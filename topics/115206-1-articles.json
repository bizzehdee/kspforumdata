It took an unreasonably long time but it worked. Two whiplashes, one Nuke, three LF fuselages (the ones for whiplashes drained to 1/4 capacity), smallish wings and a probe core instead of a pilot. It\u0027s mostly useless because it can\u0027t take any payload, but it works. It was a very, very long climb as I was gaining maybe 1-2m/s per second, and only climbing as lift gained through the extra speed (and extra centrifugal force) allowed.\n\nYou can expect maybe 400m/s dV from the nukes in the ballistic flight. There\u0027s no way in hell you could get 1200dV out of them before sinking back into the atmosphere if you start at 1200 you can get from the whiplashes.\n\nFor that I had a different approach: an intermediate engine. I built a very heavy MK3 SSTO with a Rhino for bringing it into orbit from the 25km where Whiplashes die. Again, very impractical but again it works.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T15:13:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyromancer","CreatedById":147649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:12:04Z","Content":"This is what I use to give tours, good enough for Mun flybys without refueling but not for much else\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Ct9rhhH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ct9rhhH.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:30:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E LF only space planes are hard.\n\u003E For 4 km/s dV on nukes with a starting TWR of .7 (the highest TWR where nukes are typically mass optimal) you need 3.5 t (700 units) fuel per engine (and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00E2\u20AC\u00BA tank mass) for a budget of 1.8 t payload per engine for a total mass of 8.7 t.
