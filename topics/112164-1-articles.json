If you read the history all but one of the DD tanks made it onto the beach, that was his. The flotation screen on his tank got holed by enemy fire and it sank, he barely made it out. He said he was glad that he had to swim to shore, because it washed the crap out of his pants. He picked up a rifle on the beach and fought with the infantry for a week before they got him another tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the next 10 months in Europe he lost nine tanks and eleven crew members, but was never injured once, and he was promoted all the way up to tank commander. They wanted to give him a field commission to 2nd Lt and make him a platoon commander, but he told them to go to hell because platoon commanders had a habit of dying fast in combat. (The platoon leaders\u0027 tanks had two radios, one for the platoon net and one for the company net, which meant that they also had two antennas on top. So the Germans learned to shoot the tank with two antennas first. Some guy got the idea to weld a rod to all of the tank\u0027s turrets to make them all look like they had two antennas, they told him to go to hell too.) In April of \u002745 he had been shot out of his ninth tank and was once again fighting with the infantry when he caught a mortar fragment in his calf, which was his only injury of the entire war. He was recuperating in the field hospital on VE Day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoincidentally, we\u0027re going to go visit the old man\u0027s grave today.
