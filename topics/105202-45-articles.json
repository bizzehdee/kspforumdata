I personally think it\u0027s more challenging to try not to let those kerbals die, and if necessary, I have to plan a rescue/emergency supplies delivery mission to be launched asap. Not using Revert, and having to reach the targets in time adds to the challenge.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, either way is valid, as long as we\u0027re having fun with our games. Thanks RDude for making both ways possible.\n\u003E \n\nWell to be fair, regardless of the outcome it is essentially the same challenge to not let the kerbals run out of life support.  In reality I have never lost a crew with any of the LS mods.  But at some point if the worst were to happen I still find it more challenging to have to go rescue them.  What I\u0027m meaning is if you hit that point where the crew is lost (problems occurred, no way to ship emergency supplies in time), if they were set to die then oops nothing left to do.  If they are set to revolt I can still plan a mission to rescue them.\n\nThat being said both options are there so all good.  I just disagree that setting them to death is somehow a greater challenge than the other.  They are just different."},{"CreatedByName":"Kowgan","CreatedById":116874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T22:06:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, goldenpsp said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I just disagree that setting them to death is somehow a greater challenge than the other.

This one pretty much covers the core logic and basic supply stuff.  Recyclers will be next, but necessitate some new parts - note that when that hits, your consumption rate will jump to 15 supplies per day until you slap on a recycler (good) or get to a reliable water source (better).  Habs will be last, but must coincide with MKS, Karibou, and MKS-Lite releases.  \n\nGreenhouses and recyclers will work on two different mechanics.  the recyclers reduce consumption (there is no conversion, you consume less and produce less mulch).  Greenhouses focus on converting mulch (with some fertilizer) back into supplies.  Thus the two can work together, and one could (in theory) build a very large \u0027biofilter\u0027, but it will be a lot less space efficient (i.e. the best avenue will be a combination of both systems)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T20:11:15Z","Content":"Noticed the 24 hour clock support added in the github notes...
