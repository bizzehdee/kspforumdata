It\u0027s one of the reasons that it\u0027s Public Domain - if any other maintainer thinks this would fit into they\u0027re mod, they can just paste it in (Or at least add it relatively easily).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, about the suggestions here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Toolbar - should be very easy, I just didn\u0027t think it would be too useful. Now that buttons can be hidden and there\u0027s a snippet for optional integration - sure, why not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bars, and/or just using the stock UI for resources - I\u0027d like that, but it looked at first glance that taking that out of the flight mode would be hard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be worthwhile, however, to integrate this feature into Alternate Resource View, which is basically the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Picture / VesselView - That\u0027s my wish-list \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve actually looked into VesselView\u0027s code, and I don\u0027t think it would be practical to use; The big issue is that in the tracking screen, the vessel isn\u0027t actually \u0022loaded\u0022, and vessel rendering (probably) can\u0027t be applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this mod, I\u0027m looking at the saved state of the vessels - essentially the persistence file. Loading a vessel so it can be rendered takes a long time, and has some side effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best idea I had so far was to take a snapshot of every vessel when possible, and showing that; It\u0027s not a perfect solution, but it does most of what is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, no Idea when I might get to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout Live usage from mods: I doubt it would just work without dedicated work, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA snapshot wireframe 2d view of the vessel would be perfect for a visual. There is no need for it to be rendered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm glad youre still working on this at it is certainly a useful plugin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T07:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69363-0-23-Time-Control-3-3-14-Now-allows-custom-warping-from-the-TRACKING-STATION!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETime Control\u003C/a\u003E does something screwy to the resources window when it is opened in the Tracking station.
