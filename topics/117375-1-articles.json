Any advice to help it not explode due to overheating would be great.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T08:52:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 08:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ayana**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T07:42:12Z","Content":"Hi there\n\nmake a shallower reentry (half orbit, periapsis about \u003C30km above KSC), or moa... errm more airbrakes, additional two will do the job i think...\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T07:46:23Z","Content":"Make sure your pitch maintains about 25 degrees during your high altitude descent, rcs or reaction wheels help, control surfaces don\u0027t do diddly squat at that height"},{"CreatedByName":"ayana","CreatedById":105618,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T08:07:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi there\n\u003E make a shallower reentry (half orbit, periapsis about \u003C30km above KSC), or moa... errm more airbrakes, additional two will do the job i think...\n\u003E \n\u003E Happy landings!\n\nGuess I do have to use the airbrakes, even though they feel cheaty."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T08:47:13Z","Content":"I never use more than two airbrakes, the body of your plane is the most effective airbrake it just has to be mostly against the airflow, same as the shuttle"},{"CreatedByName":"ayana","CreatedById":105618,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T08:52:16Z","Content":"It\u0027s just so counterintuitive to do that with a plane."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T08:59:33Z","Content":"![2360738075_931822b24f.jpg](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3063/2360738075_931822b24f.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T09:12:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s just so counterintuitive to do that with a plane.\n\nYou want to slow down faster, so you want to put the fattest part of the plane facing the airflow.

Drag is the force that slows you down. The beauty of a Delta wing is that it\u0027s self correcting from a stall.\n\nFunny story: early STL concepts called for subsonic wings and simply stalling at supersonic speeds.

Usually this is detrimental as far as the dV is concerned, but sometimes it allows multiple engines or mixed engines to have full access to the shared fuel/ oxidizer throughout the flight; when otherwise it doesn\u0027t always seem so."}]}
