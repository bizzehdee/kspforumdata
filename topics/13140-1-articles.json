But as i got older i appreciated video games less for their play value but for their story, and thematic parallels to real life. I\\\u0027ve always been one for the story in a video game, they can often time bring out more than a book ever could although i do like books. Now im not someone who worships video games or anything like that, but i think a lot of people miss the points brought about by video games that have greatly changed my views on the world and influenced my life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it wasn\\\u0027t for games like Mass Effect, Deus Ex, and Halo(and many others which i wont mention), my fascination for science and technology would never have grown to what it is today, i may just be some blabbering idiot who only cares about my social life(which i do have, dont worry) and little else. While many video games cater to those people, like Call of Duty for example, which i do play admittedly, i can\\\u0027t say its a video game i enjoy, nor is it an example of a video game with the things ive described above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to know what people think about video games, do you actually think it\\\u0027ll help bring about the end of society, make us all idiots, or is there a hint of wisdom and intelligence that will inspire people for generations as things such as art have done?

It\\\u0027s not like Literature, Music or Film. Game development is the most open of the four, leaving open room for argument. This gets multitudes worse when you take in the fact that some very large games come out once or twice a decade. I\\\u0027m going to use SSBU as an example. Brawl came in 2008; Melee in 2001, and U is expected in 2014. That\\\u0027s 7 years between Brawl and Melee, and 6 years between U and Brawl. You can NOT screw up with such a long production cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarlier this week, it was announced that Namco Bandai were to develop U. As is expected, anger occured.

The Twitter follower claimed that Namco Bandai is incompetent, and ultimately shouldn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t be involved in the development of the game.
