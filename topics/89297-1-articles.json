Members are awarded points based on the kinds of activities achieved (e.g escaping the aptmosphere = 1 point, killing a kerbal = -10 points), and are allowed to repeat them multiple times. Points will be persistent across quickloads, meaning any achievements or tragedies will remain on their score. At the end of the event the member with the highest score will win a prize (tbd).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to do is have this event open to both experienced and inexperienced members, as well as those that own the full game or just the demo. This may require separate tiers based on skill or game type, with points and challenges adjusted accordingly. As such I was wondering whether the community had any suggestions for short and long challenges that could be achieved in the event time, that cater to the different game versions and skill levels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas I have so far (could do with a lot more):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEscape the aptmosphere\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAchieve a circular orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReturn a Kerbal to Kerbin safely from orbot\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHave a probe leave Kerbin SOI (Full only)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEnter orbit around the Mun\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELand and have a Kerbal walk on the Mun\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESuccessfully return Kerbals to Kerbin from the Muns surface\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAchieve orbit around Minmus (Full only)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EConstruct a mutli-flight space station (Full only)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKill a Kerbal or strand them in space (0.5x for Demo since probe is not an option)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also thinking of using a google chart like this to show peoples scores live throughout the event:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.cubbyusercontent.com/pl/KSP%20Comp%20Idea.png/_5dae119f4c854266ac276f307527a23e\u0022 alt=\u0022_5dae119f4c854266ac276f307527a23e\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(In this case the kerbal deaths need to be subtracted from the positive bar length to get the final score)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-15T20:10:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2014 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ZodiusInfuser\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gravaar","CreatedById":83438,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T12:39:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to ask people how many hours of KSP they have played BEFORE putting up a score system and deduct 1 point for each 10 hours they have played (or even a 1 for 1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE.g.
