One could be directly over KSP and one offset just enough that it\\\u0027s always visible when the KSP one is blocked by the planet. However, then your Munar relays end up sending signals across 3000 km some times and 19000 at other times; better to relay across a more predictable 11000 km distance to a lower-orbit 3 satellite setup, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also go with lower-altitude comsats if you add more than three, but the calculations of just how low get more complicated fast. Lastly, you could park a single Munar one 2500 km ahead of the Mun in the same orbit and use it, if your Munar base can see that point in the sky at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
