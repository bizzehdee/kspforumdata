But there\u0027s also a LOT of 3d models out there on the net. So if you\u0027re not really a good modeler, maybe you\u0027d be better off starting with reworking existing models into the game. You\u0027ll also learn quite a bit about how things are done by observing existing models of things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally think the circular indents could be better done with normal/displacement/bump maps. Easier on resources. Keep in mind you don\u0027t have to copy something exactly, you can add your own twists to it, for example, the indents could be more easily done with the opposite of an indent, an extrude, with a bump map. OR you can actually just use an extrude bump map on the rest of the sphere, and it will give the illusion that the circular areas are indented. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo create a sphere that doesn\u0027t have any artifacts from boolean rendering, requires well over a 2000 face sphere, which is quite a lot of faces just to have 3 circular indents in an object.
