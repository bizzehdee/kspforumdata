Blinking, he sat up, patted his head and inspected his fingertips. \u0022Huh. No blood.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The punctures are tiny and heal practically instantaneously,\u0022 said Patbro with a smile. \u0022They\u0027ll open more easily the second time too, whichever Kerm you Commune with. You\u0027re a marked kerbal now, Jebediah.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good to know that tomorrow isn\u0027t going to be as itchy,\u0022 Jeb cocked his head to one side. \u0022How specific are the punctures though? Will other Kerm know that I\u0027ve Communed with Elton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t follow you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb scratched his head. \u0022You said I\u0027m a marked Kerb - are these Elton\u0027s marks? Does he leave behind - oh I don\u0027t know - a personal scent or something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro pinched the bridge of his nose. \u0022You know, I have no idea. I haven\u0027t noticed anything different with my Kerm after speaking to Elton but another sapient Kerm... hmmm. That\u0027s an excellent question.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Either way, you don\u0027t seem too worried about being a marked kerb,\u0022 Geneney observed. \u0022Which is probably more than Elton could say right now. What on Kerbin did you do to him?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb swung his feet off the bed. \u0022What do you mean? I didn\u0027t do anything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney pointed at the leaves scattered over the sleep room floor. \u0022It didn\u0027t look that way from where we were sitting. Whatever you did it made his branches fairly stand on end - I reckon we\u0027re lucky to still have a ceiling.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve never seen a Kerm react like that,\u0022 said Patbro. He shivered, remembering all the leaf clusters \u00A0around them closing in waves. \u0022Although Elton is far more expressive than a normal... than most Kerm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s face cleared. \u0022Oh... that would have been when I showed him the view from Kerbal 1. He was very... very\u2026\u201D \u00A0Jeb threw up his hands. \u0022He was all sorts of things all rolled together. I don\u0027t know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thunderstruck?\u0022 suggested Geneney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That was part of it. It all made perfect sense in Communion.\u0022 A look of awe crossed Jeb\u0027s face. \u0022It \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E made sense in Communion, Genie. Didn\u0027t matter if we got the words wrong because we knew what they meant anyway. I did most of the sharing but Elton\u2026shared a couple of things with me too. Some faces from the past. They felt a bit blurry, a bit faded - I guess that\u0027s because Elton never Communed with them personally but his kerbals knew them so I got their memories second hand.\u0022 Jeb frowned. \u0022I didn\u0027t follow the part about his kerbals to be honest - I\u0027ll need to ask him about that tomorrow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro nodded vigorously. \u0022You really should. You should be there too, Geneney!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney looked at Jeb\u0027s flushed face. \u0022As long as that\u0027s all right with Elton,\u0022 he said. \u0022I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen Jeb this excited since... well since Kerbal 1.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb awoke to the nutty, grainy smell of hot natas mingling with the smell of fresh greenery and cinnamon all around him. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and sat up, peering at the rows of bunk beds on the far wall. A breeze from the half open window chivvied a drift of glossy green leaves across the floor and Jeb\u0027s face lit up in anticipation. He rolled out of bed, grabbed the poncho Patbro had left on the bedstead, pulled it over his shoulders on his way out of the sleep room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Morning Elton!\u0022 Jeb pushed open the door and sauntered into the kitchen. \u0022Morning Genie, morning Patbro!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney looked up from his chopping board. \u0022Morning, Jeb. You slept well then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Took me a while to drop off but after that? Like a kerblet in its pouch.\u0022 He turned to a rather bemused looking Patbro. \u0022I\u0027ll get a brew on - where are the supplies?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um - the pot\u0027s on the stove,\u0022 said Patbro. \u0022Filters and coffee are in the corner cupboard down there.\u0022 He pushed his chair back. \u0022But, please. Let me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney put his knife down. \u0022Don\u0027t worry about it. Do him good to be on the breakfast shift again.\u0022 He grinned at Patbro\u0027s expression. \u201CThe boss brewing the morning coffee used to be a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u00A0\u003C/abbr\u003Etradition until Derny - now our chef - turned up to volunteer his services. He\u0027s more creative than Jeb and better still, none of his brews have been mistaken for leftover window sealant.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb aimed a rude gesture at him from over his shoulder before emerging from the cupboard with a jar of ground coffee, filters and an elderly tin of anise flakes. Levering the top off the tin, he rubbed a pinch between his fingers and sniffed. \u201CBit old but they\u2019ll do nicely.\u201D Ignoring Patbro\u0027s and Geneney\u0027s revolted expressions, he dumped a spoonful into his coffee cup, thought for a moment then added a second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney ladled the natas into three bowls and added a generous portion of chopped pickles to each. The coffee pot burbled and slurped its way to a standstill and presently the anise laced aroma of hot coffee was adding to the distinctive smells of a traditional Kolan breakfast. Everyone dug in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro pushed his bowl away with a satisfied grunt and reached for his mug. \u0022So - is there a plan for today?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb swallowed a mouthful of coffee. \u0022Communing with Elton mainly,\u0022 he said. \u0022We\u0027ve still got a lot of space stuff to talk through.\u0022 His eyes lost their focus for a moment \u0022And hopefully we\u0027ll have time to hear some of his story too.\u0022 He looked at Patbro. \u0022From all the bunks around here I\u0027m guessing that Elton won\u0027t have any problems talking to Genie and me together? \u00A0I\u0027ll ask him first of course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro shook his head. \u0022No problem at all,\u0022 he said.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re welcome to join us,\u0022 said Geneney. \u0022If you don\u0027t mind listening to a pair of engineers getting technical?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That sounds\u2026 interesting actually,\u0022 said Patbro. \u0022Like I said to Elton, I\u0027ve seen three launches and I watched...\u0022 His voice tailed away and he stared at Jeb as if seeing him properly for the first time. \u0022I watched yourself and Jondun walking on the M\u00FCn, sir.\u0022 He blinked. \u0022I don\u0027t suppose... don\u0027t suppose you showed Elton your M\u00FCnwalk?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No need to \u0027sir\u0027 me,\u0022 said Jeb. \u0022But no - we didn\u0027t have time for that last night. Wonder how it works with all of us Communing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro tried to bury his excitement. \u0022If group Communion with Elton is anything like talking to Jonton back in the day - why it should be the next best thing to being there!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney raised his eyebrows, his voice deceptively calm. \u0022Now that does sound interesting,\u201D he said. \u0022Always did wonder what it was like. You can give us the guided tour, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Be happy to, Genie. Breakfast dishes first though, I think.\u0022 He turned to Patbro. \u0022If you think my coffee\u2019s bad, you don\u0027t want to let Genie\u0027s cooking congeal in the pan. Not unless you enjoy washing up with a hammer and chisel.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro just shook his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo sooner were the breakfast dishes dried and put away than all three kerbals hurried through to the sleep room. Jeb clambered onto his bunk from the previous night, slipped a pillow under his neck and without further thought, lifted his head into the waiting leaf cluster and waited for the white light to engulf him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;good morning, Jeb\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGood morning, Elton.

I cannot read anything that you don\u0027t want to share. You were worried about asking me for something though and I could see two other kerbals at the front of your mind. It wasn\u0027t difficult to guess your thoughts\u0026gt;\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOhh-kay. Going to take me a while to get used to this.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;you will. For now - yes. Patbro and your friend are welcome to join us. I should know your friend\u0027s name first though\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGeneney, or Genie for short. Uh, if you could let go of my head, I\u0027ll let them know.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;certainly, Jeb\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd with that, Elton\u2019s leaves lifted away from his scalp. Jeb sat up and rubbed his head. \u201CDefinitely didn\u2019t pull as much this time. And Elton says you\u2019re both welcome to join us.\u201D He watched Geneney \u00A0and Patbro find their own bunks, Patbro propping himself up and slipping his head into the leaf cluster with practiced ease. Geneney took longer to settle but eventually Elton\u2019s leaves closed around his head too. Jeb flashed him a quick thumbs-up before leaning back onto his own pillow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe light swirled away in tattered ribbons, buffeted by the mental currents sloshing back and forth \u00A0Jeb felt a moment of panic as he felt his own link constrict but then Elton\u2019s voice filled his head. \u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;This is my doing, Jeb. Do not fear\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe link expanded, releasing him into relative calm. With growing wonder, Jeb sensed two more presences floating just out of reach as if seen from the corner of his eye. One of the presences spoke, Geneney\u2019s words materialising fully formed in his mind.

To his delighted surprise, he found the details much easier to follow than he\u2019d expected; Jeb\u2019s easy-going delivery highlighted by real-life images of partially assembled rocket engines and spacecraft as seen through his own, and occasionally Geneney\u2019s eyes. Even when the conversation turned to intricacies of mission planning and orbital mechanics, Patbro and Elton \u003Cem\u003Efelt\u003C/em\u003E the patchwork of mental images and rules-of-thumb behind both Jeb and Geneney\u2019s understanding, tapping directly into their years of hard-won experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;but what of your flight controllers, Geneney?

He took a tentative step back, watched his gloved hands let go of the ladder, then turned and walked out into a landscape of fierce greys and jagged beauty, unlike anything remembered from all his many kerbals. Great boulders threw needle sharp shadows across the ground and the curved horizon seemed almost close enough to touch. He turned, frustration leaping inside as an ugly, misshapen flying machine replaced his view of the M\u00FCn, and tipped his head back to watch a pair of chunky grey boots emerge from an open hatch, followed by a pair of bulky white legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[Bend a bit more, Jond.

Fascinated, he watched the dust particles shooting over the surface, before turning his attention to a thin metal tube secured to one of the ladder rails. He fumbled it free, his pressurised gloves making it a struggle to operate the clips holding it in place, and loped over to join Jondun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe suit fans whirred in Geneney\u2019s ear, the cool, slightly rubbery tasting oxygen drying out the back of his throat. Resisting the temptation to sneak another peek at the view, he depressed a catch on the side of the flag tube and pulled it\u2019s two halves apart. He handed the upper pole and cross bar assembly to Jondun, just as he\u2019d seen Jeb do half-a-dozen times in training, and with a grunt drove the lower pole into the regolith as far as he could. He pressed a button on its side and four supporting legs snapped out flat, raising puffs of dust from the Munar surface.

Ruddy orange light rayed out around him, staining the mindscape around him in shades of russet and ochre. Rocks appeared under a dusty cerise sky, dotting a landscape that seemed to go on forever. Elton\u2019s dismay struck like a hurricane, scouring up towering clouds of tan dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the dust clouds froze.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElton\u2019s will struck the three kerbals like a hammer blow, striking unerringly at their most long-buried, primeval cores. Jeb, Geneney and Patbro snapped to attention. The desert would be tamed. There was no, could be no, doubt of this, for had not their Kerm decreed it? And this was proper, for they were\u2026 not kerbal but something greater. To be kerm-bal was to be apart from the Kerm and in the deepest, darkest depths of their souls, this was inconceivable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Dunan vista shattered, replaced by swirling grey light and a sense of shame so deeply felt as to be almost tangible. \u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;I\u2026 I overreach myself, good kerbals\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E The light dimmed, flecks of black char appearing around its edges \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;and I crave your forgiveness\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElton\u2019s voice shook. \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;I would still offer my help if you would have it, my friends.

Jeb picked up a Kerm leaf from the floor, twisting it between his fingers. Patbro poured himself a mug of water from Jonton\u2019s pedestal before propping himself up against Elton\u2019s trunk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CChange of plan.\u201D Geneney walked in frowning. \u201CYou up for a trip out to Alpha?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot after that Communion I\u2019m not.

Get a few hours down the road before turning in.\u201D His gaze drifted over to Elton\u2019s trunk and he dragged his attention back to Patbro with an effort. \u201CPlease pass on our regards to Elton and thank him for his time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro nodded. \u201CI\u2019ll let him know you were called away\u201D he said. \u201CAnd for myself - thank you both for the Communion.

Jeb raised his eyebrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust thinking about the first time we came here. Brand new research posters up everywhere, everyone piling out of the labs to see us, that poor technician practically falling at your feet.\u201D Geneney gestured at the board. \u201CI remember some of those posters from the last management committee meeting and they weren\u2019t looking that fresh then.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe conference room door stood ajar at the end of the corridor.

Blithering idiots owe me a new driver side door.\u201D Geneney stalked over to the drinks table and helped himself to a coffee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan strode into the room. \u201CAh, Geneney, Jebediah. Did you manage to speak to Elton?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe both did,\u201D said Jeb. \u201CGeneney and I were hoping to speak to you about that, Director.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan gave him a sidelong look, stiffening in surprise at the earnest look on the other\u2019s face. \u201CCertainly,\u201D he said. \u201CI see\u2026he\u2026made quite an impression.\u201D He saw Ademone\u2019s raised eyebrow and made a snap decision. \u201CYou can brief us all as the first item on the agenda. Shall we make a start, good kerbals?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb waited until everyone was seated, took a sip of water and began. He described his first Communion, watching Ademone\u2019s expression gradually shift from skepticism to a cautious wonder. Nelton shot him a look of fierce approval as he outlined his, Geneney\u2019s and Patbro\u2019s discussions with Elton, carefully skirting around his final promise to them. Geneney gave him a tiny nod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, as he sketched out Elton\u2019s history lesson, three very sober pairs of eyes stared at him across the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026I mean it was the Kerm crisis he was describing. Which I knew about. But it turns out there\u2019s nothing quite like seeing the problem for yourself to really hammer the scale of it home. Mind you, I think Elton felt the same way about Starseed. Communing with him was an eye-opening experience all round.\u201D Jeb looked directly at Lodan. \u201CWe can\u2019t afford to stop the crewed program, Director. Gene and I were talking it over on the way here and we both agreed what the next steps are with the hardware but couldn\u2019t see any way to build or launch it.\u201D He gripped the edge of the table, knuckles turning white. \u201CWe need a plan, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan heard Ademone\u2019s sharp intake of breath. \u201CWhich is precisely what we\u2019re here to discuss,\u201D he said quietly. \u201CThank you, Jeb.\u201D He took a deep breath. \u201CYou will remember a certain meeting in my office. We discussed the Kerm crisis and the Council\u2019s plans to address it. You and I disagreed significantly on a number of points.\u201D Lodan turned to Ademone. \u201CAnd I had a proposal for Rockomax which, as I recall, you thought was rather heavy-handed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFaint creases appeared in the middle of Ademone\u2019s forehead.

I\u0027m also hoping that a real modder can figure out a way of changing the tech tree screen around a bit to make the descriptions look a bit more elegant.
