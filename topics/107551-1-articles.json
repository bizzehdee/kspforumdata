I have created a video demonstration of this effect.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMq2_Btq6SU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAs you an see, the fairing will only be on the original part, not the duplicates created by symmetry. I show the workaround in the video (which is also found in this post: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43086-Open-Source-Construction-Techniques-for-Craft-Aesthetics?p=1880822\u0026viewfull=1#post1880822](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43086-Open-Source-Construction-Techniques-for-Craft-Aesthetics?p=1880822\u0026viewfull=1#post1880822)), which is that you have to create a subassembly of the fairing-covered part, and place each additional part one-by-one.\n\n**Re-creation steps:** \n\nCreate a core stage out of fuel tanks. Radially attach fuel tanks to the core. Add a fairing of any size and shape to the radially attached part. Take the radially attached part and activate symmetry, then place the part back on the core.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T00:38:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 12:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GusTurbo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T03:56:37Z","Content":"Hmm yes.
