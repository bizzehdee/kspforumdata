Already we can repair damaged struts and wheels, and there are plans to toss in telescopes (trickling science, maybe?). Having your Jool destined probe sustain random damage to the solar panel requiring a rendezvous and repair mission to save your expensive probe and get the contract completed without losing reputation would be just one idea, or a heat shield that gets damaged on launch (now the reason the shuttle does a 180 to get inspected by the ISS) that needs emergency repair or rescue to save the crew. Obviously we don\u0027t want this to happen on a regular basis, but the chances that it might happen would be a great reason for a ready-launch-shuttle docked at the now useful Kerbin orbit space station. Damage on launch is a common effect, but most often its due to mistakes on the ground. This could be a reason for the engineering point system, starting with a hidden penalty that increases the chance a science instrument or engine will become damaged and either fail or be less efficient, and reducing that penalty with engineering point investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts could issue entire campaigns. For example, the Titan program: the Kerbal government issues a challenge to send a series of explorative missions to Jool, and (most notably) Laythe (as it would look so enticing from a telescope). Back at KSC you have a tab that allows the management of these programs. A flashcard-type system that allows you to designate missions in progress as protagonists for the campaign goal (IE, select a craft bound for Jool and drag it to a campaign goal, and title that mission Titan I, allowing it to complete the goal, and for you to easily manage multiple contracts at once). While we\u0027re at it, the Astronaut complex can have the added feature of being able to commit some of these program missions to a museum, complete with a customizable description, snapshot of the craft (or a stage that you designate) or even an in-game \u0027model\u0027, the participants (if manned), and the dates of the program, and the name of the mission designator and program (mini campaign) it was in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReputation modifiers based on the kerbonaut (which changes depending on his success rate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight simulator mode allowing you to test your craft in simulated conditions at a fraction of the cost of the vessel and no reputation (or kerbonaut) loss\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepth to the Kerbals! Divide the kerbs into pilots and mission specialists. Allow the specialist to gain boosts in science gains, and the ability to begin a timed (over say, a month) experiment in the laboratory or station. These guys would be more efficient when it came to data analysis and surface sampling as well. Pilots should be the only ones that can fly, or just make the nav-ball indicators and course trajectories disappear for non pilots. An engineer class (or just a different mission specialist stat) would be more efficient at repair work, or would be the only one able to conduct repairs. This actually gives you a reason to take more than one kerbal to space (sorry, Jeb). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVIP contracts: take x-scientist to do y-study at z-planet; take rich dude to planet-x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESustainment modules. Kerbals need water and food. I think I\u0027m probably the 1 millionth person to say, but introducing a food and water resource stat(s) to the equation would go \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea long way in immersion and realism factor - no more going interplanetary the second you get staging. Small flights (in system) should be sustainable with the resources in a command pod (measured in consumption per 24 hours), but longer flights would need more resources per kerbal. And since you now need a pilot, a scientist, and an engineer, you would need exponentially more resources, and therefore more planning, and therefore more immersion. Right now we get great rewards for going interplanetary, we should get increased risks with that as well. This would also make space stations and bases require logistical support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile we\u0027re at it, an insanity stat! Not sure what courage and stupidity stats do for us, but sanity would be a new ball game. Short flights would be no big deal, but leaving Bob working long months orbiting Minmus with nothing to do might make things... break more often... or suddenly find the station hurdling towards the surface... hehehe. But seriously, there is no downside to not rotating kerbals out of a far away posting.

Damage on launch is a common effect, but most often its due to mistakes on the ground. This could be a reason for the engineering point system, starting with a hidden penalty that increases the chance a science instrument or engine will become damaged and either fail or be less efficient, and reducing that penalty with engineering point investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD have said they don\u0027t want random damage, or random damaging events, so this is probably a no go. Imagine, you had a rocket, which functioned perfectly the first 10 times you launched it, but on the 11th launch an engine fails to ignite, or you reach orbit and a little pop up says something along the lines of: \u0022Part-X has been damaged to Y extent, New part-Z needed or On site orbital repairs.\u0022 How annoyed might you feel at that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts could issue entire campaigns.

Back at KSC you have a tab that allows the management of these programs. A flashcard-type system that allows you to designate missions in progress as protagonists for the campaign goal (IE, select a craft bound for Jool and drag it to a campaign goal, and title that mission Titan I, allowing it to complete the goal, and for you to easily manage multiple contracts at once). While we\u0027re at it, the Astronaut complex can have the added feature of being able to commit some of these program missions to a museum, complete with a customizable description, snapshot of the craft (or a stage that you designate) or even an in-game \u0027model\u0027, the participants (if manned), and the dates of the program, and the name of the mission designator and program (mini campaign) it was in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.

Divide the kerbs into pilots and mission specialists. Allow the specialist to gain boosts in science gains, and the ability to begin a timed (over say, a month) experiment in the laboratory or station. These guys would be more efficient when it came to data analysis and surface sampling as well. Pilots should be the only ones that can fly, or just make the nav-ball indicators and course trajectories disappear for non pilots. An engineer class (or just a different mission specialist stat) would be more efficient at repair work, or would be the only one able to conduct repairs.

Kerbals need water and food. I think I\u0027m probably the 1 millionth person to say, but introducing a food and water resource stat(s) to the equation would go a long way in immersion and realism factor - no more going interplanetary the second you get staging. Small flights (in system) should be sustainable with the resources in a command pod (measured in consumption per 24 hours), but longer flights would need more resources per kerbal. And since you now need a pilot, a scientist, and an engineer, you would need exponentially more resources, and therefore more planning, and therefore more immersion. Right now we get great rewards for going interplanetary, we should get increased risks with that as well.

In my game, I assume that any ships or stations that are permanently in orbit are constantly re-supplied by ATVs, and I am there to run the big stuff, like the mun missions and missions to other worlds and moons. I feel that the player would feel more of a detriment to the gameplay if Life support systems were introduced to stock. I for one, would create a mod to remove LS (Unless it is done in a good way, but for the way I like the game, I don\u0027t think that would work.) if that happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile we\u0027re at it, an insanity stat!
