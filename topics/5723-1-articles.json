Here are my thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.brobible.com/brommunity/story/let\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.brobible.com/brommunity/story/let\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst of all, I will like to apologize if my grammar and spelling won\\\u0027t be in line; English is not my first language, and I mainly learn it by my self...\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\\\u0027s start with topic (if you don\\\u0027t mind, i will copy-paste couple of comments I have made on FB);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was quite pissed of by all this SOPA stuff going on last couple days, so it made me think a bit what was origin of that. Way are they even considering something like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnauthorized use of digital footage and piracy...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFirst \u0027unauthorized digital use of footage\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, they have a problem with someone using part of song/movie/tvshow to produce their own clip or song... In general they want to prosecute you if you make a remix of some copyrighted song. But they don\\\u0027t understand one fact, and that is that this use of \u0027unauthorized digital footage\u0027 is ACTUALLY PROMOTING THAT DIGITAL FOOTAGE!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many times have you heard about some artist just by fist hearing remix of his original song?? How many times have you start to watch some TV show just because you have seen some fan made video on YT?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have one personal example; I have made personal video for my wife couple years ago, using song from Josh Groban... It was actually couple photos of my wife and her friends, made as video gallery with background music from that artist. And Josh was more or less unknown in Croatia (where I live), and most of my friends and relatives, got first contact with Josh\\\u0027s music by my video. Some of them liked it so much, that they purchase albums from that artist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouple months lager, I got personal message on Youtube, that on my video audio track has been disabled due to copyright clams. So, basically, they destroyed my video (it wasn\\\u0027t much, but it was made in sinc with audio track) that actually helped in promotion of that music and author, and they had direct financial gain from that video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn other hand, I didn\\\u0027t have any financial gain from that video, eider did I clam that I\\\u0027m author of that music (I have even put in description name of original author and link to his personal webpage), but they still felt like that video is making them lose money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENow, let\\\u0027s talk a bit about piracy.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s first take example of video games:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can often hear how piracy has killed PC gaming, and most of developers are turning to consoles as their main platform. In general, that\\\u0027s true. But why is that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t think that I have ever heard that some indie game was pirated. Reason why? Realistic price. You get regularly more \u0027bang for money\u0027 from indie game, then from some AAA title. Usually AAA titles get you max of 10h of gameplay for price of 50$ or more, while indie games give you less game play, but way lower price, and when you put all together, it turns out that you get more gameplay per dollar with indie games then with AAA titles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s take one example; Modern Warfare 3; approximated length of single-player campaign is around 8h, and price tag is 60\u00E2\u201A\u00AC or 77$ (source: Steam). That\\\u0027s 7.5\u00E2\u201A\u00AC (9.6$) per hour of game play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESerious Sam 3, indie game by Croatian developers Croteam, is 28\u00E2\u201A\u00AC (35$; that\\\u0027s one of more expensive indie games; source also Steam). To finish singleplayer campaign, it took me also around 8h. That\\\u0027s 4.75\u00E2\u201A\u00AC (6$) per hour. And personally I had more fun playing SS3 then MW3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\\\u0027s compare that \u0027\u00E2\u201A\u00AC/hour of fun\u0027 in games with same thing in movies. Average ticket price for movie is 4,7\u00E2\u201A\u00AC (6$). If we take average of 1.5h per movie, then we get 3,15\u00E2\u201A\u00AC (4$)/hour of fun. That\\\u0027s more then double \u0027fun\u0027 then you get from Modern warfare 3. So for price of Modern warfare 3, you could get 19h of movie watching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- note; I haven\\\u0027t intentionally taken in consideration multiplayer, because they are selling this games as single player with addition of multiplayer, but in reality is other way around. But they can\\\u0027t admit that, because 60\u00E2\u201A\u00AC for multiplayer game is way to much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, they keep crying how people download pirated games, but they don\\\u0027t think that reason for that is to high price, that most of gamers worldwide can\\\u0027t afford. How can you expect that someone here in Croatia, who has 500$ monthly income, gives 10-15% of that for a game?? And there are many other examples beside Croatia (for example China and Russia, as countries with most of pirated materials).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what will happened if they cut price of top titles in half? They will earn same amount or even more money then before price cut! Reason; more people will be able to afford that game, and I can bet that most of people will actually like to have original game (i remember how happy I was when I got my first original game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have mentioned movies... They are apparently also affected by piracy, and piracy is their main excuse for justifying lower incomes of movie industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I personally go to see some film in theater 2-3 times a month... And I have never come to movie theater that wasn\\\u0027t crowded! Last time I waited for 20min just to get tickets! And there was more then 10 boots opened! And just for relatively mediocre Sherlock Holmes 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, let\\\u0027s take a look at Annual Ticket Sales (for US, but it will be good for this example): 2011 was one of worst years for movie industry when it comes to income (source: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.the-numbers.com/market/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.the-numbers.com/market/\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut why is that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason nbr.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETicket price:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom 2000. to 2010, ticket price has raised approximately 50% (source: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.natoonline.org/statisticstickets.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.natoonline.org/statisticstickets.htm\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, they have raised price of ticket, but still made less money... Apparently, that had some negative effect on number of people in theaters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason nbr.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuality of movies:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn IMDB top 50 movies from 2000-2009, there is 20 movies made after 2005 (low point in movie revenue).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom those 20, just 2 made after 2005. are in top 10 of pass decade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn over all list of best movies ever, in top 100, there is just 9 movies made past 2005.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on list of WORST movies ever made, in bottom 100, there is 26 movies made past 2005.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey raised price of tickets, made less good movies, and more then ever bad movies, and they wonder why they earned less money?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, it\\\u0027s easy to blame it all on piracy, and try to push some laws that will apparently reduce \u0027damage from piracy\u0027, but in realty, those laws will just made problem even worse, and problems that ware reason to push those laws will not get solved, because they are dealing with nus-product of problem (piracy) and not source of problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that someone will find this interesting and will make him think about real problems that in mine opinion are main reason for large amount of pirated content on internet, and that if nothing else, will give him something to read on toilet...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I apologize one more time for my English, and I hope that it was good enough to get point of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caesar15","CreatedById":11257,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-18T15:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at wikipedia\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scruce","CreatedById":9059,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-18T15:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am opposed to both SOPA and Wikipedia\\\u0027s takedown.
