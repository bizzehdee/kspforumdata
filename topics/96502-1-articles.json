My schedule at home made it inconvenient to catch this weeks and by the sounds of it, 0.91 will be a pretty small update, but the atmo change in the future sounds very divisive. In brighter news, less Science grind and pulling 64bit both sound incredibly promising. Also, yeah, the current wings may work fine on the Mk3 parts, but they just look so out of place and bump up the part count unnecessarily (please consider pWings, Squad..).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T12:20:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FlowerChild\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERegardless, I\u0027m pretty sure \u0022intuitive\u0022 is what was meant there and I\u0027m just over thinking the whole thing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just listened through the video.
