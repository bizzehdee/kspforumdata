Intakes, like everything else except wings, use cube drag now, so changing part.maximum_drag (as the intake drag does) does absolutely nothing to the drag the part actually crates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo closing intakes does nothing other than shutting the resource intake off. It doesn\u0027t change drag at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConvective heating is related to drag only so far as it\u0027s related to velocity; the quicker you slow down, the lower your total heat load. This means that if you can find a way to slow down faster \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E increasing your convective surface area, you\u0027ll get less heat. Compare a pod (entering rear first) and a Mk1 cockpit (entering nose-first). Both have the same \u003Cem\u003Ecross-sectional\u003C/em\u003E area, but the cockpit stays faster longer (and even has more surface area) and thus will take on way, way more heat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what I do, is shut down intakes that I consider \u0027belonging\u0027 to an engine together with the engine. To prevent air-hogging; for example if I have a spaceplane with both turbojets and RAPIERS, when shutting down the turbojets the RAPIERS don\u0027t have access to the turbojets air-intakes. As in reality you also can\u0027t really suddenly reroute air from one engine to another. (I know it gives less performance in the end but it seems only fair).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
