Their myths tell them that they were cast down from Paradise, to Kharak, as a punishment by their god. When they reach roughly 20th/21st century tech levels, biology tells them that they aren\u0027t related to most of the life on the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they advance to spaceflight, they find a debris field in orbit, and recovery of fragments shows the debris is an extremely advanced manufactured composite material... analysis of it causes huge leaps in materials technology. They don\u0027t find any larger debris or intact technology in orbit, but one of their satellites detects a massive object buried in the largely unexplored equatorial desert (where temperatures may exceed the boiling point of water in the summer months)... an ancient starship buried in the sand, with an intact fusion reactor, attached hyperspace module, and a stone with engravings showing the location of their true home. They reverse engineer the technology of the ancient starship, and set out to find their true home. \u0022Hi-jinks ensue\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSooooo...... could we make a mod that sort of recapitulates this idea in KSP? Obviously we skip the hyperdrive part. Move \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to another less desirable world, and give the player a goal of discovering ancient tech and reaching Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ve already got well known mods that \u0022move\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E from Kerbin to a \u0022less desirable\u0022 location (Duna, Laythe, Eve), Duna fits the bill for a desert planet that could in theory be barely habitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130318-111316-new-update-alien-space-programs-take-ksc-and-push-it-somewhere-else-duna-laythe-or-eve/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve taken what that mod does, and applied it to my \u0022more habitable, Mars with oceans\u0022 planet...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027d want to do more, to add the following elements:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* players need to find derelict spacecraft on the world to advance the tech tree\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* a set of contracts/worlds first records with big rewards for reaching Kerbin with probes/ returning science data/ getting kerbals there\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... my plan is\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* turn down the science multipliers so that the player basically cannot get science from the surface/upper atmosphere of the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Mofidy the tech tree - only allow enough science to be unlocked from reaching and high orbit to get a probe core that can detect anomalies (no liquid fuel engines yet)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Add an easter-egg/anomoly that unlocks multiple liquid fuel engines and tanks, similar how certain monoliths now unlock tech. I was thinking either the \u0022flying saucer\u0022 easter eggs, or a collection of rocket parts, like what you find in the hangar at the island airfield. Also I\u0027d like there to be a preplaced flag with the \u0022Kerbin Mun\u0022 image.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Starting tech would be Junos(the planet would have O2 in the atmosphere), mk1 cockpit, Flea SRBs, basic wings/landing gear/control surfaces/mk16 parachute, ... maybe the 1.25m inline decoupler\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* reaching orbit should unlock enough science to get a probe core capable of detecting anomolies, a comm 16 antenna, and solar panels\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* it would be extremely impractical to advance further along the tech tree with the available technology *without* locating the derelict rocket parts - its no Hyperdrive, but liquid fuel engines would allow for missions to Kerbin and lots and lots of science and funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... how do I mod contracts? How do I place easter eggs on a planet? How do I have them unlock techs? How do I mod the tech tree? Is anyone interested in such a mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, all I\u0027ve got is a decent starting world\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QD7heeJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QD7heeJ.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
