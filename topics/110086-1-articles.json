Jump to other ship who need attention, do that operation, game crashes. \n\nRestarts and flag for build new outpost is not lit anymore, in short outpost can not be used for the Mun or Minmus contract even if all parts was launched after the contract was given.\n\nHad two failed attempts on this, mun base failed as it docked with an old station in Mun orbit to transfer personnel and fuel. I then assumed it was the docking with old station who killed the build new flag, minmus base failed as I used kas to transfer monoproplant it needed for contract completion. \n\nEither the kas connection killed it or that fuel was transfer after landing. \n\nIn short does anybody know the rules if it is any, I assume if you launch the base as one single launch and just stage your way to target it would work or it would hardly pass testing. \n\nLooks like being docked to anything in any other launch even later and restart game or perhaps even switch to other ship or KSC kills the flag."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:23:07Z","Content":"Update, think this is an KIS problem.

Don\u0027t really have a fix other than going into the debug menu and just marking the contract as complete. I don\u0027t really consider it cheating since technically I fulfilled the contract the game just didn\u0027t want to acknowledge it.
