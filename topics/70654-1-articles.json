I am by no means an expert, but there\u0027s no info on how to set these up except for that one unity screenshot of the stock leg and there\u0027s a few things you need to do that you can\u0027t really tell from it. I just figured it out by combining info from that picture and the rover wheel picture, and a lot of guessing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103148235/legtut/ingame.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ingame.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets get started. First model and animate your leg.

This will be used by KSP to orient the foot to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103148235/legtut/blenderfoot.png\u0022 alt=\u0022blenderfoot.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re modelling in Blender, you can set it to use metric units, which will make it follow the same units of measurement as KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExport it as a .fbx file; make sure to check \u0027include animation\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImport it to Unity.

I named the moving part \u0022piston\u0022, and it\u0027s collider object \u0022pistonCollider\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--If you did the animations in your 3D program, don\u0027t rename prefab objects in Unity or you will break the prefab animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlace the collider as a child of the moving piston object and set it\u0027s transform position to 0, 0, 0. This will place it at the origin of the piston object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd a collider component (I used a capsule collider). Adjust the dimensions and center of the collider component, not the object\u0027s transform. This will be the collider that collides with the ground. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe foot itself will not have a collider.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the setup here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103148235/legtut/addlayer.png\u0022 alt=\u0022addlayer.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, lets add a couple layers.

Thanks, Tiberion).\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, create a game object and name it \u0022wheelCollider\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlace this in the same level of the heirarchy as the piston. (Not as a child of the piston.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESet its layer to \u0022WheelColliders\u0022.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103148235/legtut/wheelcollider.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wheelcollider.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet its transform position as the \u003Cstrong\u003Eexact same position\u003C/strong\u003E as the piston object. This is important! (Copy and paste the position values from the piston object to the wheel collider object)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, as you can see above, set it\u0027s center (not gameobject position) and rotation so that its at the top of the piston, and the green line coming from the center of the wheel (not the green axis, the green line) is pointing along the piston to where the foot is. (see above.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImportant: Set it\u0027s suspension distance long enough that it protrudes through where the bottom of the piston collider is. If its not long enough, then only the piston collider will touch the ground and you will have a rigid leg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso visible in the above picture is the module config. As you can see, I made it so the spring and damper values are the same between the config and unity; I don\u0027t know if it matters, but I did that just to be safe. You should adjust these to your liking as you test the part in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe config is pretty self explanatory except theres one error in that picture: set \u0022alignFootUp = true\u0022, not false.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EsuspensionUpperLimit is the distance you want the suspension to travel. I set mine to half the distance as the suspension limit of the wheel collider, so it will only move half the distance at max compression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the overall setup. Make sure to uncheck Play Automatically on the animation component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103148235/legtut/finalsetup.png\u0022 alt=\u0022finalsetup.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, I\u0027m bad at explaining things, but you can look at all my files here: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103148235/legtut/legTut.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EDownload Part, Blender, Unity files\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any questions, please ask and I\u0027ll try to answer and edit this post to clarify the confusing bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportant extra tip\u003C/strong\u003E: If you want your leg\u0027s piston to extend (telescopically) during its deploy animation, only animate an empty parent object of the piston mesh.
