Metal items won\u0027t generally scratch; I just tried my knife against my phone (on a part outside the visible screen) and it had no effect. Sand and grit, however, are full of quartz which is a hard mineral and that can scratch the glass. Be careful at the beach!\n\nAs for cracks, well while it\u0027s tougher than normal glass it\u0027s still brittle compared to many other materials. Combine that with the thinness of the glass used in phones and if hit hard enough the glass will break.\n\nAnd remember not all phones use the same stuff. Some use glass from another maker, others might even use altogether cheaper and less durable materials."},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T06:01:54Z","Content":"being scratch resistant is completely different from being scratch proof (which is as far as i know impossible). abuse the device enough and it will scratch."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T06:23:06Z","Content":"Kind of wish we have a self-healing material that will repair itself from minor scratches."},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T11:45:58Z","Content":"Spider silk is stronger than steel, but it\u0027s still easy to break because of how thin it is.\n\nSame difference really"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T12:37:14Z","Content":"Talking about that, they found a new biomaterial stronger than spider silk from a type of sea snails called limpets. \n\n[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/limpet-teeth-are-strongest-natural-material-known-1.2965059](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/limpet-teeth-are-strongest-natural-material-known-1.2965059)\n\nAnd it is not their shells, but their teeth."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T14:17:26Z","Content":"I\u0027ve got a phone with Corning\u0027s Gorilla glass and after more than a year there still aren\u0027t any scratches.
