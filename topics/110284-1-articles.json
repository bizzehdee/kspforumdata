Early prospecting missions help introduce the concept and let you do geology studies. Later ones focus upon finding a good spot for a base. And in the spirit of the 49ers, Football! Er, a valuable, finite resource with an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/08hdJyj.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eappropriately vague name\u003C/a\u003E that will give you a windfall...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really glad you like it! I had a blast writing it, and it feels great to know the person who inspired it got a kick out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI absolutely love the idea of a mega-valuable resource; when I finally unlocked the stock mining gear and ran the numbers I was supremely disappointed that I couldn\u0027t turn any meaningful profit from off-Kerbin mining. Sometimes you just want to ignore the contracts and remain financially solvent, you know? For balance reasons I understand \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E Squad implemented it the way they did (if you can mine and refine for beaucoup bucks right next to the launchpad, contract money is meaningless), but still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022And I am quoting Gene here, \u0027Kestrel underwent RUD, Daphtris unhurt but requests ASAP support team\u0027 which by the way \u003Cem\u003Esuuuuper\u003C/em\u003E messed up I hear it from CAPCOM and not, you know, from you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Yeah Izzy I know but you were already over the horizon and besides, the service module isn\u0027t designed to land on the-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Don\u0027t you tell me what I can or cannot land, Dee. I\u0027m a Pilot, and I will land anything I damn well please.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Daphtris has no response, but does pointedly stare at the crumpled service module resting on its side fifty meters from her own wrecked lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Okay, so \u003Cem\u003Emaybe\u003C/em\u003E it would have gone better if it had some legs, but you have to admit apart from the cracked fuel tank and crushed bell I did a damn sight better than you,\u0022 Isarigh concludes. Knowing there is no way she could win this argument, Daph shrugs and asks, \u0022Everything I left behind still in there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thankfully her lucky wrench hadn\u0027t been jostled loose from the velcro pad, but the same could not be said of her power drill. Daphtris mumbles a few expletives as she attempts to navigate through a room designed without gravity in mind, but stops short as a foot catches in the handle to the snack drawer. A terrible question strikes her. Did they have enough for two people to continue on while the rescue ships were en route? She grabs a grease pencil and scribbles some figures on the wall. Even if they were to skip a meal each day, there wasn\u0027t quite enough to stretch it. Out of nowhere a second, darker thought hits. \u003Cem\u003EDo we have enough electricity to last the night?\u003C/em\u003E That carpet of solars she made would be utterly worthless come sundown. With a bit of struggle, she extricates herself from the service module. \u0022Hey Izzy?\u0022 she calls, \u0022Can you help me carry some stuff?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Could you explain all of this, please?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Isarigh stands bewildered amid the piles of erstwhile engine parts, RCS gear, and what had been the twin to the Kestrel\u0027s antenna but was now... something else entirely. Her little sister had always been interested in how things work, routinely taking apart the toys she received on birthdays and holidays, but this was on a completely different level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022It\u0027s easy, Iz. You know how the alternator works, right? This,\u0022 she gestures at one cobbled-together mass, \u0022is the exact same thing, but instead of siphoning off exhaust from the rocket I\u0027ve plugged it into the monopropellant system. It\u0027s not a lot of power, but it\u0027ll get us through the next few nights assuming it holds.\u0022 Daphtris is smiling, the hours of grueling reconfiguration apparently paying off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Yeah okay, but what\u0027s all that stuff?\u0022 Izzy inquires, slightly more confused than before. She gestures vaguely at the pipe attached to the exit port of the alternator, which leads to a squat box covered with what had been the cockpit window of the service module. It is nearly impossible to make out the contents as the interior is coated in condensation, but Isarigh puts her helmet to the glass and tries anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Oh! Uh, remember how I lied about there being enough food to last until rescue?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022You WHAT??!\u0022 Iz bolts upright, almost toppling backwards in the low gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022No it\u0027s okay, this is how I fixed that!\u0022 Daph frantically backpedals. \u0022The exhaust from the monoprop is basically just steam, and I\u0027m using the excess to heat and water a miniature hydroponics setup like we had in our dorm room closet. Only major difference is this one\u0027s germinating those seeds you\u0027re always munching on.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Suspicious of the explanation the older sister asks, \u0022So how are you going to keep it growing at night? The docking guidance lamp got smashed when I landed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022That\u0027s what I needed your antenna for!\u0022 Daphtris beams. \u0022I turned it into a light bulb on a stick.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Isarigh nods slowly, inwardly convinced that her sister has gone completely off her rocker from the stress. \u0022Soooo... where\u0027s the bulb?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022No imagination at all, I swear!\u0022 exclaims Dee. \u0022The bulb isn\u0027t just there to stop you from poking your fingers into white-hot metal. It\u0027s there to keep the filament in vacuum, so it doesn\u0027t immediately burn out. This,\u0022 she gesticulates wildly at nothing in particular, \u0022is basically vacuum, so we don\u0027t need it. Just, you know, don\u0027t poke it and it\u0027ll be fine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T03:07:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edminster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eminor copyediting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toyotawolf","CreatedById":75259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T14:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOL awesome glad to see this is happening Angel, i look forward to testing the c$#% out of it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T16:37:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Edminister: great story. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I can see Wild Blue Industries, a bunch of Space Cowboys, seeing the disaster as a marketing opportunity to build stuff for prospectors...
