I guarantee that if the whole world were forced to switch to some arbitrary system based on squigs and foors and lops, there\u0027d be a whole lot of griping and complaining, but ten years from now we\u0027d all be using it just fine. Metric has a lot going for it, particularly unit conversion, but when you get down to it the basis of everything, the meter, is just as arbitrary as the foot, because it\u0027s historically based on the circumference of the earth, and the scale of that value is meaningless to most people. And the \u0022imperial\u0022 system doesn\u0027t have any more convincing argument about being better, even though the length measurement bases are supposed to be based on sizes we see in everyday life, like the length of a person\u0027s foot, knuckle, or the distance from nose tip to thumb on an outstretched arm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know the real reason the conversion isn\u0027t happening? It\u0027s because the problem with changing everything to metric is...well, changing \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E to metric. People in this thread keep on talking about road signs in the interstate system, but that\u0027s just the tip of the iceberg. Let\u0027s get this straight: changing the signage (and the paradigm for how the system is understood - it\u0027s not just a matter of switching the signs out) is a big enough job by itself. But then you also have the US highway system, which is a whole separate system, and it would have to be changed at the same time. And the federal government doesn\u0027t actually do the work on this; that\u0027s the responsibility of the \u003Cem\u003Estates.\u003C/em\u003E So you have to convince each state to do this in the same time frame or you\u0027re going to get a gigantic cluster. And the states have to worry about changing their \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C/em\u003E highway systems in the same time frame. And county roads. And municipal streets. Which are controlled by sub-state entities of one sort or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the scale of this starting to sink in? Oh, and this is just the part that is visible to joe citizen. For large parts of the country, \u0022sectioning\u0022 of counties is based on square-mile regions, separated by major roads. Now these obviously won\u0027t be square kilometer regions; no one is going to tear up established infrastructure just to make it consistent with the new system. So you\u0027re left with a dilemma: do you continue to make new construction based on the old legacy system, even though you\u0027re committed to otherwise using metric? Or do you make new construction based on kilometer, with a paradigm switch between old and new construction? Replacing every road sign in the country is peanuts compared with figuring out how to deal with the change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s just infrastructure. What about business? There are billions of business, engineering, and manufacturing documents that would be out of compliance, plus tooling that needs replaced to adapt to a new system. Converting this data costs time and money, but you also need to support all the existing stuff, so you have to keep the legacy system around anyway! US businesses and workers are already facing substantial financial competition from foreign suppliers, adding this cost for little benefit (because you don\u0027t actually change your product definition unless you have to) is not a decision to be made lightly. We already deal with this to a certain extent with customers and suppliers who need the other system, but forcing a full-on switch exacerbates the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople will complain about thinking that one system or the other is better for some reason, but that\u0027s just us being stubborn. The holdup on using metric here is the scale of the conversion effort, and the cost associated with it. And it\u0027s bigger than people realize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I would accept a true switch to metric in a heartbeat if someone presented a realistic plan to actually accomplish it.

As you say, we\u0027d all get used to it if the whole world suddenly switched to some arbitrary system. But that\u0027s just it: The whole world switching to that arbitrary system would standardize measurements around the globe. As it is, the Metric system is used in 95% of the world, while the last hold-out has enough economic power that its stubbornness affects everyone else. It would seem to be the path of least resistance for the US to finally switch too, but that doesn\u0027t seem to be likely any time soon. And even if it was, there would be significant hurdles to overcome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat doesn\u0027t mean it is impossible though. Both Canada and Australia switched over in the 70\u0027s.

On a per-capita basis, it probably wasn\u0027t any cheaper for Australia and Canada to make the change than it would be for the USA to do it, given their vast areas and relatively small populations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you\u0027re right.

Is that the general consensus is that the US is being lazy to switch over. Officially we are. And ever since 2nd grade, I\u0027ve learned both systems, all the way up through Engineering school where 95% of our work was done in metric. (thermo class) Note that our machining courses, all our math had to be done in imperial though (because all the old lathes and mills were all built with mils in mind, and buying new 1s built with metric in mind for controls.... well they certainly aren\u0027t cheap) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever had any problems with other countries either submitting metric designs built to inch spec for production.

My car had mph speedometer and all roads have miles, not km. My frustration was even more when I had to remember that there were actually two kinds of miles - one ~1.6 km and another nautical one ~1.8 km. I always used the wrong one when I had to estimate the distances. Having been used to kilometers my mind simply accepted the sign 220 as 220 km, not 220 miles.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I wonder if you\u0027re actually serious. I\u0027ve been traveling all my life. I go to Germany, my speedometer is in Km/Hr, the signs are in Km. I don\u0027t need to do a mental conversion into mph, to figure out its going to be a half hour for me to get from where I am, to where I\u0027m going. I come back to the US, with a car that says mph, and the road signs say I\u0027m 96 miles from seattle. Its not difficult. If you\u0027re trying to convert stuff into your system like that (and then bringing in the nautical mile is the real thing that makes it ridiculous) thats your own problem, not a problem with the US using Miles for distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless of course you brought your car over here... but that makes no sense either, because of the probably 50 rental cars I\u0027ve ridden in in various countries.
