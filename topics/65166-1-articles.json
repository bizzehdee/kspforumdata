The baby SRB goes OT even when out on a radial mount. the mailsail goes OT if it\u0027s run at 100%. either the alarm is too low, or full throttle is not correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T09:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei rather like that you have to babysit your engines on launch to avoid melting them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T12:09:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the way overheating works now. Pack your engines too tightly together or run them too hard too low and you get an overheat.

Mainsails and nuclear engines always start to overheat, but the overheat bar stops at around halfway, making it completely safe to run them at 100% for long periods of time. Maybe the problem was worse before I started playing in 0.22, but currently you can pretty much ignore the warnings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JtPB","CreatedById":103925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T16:59:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eall of you has forgot the RAPIER, which i tested as jet booster(that after a while become close-cycle engine if theres no enough air intake),\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026amp; if i got him to 100% to much time it explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas an answer to the thread\u0027s question, i like the state as its now, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T17:04:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERAPIERs just fall of when someone sneezes nearby, but I\u0027ve never managed to destroy them from overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
