Building a *Flight of the Phoenix*-style contraption out of parts leftover from your own crashed ship to get home is a unique challenge. Erecting a tower using the winch is pretty awesome too.\n\nRecently, I used KAS to experiment with artificial gravity. (Inspired by Mars Direct) The onboard instruments only show the average acceleration of the whole vessel, but it was fun to mess with the concepts anyway. Unfortunately, KSP isn\u0027t designed for this, so some of the torques don\u0027t work as they should. After a while, I replaced the cable with a pipe, which made it behave more naturally.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/aDtL8xh7UTg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nNot my best video by far.
