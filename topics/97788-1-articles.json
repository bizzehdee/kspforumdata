The craft was over weight, so I removed some fuel out of one, assuming all three would be mirrored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went on with the flight and it flipped out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I went back to check, all three were identical in the VAB but the craft was auto-saved in an overweight configuration. My last change (removing the solid fuel from a single tank) had translated to the craft as it went into the game, so fuel was asymmetric, but HAD NOT saved as such, the fuel in the other two boosters was back to the previous level. This was an already modified level of fuel, which I had already changed in previous versions of the craft file, and had mirrored perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back into the VAB I once again changed the fuel level in one, but right clicking on the other two showed no change, and when right clicking on the third, it changes back to the previous level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
