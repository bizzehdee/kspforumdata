You can use a reasonable number of control surfaces and a bit of RCS like you might on any other ship. There are some restrictions on how these can be mounted, but you shouldn\u0027t have any issues with them if you aren\u0027t attempting to break the physics of the game. There are some \u0022breaks in physics\u0022 that players routinely use without always realizing it, and you can take advantage of these within the challenge guidelines. This challenge should be easy for rookie spacecraft engineers to enter and place in, while it will discourage some of the more aggressive metagaming and physics exploitation often seen here done by the expert players. Experts are still welcome to compete as long as you play by the rules. Most of you rookies probably won\u0027t even need to read much past the next paragraph. I won\u0027t instantly disqualify someone for minor rule infractions, but will point them out and place them accordingly on the leaderboard.

To count as orbit, the periapsis must be at least 69,078 meters in altitude. Of course you don\u0027t have to reach orbit to score in the challenge, but anyone who does will be categorized separately from those who do not. This challenge is prompted by the new 0.24 PB-ION thruster which had its thrust boosted to 2kN. If you are not using version 0.24.X you may still play in the challenge but you\u0027ll want to alter your ion engines to be like those in the latest version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAcceptable Propulsion:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome mods are accepted for certain purposes. Your ion engines must be the stock PB-ION Electric Propulsion System with 0.25t mass, 2kN thrust, 4200 Isp, 8.729 electricity per second, and 0.485 xenon per second. You may use any style of RCS/translation controls you like, burning any type of fuel you like, provided they are operated with the translation controls (default IJKLHN) and have an Isp no higher than 260 at any altitude. RCS fuel you use must burn through mass as quickly as standard RCS. No fuel of any type other than electricity (that means no RCS fuel) may be collected during the flight unless you are outside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and you are collecting the fuel from a ship you are docked with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYour net dV expenditure in getting to orbit must be at minimum 75% from your ion engines.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E No other RCS restrictions apply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAllowed Control Surface Placement:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may use wings and control surfaces from any mod, provided they use the same mass, lift, deflection range, and surface area ratios as the stock wings and control surfaces or those within B9 Aerospace. If Firespitter, FAR, or KW Rocketry have any fixed wings or control surfaces then those are also valid. Rotary wings/propellers are not allowed, including those you build with stock parts. You may use any number of physics-free parts provided the craft is within part number guidelines (details below, and very relaxed) and is clearly not using any of them to generate any significant amount of thrust. No infinigliding allowed. This is defined as a craft that needs no propulsion to stay afloat and can gradually increase its speed/altitude ratio without losing mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may use as much wing space as you like. Control surfaces are limited to being placed on the trailing edge of wings only, except for a single allowed pair of control winglets placed near the front of the craft attached to the fuselage. No control surface may clip any other control surface. Your lift from control surfaces may not equal more than 1/2 of your lift from static wings. No parts may be attached onto a control surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFerram Aerospace Research atmospheric physics is allowed and ranks separately from stock atmospheric physics.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart Clipping:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinor clipping of parts (mostly accidental) is allowed as long as it looks decent--I am aware this sounds a bit sketchy. I\u0027ll be the judge on whether the clipping is legal or not, but I\u0027m pretty lenient. As long as you don\u0027t activate part clipping in the VAB/SPH, don\u0027t use any attachment nodes twice, and don\u0027t have large amounts of parts visually clipping into other parts, you should be fine. As long as I don\u0027t suspect you of trying to cheese the challenge, I won\u0027t pick on your craft.

You are strongly advised to have a dV readout, such as Kerbal Engineer, to show how much dV you spent getting up there--the less, the better. Any mods you used need to be detailed in your post. Show your part count. If you are carrying illegal engines on your ship, make sure it\u0027s clear they are off for the whole trip and only count as cargo. Any dead weight counts as cargo.
