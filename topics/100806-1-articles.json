Currently underway is a science probe which will map and scan the planet. I designed the probe to take a lot of extra fuel in order to get into a high inclination orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m designing stage two of my mission, which will include a rover, a small communications satellite that will orbit in a very low orbit to provide a link with Kerbin (RemoteTech), and a larger communications satellite that will be in a highly inclined, elliptical orbit around Duna to form the backbone of my Duna communications relay for later exploration and colonization missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile designing the probe, I wondered, isn\u0027t there a way to aim for an inclined orbit when transferring to Duna? This would save a lot of fuel, as I know that the further away from a body you do a maneuver, the less dV you need, as opposed to aiming for Duna in an equatorial orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T23:42:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 11:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kip336\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EQuestion Answered.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T21:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure. After you\u0027ve left kerbin and have an encounter with Duna set, make a correction burn (I usually do this at roughly the halfway point of the trip, or at the ascending or descending node if the inclination is off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick on Duna and select Focus View, now you\u0027ll be focused on Duna and you\u0027ll be able to see your orbital path once you reach Duna\u0027s SoI.

But not necessarily, for example you may already be coming in high or low and you might want to burn radial to move yourself over the center of the Duna system, or it might take a little bit of prograde or retrograde thrust... who knows. Just play around a bit until you like what you see. If you\u0027re doing the maneuver far away it takes so little DV you can afford to play around. Heck, on ships with an RCS system I usually just do little bursts of translation to see which direction will move me where I want to end up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, you can use a maneuver node, but since you\u0027re talking about at most 5-20m/s it can be more trouble then it\u0027s worth to try to set one up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no...
