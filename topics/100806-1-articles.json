Currently underway is a science probe which will map and scan the planet. I designed the probe to take a lot of extra fuel in order to get into a high inclination orbit.\n\nNow I\u0027m designing stage two of my mission, which will include a rover, a small communications satellite that will orbit in a very low orbit to provide a link with Kerbin (RemoteTech), and a larger communications satellite that will be in a highly inclined, elliptical orbit around Duna to form the backbone of my Duna communications relay for later exploration and colonization missions.\n\nWhile designing the probe, I wondered, isn\u0027t there a way to aim for an inclined orbit when transferring to Duna? This would save a lot of fuel, as I know that the further away from a body you do a maneuver, the less dV you need, as opposed to aiming for Duna in an equatorial orbit.\n\nMany thanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T23:42:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 11:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kip336**\n  \nQuestion Answered."},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T21:07:42Z","Content":"Sure. After you\u0027ve left kerbin and have an encounter with Duna set, make a correction burn (I usually do this at roughly the halfway point of the trip, or at the ascending or descending node if the inclination is off).\n\nClick on Duna and select Focus View, now you\u0027ll be focused on Duna and you\u0027ll be able to see your orbital path once you reach Duna\u0027s SoI. From here I usually just make tiny burns in each of the main directions to see how they\u0027ll adjust the encounter (you may be able to do this with a maneuver node as well, but I don\u0027t normally bother since we\u0027re talking about only a few m/s of delta-v) You should be able to get an encounter that comes right over one of the poles or at whatever inclination you want.\n\nThe key to interplanetary missions is make burns as far out as possible. Tiny course corrections on the other side of the system have huge impacts months later when you finally get where you\u0027re going.\n\nAlso: Beware Ike... it\u0027s huge, it\u0027s close, and it likes to take things on highly elliptical orbits and throw them out of the Duna system."},{"CreatedByName":"Kip336","CreatedById":131629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T21:14:59Z","Content":"Ike....yea....his name comes up a few times too many.

But not necessarily, for example you may already be coming in high or low and you might want to burn radial to move yourself over the center of the Duna system, or it might take a little bit of prograde or retrograde thrust... who knows. Just play around a bit until you like what you see. If you\u0027re doing the maneuver far away it takes so little DV you can afford to play around. Heck, on ships with an RCS system I usually just do little bursts of translation to see which direction will move me where I want to end up.\n\nAgain, you can use a maneuver node, but since you\u0027re talking about at most 5-20m/s it can be more trouble then it\u0027s worth to try to set one up.\n\nAnd no... Eve is a cruel mistress... save her for last unless you want to be caught in her purplely clutches forever. And Gilly is a boring space potato. Duna is where you want to go... just watch out for Ike.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T21:47:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WhiteKnuckle**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kip336","CreatedById":131629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T23:43:45Z","Content":"Alright, thanks for the input then!\n\nAs for Eve/Duna, I was basing myself of the travel to Duna tutorial on the wiki:\n\n[*\u0027*](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:How_to_get_to_Duna)[*Duna*](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Duna)[*is*](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:How_to_get_to_Duna)[*Kerbin*](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin)[*\u0027s second closest neighbor.

Otherwise, just try to make it so that your periapsis will sit close to the equator, and the apoapsis as far out as possible (which isn\u0027t as far as one would like, not near Duna; and there\u0027s always the Ike problem). The high-apo plane change will probably still cost on the order of 100m/s; not having to worry about Ike is worth another 100m/s, I\u0027d say."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T09:06:56Z","Content":"I find that the point of SOI entry is a really good time to make a choice about polar or equatorial orbits. Transfer burns rarely drop you into the perfect plane when you arrive, and most adjustments here seem to cost about 50 delta-v to set the orbit either way ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s true that you can do them earlier while still in solar orbit, but getting it fine tuned can be challenging, as 0.1m/s can fling you round the other side of the planet entirely. Being the the edge of the body\u0027s SOI is still vastly cheaper than when you\u0027re already in an orbit around it while not requiring inhumanly precise throttle control."}]}
