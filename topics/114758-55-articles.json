Before that, the Kerbal was sitting in the retracted part and was not able to get into IVA because the hatch was blocked. (KSP ignores the fact that there are 0 seats in a part an still puts the kerbal inside) I changed the code so that the part automatically deploys when a kerbal is inside. I also considers just forcing the Kerbal to leave the part, but that seemed unrealistic to me.\n\nThe part should be deployed though when you get to the part the first time. Do i understand it right, that the part is retracted during the whole time when you first reached that part?"},{"CreatedByName":"Spheniscine","CreatedById":125755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T12:23:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 25 minutes ago, Nils277 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Quote\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Do i understand it right, that the part is retracted during the whole time when you first reached that part?\n\u003E \u003E\n\u003E \n\nYes.
