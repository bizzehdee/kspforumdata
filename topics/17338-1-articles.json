I\u0027d like to bring my guys home from orbit, but I\u0027ve no means of slowing them down unless the engines will restart.

You need to be able to go back to tracking station. When you reload up the ship in flight, the fuel flow would be going well. Unfortunately if you are using this for a spaceplace, means a landing to do the reload, not so good for your speed efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UseAsDirected","CreatedById":27623,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T02:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever had success with this? It seems to be happening constantly, making the game almost unplayable. Every... single... time....
