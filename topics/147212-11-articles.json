The V-2 wasn\u0027t made of stacks of small pieces, and therefor wobbly. No LV I can think of did this, regardless of how early a design it was. The point of the small tanks in career should not be to make new players make absurd contraptions, it should be what I assumed they were for back in the day---small, upper stages.
