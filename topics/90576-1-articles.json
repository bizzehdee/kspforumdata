The main point people like RT is because it introduces a mechanic that forces you to an additional kind of craft (satelite) and introduces new mission profiles (putting rather small payload at specific orbits). It offers another more central role for small and medium ssto\u0027s and shuttles. At least those are the reasons why I like to have it.
