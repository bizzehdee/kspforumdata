No clue why deleting the cache changes things, but try moving one of your larger part mods to your desktop then delete your ATM cache and try starting KSP a couple times. Alternatively you could install a memory monitoring mod like GC Monitor or Sentinel and see if you\u0027re hitting the magical 3.8gb limit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a bad install, the path to the ion engine cfg is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Space Program/GameData/Squad/Parts/Engine/ionEngine/ionEngine.cfg\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you should try re-installing (or verifying your Steam cache).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T21:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei fixed the ion engine part, but now i have the same problem with SXT, or stock extension. i can fix it by deleting its folder in the ATM texture cache folder, but it extends load time and i think it uses more ram when i do that. i think its because it uses the textures of the squad folder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
