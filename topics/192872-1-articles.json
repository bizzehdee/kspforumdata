In this case however there isn\u0027t a better vacuum engine in the game for most use cases (unless you use a 2.5m LV-N or ion). A 2.5m Rhino would mass 6t and have 1333kN (calculated, not checked). This will still normally be worse on grounds of higher mass and lower vacuum Isp, but on a sufficiently massive stage it would be better purely down to lower gravity losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-03T05:04:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2020 05:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket Witch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExtremeSquared","CreatedById":153192,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-03T22:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming you won\u0027t be landing with it, you should compare it to a non-scaled Terrier if you want a real competition.
