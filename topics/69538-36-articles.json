Not cool at all. Its simply not necessary. Work is being done on the mod. There have been regularly new commits on his bitbucket. Also remember he does not have to release this to us at all. So again your comments are unnecessary, rude, and flirt awfully close with violating the forums rules about badgering modders about new releases and updates. I am sorry if my response and others might seem as if we are overreacting but it doesn\u0027t seem like you have been on these forums very long. I and many others have seen too many modders get frustrated and leave\u00A0because of insidious and rampant comments. I have seen modders leave and quit from benign and possibly even creative criticism yet because it was compounded by constant other comments they decided to shut down and either not support their mods any longer or give up and never complete projects all together. Its because of our experience witnessing and experiencing the loss of great and the potentially great mods we don\u0027t take comments like yours lightly. Just this week we almost lost the cactye telescope because people kept hounding the modder about updates. So just accept the ksp trademarked soon and whenever mods are updated they are updated. Full disclosure I have been guilty coy fully asking modders to update their mods. I have even gone so far as to preface it as being playful or as a joke but I have learned that its just easier to encourage and wait rather than beg or demand (even if it is playful). \u00A0So please have patience.
