Aircraft can be told to hold in a pattern at a waypoint until there\u0027s more room on the next leg of their flight plan, or to approach a waypoint at a different altitude or in a slightly different direction. For an orbiting spacecraft that needs to rendezvous with something or reach a mission orbit meeting certain specifications, the space of possible flight paths isn\u0027t smooth like it is for aircraft. There are discrete windows where it\u0027s possible to do the mission within your delta-v budget, and the window you take will determine the orbits you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo each operator of a spacecraft would be responsible to generate a plan that doesn\u0027t closely approach anyone else\u0027s current orbit or previously filed plan. If two operators file plans that conflict, the first to file gets approved and the other gets told to recalculate around the plan that was approved. You\u0027d have limited ability to move other ships out of the way of a manned ship that declares an emergency, so I\u0027d allow manned ships to to reserve a couple of pre-calculated contingency maneuvers in addition to their planned maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBusy orbits like geosynchronous, near major space stations, and typical phasing orbits for rendezvous with busy targets would have limitations on how much time you can spend at those altitude ranges at certain inclinations if it isn\u0027t your mission orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor military spacecraft (e.g spy satellites, X-37B) that don\u0027t want to publish their orbits, I\u0027d allow them to fly without filing as long as they agree to monitor the database, maneuver to avoid any flight plan that gets filed, and pay fair compensation to anybody on a flight plan who\u0027s harmed in any way, subjected to a near miss, or forced to maneuver because of an unlisted flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T23:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERendezvous =/= docking.
