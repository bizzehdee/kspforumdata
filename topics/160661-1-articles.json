Is it because of the more confined space of HB engine\u0027s turbine at a specific overall diameter\u00A0(compared to LB engines) ? I mean, say on a B737, CFM\u00A0LEAP vs the predecessor CFM56 (or the even older JT8D), I know LEAP\u0027s combustion turbines are really, really small, yet they produce around the same thrust (even without the fan, say), but it\u0027s interesting. I do believe that the way forward would be to actually use some higher bypass ratios, because otherwise it seems that economical supersonic flights will never be in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-20T12:48:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2017 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by YNM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-20T14:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223061756\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160661\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495231206\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002249317\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Steel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy (slightly educated) guess is that the limit is a thermal one, rather than anything inherently limiting with the concept of HB turbofans.
