Do a visual survey above 15km of the area.\u0022 (Crew report - general area)\n\nContract two: (only available after completing above contract)\n\n\u0022The trees turned out to be no trees at all, unless genetically modified trees were created to look exactly like a crashed spaceship. Go there and investigate.\u0022 (Crew report, landed, general area)\n\nContract three: (only available after completing above contract)\n\n\u0022XY Kerbal seems to be alive and has left the ship.
