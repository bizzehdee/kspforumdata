The system is designed to set fuel transfer rate based on the number of yellow lazors with line of sight to the target vessel. In addition the distance also matters, but you will only see deminishing returns beyond 500 meter. There is also a max range for the transfer where the transfer as the deminishing returns will eventually lead to 0 transfer rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is not working like this, please take note of what actually happends and give me some steps to reproduce the bug, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dragon01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dragon01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI found a bug in the robotic arm.
