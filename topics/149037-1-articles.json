Adding a slope map, especially where you can select cutoff values (ie so you can clearly see where the terrain has \u0026lt;5 degree slope for example)\u00A0would be great in helping the player choose suitable landing sites and would increase the usefulness of KerbNet and scanning satellites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T08:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe a coloured \u0027slope overlay\u0027 addition to the current height display could work.
