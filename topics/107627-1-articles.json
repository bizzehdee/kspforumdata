Quite easily i might add ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I regularly use Mun slingshots to give my interplanetary ships couple hundreds of dV extra. Of course it depends if Mun is in right position in its orbit for my needs. If anyone is interested in slingshot maneuvers, i\u0027m sure there is some tutorials on YouTube."}]}
