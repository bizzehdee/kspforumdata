Use the best hill you can find!\n\nRules!!!\n\nMain propulsion is done with electric rover wheels only.\n\nFunctional parts must be stock. (Information or cosmetic mods are permitted.)\n\nAny stock form of stability assistance, traction improvement or similar device not contributing to forward or upward velocity is permitted. (I use 2 upward facing Place-Anywhere 7 RCS port to keep me on the ground.)\n\nHyperedit and similar tools that facilitate rapid prototyping and testing are... strongly recommended!\n\nCrewed or uncrewed...\n\nYour rover can explode and any kerbal can die except Jeb! Jeb is not allowed to die, ever... especially not publicly!\n\nRanking will be based on the apoapsis from a screenshot of the map view. Mouse over the apoapsis to be sure the apoapsis height is displayed. If you do something heroic, we would appreciate more screenshots or videos. If you find a real nice hill, coordinates or some other way to recreate your bold feat would be nice too!\n\nI am not a Gilly specialist but I wonder if it would be possible to get into an escape trajectory this way. If this happen, consider my challenge broken unless we can agree on some way to rank escaping trajectory (time to escape right after jump?)\n\nAnd here is some kind of proof it can be done:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OeidR_SNNE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThis was a first test starting from latlong 0,0 (according to hyperedit). I didn\u0027t really looked around for a launch site yet!\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T11:09:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ..I am not a Gilly specialist but I wonder if it would be possible to get into an escape trajectory this way...\n\nGilly\u0027s escape velocity is 35.71 m/s - out of reach of just rover wheel propulsion.

Following a brief visual search, a maximum elevation of 6400m was found during an EVA by Jeb but no steep slope.\n\nAn initial jump was nevertheless attempted around that location. An apoapsis of 10992m was attained.\n\nThe following scientific findings worth of mention where discovered:\n\nIt is very hard to control a rover on gilly, even with two Place-Anywhere 7 RCS ports. Multiple attempts at reaching a relatively slow speed had to be done.\n\nThe flag marking the highest elevation was displayed floating in the air on the map view. I believe there is a discrepancy between the real terrain model and the map view model.\n\nAnd now ladies and gentlemen... the pictures:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
