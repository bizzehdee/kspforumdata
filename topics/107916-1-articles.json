I acitvate the J33, it lifts off without assistance and stabilizes itself in an height between 9500 and 12000 m (it will oszillate between these two borders without me ever pressing any button).\n\nThe problems start about 1 to 2 hours in flight with maximum physics warp. The plane will get slower and slower (fuel and intake air are both redundant available and the engine is put on 100%) till the plane stalls and crashes between 3 and 4 hours in flight.\n\nI have no idea, why this happens. Could anyone give me a hint what is going wrong?\n\nHere a picture in SPH and in flight:\n\n[![5oNt7Oj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5oNt7Oj.jpg)](http://imgur.com/5oNt7Oj)\n\n[![Jh71qkX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Jh71qkX.jpg)](http://imgur.com/Jh71qkX)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T21:56:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 09:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Heimdall5008**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:32:46Z","Content":"The question is, is your Jet engine losing power this whole time? The basic jet loses power the higher it goes and the faster it goes. So there is a max speed that engine will go."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:45:13Z","Content":"The only thing I can think of is the plane climbs too high at one point, loses power and the nose tilts downward. And if your not at your pc to pick it back up when that happens you\u0027ll return to find it crashed. \n\nYou should probably consider mechjeb or other automation means to keep the plane at a specified altitude.\n\nIsn\u0027t there a way to trim control surfaces so they always pitch up? I had always thought it was alt\u002Bpitch, but it doesn\u0027t seem to do anything for me what so ever.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T17:49:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"Heimdall5008","CreatedById":114990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:07:47Z","Content":"This was also my first assumption, but according to the flight log I never got higher than just below 12.000 meters.

My guess is that time warp is the culprit. I\u0027ve noticed that using it can cause odd problems. Almost always if I encounter a problem while under physics warp I\u0027ve found that simply canceling the warp fixes it. My advice would be to try that and get back to us on if it fixed the problem.\n\nAnother troubleshooting step you could do is install Kerbal Engineer and do the flight with the Vessel info window open. The problem may reveal itself in one of the readouts."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T21:26:07Z","Content":"Is that the Wheesley engine?
