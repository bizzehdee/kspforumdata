I acitvate the J33, it lifts off without assistance and stabilizes itself in an height between 9500 and 12000 m (it will oszillate between these two borders without me ever pressing any button).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problems start about 1 to 2 hours in flight with maximum physics warp. The plane will get slower and slower (fuel and intake air are both redundant available and the engine is put on 100%) till the plane stalls and crashes between 3 and 4 hours in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea, why this happens.

My guess is that time warp is the culprit. I\u0027ve noticed that using it can cause odd problems. Almost always if I encounter a problem while under physics warp I\u0027ve found that simply canceling the warp fixes it. My advice would be to try that and get back to us on if it fixed the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother troubleshooting step you could do is install Kerbal Engineer and do the flight with the Vessel info window open.
