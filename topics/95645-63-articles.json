Although, you might find some of tech nodes empty, but as Yemo explained several times in this thread, empty node is still needed as it is balanced as \u0022science price\u0022 for whatever part you want to unlock and it is higher node on three where empty one is requirement to unlock high tier cech node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you use some mode that is not configured for CTT or SETIctt, it will be covered with stock tech tree at least, so you will be able to unlock it as any other stock part in game, although might not be balanced well enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, SETTI covers all of it pretty well, let Yemo take a well deserved break from moding until KSP 1.1. comes out. Until then, at least we have SETI that have covered most popular mods. I hope that Yemo will find mental strength to continue development of this mod, once KSP 1.1. is released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscussion about new Community Career Framework is always welcome despite of lot of unknown features of KSP 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwait, SETIctt is a thing? is it like, SETI but without any like any modifications to the standard tech tree? any idea where i can find out more about it? or its topic thread?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T15:50:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if I explained well enough. There is a lot of info in first post of this thread, but it is not survived forum migration well enough, so info there is confusing compared to well informed post on old forum.

SETIctt is differently organized tech tree that organize stock parts and parts from various mods in a different way than stock tech tree. SETIctt does not alter part properties, only mod requirement is CTT that is used for arangment of tech tree nodes. So, any other mod that add parts and is not covered by SETIctt will be dealed in same way as other tech group/level part from stock game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSETI balance mod however deals with changing parts to be more balanced for overall gameplay experience. That includes merged antenna in core probes, some part mass changes, is some science parts is reusable or not and similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSETI contract mod deals only with available contracts that should be offered to player trough career. Mainly it balances stock contracts for speed record limits and such, so you don\u0027t get too much reward too early in game and also provides some new contracts. If that one is not compatible with latest changes with contract configurator, you can use SETIctt without SETI contract mod, although you could get more rewards early in game than it is intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSETI green house mod add some new parts for offworld food production and it is not required to install if you don\u0027t like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is several other mods, like contract packs from different moders that can be used along SETIctt, but that is also optional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also find more info about it through various posts in this thread if you are patient enough to read it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nobodyhasthis2","CreatedById":154685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T17:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am seeing a module manager error during loading say there is a problem\u00A0with\u00A0hybridbooster-rt11.cfg.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1.0.4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSETI Tree\u00A00.9.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sure it is down to me as SETI has been running like a charm in the past.\u00A0Thought it was worth posting here as it a bit unusual error.\u00A0As a possible self help route to a fix I am sharing a few thought here.\u00A0Not sure if this down to dirty CKAN instal.

After that, make sure that all folders are wiped out, except SQUAD of, courrse.

Might not be balanced as expected, but I probably could not play much before KSP 1.1. release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
