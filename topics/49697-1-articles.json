The problem is the fact that we can use transmissions to grind out all available science in a single trip, and do that in multiple biomes. If either there were a limit on how many time a given piece of equipment could run a single experiment, or if there were a limit on how much science you could get in a single experiment/biome via transmissions, then returning experiments would be more important. Admittedly, pure sensor experiments don\u0027t fit into this model well, but for those that do, it\u0027s more realistic than what you\u0027re suggesting.
