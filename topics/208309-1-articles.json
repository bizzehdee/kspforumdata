In most cases you can find these mods on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, which I recommend you use to avoid a whole lot of pain as it very rarely makes mistakes, usually gets all dependencies and also allows you to update mods when they\u2019re available. This is neither an exhaustive list nor a list of \u201Cmods you must use\u201D, I\u2019m just giving you some options to take a look at and see if you like the looks of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore mission types (I assume you mean in-game contracts from Mission Control?):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nContract Configurator is a requirement for most contract packs, you\u2019ll probably need that;\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA variety of contract packs exist, each with a different focus- launching relays, building and using stations and bases, replicating real-life missions- so look for some that fit your goals.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStrategia- completely replaces the Administration strategies to offer a variety of options- focus on crewed or probe missions, to different planets or moons, boost a particular Kerbonaut type or trade one in-game resource (funds, fame, science) for another.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNew, balanced parts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRestock\u002B, fills some holes in the stock part lineup (e.g. 0.625m tanks, 3.75m Poodle-esque vacuum engine, hemispherical tanks in all sizes and it also includes 1.875m and some 5m parts that replicate most of the Making History parts) and adds a few novelties like a forwards-facing rover wheel. Not everyone likes the part retextures that Restock itself adds, but many other mods I\u2019ll be mentioning have a similar style as they\u2019re made by the same modder\u00A0(Nertea) who\u2019s subsequently been hired by the KSP2 team, no coincidence there.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNear Future mods- each specialises in a different area, so NF Propulsion adds fancy PIT and VASIMR thrusters while NF Exploration includes a lot of probe-oriented parts, they can be used independently or together. There\u2019s also Cryo Engines, Kerbal Atomics and Stockalile\u00A0Station Parts Expansion Redux (SSPXR for short) which adds a lot of really nice parts for stations, large spaceships and surface bases. The only mod I know of to include a part with \u003Ci\u003Eactual moving fish\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0inside it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSSR MicroSat- a dinky little probe with all the necessary parts to kit it out as a cheap but effective probe or relay, useful for early exploration.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnything from Wild Blue Industries\u00A0by Angel125, I\u2019ve only had a chance to use a few of them but they\u2019re all well-made and have a wide range, from airships to rovers to warp drives.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nX-20 \u201CMoroz\u201D, a versatile little shuttle with a range of possible uses, can cram a lot of Kerbals into a small space.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHonourable mention for Luciole as while the parts can be a bit overpowered in some cases, they also look great and expand the options for small-scale rockets that few other mods touch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nUtilities and career helpers:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nStage Recovery- can catch and recover dropped boosters and stages, either using parachutes or by simulating a powered landing. Very tweakable to increase or decrease the rewards from recovered stages and can make a big difference when you\u2019re struggling for funds early in a career.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBon Voyage- it\u2019s a rover autopilot that can drive around a planet or moon in the background instead of spending hours tediously driving it by hand.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSCANsat-\u00A0adds a variety of parts that can create different maps of planets and moons from orbit over time and can also detect surface anomalies, resources for mining and help you track down every biome to maximise science gains.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Environmental Institute (KEI)- automates the science gathering around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. If\u00A0you didn\u2019t know, there are over 20 \u201Cbiomes\u201D in and around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E buildings that all give their own science data, which you could visit by rolling a pod around, or just use KEI to do it all in one click. Can be a bit overpowered if you\u2019re playing on high science multipliers, especially if you invest the science into getting more experiments, but it\u2019s possible to do the same thing yourself so not cheating.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMechJeb- some\u00A0love it, some hate it, but once you\u2019ve done your hundredth launch, rendezvous or transfer burn you\u2019ll want something that can do it all for you with minimal input and MechJeb can automate almost everything, from launches to plotting nodes, rover driving to plane flying and docking to landing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Space Transportation System (KSTS)- allows you to record a flight using any rocket or spaceplane, then re-use the recorded flight profile to launch payloads up to the mass and altitude of the recording, for the price of the vessel and fuel used. It can also be used for on-orbit construction using space stations, drop payloads near existing vessels for instant rendezvousing\u00A0and ties in with Stage Recovery (and another recovery mod called FMRS) to subtract the cost of recovered boosters from the total, so once you\u2019re tired of launching everything yourself you can just select what you want launched, what orbit you want it in, pay the cost of the craft and launch and then sit back and wait for it to be dropped off in the desired orbit. Orbital construction can lead to Kraken-induced vessel destruction on occasion, so be warned.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExtraplanetary Launchpads- taking \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E to the next level by mining resources, turning them into parts and then creating new vessels- anywhere, any time. Your latest creation\u00A0too huge and heavy to be launched from Kerbin? Just build it on Minmus instead!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSoundtrack Editor- this one isn\u2019t on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E as it needs to be installed different to most other mods. It allows you to add your own music to the in-game music player, so if you want to start blasting the music from Interstellar while doing a tricky docking or some smooth jazz in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, go for it! There are plenty of websites that offer royalty-free music to download, including by Kevin MacLeod who wrote much of KSP\u2019s soundtrack, while the mod Astronomer\u2019s Visual Pack also has an optional extra full of music (and links to get more) that\u2019s worth looking at.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nVisuals and stuff- most of these will put a lot more strain on your PC, dedicated graphics cards only for most of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEnvironmental Visual Enhancements (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E)- allows the addition of clouds and other effects, requires configs to do anything. Required for all planetary visual mods that I know of.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScatterer- atmospheric and water effects as well as sunflares, also required for many planetary visual mods but can be used alone.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpectra and Astronomer\u2019s Visual Pack (AVP)- both contain\u00A0configs for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and scatterer to make the\u00A0planets look pretty. Other\u00A0options are also available, search on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E or the forums.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWaterfall- no GPU needed for this one, I\u2019ve run it on integrated\u00A0graphics without issue. Adds more realistic rocket plumes that change depending on external pressure and throttle setting, requires a config to work properly for stock parts (with or without Restock) but some mods (e.g. Near Future) have the configs built in. There\u2019s also a mod to add Waterfall\u00A0effects to SRBs so they don\u2019t feel left out.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDistant Object Enhancement (DOE)- makes planets and moons visible at a distance, as well as vessels at closer range. You can see Venus, Mars, and Jupiter from the surface of Earth with just your eyes; DOE does the same thing in KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are literally thousands of mods out there to choose from, the best way to find out what works for you is to try them. Just don\u2019t go over the top and add ALL THE MODS!!1! all at once or you\u2019ll quickly get buried under a bewildering wall of new parts and features that you don\u2019t know how to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-24T17:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224136427\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208309\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653335926\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022214115\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022glorsh66\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, glorsh66 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are the best mods to start a new career?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are the best mods to start a new career mode? \u00A0(I have never played long enough in the vanilla version).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t like the sandbox mode, so I like where there is some handholding by the game, so you know your next objective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I want:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n- more mission types (without removing old ones)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- New parts, that are balanced.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Balanced and well-implemented game mechanics that work well with career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR: consider Bluedog Design Bureau because it has great parts, a very active forum thread if you have questions, and also bundles new contracts.
