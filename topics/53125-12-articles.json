But the game shouldn\u0027t use more than 3.4GB of RAM. It isn\u0027t written in 64bit only 32 bit so it can\u0027t recognize more than about 3.4GB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy CPU is an i5-3470 running at 3.20GHZ normal clocked, with 8GB of RAM on a W7/64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will download the new module thanks for the lower part count. I am still considering retiring the XI-2 and replacing it with one of my SSTOs that I have that I know will do anything it is asked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
