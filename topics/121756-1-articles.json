The stock model has been greatly improved so craft shape and streamlining matter, as well as craft orientation. The days of slamming a rocket over to a 45 degree angle at 10km are over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR, meanwhile, has gone to an even more sophisticated model that makes a voxelized model of the craft and does its aero calculations on the resultant shape. This takes things like clipped parts and enclosures made from multiple parts into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice would be to try the new stock model and see how you like it, if you find it inadequate you can get greater fidelity through FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T22:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like the new atmosphere compared to the previous one. It feels much more realistic, and now I don\u0027t feel that I\u0027m cheating if I don\u0027t have FAR installed. A few things still irk me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Occlusion only works for parts in a stack. Even if one part is clearly \u0022behind\u0022 another part, it still creates a lot of drag. This is especially nasty for struts. If you want to strut your noodle-plane, no matter where, even \u0022inline\u0022, they still create drag and heat up on reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Attaching air intakes to the *back* of engines, rotating them into the airstream and offsetting them away from the exhaust stream actually *reduces* drag. No, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I still haven\u0027t gotten a single plane to stall. Flatspins - yes. But no stalling. Is that even a thing in Stock aero?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Eve and Jool atmospheres are *super* mean. If you just so much as scratch the atmosphere (like 5km below the cutoff), you burn off all of your surface attached assets.

One of the great oldFAR tricks was adding antennas to open nodes in order to reduce drag.\u003Cp\u003EPeople like to think that aerodynamic calculations are trivial but the complication is in KSP itself and how you can create pretty much any shape, and how that shape can change rapidly at any moment. KSP\u0027s current simulation is pretty good and feels, and acts, a lot like pre-1.0 FAR, or NEAR maybe (never played it). It\u0027s also pretty fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eferram4\u0027s current system of voxelizing the vessel is a great solution to the problem but it was by no means trivial; it took him a good deal of work and pushing builds off on people like me, who just happened to be nearby, for minor testing and performance reviews to get it right. KSP could definitely go that route but Squad\u0027s dev cycle wouldn\u0027t make it easy and, besides, they\u0027ve pretty much got oldFAR already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
