However, I was still able to control my ship, mainly by exploiting what I call the time warp ASAS. If you jump to x5 warp for a second all your ships rotatiion and stuff stops, making it a lot easier when your controls are absolutely totalled by the kraken (At one point left arrow pulled me up, right arrow pulled me left, down pulled me right, and nothing pulled me down.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kacperrutka26","CreatedById":18849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-15T18:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s not Kerbol, it\\\u0027s the sun.
