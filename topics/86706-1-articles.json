You want to decouple your missile at the same time you fire it off. To do this you need to have all of the appropriate engines in the same stage as your decoupler. Something else you can do is tweak the thrust on the back seprotrons so that your front ones are profiding more force, which will cause it to pitch down, instead of trying to push the whole thing clear all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T21:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there any video where I could check how to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried your advices but it don\u0027t seem I can do them right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T21:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022goldenpeach\u0022 data-cite=\u0022goldenpeach\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there any video where I could check how to do this?\u003Cp\u003EI tried your advices but it don\u0027t seem I can do them right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo tweak the thrust just right-click and slide the thrust limiter down.
