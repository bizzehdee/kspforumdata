So, I\u00B4ve built a quite heavy rocket, which gives me some near 12.000Dv to reach Jool and its moons and be able to land and return form there. The problem is that while in LKO, the rocket translates way too slowly, and it gets frustrating.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is the best way to make it more maneuverable?

They use (minimal amounts of) LF\u002BOx, so you don\u0027t need to add tanks, but they operate using RCS commands and they provide much more thrust than RCS thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing about Vernors is that they produce thrust only perpendicular to the surface, so some thought is needed if you need roll control (although if you have reaction wheels already, roll control might well be manageable as it is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027d put two rings of 4x symmetry at the top and bottom of your main stack to give good pitch\u002Byaw control, then maybe one on each side of your innermost pair of side stacks (assuming they\u0027ve been placed in pairs... if you\u0027ve used 8x symmetry, you\u0027ll be stuck with either placing them manually or placing one on each side of every booster, which would be overkill) for roll control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRotation will still be slow - normally for very big ships I deactivate SAS, press the desired direction for a few seconds then use physics warp to let it rotate slowly. As long as there is no control input or other forces on the ship, physics warp is fine even for huge ships. However, trying to use controls or SAS while on physics warp can destroy a large ship quite easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you really want to move it faster, use double rings of Vernors top and bottom...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T12:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbtw, just to be a stickler for terminology, \u0022translation\u0022 is sideways movement (which is absolutely impossible without RCS thrusters of some sort, whether standard monoprop ones or Vernors).

However (and this is vital for large rockets) they have weak joints so you do \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E want to put them where they\u0027ll weaken the structure.

They are often the right size (2.5m), and you ditch them when you stage and no longer have enough mass to justify their use. You only haul them for as long as you need them. 0.2 tons is nothing to a 100 ton radial throwaway booster but means a lot when attached to your final payload.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
