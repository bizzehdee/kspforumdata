I\u0027m planning on trying to make a base that would actually cover the hole and be able to drop a small craft to the bottom, conduct science and return to the base overhead. Main problem is i have no idea how bit it is and well if it\u0027s even possible to make something that big and survive a landing. any help would be appreciated? also has anyone ever attempted anything like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"turkwinif","CreatedById":84592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T02:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48006\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48006\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread should help a lot. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
