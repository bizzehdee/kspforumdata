The navball can be used for land nav, but it requires you to know what the heading to your target is. One way to use the navball to get a heading to target is to radially attach a small probe like this :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ev1ui6a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ev1ui6a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you want to go to that hill over there, control form the main pod, throttle up just enough to use q or e to rotate the craft until the little probe points in the direction you want to go then shut down the throttle and let the craft settle on the landing gear. Right click the little probe, control from here, and take note of the heading. Now, go back to the main pod, take off and get some altitude, then rotate the craft so that your engines will fire at the desired heading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the locked camera view will align your camera as you want, try that.

Map view only rotates across the 180 degree arc from north to south, so when looking at its primary, every celestial object is going to be moving from left to right if it\u0027s in the foreground, and from right to left if it\u0027s behind the primary. And as the old pros told me when I was a newbie, you should do most of your flying by the navball anyway, so visual perspective is nearly irrelevant. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I use the main camera view when I am within 20kms or so during docking, during the last few minutes of landings, and to take scenic screenshots, and that\u0027s about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T12:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe NavHUD mod might be useful?
