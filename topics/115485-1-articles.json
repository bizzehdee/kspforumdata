Thank you for the responses! I had just been using the \u0022guess and check\u0022 method for years and thought I would ask if there was a better way that never dawned on me.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T22:22:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tynrael**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:33:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am curious to see if anyone has a good technique or method to know (immediately) what their reference point is in the map view or third person camera view looking at their ship.\n\u003E What I mean for the map view is, is there an easy way to instantly know if you are looking at it from the top down, as opposed to bottom up?

I had a problem in the beta where when I used surface mode to center my retrograde marker in the top center of the navball it resulted in me still carrying horizontal speed and so I got used to going back to orbital mode to try and kill the horizontal speed so I didn\u0027t scrape/bounce across the surface. I have not tried sticking with surface mode when landing since the 1.0 release."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T19:16:48Z","Content":"It occurs to me that your orbits inclincation is going to play a big role here too, I generally try to stay pretty close to the equator."},{"CreatedByName":"Tynrael","CreatedById":144990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T19:41:28Z","Content":"I guess my problem is I don\u0027t immediately make the connection between my rocket, the navball, and where I want to go. Take this picture for example, if I want to fly over the hill in the direction of the blue arrow- I have no idea where to position myself on the navball to point that direction. I would lift off and gain some vertical speed and then tilt any direction and then swivel around on the navball until my rocket was finally pointing in that direction.\n\n![example.jpg](http://s7.postimg.org/f0zsoskd6/example.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T20:28:02Z","Content":"Land navigation and space navigation are similar but not the same. The navball can be used for land nav, but it requires you to know what the heading to your target is. One way to use the navball to get a heading to target is to radially attach a small probe like this :\n\n\u003E ![Ev1ui6a.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ev1ui6a.jpg)\n\nSo, if you want to go to that hill over there, control form the main pod, throttle up just enough to use q or e to rotate the craft until the little probe points in the direction you want to go then shut down the throttle and let the craft settle on the landing gear. Right click the little probe, control from here, and take note of the heading. Now, go back to the main pod, take off and get some altitude, then rotate the craft so that your engines will fire at the desired heading."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:20:26Z","Content":"I think the locked camera view will align your camera as you want, try that.

Map view only rotates across the 180 degree arc from north to south, so when looking at its primary, every celestial object is going to be moving from left to right if it\u0027s in the foreground, and from right to left if it\u0027s behind the primary. And as the old pros told me when I was a newbie, you should do most of your flying by the navball anyway, so visual perspective is nearly irrelevant. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I use the main camera view when I am within 20kms or so during docking, during the last few minutes of landings, and to take scenic screenshots, and that\u0027s about it."},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T12:16:31Z","Content":"The NavHUD mod might be useful?
