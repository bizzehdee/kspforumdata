Is it possible to have one scaled to the same size as the Soyuz ports? It need not be a separate part, just scaled so that it\u0027s the same diameter.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I made the GEN-DP-2P by scaling the 1P to 0.75 (it\u0027s very slightly large at 75%):\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Seems like it should be an option for the Russian station modules. I can work a bit on the exact scaling and follow up here if you are interested.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The stock docking ports are odd scale wise... The pass-through on standard docking ports is usually 80cm (Apollo was 81cm). Even if the structure around the port brings the outer diameter to 1m, that would make a kerbal scale port 0.64. So the smallest port is actually biggish (which is good given their heads). The 1.25, OTOH, is huge.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The new IBDM is 1.42m across (outer) with an 80cm passthrough.  The Common Berthing Mechanism outer diameter is about 2m, which to kerbal scale is 1.28---so the larger kerbal ports are CBMs.\n\u003E \n\nI really do not want to make a new size of part/port.  I\u0027ve talked about this in the past.  If/when stock supports 0.9375m parts/ports, sure.  Until then, sorry -- stock decided that the size was going to be 0.625m.\n\nThe problem with doing a new size of part... is then you need a crapload of -other new parts- of the same size to make them useful; new ratios for adapters, new tanks, engines, pods, heat-shields, cargo bays, etc.  Also it would be... painful... to retrofit the new ports onto existing parts (e.g. the SC-B would need a complete model rework in order to fit the larger port).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On Saturday, October 01, 2016 at 7:29 PM, falken said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E One thing I was wondering Shadowmage is if you have plans to ditch liquidfuel\u002Boxidiser for something else?

Notably I wrote a .DDS conversion utility that allows for specifying the output format on a per-texture basis.  DDS4KSP works great, but when batch-converting the only option is \u0027auto\u0027, which for some reason flags all PNGs to be converted to DXT5 regardless of if they actually have alpha or not (might be a GIMP problem with the exported .pngs), resulting in textures double the size they need to be (both on disk and in memory).  Either way, the tool has been written... which will make the texture export/conversion process a bit faster/smoother.\n\nAlso spent a bit of time looking into PartTools customization / re-implementation.  Really sick of having to run two different Unity versions (3 if you need emissive animation support) which don\u0027t play nicely next to eachother; also sick of PartTools not supporting .dds textures and lacking a \u0027don\u0027t export textures\u0027 option.  Would also be nice if they could support BlendShape animations....\n\nSadly the API for PartTools is non-existent, everything is set to private/internal modifiers and there is zero room for external interaction with the existing classes.  This leaves me needing to either 1.) Pray that SQUAD updates PartTools properly and in a timely manner, or 2.) Write my own custom model format exporter for the UnityEditor, and a custom loader for in KSP.  I highly doubt #1 will happen (at least in the short-term), and I really don\u0027t want to go with #2.  The third option is keeping the status-quo, which, frankly, is driving me crazy with the inconsistencies and workarounds needed for what should be simple operations (such as the need to create, assign, build, and manually copy an asset-bundle just to export a model with BlendShape animations, or the lack of emissive animation support since Unity 4.2.xxx).   (If anyone from SQUAD is reading... you could probably talk me into updating PartTools for you pretty easily...)\n\nStill mostly waiting on an updated ModuleManager before I can publish 1.2 testing releases.

Sadly they added those functions/modules long after I had already created a code \u0026 config defined emissive module.

KSP/Unity already supports loading models from AssetBundles (if a bit of an effort to actually do it...), and the only thing stopping me from using those on the Unity end is the absurdly painful export process -- the need to maintain a .prefab of whatever object from the scene I\u0027m trying to export and the asset-bundle building process.\n\nIs anyone aware of a method to make an AssetBundle directly from an object in a scene?   \n\nBarring that (which I don\u0027t think is directly workable) I\u0027ll likely create a script that does:  \n\n1.) Create a dummy .prefab of a GameObject from a scene into a temp directory.  \n\n2.) Tag that dummy .prefab for a temp/dummy AssetBundle.  \n\n3.) Builds that specific AssetBundle into a temp directory, renaming it to whatever was specified in the export script  \n\n4.) Copies the just-built bundle into the specified GameData/XXX/ directory  \n\n5.) Clean up the dummy prefab, asset bundle, and garbage files that Unity created while building the AssetBundle.  \n\n6.) The original game object still exists in the scene for further modification/re-export, and the newly-created asset-bundle has been copied to the KSP/GameData/XXX folder, ready for use.\n\nFrom there my existing loader code would take care of loading it in KSP, reassigning textures/materials (as they won\u0027t be in the bundle), and adding it to the KSP GameDatabase models list."},{"CreatedByName":"shizzak","CreatedById":159437,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-05T19:53:02Z","Content":"Once that parachute issue is fixed, I\u0027d like to make an Orion em-1 cinematic and would love to give your mod the credit it deserves.

Custom wheels are not a necessity more of a luxury  . So if possible could you please, pretty please keep the shuttle in 1.2 even if it doesn\u0027t have wheels.

Tthere are a few other/non-wheel problems with the parts that I haven\u0027t been able to fix as well; inertia tensor / moment of inertia (causes the roll instability), \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/module toggles that need to be re-hidden, \u0027control-from-here\u0027 transform for thrust-line, and the IVA went missing/corrupted at some point.  All of this stuff worked fine in 1.05, sadly each KSP update has broken those parts more and more.  I would like to at least get those problems fixed before I re-introduce the parts.  Most I already have an idea of what the solution will be and merely need the time to sit down an implement them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, mechanicH said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Looks like sarbian came out with another update.  2.7.1. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003E \n\nThanks, will update the distro to the newest before I do a 1.2 release  (likely sometime tomorrow afternoon/evening).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, StickyScissors said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) would it be possible to add an optional attatchment node to the top of fuel tanks that have nosecones on them?
