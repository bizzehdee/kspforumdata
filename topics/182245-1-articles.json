The new part variants are not working. I select a desired variant but once I launch the vessel, it is reversed to the original 1.4 variant. This also occurs if I save the vessel and then reopen it. The issue is only with variants added in the two newest updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The deltaV is not accurately displaying. I have certain stages that have more than 0 deltaV but the readout still tells me that the burn time and deltaV is 0. Some stages (which include engines and should have deltaV) do not even have a deltaV amount displaying (i.e. they appear the same as in version 1.4) Once I stage the rocket to the stages that show no deltaV or 0, the deltaV pops up showing the correct value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is appreciated.
