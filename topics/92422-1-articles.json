It saves SQUAD from having to debug problems they might not have caused, while still getting the problems out in the open for advice from other users and to see if lots of people are having the same problem, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that doesn\u0027t seem to be the way that subforum is being used in practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice a large number of the posts seem to be from people using it to get support for ONE mod that they already know is (or at least think is) having the problem. Rather than people thinking \u0022I installed a bunch of mods - I started having this weird problem - I wonder what\u0027s causing it?\u0022, it seems to be being used by people thinking \u0022I already know this is a problem with mod XYZ, but I\u0027ll post about it here instead of in the thread that\u0027s specific to mod XYZ.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s a bit annoying to me, because it now means if I want to keep on top of problems occurring in a mod I help develop, I have to read through ALL the threads in that entire subforum, the vast majority of which are about other mods, to find the few here and there that might be about the mod I\u0027m checking for. In the past, reading through just the one thread in the \u0022showcase\u0022 or the \u0022development\u0022 (depending on the state of the mod\u0027s release) about the ONE mod was good enough to see all the user support reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a few occasions I\u0027ve found posts about a mod I\u0027m helping develop in the \u0022support modded installs\u0022 subforum only a week or two after they were written, and only accidentally via a google search that turned them up when I was looking for something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d like a clarification on this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you *already* know the exact mod you\u0027re trying to get support for, should that support request go in that mod\u0027s own thread, rather than in the generic \u0022support modded installs\u0022 subforum?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T11:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s something that in my opinion comes down to the individual posting the thread. As annoying as it may be to have to check two forums I\u0027d say that the modded install support forum is more suited for support requests than a mod release thread which I think would be home to discussions about that mod instead of support requests. That said I do understand it\u0027s easier to have all support requests in one thread. There\u0027s no perfect solution I think, we\u0027re already busy moving threads as it is and even introduced warnings when posting in support that people need to read the sticky threads.
