Need to launch a new ship with the replacement part is fine (actually this is what I want). I just have KAS but haven\u0027t played with it - is it capable of removing the bad panel and attach a new one?"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T07:01:11Z","Content":"Stock engineers can, they just need a certain skill level."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T07:09:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Stock engineers can, they just need a certain skill level.\n\nI\u0027m talking about solar panels, not chutes/landing gears/rover wheels.
