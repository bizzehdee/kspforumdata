I decided I wanted something a little more robust while keeping it simple. This little ion-powered ship is \u0027fast\u0027 and has a long enough range to round-trip duna solo. Includes a little space shack to house your kerbal when he\u0027s not out riding around, and to allow him to dock and refuel.

Your kerbal is glitched and leaning to the side in the seat.

The RCS is balanced just about perfectly in the VAB but because of the size of the ship and the fuel tanks not being at dead center, the balance will go off a bit when fuel level is low or depleted.

I ended up having to abandon my early dock designs because of it, so my new dock has the ports right at the very edge of a beam, and I dock facing the edge so the generator has lots of room. That said in my experience when the generator does hit something, it\u0027s usually the spacebike that explodes, not the station... might need to check that you didn\u0027t have clipping enabled when you assembled the station dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScottyDoesKnow","CreatedById":70796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T21:24:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard something about disabling clipping before, but didn\u0027t see anything in the keybindings.
