We are doing the best we can to resolve this issue, but this is a difficult and time consuming process. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022mso-ansi-language:EN-US\u0022\u003EUnfortunately we didn\u2019t spot those issues during the internal QA, external QA and certification QA. But, as soon as we knew about them, we began following the bug reports on the tracker, the forum, reddit and support email. This has allowed us to reproduce and isolate the problem, and we have been working closely with Flying Tiger Entertainment on a patch for both consoles. We have been doing internal and external testing of the patches for the last 2 weeks and preparing them for certification. Unfortunately we can\u2019t announce any release date yet as we have to finish the QA process to submit the patch for certification.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\u0022MsoNormal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022mso-ansi-language:EN-US\u0022\u003EWe regret that we can not give you a date for the release, but be sure we are doing all we can to keep our players satisfied.
