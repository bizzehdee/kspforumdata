At first I placed the cab centered high, then realized that was making things too complex for Kerbals to get in and out of it. So I placed it on the left close to the ground. Still had to get ladders up and over the truss and all, but it\u0027s much better than the alternative. IVA views from inside the cab are very interesting, especially as you\u0027re moving. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes and tips: When you first launch it, the Eagle underneath will STREEEEEEETCH the docking port to its limit. You may see the docking port several meters apart or see them joined, but be suspended seemingly on their own midway between the carrier and the Eagle, which will be almost touching the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t be alarmed by this! Just do the following: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaise and then lower the Eagle\u0027s landing gear to clear the \u0022runway bug\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen just go ahead and uncouple the docking ports. the Eagle will drop the short distance to the ground and be unharmed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom then on - you\u0027ll never have to use the docking port again. Ignore it. You\u0027ll be lifting and transporting the Eagle solely with the winches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 6 winches correspond neatly with the crossbeams on the top of the Eagle\u0027s truss. When placing the clamps with a Kerbal, put them there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWinch up a little bit at a time on each winch. And alternate front and back. For example - lift the front winch about 1 meter, then lift the rearmost winch about the same. Then the second forward one, then the second back, then the 3rd forward, then the 3rd back. Until all are about the same length winched up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWash, rinse, repeat until the Eagle (or whatever your payload might be) clears the ground by about 2 meters or so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you\u0027re ready to drive anywhere you need to. Go a bit easy. The payload does sway some. But you can probably get it up to about 20 Meters per second on a flat straightaway. That\u0027s what I got up to on the runway. YMMV on other types of terrain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest part? This thing is so big and huge, I bet you could use it to transport a bunch of other things aside from the Eagle as well. I think the PX shuttle would be too big for it, sadly, but I think the Cheyanne Dropship might fit under there when it\u0027s all folded up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with 8 Motorized all wheel drive, the thing is just SOLID and moves smoothly and with authority. Might make a good rover for carting around large sections of base stations on another planet if you can get it there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need the LLL, B9, and DSM packs. I also used KAS of course and struts from the R4 Boat parts pack. But if you want to, I bet you could recreate this with the standard stock struts. I was just overbuilding it, really. I\u0027m also thinking I could design another carrier along the same lines as this one but made mostly from stock parts (aside from KAS of course). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair warning. With both it and the Eagle in proximity the part counts do slow the Framerate some. I may try stripping this beast down some and see how much I can remove and still maintain integrity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s the craft file if you want to try it out: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?pmni412wghildac\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEagle Carrier\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - WHO DA MAN? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-03T06:50:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2013 06:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Logan.Darklighter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T06:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, next a carrier for Saturn-V....

IOW, they\u0027re not actually providing any stability. I\u0027ll see if I can do a fix the same way with these that I did for the Eagle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Setting up action groups for the rotating engines separately for the front and back engines is a good idea. The front engines have a tendency to damage the wings over time if set in the standard locked position. I\u0027d recommend just using them for VTOL/STOL work and for braking maneuvers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The air-brakes seem to have a mysterious tendency to break for no reason whatsoever. At first it did it in conjunction with the above issue with the front engines and the air-brake exploded.

Been made aware over on the Lackluster thread that the docking pieces I use to attach the pods to the Eagle are what\u0027s causing some pretty severe lag. It\u0027s a known issue and he\u0027s already got a new part release for it. So I\u0027ll be modifying the craft files and re-uploading them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also got a new tweak to the Eagle Transport crane. I noticed it was slightly off balance because it had the cab (the B9 \u0022overhang\u0022 cockpit) on the left front corner and no corresponding weights on the other 3 corners to balance it. It\u0027s heavy enough already so it was not really effecting performance at low speeds or under a carry load, but my occasional OCD wouldn\u0027t leave me in peace until I corrected it. I took the opportunity to make a version of it that does not already have an Eagle attached so you don\u0027t have to launch it and then get rid of the Eagle to use it for other things. (Or use it if you don\u0027t want to install the Eagle mod). And also got rid of an unnecessary hull piece on the top. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Ultimately I intend to design a version that uses as close to stock parts as possible. It\u0027s so useful as a tool I don\u0027t want it to be limited by the amount of mods it\u0027s necessary to have in order to load it. I\u0027d love it if I could make a version work that ONLY requires the KAS winch system.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that\u0027ll get done by this weekend. Right now though, I\u0027m kinda stuck in the middle of a hard disk crisis. Windows is saying my hard disk is having problems. And insisting that I do a full back-up and shutdown. I suspect it\u0027s not physically damaged - that it\u0027s not actually a hardware issue - because there\u0027s no bad sounds or anything coming from the unit AND it\u0027s steadily making a copy of my files without hiccup to my terrabyte drive with no complaints. AND because I\u0027m able to make this post and netsurf on the machine even now as it\u0027s making the back-up. I think I just need to run a disk check and repair routine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that one of the causes of this crisis is ironically all the stuff I\u0027ve been doing on KSP. With a lot of mods in place, the damn thing takes up over 3.5 GIGS of RAM in active use. That\u0027s a LOT of activity on the swap files portion of the hard disc. And It -has- been perhaps a bit too long since I did a full defrag. I always wind up putting that crap off too long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that this is taking ****ING FOREVER. I\u0027m already 12 HOURS into the back-up copy and STILL not done. I knew I had a metric butt-load of stuff on my drive, but GEEZ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s the checkdisk that I\u0027ll likely have to run when this is all done and I know THAT\u0027LL take the better part of a day itself since I\u0027ve had to do that before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah. Gonna be kinda stuck until that all finishes.
