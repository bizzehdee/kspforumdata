But I\u0027d like to develop parts that meet the in-game standards, specifically the aircraft fuselages for now. So are there example or blank MK1 (or is that just a 1.25m circle?), MK2, etc fuselage models that I can start with so I can make sure the ends of my parts conform to these standards? I\u0027ve tried searching the forum, and I\u0027ve read all the tutorials, and have got the basics down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start, I want to make a MK2 fuselage that contains intakes near the front (off to the sides, so as not to interfere with cockpit mounting), and square wing mounting points near the top of the middle of the fuselage, so those pesky wing edges aren\u0027t showing. Possibly want to expand this idea into wings with dedicated landing gear mounting points as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T04:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have Blender, check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43513-Blender-mu-import-export-addon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etaniwha\u0027s .mu import/export add-on\u003C/a\u003E - you can use it to examine how stock parts are modelled.
