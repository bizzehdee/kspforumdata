So I crash a lot of planes Into the ground but the guy lives. And so do I have a machine that can collect trash. I was thinking if you could take some debris and dump it into a pile and a level 5 engineer could make something. You could press a button and go into an editor type thing on another planet and you could plan a thing that needs to be built and then the engineer, over time will build the thing you asked him to. And also I\u0027d love a way to throw a parts into a machine that runs them into ore and a machine that makes parts from ore. I think this will add a whole new level to training up your engineers and add a whole new level of fun into making a base.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T22:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would be happy if KIS ans KAS became stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
