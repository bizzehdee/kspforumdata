Try to design your fuel distribution in a \u0022tree\u0022 fashion - no matter where you start, you can\u0027t get back to your starting position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you\u0027ve also got the central tanks sandwiched between two quad adapters - because of the way the part assembly system works, only one of the second quad-adapter\u0027s four nodes is guaranteed to connect. The other three probably won\u0027t. In your case, it looks like you got lucky and had two nodes connect. To solve this problem, you\u0027ll need to add a double layer of docking connectors between the second-placed quad-adapter and the fuel tanks above it.

You are drawling fuel out of the top set of tanks into the attached set of tanks, and then running it to the bottom tank, which is already pulling fuel from the upper tanks (Making the fuel lines unnecessary) If you want an even fuel distribution you could just run lines from the outer set of tanks to the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radioactivescrubs","CreatedById":90535,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T20:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a Tank under the Tristack adapter because the adapter doesn\u0027t allow cross feed. so the fuel goes from the center stack to the external tanks then to the lower tank and then the thruster underneath it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T20:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETanks don\u0027t pull fuel and fuel lines don\u0027t pump any fuel. It\u0027s engines what draws the fuel from accessible tank(s) using set of rules over stacks of tanks and fuel pipes. And yes, having loops in the structure is a recipe for disaster unless you really know what you are doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo understand what is happening, we need to see not only where tanks and fuel lines are but also where engines are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this particular case though, I believe the problem is in the upside down tricoupler because it only allows the fuel to go in one direction - from the single port to the three ports - and it is most likely really attached to only one of the three tanks above it, because I can see another tricoupler above the structure. That one tank then is the one with problems. Note that in this game you cannot design ships which \u0022branch out\u0022 (tricoupler above three tanks) and then join branches again (tricoupler below). If you try that, the game will attach the part only to one of the branches. The rest is just facing each other without a connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
