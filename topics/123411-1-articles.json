It is so wonderfully meta and compelling that you can easily read it in less than 8 hours. Beyond the incredible science fiction it is also is a highly emotional book, that through the satire and humor there are deep messages about life, love, and yes as cliched as it might sound the pursuit of happiness. I highly recommend this book and I am curious to see what the opinion of the community is about this novel. I wouldn\u0027t move it up on your book list and rush to read it, however it should definitely be added to everyones list. Especially people who are fans of science fiction, particularly all Star Trek, every iteration of the franchise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso please try to avoid spoilers. Use spoiler tags when discussing the major plot points of this book.
