My antivirus (just microsoft security essential) detected it and removing it every time it emerges, but still, even though I have removed all suspicious files and take the computer off the internet, it still emerge to be caught again by the antivirus from time to time, which means there is something else in here releasing them. I need some help going to the root of the problem and get rid of it. The guides I found from googling are dubious and ask me to install stuff, which I have once again painfully learned to distrust.\n\nAt least I can trust people here a little more. So, anyone got something for me to go with?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T06:23:12Z","Content":"Don\u0027t quote me on this, but you might run a scan on your computer for corrupted files.

You might also consider installing Windows from scratch after disinfecting, because you never know what damage any malware has done.

Second: When performing a Malwarebytes scan make sure you use a custom scan and tick ever box, this will give you a complete scan of your entre computer, threat scan will not do this, also check it\u0027s history folder and delete everything, otherwise it is still on your PC. Thirdly: Security essentials is a decent AV, not the best certainly, but good for a free AV.

Since I\u0027m a 20\u002B year IT Consultant, not only do I use Malwarebytes, I use Clamwin, and SuperAntiSpyware Portable to get rid of infected files.
