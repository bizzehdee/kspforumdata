That\u0027s the first time I hear about that particular concept. Very interesting, the performance numbers are quite decent. The paper with the development plan is from 2011, I wonder if they\u0027ve actually built one yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Okay, found a paper detailing a successful intitial test firing of the triple-channel NHT at 30 kW in Fall 2013. It mentions several future \u0022shakedown runs\u0022 as they slowly increase power before they will even start measuring performance data. So technically they built one, but it\u0027s not yet been operated at the target power and has not yet demonstrated that it actually produces the projected performance. Still, the initial test firing looked good, and I wish the team much success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, such a thruster doesn\u0027t really bring down the power required per N of thrust (and thus the mass of power generation and processing), but it does handily keep it from going up as higher power and thrust ratings are built. That\u0027s definitely a start, moving high power electric propulsion from \u0022infeasible\u0022 to \u0022inconvenient but feasible\u0022. I have a feeling NASA is pushing for this one, as their Asteroid Redirect Mission outline calls for a hall thruster powered capture vehicle with around 3000 Isp... which seems to fit the projected full-thrust performance of the X3 NHT in an uncanny manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe if that works out for them, the ARM mission could validate this kind of technology for future Mars travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-22T09:18:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2014 09:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
