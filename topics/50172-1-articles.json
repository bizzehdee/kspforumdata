I would know all this if I had gone into astrophysics, but I have already chosen my path (Automatition, electrical engineer... bachelor later maybe...?), although I have been interested in these things all my life. Maybe I\u0027ll be able to take a major in astrophysics afterall...

To get the notation consistent, you know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev\u003Csub\u003Ec\u003C/sub\u003E = Sqrt(GM/r\u003Csub\u003Ec\u003C/sub\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere v\u003Csub\u003Ec\u003C/sub\u003E is velocity of circular orbit, GM is gravitational parameter (Mass times gravitational constant), and r\u003Csub\u003Ec\u003C/sub\u003E is radius of circular orbit, which is planet\u0027s orbit \u002B orbit\u0027s height. So lets say that instead you have an orbit with two different heights, yielding r\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E as the apoapsis distance and r\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E for periapsis. Just like circular orbit, that\u0027s planet\u0027s radius \u002B corresponding height. In that case, the two velocities are given by the following.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E = Sqrt(r\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E/r\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E) * Sqrt(GM/a)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E = Sqrt(r\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E/r\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E) * Sqrt(GM/a)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere a is the semimajor axis, a = (r\u003Csub\u003Ea\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B r\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E)/2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing these, you should be able to compute Hohmann transfer, which is elliptical orbit connecting two other orbits (often circular ones). So you can do the math, for example, on how much fuel it will take to transfer from Kerbin\u0027s orbit to Duna\u0027s. These tend to work pretty close in the real world too. They aren\u0027t exactly right, unfortunately, but any reasonable approximation can be made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more useful thing to know is how much delta-V you need to go from surface to a low orbit. Since potential energy change is usually minimal, as a rough estimate, you can simply use velocity of circular orbit when there is no atmosphere. You\u0027ll need just a touch more to fight gravity, so have some reserves. If, however, there is atmosphere, you need one more formula to estimate extra velocity required to fight through it. This assumes that thrust of your engines is about 2x the weight of your ship. This is what you need to ascent at terminal velocity and what you should be aiming for. The extra delta-V is given by this formula.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev = 4gH / v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, g is surface gravity, H is scale height, and v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E is the terminal velocity at whatever altitude you are taking off from. For planets in KSP, all 3 of these are available for every planet in the system. For real world applications, you have to be able to estimate v\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E, which will be very different for different rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis last one is for very rough estimates. So keep it in mind if you are going to use it in KSP to estimate fuel needed on a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoheli","CreatedById":47640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T06:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just gonna leave this here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncludes examples of calculations if you follow the links!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
