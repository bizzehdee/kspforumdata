To accomplish this, many hours have been spent between missions designing the *Kidonia*, the largest interplanetary mothership ever constructed both in this incarnation of the space program and in my history of playing KSP.\n\n*Kidonia* is so named as a homage to \u0022Sidonia,\u0022 the titular spacecraft of the manga and anime series *Knights of Sidonia* (get the thread title now? xD), with which it shares some design elements and the trait of being really big.\n\nThe ship is planned to be constructed in Kerbin orbit out of two major sections and a number of smaller modules. First to be launched is the largest and most expensive, the \u0022core section,\u0022 which contains the ship\u0027s central probe core, primary fuel reserve, secondary cargo bay array, and main solar array.\n\n[![rTz3bQqm.png](http://i.imgur.com/rTz3bQqm.png)](http://imgur.com/rTz3bQq.png)\n\nThe core section nearly crushed the launch pad under its incredible bulk, in excess of 1100 tons, but was just barely able to lift itself clear of the launch clamps and proceed into orbit:\n\n[![XCjiPtPm.png](http://i.imgur.com/XCjiPtPm.png)](http://imgur.com/XCjiPtP.png) [![OnNjPP5m.png](http://i.imgur.com/OnNjPP5m.png)](http://imgur.com/OnNjPP5.png)\n\nOrbit was achieved with a very slim fuel margin. I had originally intended to park the core section in a 70x70km orbit and later move it to a higher 320km orbit for most of the construction, but aerodynamic issues caused by the large decorative wings and the hollow cargo bays forced me into a steeper than ideal ascent, and I decided to push my apoapsis a little higher to provide a bit of a safety buffer. I ended up cutting it pretty close, but just managed to circularize at 80km with only a few hundred units of fuel left.\n\nP.S. Thanks to Geschosskopf for posting so soon so I could make a second post without it auto-merging with the first one ^^; To answer your question, they\u0027re mainly decorative, but do contain a bit of extra fuel and allow oddly-shaped companion ships to dock without colliding with the main hull, as will likely be illustrated later on. I also imagine them serving as some kind of heat sink.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T03:01:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 03:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T04:20:35Z","Content":"Good lord."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T05:11:28Z","Content":"Kool ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Good lord.\n\nThat too"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T19:50:33Z","Content":"Thanks for the praise ^^; And if you think this is big, wait till you hear this: that\u0027s only the back half of the ship.

Thus for obvious reasons I\u0027m not going to pollute this album with documentation of every single one of those repetitive missions.\n\nThe typical profile for the missions so far (currently five have been completed and five more are in progress) is simple: the launch vehicle brings the tanker to orbit; the tanker separates and sets a rendezvous course with Kidonia; then, while the tanker is en route, the launch vehicle returns to Kerbin and is recovered. While the launch configuration costs nearly 200,000 funds, with a recovery near KSC the net mission cost is closer to 7,000 for each run - essentially just the fuel costs (disclaimer: my math may be wrong). 25 such missions should end up costing a total of around 200,000 funds, just barely within my space program\u0027s current budget.\n\n[![3oLO1iYl.png](http://i.imgur.com/3oLO1iYl.png)](http://imgur.com/3oLO1iY.png)\n\nHere the launch vehicle is pictured returning to Kerbin after dropping off a fuel tanker.

In case you didn\u0027t know, a Gigantor at Jool only produces about 0.9 EC/sec with 100% exposure and the smaller panels hardly register as working at all. The mothership obviously needs a lot of juice for all its reaction wheels and appears to have a lot of battery capacity for that, but I\u0027m worried the main solar array won\u0027t be enough to recharge it between maneuvers, several of which have to happen in fairly rapid succession when the ship is capturing upon arrival. Also, the ion probes seem to rely exclusively on OX-STATs, which are essentially worthless at Jool.

Unfortunately the Jool transfer window is pretty much here already and I still haven\u0027t unlocked RTGs. I\u0027d use fuel cells, but their nature of consuming my precious rocket fuel deters me from them (in fact I\u0027ve never used one even once). Using HyperEdit, I have run some tests verifying that while the solar panels perform poorly, the stackable ion probe is able to power and (slowly) recharge itself, and the Ore Bot is unable to run its drills continuously at full power but can still gradually mine ore over time. And no, I\u0027m not technically a professional but that\u0027s just because I\u0027m still in school. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nYou really should try fuel cells. I also was a bit scared of their LFO consumption but after playing wth them a bit, I\u0027ve fallen in love with the things. Their fuel consumption is so small as to be unnoticeable. Seriously, they just sip fuel and unless you\u0027re using them to power a rover or something, you don\u0027t need them on all the time anyway, just for when you need a quick battery recharge. I find them even less parasitic than Vernor engines ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)."}]}
