My name is Jan (or Jannibal of course)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m 21 y/o and a technical physics student at the Hague University of applied sciences. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing the demo for a few weeks and decided to buy the game about a week ago. Since then I\u0027ve managed to get a space station in orbit, several astronauts on minmus and a small base on the mun. I even managed to (crash) land a small satellite on Eve! So I believe i\u0027ve got the basics covered. Currently I\u0027m trying to turn that space station in to a refueling station for manned flights towards other planets, though I haven\u0027t figured out yet how to transfer fuel from one ship (station) to another\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T04:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo transfer fuel, right click on one tank, then hold alt while right clicking on another tank.
