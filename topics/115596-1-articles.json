They come off and start to float when there\u0027s too much weight on them and it doesn\u0027t look right at all.\n\nInstead I propose landing struts dampener being oriented perpendicularly (~90 degrees) to the ground, or have the dampening piston and the hinge as separate pieces connected by one point.\n\na few more and less random examples of what it should look like:\n\n\u003E ![landing%20leg00%20(13).jpg](http://www.capus.co.uk/uploads/images/landing%20leg00%20(13).jpg)\n\u003E ![nosegear.jpg](http://www.ez.org/feature/F0412-1/fran/nosegear.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![B5LZYrdCQAAAJeR.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B5LZYrdCQAAAJeR.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![design_2012_2.jpg](http://www.russianspaceweb.com/images/spacecraft/manned/ptk_np/va/landing_gear/design_2012_2.jpg)\n\nI don\u0027t know if the physics engine supports such things right now, but I hope it will once U5 comes out. If that\u0027s the case I would really like to see that change.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T23:30:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 11:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"}]}
