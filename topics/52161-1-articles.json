I appreciate the upper atmosphere, orbital experiments and EVA reports above the various biomes. On the flip side, surface EVA reports and samples from some beach on Kerbin? That doesn\u0027t seem in the spirit of a space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemoricus","CreatedById":4141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T01:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think being able to do those is fine. The amount of science you can get is absolutely paltry compared to missions to the Mun, Minmus, and beyond, and their sole purpose is really to give new players a little boost in unlocking the first few sets of nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudester28","CreatedById":61717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T01:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mind all the experiments in Kerbin. They only help. If you want you could simply ignore doing science within the atmosphere of kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that bothers me with career mode is how it appears to be turning away newcomers. By lacking a tutorial, new players seem to have a little trouble figuring out how to perform early science with what little they are provided. I have observed multiple examples of this in sections of the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Force21","CreatedById":14852,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T01:39:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, the science progression is supposed to be the tutorial. The devs said it\u0027s not the main event of career mode because career is nowhere near finished yet. Science is only the first step in career, and if you can get through it in only a few flights then good for you. I\u0027m currently challenging myself to not transmit any data at all except for crew reports because they have 100% transmission value. Doing this self challenge causes all the science on Kerbin to become very necessary to get to better like nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlamedSteak","CreatedById":67223,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T01:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s fine, it encourages exploration of the most interesting planet.
