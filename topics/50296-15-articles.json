I have the following problem: Deadly Reentry is too deadly for m! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E Whether I come in to the atmosphere of Kerbin with only a MkI capsule and a heatshield or with some science stuff attached, I always explode.. (And yes I am pointing my shield to \u0027the flames\u0027.). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI come in from a 100-120km orbit with a periapsis of about 22-30km. Scott Manley did this in his latest video series as well, and he managed to \u0022not explode\u0022.. Still, when I reach around 25-30 km altitude (about 2000 m orbital velocity) my shield overheats and blows up. The temperature is about 1000 degrees Celsius then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question: Am I doing something wrong (angle or something like that) or I the mod somehow set wrong in my game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I am doing something wrong, can you then suggest me what to do to make it work? I really like a challenge, but this I cannot do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razorcane","CreatedById":66919,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T17:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENathan, did you ever figure out how to turn off re-entry effects when ascending into orbit?

Heating depends on velocity and atmospheric density, not direction of travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution is simple - don\u0027t go that fast low in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
