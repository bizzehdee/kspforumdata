If you imagine just tilting the entire SOI of a planet or moon, just tilt all orbiting ships along with it. In that case, the only problem is that now, getting to and from those places isn\u0027t the same so ships en-route may need correction burns that you weren\u0027t expecting (and possibly don\u0027t have the fuel for).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T23:15:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LostOblivion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LostOblivion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m hyped for the fact that they\u0027re looking into axial tilt on planets, but am curious as to how they\u0027ll do it for existing saves.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t get the impression that they were actively looking into it, it sounded more like they had looked into it and ran into too many problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T23:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Norpo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Norpo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think they were referring more to the (rather pointed) end of it, as opposed to the transitions in the actual fairing.
