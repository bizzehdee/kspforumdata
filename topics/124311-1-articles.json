Nothing ever goes wrong. I was thinking if there could be snowstorms and hurricanes and tornadoes and thunderstormsthat can pose a threat. Like the snow makes driving a rover hard. And the thunderstorm takes out a random part every so often. And the Hurricanes can throw stuff off course. And why don\u0027t I do the circumnavigation challenges? Because nothing ever goes wrong. And having a level 3 tracking station can keep track of these storms. This will add a whole new level of interest and challenge to Ksp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T21:43:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to have it, but it\u0027s on the WNTS list, so I\u0027m pretty sure SQUAD knows that wpeople want it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T21:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWeather is on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not To Suggest list\u003C/a\u003E due to repetitive suggestions.
