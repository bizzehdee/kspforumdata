The episde link is provided below and provides about 2 hours of test data showing different configs it was tested in. Oddly, the configuration worked once, normally in a engineering sandbox mode, and then crashed again when almost the same exact vehicle was reloaded and the same modifications were made in career mode. All parts were rigorously tested to confirm it was not a part issue of any sort whether stock or mod as they would all load to the pad independently just fine it was just when they were brought together in a fairing in a particular combination that this very serious crash style occurred.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect it has something to with fairing / engine interactions with colliders but even inverted the error still occurred. Submitting error reports generated by the game as well as a twitch tv link to the video where I attempted to diagnose the cause myself. I also suspect it may have something to do with the game thinking the craft is somewhere else for some bizarre reason other than the launch pad because it always switches scenes to space wtih 0 coms though still showing the stages on the left as if it never left the pad. The interaction is with KSP Intersetellar Extended Candle engines, but could conceivably happen with others though I ran out of time to test that theory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the logs, the save files associated with the repeated testing CTDs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/qebzscrjgn1bvmn/05092017errorlogs.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/qebzscrjgn1bvmn/05092017errorlogs.zip?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the video on Twitch TV that contains the troubleshooting effort. It starts around 2:15 to 2:30 and runs until the end about 4:30, a full 2 hours of rigorously attempting to identify and troubleshoot the problem. Inverting the payload in the fairing hangar also did not solve the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.twitch.tv/videos/141246182\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/141246182\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft file causing the CTD:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ywx2gx5uub7bgd/Micro%20Probe%202.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7ywx2gx5uub7bgd/Micro Probe 2.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nupdate: An even more bizarre complication has arisen, this craft can be launched in sandbox, it only crashes in career. Repeatedly tested in career, with and without the decoupler, with and without the fairing, with and without it being at the bottom of the inter-staging rack. Unbelievably odd. It has to do something with the name and perhaps the initial game crash? Going to destroy the craft in this particular save, rebuild it from scratch, rename it and see what happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRebuilt it exact to spec under a new name, still crashes in career only, new name Mun Micro Probe 2. The original craft that it was based on is also crashing. We\u0027re making progress in narrowing down cause. Updating title. Suspect previous deletion of a probe in space did not complete properly in the tracking center corrupting the save and possibly making it so that all probe cores of the same type launched now register at a random point in space rather than at launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeft the name unchanged, stripped down to probe core, launched. Stable with just Hecs core, went back reloaded primary craft file so that once again all parts were present, launched, ctd. Something is broken on the payload, still working out what. This craft launched before with no problem, something has changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemoved all parts from corrupted craft that were mod-based and only utilized its stock part elements, the craft deployed without crash. Adding back the navigatin light and launching, then adding back the candle engines and launching, will update again momentarily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavlights confirmed good. No crash. Re-add candle engines.. no crash? Craft is mysteriously stable again as a whole after re-add of parts. Possible issue with saved crafts from between KSP IE updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemoved and re-added candle engines to the full payload/delivery booster assembly and still crashing, so re-adding the engines does not always fix whatever is underlying this. Debugger menu will not open when the view is changed to space prior to ctd and funds are wiped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crash dumps are indicating some form of bizarre memory access error. Putting ksp into admin mode.\u00A0But why only affecting this particular craft file and why only career?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft loaded without crash\u00A0after 3 way coupler removed, landing gear, candle engines, and the nav lights were removed. Adding back only sm-3 mount and putting on the fairing rack and reloading. Still stable. Adding landing LT-1 gear back\u00A0to the sm-3 mount, retracted as before. Normal launch. Adding back candle engines. Normal Launch? Adding back nav light. Normal launch!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConclusion: KSP not running in admin mode was causing a random failure to access some part of the craft file for reasons that are unexplained as all the parts in this build have been utilized before. This began after the recent ksp ie mod update, so uncertain if\u00A0interaction has been caused by updates. Solution: Run KSP in admin mode, this was not a part or apparent staging/physics error. Why it has chosen to randomly manifest a memory access error now remains\u00A0undetermined, but launch is able to progress without error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-10T14:38:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2017 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Maelstrom Vortex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maelstrom Vortex","CreatedById":111435,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T22:46:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you get a problem like this, try running in admin mode, should resolve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
