This was mainly due to getting distracted by other things to do in KSP, and always wanting to develop my space programme in a \u0022realistic\u0022 progression, usually for this to end at a KSP update. So I felt it time that I skipped the faffing about with small rockets launching satellites and probes and tried more ambitious projects. I\u0027m hoping for there to be a series of these \u0022projects\u0022.\n\nFirst up I present the Selene 1 mission.  \n\nThis was a manned mission to and from the Moon, the first time I had tried such a thing in RO. I created the craft by \u0022simulating\u0022 (read: using hyperedit) the various aspects and then building and running the mission from start to finish. Not a perfect mission, but I managed to get 3 little green men with large heads all the way to the moon and back, 2 of them even landed.\n\nI tried to avoid making an Apollo replica, but form follows function so there are similarities. I also wasn\u0027t particularly worried about what combinations of hardware I used, as long as it did the job. I also used Chinese colours and the ESA flag just because I could. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It had some (non-fatal) flaws as described in the pictures, but did the job. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

So far, so good.

I don\u0027t have shots of the actual landing as I managed to crash into the Moon due to not paying attention and then quick-saved instead of quick-loading... As it takes ages to launch the craft on shiny graphics settings (for the pix) I wasn\u0027t exactly enthusiastic to try again. At that point anyway there was enough DV to return from the moon in the (shorter than Selene 1) LOTV and the LMV was identical to before, so I feel I can safely assume it would have made it back. As you can see from the pictures I had better separation events, which for me was a major goal of this mission.\n\nSelene 2 had a shorter LOTV section than Selene 1, therefore slightly shorter launch stages, and made it to LEO much more comfortably than Selene 1 did.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

So first up was the Alator 1 probe, which had the simple task of reaching orbit around Mars. It managed this, but not as well as I would have liked. Therefore the Alator 2 probe is already in the works.\n\nPictures:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
