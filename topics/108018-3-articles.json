Many parts like size 3 radial decouplers/probe-core/SAS etc are still missing. The KSC buildings are still somewhat ackwardly plopped onto/sticking out of the ground, missing proper transitions. This may seem like fluff, and I would agree, if we were still in early access and working up to implement all features, but for 1.0 where \u0022KSP is finally ready to be viewed by all as a complete game \u0022 some polish is needed. The Career/Science Tree, imo, seems to need a balancing/playtesting pass to avoid overt grinding and inter-level dependencies (especially at the 90 science level where the player is between orbit and moon landing and size 2 engines, structural parts and tanks are each in different parrallel nodes) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR : I think many players are looking for an acknowledgment (no apology, finger pointing or anything, just acknowledgment) from SQUAD that 1.0 was rushed/not polished enough, so that a discussion can be had with the community about how to fix it and avoid these problems in the features\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T12:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022-RanZ-\u0022 data-cite=\u0022-RanZ-\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think the launch was that bad... and I bet money it was not Harvester and the devs that wanted to launch this soon, I am guessing it was his management at Squad that wanted the game out so THEY rushed them to get the \u0022complete\u0022 game out to make more money.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope, please not more pseudo economical analysis.
