As far as I got it, the antenna range is determined by \u0026lt;Range\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;HighestPower\u0026gt; \u00D7 (\u0026lt;Sum of all Antenna Powers\u0026gt; / \u0026lt;HighestPower\u0026gt;)**0.75 In other words - if you have a vessel with a certain range R, then doubling the antenna(e) will increase your range to 1.682\u00D7R.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe communication range of any two given sets if antennae is given by ComRange = (\u0026lt;Range1\u0026gt; \u00D7 \u0026lt;Range2\u0026gt;)**0.5 - or in plain English: Two identical sets of antennae have a ComRange which equals the Range of a single set. If you increase the range of one set by a factor of 1.682 (i.e. you double the amount of antennae on one vessel) your ComRange increases by a factor of 1.297. If you double the antennae on both craft your ComRange increases by a factor of 1.682, obviously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tricky part, however, is signal quality Q which is described by\u00A0 Q = (3-2\u00D7(1-\u0026lt;relative Range\u0026gt;))\u00D7(1-\u0026lt;relative Range\u0026gt;)**2, where relative range equals \u0026lt;relative Range\u0026gt; = \u0026lt;vessel distance\u0026gt; / \u0026lt;ComRange\u0026gt; or in plain English, the relative range is the fraction of the possible communication range. Now, no matter what you do, at 50% of your possible ComRange you obtain a signal quality of 50%. The function, however, is not linear, meaning at 25% of the range you still achieve 84% while 75% send you down to 16%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe obtained that doubling your antennae on one and both vessels will get you a 1.297 and 1.682 boost in ComRange, respectively. This means your relative range of the vessels decreases to 0.77 and 0.59, respectively if their real distance is not changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, assume you would build an additional satellite equiped with the same set of antenna configuration and place it half way in between the two spacecraft. Your real distance is cut to 50%, while the ComRange does not change. Your relative Range is at 50% of what it used to be. However, you now do have two connections on your way to Kerbin instead of just one. The total signal strength is the product of the signal strengthes of the two single connections. Assume your signal strength of the two connections would be 60% = 0.6. Then your overall signal strength would be 0.6 \u00D7 0.6 = 0.36 = 36%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how does that compare to the original signal strength without relay? Imagine you would operate at 50% of your ComRange and want to improve your signal strength which currently is 50%. You basically have three options: Double the number of antennae on Kerbin to increase your Signal strength to 66.9%. You could double the antennae on your satellite as well which gives you a 79% connection. Great. With one relay satellite in between you get 73.8%. So in this case it would be\u00A0 best if you increased (doubled) both ends of the connection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut say, what happens if you operate long distance at 75% of you range (signal at 16%)? Doubling the antennae on both ends gives you an increase to 58.6% while adding a relay in between gets you an amazing 73.6% of total signal strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a conclusion we can state that relays are superior to increasing the number of antennae on Kerbin, especially when operating over long relative distances. Especially as doubling the number of antennae on both craft gets exponentially tedious and lets the rocket equation kick in to make that endeavour ever more expensive a single vessel somewhere in space with a few dishes is the best choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-27T08:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the thing about putting a relay halfway between kerbin and your target is.... the rocket equation and orbital mechanics.

After matching orbits as closely as I could with the launcher\u0027s Rhino engine, I deployed the first sat at Duna AP\u00A0and made adjustments with their smaller engines. After following the launcher around to Duna AP again, I deployed the second sat and reduced its orbital period from 3.0 days (uncanny, huh?) to 2.0 days, which put it between Ike and the launcher, then reset the orbit at AP. I repeated these steps with the third sat, then crashed the launcher into Ike to appease it and hopefully discourage it from eating my sats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did further adjustments using Ike as my target and fixing up the\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DunaSynchOrbit.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.antiwindowscatalog.com/media/ksp/DunaSynchOrbit.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the end result.
