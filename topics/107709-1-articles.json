It\u0027s a command module part. I\u0027ve got it working in 1.0 and everything appears normal about it.\n\nThe part was created before EVA\u0027s were prevalent in KSP. I\u0027d like to add an EVA hatch to the part but I do not know how. I\u0027ve not done modeling with the programs KSP uses. I am decent with the basic part code (i.e. I can change parameters around without making weird stuff happen.)\n\nHow do I put an EVA hatch on a part that does not have one?"},{"CreatedByName":"shinler","CreatedById":147354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T19:40:16Z","Content":"idk thats my problem 2"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T17:13:15Z","Content":"After looking I believe it is something that you add in the Unity stage of part creation.
