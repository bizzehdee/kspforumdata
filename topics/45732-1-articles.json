The end result, as you can see, is an utterly ridiculous looking plane that works with FAR with a maximum payload of 20 tons to a 75x75 orbit. And yes, before you ask, the cargo detaches from the plane as if it were in a proper cargo bay (minus doors) thanks to the magic of SelectRoot. The action groups have been set up so you can turn the turbojets off in stages, starting from the ones on the sides, the top one, and finally the bottom one. It is advised that you don\u0027t start the rockets before reaching 1500 m/s. If you need to shorten the cargo bay for whatever reason, take off the rear I-beam and replace the front one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, some of you may be questioning what\u0027s with the \u0022Supper Guppy\u0022. As some may have noticed, I attempted to replicate the bloated hull look. Of course, the Super Guppy does not have a massive delta wing trailing behind it, but at least I got the cockpit position right. As for why it\u0027s Supper instead of Super, it was a typo that stuck since I thought it was funny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you feel like you want to use this, do note that an autopilot mod is highly recommended. It\u0027s perfectly flyable by hand, yes, but not comfortable at all thanks to the slow nature of the SAS. Once we get a hard lock SAS, flying this will be much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kola2DONO","CreatedById":77488,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T18:12:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice, looks a bit like the Airbus Beluga\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
