The resource flow is basically lob up a fission reactor with a supply of lithium attached. Breed tritium in the reactor, converting the lithium to tritium. Tritium will have a half-life of 12 years. If you attach a He3 tank to the vessel with a tritium tank on it, you\u0027ll eventually end up with some He3 over time as the tritium decays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can take this setup to the semi-extreme and build a large station with several large fission reactors and a large supply of lithium, tritium, and He3 canisters. If you do this soon enough in a KSP Interstellar career game, by the time you unlock fusion reactors, you\u0027ll have a large supply of tritium, and a steadily increasing supply of He3 (just to be clear He3 is available in the next patch of KSPI coming in a few days; not currently available in 0.8).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T20:15:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eadrom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eadrom","CreatedById":91728,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T20:36:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECouple questions!
