It wasn\u0027t very cost efficient and it wasn\u0027t so much reusable as it was refurbishable. To be fair a lot of overhead was added due to the dozens of groups with conflicting goals trying to get a piece of the action. There were a lot of requirements from different factions, such as the Air Force\u0027s insistence that it be able to launch spy satellites into a polar orbit from Vandenberg AFB. Because of this it ended up really having to pack a lot of complexity and capability into one machine on a budget and certain safety considerations ended up being thrown out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what it\u0027s worth, I think we would have been better off sticking to a Soyuz-like craft for carrying people to and from LEO. Existing Titan and Delta launchers could have been used to send up the big space station bits like the Russian Protons. This way we have a clear separation of mission roles and less complexity allowing for things to go wrong. After all there\u0027s no sense in taking a multi-tool to do a specific job when all we needed was a screwdriver. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also a big fan of Big Gemini and think that it might have been a good choice for crew and resupply missions to stations and even orbital construction yards, serving in a similar capacity as TKS for Salyut. It would have had that capability to carry 9 or 12 people depending on configuration and would be roughly the same mass as an Apollo capsule, but would carry twice the cargo to LEO. And this was without the proposed cylindrical cargo module, which would\u0027ve increased cargo capacity even further.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T21:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn all technicality, the program may not have lived up to what it was originally intended, and it may have been costly, but it was the space program I grew up with, and the Shuttles hold a special place with me.
