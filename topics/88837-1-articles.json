They don\u0027t add realism per se, but they do add tools which will help you overcome the extra problems that FAR will introduce (e.g. with hinges you can make your un-aerodynamic probes and rovers fold up a bit so\u0027s they can be tucked behind fairings, which are then more launch-able).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027ll be controversial, but \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220221-mechjeb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMech Jeb\u003C/a\u003E will help with planning trips to other bodies.

It\u0027s own proud boast is \u0022Totally useless, totally fun\u0022. As you also say, it adds so much to the feel of the game that it\u0027s pretty essential to me (makes it to No.8 on my list).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile FAR and DRE are good realism mods I think RT just solves a problem it introduces itself, LS mods too mainly. For probes I think SCANSat adds depth more without forcing complexity and the resizable fairings of Procedural Fairings are much more useful than the fixed KW ones (although I think FAR and PF are not playing nicely together yet in KSP 0.25). MJ and NRAP are important \u003Cem\u003Eto me\u003C/em\u003E but wouldn\u0027t be to most people, especially when they\u0027re starting. Conversely a docking-alignment mod - the one I list or Navyfish\u0027s original - NavUtils for runway landings and \u0027the IVA suite\u0027 add loads more really useful and important instruments, especially bringing flight from the cockpit (or probe control-room) to life. IVA\u0027s a bit like Chatterer to be honest; no-one needs it but it makes the game feel so much better. Finally in my list AGX and the Goodspeed pump are just conveniences that are probably more complicated than useful until you know you want them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest place to look for tutorials is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Drawing Board\u003C/a\u003E, My own tutorial will explain basic design but is designed for stock, not FAR/DRE and other realism mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sakai","CreatedById":93661,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T17:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only real problem is actually getting proper orbit.
