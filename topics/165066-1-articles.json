I have already created the .mu file, the texture, and the internal.cgf. At this moment, the internal.cfg, only has the lines to bring up the .mu mesh, onto which I would spawn the props and then write onto the .cgf, so my cfg currently looks like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EINTERNAL\n{\n\tname = Mk2ShortIVA\n\tMODEL\n\t{\n\t\tmodel = GenericInlineCockpits/Spaces/Mk2Short/Mk2ShortIVA\n\t}\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery time I click on the \u0022Spawn\u0022 button, I get an error that says \u0022Cannot create space\u0022.
