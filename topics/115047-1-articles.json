I placed a telescope in the correct orbit and completed those sections of the mission and it detected one asteroid. I then stopped playing the game. A few days later I came back and reopened the save and noticed the orbit line was still there and it said that the contract was not completed to the point where it was last time I played. I then clicked on the telescope craft and decided the take control of the craft at which point all I saw was a black screen with the hud showing nonsense (no altitude numbers, KER showing a low of NaNs). I then left to the space center where I got a view of the sky box that I could turn around with right click but no space center or anything else. The Hud was still intact(time warp, warp to morning, money/science/rep). I then left to main menu and when I reloaded my save I got the same result. I restated the program, opened my save, and everything was normal except the telescope ship was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, sorry if this has already been reported (I only looked through the first page)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T02:11:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 02:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ment18\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
