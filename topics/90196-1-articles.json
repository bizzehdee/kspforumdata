I don\u0027t have Hyperedit to tell you exactly what\u0027s in its .zip file but, essentially, all mods are unzipped to KSP\u0027s \u0022GameData\u0022 folder (I have no idea where steam hides that, presumably you do).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSUALLY (but not always) a mod has everything within a single folder inside its .zip (eg; the Goodspeed fuel pump mod, Goodspeed.zip, contains folder \u0022Goodspeed\u0022) and all you need to do is unzip that to KSP\\GameData. With no other mods you\u0027d then have KSP\\GameData\\Goodspeed (with the pump mod in it), KSP\\GameData\\NasaMission (with ARM stuff) and KSP\\GameData\\Squad (with most of the basic game things).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes a mod\u0027s .zip includes its own \u0027GameData\u0027 (eg; Chatterer.zip contains a GameData folder, which contains a Chatterer folder). You can either unzip the whole thing to KSP\u0027s main folder or just unzip the \u0027inner\u0027 Chatterer to KSP\\GameData. Either way you add KSP\\GameData\\Chatterer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T18:20:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes it does.
