Also you say their megaton stuff about X wings or capital ships if it\u0027s Xwing your wrong. Your wrong because Like saying if Apollo Craft hit the moon a nuke would go off it just would happen like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLight hits earth and doesn\u0027t blow it up and it\u0027s traveling at the speed of light too so mass does matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm talking about the kinetic energy of impact \u002B the velocity the mass of that ship at a normal cruising speed would Destoyer a lot of the Flagship (Snokes ship) The Lightspeed part would drive the ship like Swiss cheese THEN after its stopped the sheer Kinetic force would be like the Death Star. So mass does matter I the whole event because upon impact IT NOT IN LIGHTSPEED ANYMORE\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m I right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not please given me your logic\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
