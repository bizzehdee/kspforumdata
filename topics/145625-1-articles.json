It (the game) has been running very smoothly and I have not had any problems what so ever. The other night I was flying a Command Pod to my space station. I docked just fine, transferred my crew, then undocked and as I fired my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E retrograde I noticed that the game started running real laggy. \u00A01 in game second would take 3 or 4 real time seconds to pass. I figured my heavymod setup finally caught up to me or the high part count. Wasnt that worried about it. I went ahead and painfully waited for my craft to get out of physics range of the station\u00A0to see if it would speed back up to normal but it didn\u0027t. Again I went ahead with my rentery and landing in Super Happy Fun Time Choppy mode. It was late so I was going to shut game down and troubleshoot the problem the next day and when I was at the title screen I noticed that the rotation of Kerbin was choppy and as the kerbalnauts moved across the screen they were choppy too. I closed down the game and then reloaded it up and the choppyness was still there. I made a brand new sandbox save and loaded it up, built a small rocket and launched it, and it\u00A0was real choppy as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0After all this narrative my question is this. Even though everything was running completely flawless, could it still be mods that cause everything, even the title screen, to run perma-chop? Out of the blue? \u00A0I\u0027ve dealt with high part count, and over-mod issues before. I\u0027m not new to it, but this just feels different and I don\u0027t have the knowledge base to begin troubleshooting coding or physic time rates and such. I will start the long process of kicking mods out but I just don\u0027t see that being the problem. I haven\u0027t added anything new mod wise for a long time, not even any updates for my mods, and as I said before everything was running great, then BAM.... I\u0027m stuck with perma-chop. If anyone has ideas I am all ears, otherwise, if I am lucky enough to find the problem on my own I will let ya\u0027ll know. I may try a clean install first with what I call my \u0022Base Mods\u0022 first and see what happens. (Base Mods are ones I can\u0027t live without like Navyfishes\u0027 docking indicator and docking sounds. Mostly just fluff stuff...... er wait why am I rambling I\u0027m sure ya\u0027ll don\u0027t care and I have work to do! lol)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T19:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure of what is happening to your game, but I\u0027d say have a look at your task manager while your game is laggy. Then you\u0027ll be able to tell if it is the game which takes all your resources away or an other program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
