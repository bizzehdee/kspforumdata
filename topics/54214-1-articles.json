Inclination is the angle between the of that orbit and a reference plane 0 degrees inc. represents a equatorial orbit and is rotating the seme way as kerbin 90 degrees inc. represents a polar orbit, 180 degrees inc is an equatorial orbit but in a retro grade orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etransfers: to moons \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto get to a moon in ksp to get to kerbin\u0027s moon the Mun you have to blast 45 degrees ahead of the mun and retrograde to establish a orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfers: to other celestial bodies \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E the most common transfer orbit is called a hohmann transfer orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit achieve transfer by \u0022firing the spacecraft\u0027s engine so that it is propelled along the desired ellipse\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking: the operation which you need to rendezvous with the object and align the docking ports and dock this requires a lot of fuel for beginners and also you need rcs because it is easier to do it with rcs also i recommend using the docking mode it allows the rcs to act differently than in staging mode \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReminder don\u0027t forget to go back to staging mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding: there are a few types of landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. splash down this is achieved by landing a capsule in the water \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. eject is to get out of a capsule and land by parachute on land \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. landing on land is required to have a lot of work to do \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. space planes make controlled glides on the runway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpam is repeated messages not post itself\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-24T17:23:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2013 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T16:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat makes no sense\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Istas","CreatedById":2984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T17:11:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust... please just stop.
