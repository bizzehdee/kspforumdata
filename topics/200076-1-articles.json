I use 1.11.1 . The problem did only appear in 1.11.1 and breakingground was already installed when I had 1.11.0 . I did not edit any craft files. I also want to say, I have the picture of the KAL1000controller in the science section, but the name is CRSYscanningarm. This only happens with breaking ground pieces and only in 1.11.1 , but it works in 1.11 . Does this mean I did not install breakingground correctly or is it a bug in 1.11.1 breakingground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-07T09:41:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you got KSP via Steam, verify the game files first and see if that resolves the problem.
