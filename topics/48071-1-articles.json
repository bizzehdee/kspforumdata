When physicists talk about mass, they are talking about the rest mass. I have a couple of links for you to read up on if you want to find out more, as I have no great knowledge of GR. However, I do know that you cannot just replace the mass from Newtonian Mechanics with the relativistic mass when talking about an objects gravitational field. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=144817\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=144817\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/~dkoks/Faq/Relativity/BlackHoles/black_fast.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/~dkoks/Faq/Relativity/BlackHoles/black_fast.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity#Transverse_and_longitudinal_mass\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity#Transverse_and_longitudinal_mass\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T23:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s a little bit more complicated. The actual source of gravity is the stress energy tensor. Energy increase, which is proportional to relativistic mass increase, is going to factor into it. But so will momentum. For a point mass, it is a quantity proportional to the outer product of object\u0027s four-momentum with itself. The resulting gravitational field is a Lorentz boost of the original field (precisely because you can simply look at it from a moving coordinate system), so if the object didn\u0027t have an event horizon before you started to accelerate it, it won\u0027t have it even once you\u0027ve gotten the object to relativistic speeds.

One is unachievable, and the other is achievable, yet both would have the object move the exact same distance over the exact same time if clocked today.

In this case, meters x seconds. The plank length, too, is a distance. The difference here is that you can\u0027t crunch any information smaller than the plank length - so something that\u0027s moved 0.1 Plank Lengths is in the exact same physical position as something that has moved 0.6 Plank Lengths. There\u0027s no difference. There is a similar variable for time; if it takes you \u0022the age of the universe\u0022 to move 1 meter, then you\u0027ve moved 1 meter as of today. If it takes you \u0022longer than the age of the universe\u0022 to move 1 meter - well you\u0027ve yet to move 1 meter.\u003Cp\u003EThe thought experiment here is that there is a physical, non-infinite energy requirement for an proton to travel 10 plank lengths in 10.5 plank times. However, because you can\u0027t fractionate the plank length, both the proton and a photon will have traveled the same physical distance. The thought experiment can be dragged even deeper. Pretend both a proton and a photon began their journey during the birth of the Universe. If the protons speed is slower than a photon by 1 plank length x the age of the universe plus one second, then up until now, it\u0027s kept pace with a photon - it\u0027s traveled at C, which is impossible, but will become possible in the future when it begins to lose the race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can that be without breaking the rules? Surely the energy requirements needed to accelerate the proton to this speed are calculable, and surely some \u003Cem\u003EOh My God\u003C/em\u003E particle has been traveling at this speed somewhere. It\u0027s NOT traveling at the speed of light, but because of the existence of the Plank Scale, it should appear to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWestAir, I might also note that you\u0027re trying to take a QM approach to Relativity (Plank Length is a QM concept), and as we know, the two do not coexist peacefully yet. So it may be that no one truly knows the answer anyway.\u003Cp\u003EIt takes an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a particle with non-zero rest mass up to the speed of light. What you are talking about would require such a tremendous expenditure of energy into a single particle that I assure you, no such particle exists in the universe. It would probably have the energy of like a, AT LEAST a large hydrogen bomb, maybe something closer to a supernova, packed into a single particle. There is just no way, natural or otherwise, to focus that kind of energy into a single particle. I tried to calculate the amount of energy involved, but my computer is simply not capable of calculating down to that many decimal places. Maybe MATLAB could, but I doubt it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I figured out a way to do the calculation, and it turns out, if my numbers are right the particle would have an energy of something like 3x10^20 J. That is over 1500 times the energy of the largest hydrogen bomb ever tested. It\u0027s equivalent to 3600 kg of mass. I have to wonder whether that is enough mass, packed into the size of a proton, for the particle to collapse into a mini black hole. If so, would it? From the frame of reference of the particle, its mass doesn\u0027t increase, or does it? From our frame of reference, it should, and it might collapse under its own gravity. I\u0027m not sure how this is resolved, I\u0027ve never thought about the mass increase at relativistic velocities much. If it did collapse, it would rapidly dissolve in a burst of Hawking radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, note that your hypothetical particle is over 6x10^18 times more energetic than the most energetic cosmic ray EVER detected. Such a thing does not exist in this universe, you can be sure of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just to make sure we\u0027re on the same page, this is the speed I assumed for the proton:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne plank length behind a photon after the photon and proton had traveled 15 billion light years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about one part in about 10^61 less than the speed of light. I had a hard time doing the calculation till I wrote it out and realized that (1 - (1-10^-61)^2)^0.5 could be simplified to (2*10^-61)^0.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like, if QM and Relativity could be assumed to flesh out evenly with this experiment, that 3x10^20 Joules is the single energy requirement below a value of infinity [today], and adding more energy would do nothing to accelerate the proton further [until the future when spacetime expands further]. It also means that the energy required to reach \u0022a quanta below infinity\u0022 changes based on the distance being measured, and you can only reach true infinity with a distance of infinity...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless I\u0027m dead wrong, which is really what I\u0027d like to know from the above wall-o-text.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T04:54:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t actually know how things behave at Plank scales.

So is Quantum Mechanics when you get right down to it. Either one is a pain to actually make any computations in, except for some very simple cases, but conceptually, they are very compact and consistent. So if you ask a question about either one, I can probably give you a straight answer. If not quantitative, then at least qualitative. But when you start mixing the two... Quantum Gravity is not renormalizable, even if you manage to formulate it, and non-quantum Unified Field Theory, while entirely possible to formulate, is pretty much impossible to make any use out of. So in almost any situation where you mix the two, things just break down, and it becomes hard to answer even the most basic questions about what may and may not be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-13T05:01:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2013 05:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WestAir","CreatedById":59115,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T07:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s discerning, but at least enlightening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
