I am getting back into KSP after a few months of absence. After I saw that 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 had come out, I opened up the launcher to update it. I waited for at least ten minutes, but it still said \u0022Looking For Updates...\u0022. I tried restarting the launcher, my computer, and my modem for several days, but it still won\u0027t update. Does anyone know how to fix this?"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T00:52:46Z","Content":"The launcher is b0rked. If you have the store copy of KSP, I would suggest downloading 1.0.2 from there."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:54:10Z","Content":"[**Known issue**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120983-The-launcher-will-not-update-KSP-this-is-a-known-issue-see-here-for-help), as Umbral says, you need to re-download."}]}
