I am getting back into KSP after a few months of absence. After I saw that 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 had come out, I opened up the launcher to update it. I waited for at least ten minutes, but it still said \u0022Looking For Updates...\u0022. I tried restarting the launcher, my computer, and my modem for several days, but it still won\u0027t update. Does anyone know how to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T00:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe launcher is b0rked.
