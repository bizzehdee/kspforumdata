Everything is temperature stable when its running, but if I switch to something else, timewarp, and come back, the ore tank is full, but almost no fuel was made -\u0026gt; it gives me a message about the core temperature being to high and a shutdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf fills up its small ore tank in less than 2 hours. To make this thing work, I have to come back to this ting every 2 hours, and start the ISRU... which when drawing from a full ore tank (vs the ore that is produced at the rate its made from the drills), consumes moe power than the craft can provide, so I need to shut the drills down, timewarp until the tank is empty, an repeat...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n75 units or ore in the tank converts to roughly 7 units of LF... it will take forever to get this thing to the next biome...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts realy a pain in the ____ .... so I\u0027m going to .cfg file mod. Ideally I\u0027d just prevent the core temp shut down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin the .cfg file, it says:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 DefaultShutoffTemp = .8\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is that 0.8 value? which way should I change this to allow it to get hotter (even though I don\u0027t know why it shuts down at all, it seems to be a calculation error from the calcultions done for when I switch to it to make it the active vessel - again it is temperature stable wen its the active vessel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T00:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest you send a PM to RoverDude, who wrote the code.\u00A0 He can tell you everything there is to know about the Ore system\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T07:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html\u0022\u003E\n@PART[MiniISRU]\n{\n\t@MODULE[ModuleResourceConverter],* // IIRC, that hits every module of that type...\n\t{\n\t\t@GeneratesHeat = false\n\t}\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight want to fiddle with the thermal efficiency and stuff a little as well, but the getting rid of overheats is faster with ^^ than messing with overheat temps and heating rate\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-02T07:12:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2016 07:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T17:46:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222345262\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129050\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451695227\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest you send a PM to RoverDude, who wrote the code.\u00A0 He can tell you everything there is to know about the Ore system\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr even better, just mention \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E like this, which will cause him to get notified and he\u0027ll see this thread and hopefully reply here.\u00A0 Then everybody gets the benefit of the answer.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(One of the nice things about KSP is that the devs actually read the forums and respond directly to questions there-- I see lots of posts from folks like RoverDude and NathanKell, they\u0027re very responsive.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
