If you end up getting flameouts, you could try hitting the targets ballistically - give yourself more thrust than you need, then when you get close (within ~50km) of the target, throttle up all the way and pitch up sharply, holding the nose up until you get to the target altitude, at which point you should be in the survey zone or very close.
