Both on the ISS and in other craft, space flight is a hugely inelegant affair. The ISS is a shining star of luxury in that it actually has a separate toilet and cubicle style private \u0027rooms\u0027 (i.e. a cardboard box to sleep in), but that is about all the luxury you get. Oh, and that fancy window of course, that is a big plus \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Otherwise, space is a very bare-bones experience with little room for shame or feelings of being uncomfortable.
