I did and it\u0027s a fun experience. But since the physics warp only accelerates to 4 times the normal speed it takes a loooooong time to do an orbit. But I made at least 2 and only lost 500 m while at it. I guess it would\u0027ve taken at least 3 or 4 more orbits until the atmosphere would have slowed my vessel enough down to reentry.\n\nSo, Challange?"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T14:22:58Z","Content":"I once did an orbit at around 40km\u0027s inside the atmosphere with a tiny plane.\n\nBut that was waaay back before the Aero has changed ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOh I even found a picture of the plane.\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=284463231](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=284463231)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T14:25:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 02:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MalfunctionM1Ke**"},{"CreatedByName":"xub313","CreatedById":57408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T14:32:56Z","Content":"That\u0027s neat.\n\nI wonder if you could build a station while still in the atmosphere.

Basically you would have to get orbital velocity as low as possible and eject a probe that would then get more than 2.3k from the other spacecraft before its orbit decays too much. The probe will crash/land/do whatever you make it do while that other spacecraft will remain in a stable, on-rails atmospheric orbit. It only got one entry, by Kasuha.

I miss you, come back...)"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:28:02Z","Content":"Sure its possible and would be a fun challenge to see how long it would stay at like a 65kmx65km orbit before it falls down.
