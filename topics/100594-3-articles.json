I don\u0027t think cell phones cause brain cancer, not so much as car accidents, neck injuries, attention deficit issues, and the occasional tag attack on someones face-book page. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) Society gets exactly what they elect, the per-GDP spending on space science and medical sciences has gone down since Reagan took office, he was a very popular guy, but popularity does not help you stay on top of the foreign competitors (growing in Asia). The problem is not the corporations, the problem is the people are easily persuaded by heavily propogandized arguments to do that which is not in their self interest. \n\nI want to add something here with an emphasis. Chemical risk in the environment greatly supercede any risk we have regarding radiation except risk to sun-bathers from UV exposure. We talk about the risk associated with 3-mile Island, or even Chernobyl, Fukushima. Every year dozens of people die as a direct consequence to chemical exposure in the work place, every decade 100s die from industrial accidents or explosions within the US. Just look at the number of deadly accidents in the refining industry, chemical handling of the US over the last 100 years (e.g Texas City - 500). Direct deaths from nuclear accidents (2) in 1961 from an isolated reactor in Idaho that were primarily caused by impactors, not radioactivity. Just look at the increased risk of cancer in communities around refineries and plastic synthesis in the SW Louisiana and E Texas (not called the cancer triangle for nothing). \n\nFor some odd reason people are scared about radiation that they can\u0027t see, smell, or hear, but have no problem living right next to a facility that is both immediately risky, smells, shows visible off-color plumes, frequently burn unknowns, dump pollutants on cloudy days to avoid detection, etc. What about the tons of lead we used to put in automobiles and spew out in schoolyards waiting to pick up children. What about the tons of mercury that are emitted from coal burning plants that are situated in some of the most densely populated areas of the world and tends to accumulate up the food chain. \n\nIn Japan there was fear about radiation, but this we obsess about but 25,000 people died from the lack of adequate protections, civil code and information as a consequence of the same event that cause the reactor mishap. Many more people in Japan have already gotten sick and died from Mercury poisoning because of corporate malfeasance. Not to mention the fact that oil, gas and many other kinds of leakages occurred after the tsunami that will eventually end back into the food chain. Oil and gas industry-world wide will kill more people in a year than Fukushima will kill even under the most catastrophic scenarios. \n\nIn Russia Chernobyl was a nightmare, but the exposure would have been far less if the government inacted iodine therapies for children exposed to the fall-out and imported milk from the east. Even worse incidences of exposure occurred simply because the RF governments did not stop people from burning chaff (which also included soil particles, that they promptly inhaled) instead of the more environmentally friendly process of composting. In essence the most at-risk people were affected by bad chemical hygiene that was exacerbated by radiation fall-out. And I should add, having known someone who worked in the Soviet chemical industries, they had, for the most, part ignored chemical safety for generations, people living around some of their \u0027production\u0027 sites were often sent to the hospital after a good wind blew or a creek overflowed its banks. There are places in Russia outside of Chernobyl that are abandoned simply because these places are now too dangerous to live. I would argue that nuclear industry is properly regulated, the chemicals industry is greatly under-regulated. \n\nAny expenditure the government places on environmental risk really needs to be directed at the chemical environment not cell-phone emmisions. That is something that can be evaluated after the other risks have been factored in."},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T17:23:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wouldn\u0027t it be enough to know that the limit on the cancer deaths they can cause without the link showing up in the studies that have been done, is lower than the number of people who would die for lack of the ability to call for help if mobile phones were banned? The ability for a bystander to call an ambulance immediately rather than after dashing to a phone box can make the difference, the ability for lost people to call for directions can make the difference, call for help performing first aid or let rescuers triangulate your position using the cell phone network.\n\nYou should exclude people that died in car crash or killed someone because they were using phone while driving.\n\nWhere is statistics now?
