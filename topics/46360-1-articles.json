The angled front makes it a tad easier to see in a setup where the gauges are located slightly below eye level.

Inexpensive brackets or glue could hold a prototype together. While your at the hobby store I\u0027m sure you could find something to use as labels for the various gauges. Something like small stenciled letters you could paint on to give it that pro look. Someone mentioned switches above... I mean you HAVE to have switches. Cool ones that have covers on them!
