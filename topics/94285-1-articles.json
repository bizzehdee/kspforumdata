To make a first attempt at putting a man in space by orbiting him seems to me to be unnecessarily ambitious and risky. Is there any evidence that the Russians flew or attempted sub-orbital flights before Gagarin, as the Americans did with Alan Sheppard and Gus Grissom?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T20:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell they did more ANIMAL flights prior to Yuri than America did.
