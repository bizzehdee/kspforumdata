I am trying to get my old parts updated for 1.3.1 and new Unity. I have most of my config files working now and am almost ready to start a new career game.One file I just cant get the IVA to line up with the model ? The position\u00A0 and rotation command\u0027s don\u0027t work under the IVA config file. I seem to remember that this also used to not always work? I am not sure why this works on some models and not others? I know that the offset comand for the IVA in the regular part config works But I cant remember what is the command for changing the rotation? I tried rotate, rotation, and angle, and none of them work\u0027s. The offset command work\u0027s but I need to rotate the IVA 180-deg to make the hatch line up correctly? Anyone remember the command for rotation in the regular part configuration file?\u00A0 And is there a Wiki or something for config file commands \u0022Thanks\u0022 \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T15:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHighly reliable sources tell me that there is no rotation support for the INTERNAL node inside of a part config; it only supports \u0027offset =\u0027 and \u0027scale =\u0027.\u00A0 You have to setup the IVA model orientation properly prior to exporting it from Unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou -might- be able to rotate the models inside of the IVA config itself (e.g. find the IVA .cfg file, find the MODEL node that defines the base model, and then add a rotation there).\u00A0 However... it is likely that all of the props would then be misplaced and need to be repositioned/rotated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delbrutis","CreatedById":144613,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-02T20:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I tried the internal configuration file. For some reason the command\u0027s don\u0027t work? The model is a ring centrifuge and I just want the access tube to line up with the external model. I need to rotate it 180 deg. and I figure if the props move you wont be able to tell? Might end up with a bag or something in front of the hatch but that\u2019s better on my OCD than the tube sticking out in space. I thought their used to be a command along with offset to move the whole model at its attach point? Its been a long time since I\u2019ve messed with the files Unity has changed and I might be remembering wrong.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks for the help\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-03T18:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi , re rotating the IVA, did you make the two parts IVA external separately ?\u00A0 If you didn\u0027t,\u00A0 and the IVA, at unity import, is nested within the outer shell and you\u00A0 have the unity scene you can put it right at that point rather than messing around with cfgs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delbrutis","CreatedById":144613,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-05T03:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, yeah when I said \u0022my old parts\u0022 I meant my older parts I use for my career game\u0027s. I didn\u0027t mean to imply ownership or anything. I didn\u2019t actually make the part so I have no idea how it was put together in unity ? I guess I always assumed because you could swap out IVA files between different part\u0027s and they had their own .MU file that they were always made separately. My modding\u00A0 skills end at editing a config file and working with a texture in gimp. \u0022Ha\u0022 that\u0027s why I tried this thread to get advice from the expert\u0027s who know what their doing.Thanks for the help my OCD will probably just have to learn to live with this one. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks really appreciate all the help\u0022\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-05T17:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi , oh well, as you say, you\u0027ll just have to overlook that little issue. Re the IVA\u0027s though, generally ( i and those i chat to)\u00A0 tend to make the IVA at the same time as the model, otherwise it can be horrible trying to line everything up afterward,\u00A0\u00A0 the IVA being rotated differently than the external. So almost all IVA\u0027s even though they will swap between models with a simple cfg tweak, are uniquely suited to one pod or cockpit or in your case station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-05T17:22:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2017 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delbrutis","CreatedById":144613,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-06T05:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah thanks. You have to remember with the old models it\u0027s not anyone\u2019s fault. When these old models were done we only had IVA and external view. There was no fancy cut away internal view. You could have the IVA \u0022backwards\u0027 \u0022upside down\u0022 and rotated any way you wanted and as long as it looked cool was sized about right and the window transforms were assigned the correct camera view no one ever knew our cared how they were lined up.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
