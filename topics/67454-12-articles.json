I was hoping that getting any part within the confines of the claw would make it happy, but it demands more precision than that (the center of the claw must contact the face of the part to be docked to). So, for some pre-existing airplanes I have, for example, using the claw to dock to the edge of the wing can be problematical (since the height of the wing and the height of the claw have to be pretty close), but grabbing the rear of the jet engine nozzle is much easier... ...although it does look a bit rude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are going to purpose-design surface hardware for this kind of docking, you can include easily accessed vertical plates or beam or truss pieces on the ships to make the docking easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T18:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESoooooo .... launch escape tower as booster seperatrons?
