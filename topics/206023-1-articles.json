I don\u0027t want to make it sound completely trivial, but most of the work is done by the game\u0027s physics system. The inputs we are sending to the robotic parts are pretty much exactly what Unity\u0027s joints are designed to work with. And they are driven by animation curves that are basically built into the game as well and, at least in KSP case, are the same animation curves as are used for engine thrust/I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0scaling with pressure and speed. So it\u0027s almost as easy as making art for the parts and hooking up the necessary UI. Obviously, then there\u0027s some tuning, debugging, QA, just like there would be for any other feature. So it\u0027s not free.
