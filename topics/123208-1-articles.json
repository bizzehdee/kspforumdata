That being said, if you have one of the 2.5m ones out there on a ship with no radiators, you will still be able to operate, but the efficiency will be very low since it will overheat quickly (but not down to zero in the case of the 2.5m ones - they will tend to hit equilibrium with a net positive in processing capabilities).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design choice here is to provide two very clear options with each one having it\u0027s benefits and drawbacks.
