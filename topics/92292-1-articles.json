So, recently I developed a very deep interest for AstroPhysics after watching the film Interstellar a few weeks ago (don\u0027t hate me) and I\u0027ve pretty much been infatuated with space, astrophysics and astronomy ever since. Now, I came into KSP knowing relatively no physics or maths and just built a rocket to see what happens. After failure after failure I decided to check on reddit for answers and the general consensus was to watch Scott Manley, but I would prefer a more hands-on approach to learning about things, with more theory involved. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I managed to get into my first low orbit around kerbin which I was extremely happy about, but I learnt how a lack of calculations can end, which to say the least, is badly. So, now I have a ship stranded in orbit, and Jeb is dead (I admitted defeat and jetpacked back into Kerbin, I surprisingly survived the atmosphere heat change, but died on impact with the ocean). So, now after playing for about an hour today trying to get into a lunar orbit, I realised that I need to learn about build structures and deltaV calculations more. I just downloaded Kerbal Engineer Redux, which kind of tells you the deltaV each part gives you, and I looked at a deltaV map, but I\u0027m still pretty lost when it comes to calculating it all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s my first problem. My second problem is that I really have no idea about building efficient rockets that have correct stages, house enough fuel for my voyages, rockets that are controllable (i.e not too tall, as I figured it is really hard to control tall rockets), and also how to understand TWR, and how to get it up/down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realise that all of these questions are probably really stupid, the same things are posted every single day, and I probably shouldn\u0027t be playing this game, but I am extremely interested in Astrophysics and I think it\u0027s something I may look at doing at college/university, so if anyone can recommend any books for me to read as well, that would be greatly appreciated because all I want to do right now is learn learn learn! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T18:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey there, AstroLuke, welcome to the KSP forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have time for an extensive posting right now, otherwise I\u0027d get into your concerns in depth.

The other options is to experiment, see what works, what doesn\u0027t and go from there. The Pre-built crafts are good for this. (specifically the Kerbal-X I would remove the landing legs though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssue #2: Reading a dV (delta-V) map. This one isn\u0027t really that hard, just a bit un-intuitive. You look at where you are and where you want to go and add all the numbers plus about 5% (safety margin), this will be the amount of dV you need to get there. Not back, just there. I wouldn\u0027t worry about going outside Kerbins\u0027 SoI (Sphere of Influence) for the moment, lots to do inside there. You already have Kerbal Engineer which is good, means you have a dV/TWR readout in the editor so I won\u0027t bore you with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erocket equation\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding controllable rockets is something that\u0027s a tad tricky. Just because your rocket is tall doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s uncontrollable, however, you can do better by planning a little. My typical beginner rockets start with a capsule and a small bit of fuel, just enough to de-orbit myself when I\u0027m done. Then I need to get that stage into orbit, I know I need about 5000m/s of dV to go from sea level to orbit, but I\u0027m not going to build a single stage to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead I want my orbital insertion stage to have about 500m/s of dV, just enough to circularize and a little bit extra just in case. Then my center lift stage will have about 1500m/s, this is where the power is. After that it\u0027s all about boosters. I typically use 4 boosters feeding fuel into the center, this gives me enough oomph (TWR) off of the pad, while keeping enough fuel in the center tank to get me most of the way to orbit. Between the boosters I typically add winglets to help control the rocket during atmospheric flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow then, to \u0022control\u0022 your TWR (thrust-to-weight Ratio) you can either change the weight of your rocket, or how much thrust you are outputting. If you right click the engine in the VAB you can adjust the maximum amount of thrust of that engine. You want to aim for a TWR of about 1.5 to 2.0 on the pad, it will only go up as your rocket burns fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that covers everything, I will have a picture of an example rocket here soonish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Euf4UF8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Euf4UF8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-08T18:46:19Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2014 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Taki117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T18:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was in your shoes, still kind of am.

You can build your rocket so that the total delta V is what you need to get to where you want to go, from the map. When you\u0027re ready to land on the Mun allow plenty of margin for the landing phase as a careful landing uses a lot more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER also gives TWR. You want it about 1.4-1.7 for your first stage, once you\u0027re higher it doesn\u0027t matter as much. To land and take off from Mun or minumus your lander has to have TWR greater than 1, but, don\u0027t forget to change the reference body in KER, a TWR of 1.5 on Kerbin will be like 6 or 7 on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo adjust TWR, the easiest thing is to adjust throttle, although of course then you don\u0027t know exactly what TWR while you\u0027re flying (actually does KER change TWR in flight based on throttle? Never tried it.) You can also change staging. Classic example is a liquid booster with 2 SRB on the side. Initially it will have all 3 engines firing together in stage 1. This may give you a TWR of say 3. So what you do then is move the liquid engine to stage 2, so the SRB fire first, then when they\u0027re done the liquid engine goes. KER will show you what happens to the TWR after you make the change. Also, you can actually right click on a SRB in the VAB and decrease the throttle. Once you launch you can\u0027t adjust throttle but you can ahead of time. Your SRB will burn at less thrust and will burn longer. Fiddle with this setting (called a \u0022tweakable\u0022) in the VAB until you get the TWR you want (KER will update the TWR as you adjust.) You can also do this for liquid engines, it\u0027s called limiter. Then you can just set throttle to full when you launch. And leave it alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few others, you probably know this but landing on Minimus is way easier than the Mun. Start with small simple 1 or 2 stage rockets, a little 2 stager can easily make orbit and come back. And keep plugging away, it\u0027s amazing how quickly it comes together. I remember when docking seemed so hard but after a few days of reading tutorials and playing the game I got it and now I can\u0027t remember why I ever thought it was hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the rabbit hole!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-08T20:00:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2014 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DrD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T20:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AstroLuke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AstroLuke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI realise that all of these questions are probably really stupid ... \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, they are, but that\u0027s OK!
