Panels and girders have an impact resistance of 80 m/s, which is way faster than what you\u0027re reasonably going to be able to drive (without some kind of JATO assistance or falling down a cliff anyway). Benefit: if your rover does rollover on you, you can upright it again as opposed to the whole thing instantaneously blowing up and becoming a worthless pile of debris...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking mode controls for rovers help tremendously; on Minmus, you have to drive that way (even the Hound, which weighs four tonnes, will flip over on Minmus if the controls are left in staging mode). You can also remap your translation keys. I dunno know IJKL will work or not; I\u0027ve never tried it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing you can do is provide your rover with some constant downthrust while you\u0027re driving it to give you traction. Downforce for rovers is one of those instances where I\u0027ve actually heard people finding a useful application for ion thrusters.

The \u0027Hound is four tonnes all told and they work well with it. I used ruggedized wheels on a previous design, the Hellrider 7, which weighed only about 1.5 tonnes. They proved to be a bit powerful; on the other hand, I put the \u0027riders through a hell of a lot of abuse and most of the time they kept themselves intact.
