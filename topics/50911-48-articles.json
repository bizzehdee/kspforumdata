Those side boosters had second tanks atop them, with the big decouplers and plenty of Sepratrons to kick them away. With the decouplers right side up it worked. Flip them upside down to drop their weight with the tanks and it all goes worng.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same node order issue appears, not because of staging individually, but because the Kerbodyne size decouplers have Physics Signifigance set to 1 so they have no mass in flight. (Cheaty by default!) The problem also manifests when using an up-scaled version of the 1-to-n adapters to fit Kerbodyne tanks. With Physics Significance left at 1, those decouplers directly in line beneath those adapters will not all activate. One will, the next stage engines will, but the other 1, 2 or 3 big decouplers fail. *big explosion* as the engine flames destroy the decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you are having staging problems using the kerbodyne decoupler in anything but a single stack rocket or in an asparagus rocket where Kerbodyne size stacks are \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E attached below a stock 1-to-n adapter, you need to enable Physics Significance in the Kerbodyne decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad has kept that error in .90 and I don\u0027t know why. Those decouplers are supposed to be heavy parts that require appropriate rocket design to account for the mass, unlike struts and various other small parts.
