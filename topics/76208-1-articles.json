If I set the Spring or Damper property in VAB/SPH it is carried into flight perfectly. However, if I change the values in flight they either don\u0027t take effect or there\u0027s about 30 secs delay. Setting _anything_ else (grip, distance etc.) in flight takes effect instantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a nasty feeling this is something to do with stuff going on in ModuleWheel, but I\u0027m stumped. Calling the spring setting to the log shows it\u0027s been changed to the new value; KSP just seems to ignore it for a good while :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        [KSPField(isPersistant = true, guiActive = true, guiActiveEditor = true, guiName = \u0022Strength\u0022), UI_FloatRange(minValue = 0, maxValue = 3.00f, stepIncrement = 0.2f)]\u003Cbr\u003E        public float SpringRate; \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        public WheelCollider mywc;\u003Cbr\u003E        public JointSpring thisSpring;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                foreach (WheelCollider wc in this.part.GetComponentsInChildren\u0026lt;WheelCollider\u0026gt;())\u003Cbr\u003E                {\u003Cbr\u003E                    thisSpring = wc.suspensionSpring; \u003Cbr\u003E                    thisSpring.spring = SpringRate;\u003Cbr\u003E                    wc.suspensionSpring = thisSpring; \u003Cbr\u003E                    print(wc.suspensionSpring.spring);\u003Cbr\u003E                }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried lots of variations, not one method is more effective than the other.
