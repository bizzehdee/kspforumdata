Obviously, to get an optimistic timeframe given current funding you would need to push the whole thing back a few decades, but actually the concepts themselves are very, very detailed and very, very interesting in my opinion.

The rest all docks together and spends 300 days on Phobo\u0027s surface, shielding from 50% or so of the radiation. After that, the modules can meet back with the TEI stage in HMO, and, after a 200-250 day cruise, the crew can reenter on Earth inside the CM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://online.liebertpub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mal/journals/content/space/2015/space.2015.3.issue-2/space.2015.0018/20150616/images/large/figure9.jpeg\u0022 alt=\u0022figure9.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mars Mission would instead require 6 SLS launches:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E4.5 years before the Crew Launch, a 100 kWe SEP Tug would be launched with a TEI stage.

Here, the CM and the DSH dock with the TEI\u002BDSH resupply\u002BLander from previous flights. Two of the four crew members move into the Lander and depart for Mars\u0027 surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mars Lander is a 12 m diameter traditional entry vehicle with heat shield andno parachutes or deployable aerodynamic decelerators. At about Mach 2, supersonic retro-propulsion (SRP) rockets would be ignited to perform the final descent and landing. Supersonic retro-propulsion has been validated to some extent by Space in their flight tests to return their first stage boosters for reuse. The propellants in this concept would be MMH and MON-25, using current technology pump-fed engines similar to the RS-725 or the Proton 3rd stage engine. The lander would have about a 75-ton entry mass and deliver a useful landed payload mass of about 23\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0t. Peak deceleration during EDL would be 6.4 g, touchdown would occur at \u0026lt;5 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a 24 day stay, the MAV brings back the two men/women into LMO (Low Mars Orbit). Finally, the MAV-to-HMO boost stage of Flight #2, which had reached LMO previously, after having undocked from the DSH Resupply module. The MAV-to-HMO boost stage brings them back to HMO, where they dock, meet with the rest of the crew and perform TEI back to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s just sci-fi currently, but to me it looks (from a technological point of view only) very feasible.
