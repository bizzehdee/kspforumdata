I\u0027ve tried searching around and KoS autopilot leads me to believe its possible but I am really looking to make a simplified version where Lat, Longitude and target altitude are set for each drone, no plans for them to land as of yet. I plan to have the drone launcher part with a selectable payload attribute in the VAB and a limited range as well (will be using firespitter as the drones are basically a single prop surrounded by a small aerodynamic fuselage containing fuel and w/e sci loadout is needed), not trying to make it hyper edit easy or anything just trying to make it a little less tedious. So my main question is if it is even possible within atmosphere? and secondly if so any pointers toward the right direction would be super appreciated. I know its probably ridiculously ambitious but I\u0027m a quick learner and love a challenge (as long as I know it is possible lol) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is possible and within my ability I would like to implement a karbondrum scanner loadout to work with rover dudes stuff for resource hunting as well as an orbital version for multiple location missions where the is no atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, and i\u0027m pretty sure this is askin too much , but a camera feed from each drone would be freekin sweet as well but feeds from 4 separate vessels is something i think would surely kill a 32 bit ksp lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: roughed in a quick mockup of the part, real rough lol \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Edit: BTW, I\u0022\u003E its got a few VFX demoreels and a couple modeling minireels but they havent been updated since early 2011-ish and its mostly Final stuff from College that I had to whip up in less than a month due to a major computer meltdown but most of the stuff there is still decent imo anyway, got a resume with imdb cred there as well\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T00:53:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lucerro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T04:19:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaking a single drone fly to a preset point: Relatively easy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking multiple drones fly to multiple preset points: Difficult\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour problem is going to be the physics zone.
