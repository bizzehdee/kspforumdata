I do have a question about the quoted Isp of jet engines in vacuum. arq just quoted an Isp of 1000s for the basic jet engine in vacuum, 1200s for the turbojet. What do those values mean? Jet engines cannot operate in vacuum due to the lack of intake air, so IMHO these values should be N/A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre these theoretic values, if you fed them liquid oxidiser? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, when building rockets with jet propulsion for the first stages, I feel there is less information to know how efficient what you\u0027re doing is.

The exhaust is accelerated through a de Laval (or \u0022con-di\u0022) nozzle to get supersonic exhaust velocity. Having air pressure behind the exhaust interferes with the process, lowering efficiency. So the vacuum is the theoretical \u0022perfect\u0022 Isp while the atmospheric is the Isp at sea level.
