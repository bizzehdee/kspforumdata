This planet could also be a \u0027super-earth\u0027 as was discussed back in 0.17 with massive gravity and a very thick atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStar Systems\u003C/strong\u003E: I think are a waste of time in this game. They\u0027re just too far away to be practical to add. Time Warp would have to be updated to have several more iterations because spacecraft would take thousands of years to reach their targets (believe me, I\u0027ve done it with mods).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5 Meter Parts\u003C/strong\u003E: Correct me if I\u0027m wrong but I believe 5m parts are being added in the Making History Expansion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with you with all of this except your criticism of star systems being implemented. There are mods to do this but for this to really work they would have\u00A0to add ftl (faster than light) engines or even warp drives. This would mean that they would also have to add new materials so star systems would be useful because the large concentrations of these resources could be in a different star systems and therefore there would be a need to visit them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
