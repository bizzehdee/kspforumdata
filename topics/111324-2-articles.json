Parts on two different ships don\u0027t do that nearly as often (only when crashing into each other or blowing it away with an engine).\n\nSo, while the interactions between two ships are limited and splitting them into two threads sounds doable, you would have to do constant thread sync if running multiple threads on one ship. And thread syncs/communications are expensive. So expensive, that multiple threads running one ship would most probably lower performance compared to a single one.\n\nIn short: yes, multiple ships close together will run a little smoother, but the highest part count of any of them is still the limiting factor. So, yes, two 500 parts ships will cripple performance, while the 1000 parts ship after docking will obliterate it. However, 5 100 parts ships will most probably run faster than now.\n\ndisclaimer: just applying basic programming knowledge, I have no idea what tricks and simplifications the Unity devs applied."},{"CreatedByName":"Yorkie","CreatedById":93667,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T10:27:30Z","Content":"I have only one question.\n\nIs MU Red or Blue ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T10:35:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E From what is being said, Unity 5 still can\u0027t seperate an object built out of other objects into multiple threads.\n\nConsidering two craft are rarely, if ever flown together it would be moot for Squad to even suggest that the change to unity 5 would result in performance increases..\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d say even one 500 part ship is too much for KSP.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t for KSP version 0.90..
