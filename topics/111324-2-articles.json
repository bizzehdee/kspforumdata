What? Who said anything about unity 5 multithreaded physics only applying one core to each ship? That makes no sense to me whatsoever and I am sure it\u0027s simply not true. Multithreaded physics will apply to all ships simultaneously.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thread does \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT\u003C/strong\u003E equal one core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach core consists of a number of threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is and has always been multithreaded (but uses a single core).

It has two cores. Each core has two threads. So the Physics engine can use (about) one quarter of the i3\u0027s processing power. With Unity 5, the Physics engine will be able to use at least an entire core (I\u0027m not sure on the exact details) so it would use at least half, with the rest of the game (and most likely everything else) running on a different core. More advanced processors have either more cores, more threads per core, or both. Less advanced processor would have fewer (currently allowing KSP to use more of their processing power) but are less powerful overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: 200 posts!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T11:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yorkie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Yorkie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have only one question.\u003Cp\u003EIs MU Red or Blue \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mean sky blue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what if he\u0027s FC United?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T11:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheMoonRover\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheMoonRover\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPersonally I like the explosion style fairings, although I certainly understand why people would hate them.\u003Cp\u003EOne thread does \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT\u003C/strong\u003E equal one core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach core consists of a number of threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is and has always been multithreaded (but uses a single core).
