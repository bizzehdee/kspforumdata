Now I know most of you are going to say build a smaller rocket but I have a bet running on this\u00A0and I dont want too anyways. Its 1288 parts sorry.\u00A0I have tried\u00A064bit mods in windows and Linux but none of them have worked at all or at least dont let me use more of the computers resources. The list of 64bit mods I have tried\u00A0are listed bellow and even when I use the KSP 64 bit\u00A0\u0022beta?\u0022 from the start menu I get the same problem and shows in the task manager as 32bit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow honestly I have no idea why I downloaded most of these and will be removing some of them but crucial ones would be all the Space X,\u00A0Space Y and MechJeb because I am still learning space flight. Now the mods I am running may be part of the problem but I have tried to fly my rocket with no mods installed and got the same result as with them installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe list of mods I have are the following: Space X Brage lander 1.0, SpaceX Landing Legs 1.0.2,\u00A0SpaceY-Lifters-1.11.2,\u00A0SmokeScreen-2.6.13.0,\u00A0MechJeb2-2.5.6.0,\u00A0SpaceShuttleEngines-2.2.0,\u00A0AdjustableLandingGear-v1.2.0,\u00A0SixSeatMk3cockpit-1.0.4.2,\u00A0KerbalKonstructs-0.9.5.2,\u00A0CommunityResourcePack-0.5.0.0,\u00A0SpaceY-Expanded-1.1.5,\u00A0KlockheedMartian-Gimbal-3.0.7.0,\u00A0ModuleManager-2.6.20,\u00A0InterstellarFuelSwitch-Core-1.18,\u00A0SixCrewScienceLab-1.0.4.1,\u00A0BDAnimationModules-v0.6.2:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor my PC usage I am using about 1.5 GB out of my 16 GB and only 8% max\u00A0on the CPU. For my PC I am running windows 10 and specs are the following: 5960x @ 4.2 ghz,\u00A016GB of 2400mhz quad channel DDR4, GTX980, and a SSD. I need help in anyway possible so I can see\u00A0my rocket fly. I would add pictures but the form wont let me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your time\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlex, Ablecoh, Bishop\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/105592-windows-64-bit-community-workaround/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/95791-running-64bit-in-steam-with-linux-solution/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T09:01:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2fps with 1288 parts, lucky you.
