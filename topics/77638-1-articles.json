Duna\u0027s atmosphere doesn\u0027t provide much lift, so you need bigger wings and higher speeds than on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut ion engines have a TWR of 0.8 now, so they can be used to directly take off from any planet smaller than Laythe. Duna only has a gravity of 0.3, so it\u0027s certainly possible, you just have to make sure the ion engines are at least half the mass of your craft (so you get a TWR of ~0.4).
