The length of a 70km Kerbin orbit is over 4200 km (the radius includes the 600kn radius of Kerbin) so that would involve a very long ship indeed. You would have to construct it in orbit by docking lots of ships together (and I do mean lots). If you made each \u0022ship\u0022 out of some girders 100m long with a docking port on each end (and that may be too big for the VAB) then you would need 42000 of them to circle the planet. However, once this was constructed, the centre of gravity of the ship would be very near the centre of gravity of the planet and this would probably upset the gravitational calculations (gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance). The large gravitational force might serve to steady the object in orbit but I suspect that the engine would have a fit and the whole thing would just collapse and come raining down on the planet below...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it would be extremely difficult (if not impossible) to keep the partially constructed ring in a stable orbit while each new section is sent up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem would be the part count of the \u0022ship\u0022. If each part is somehow only 10 parts (for a 100m long ship that is strong and stable enough to actually launch to orbit it would probably need 100\u002B) then the total for the whole ring would be 420000 (or over 4 million if 100 parts per ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be interesting to knock something up in hyperedit, maybe make it out of just six pieces that are 1000 km long each and stick them in a high enough orbit that they could be joined to form a hexagonal ring. I\u0027ve not played around much with hyperedit (or manual editing of the save file) so I don\u0027t know what is possible but doubt that KSP would cope with 400k parts in a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a hyperedit test, maybe we could make a special mod part that is a very long girder (10, 100 or even 1000km long). Then I\u0027m thinking a round tank of some kind with a long girder attached radially. Then have a docking port on the end of the girder and one on the tank (at the correct angle to the girder) to attach the next section to (and a couple of other docking ports so other things can dock). I think I\u0027ll knock up a small scale example to show the principle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, if this were made big enough to circle a planet and you flew it directly at a planet (round it) then it would be able to achieve an oscillating \u0022orbit\u0022 just going back and forth...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T14:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
