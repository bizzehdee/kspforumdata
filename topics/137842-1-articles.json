CPU use is at 100% but on the runway etc it seems fine I am wondering if its a mod I am using but no idea to find out which one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also get the stutter/freezes every 5 or so seconds but I have read this happens in a modded and none modded game (garbage collection?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny way thanks and really hope

than other scenes (between 2 and 3 full cores worth)\u00A0even without any mods. \u00A0You don\u0027t give any info about your system so I presume your CPU only has 2 cores (and probably only just hits the recommended specs for the game). \u00A0Please see the sticky thread about how to provide a DxDiag report. \u00A0Some people have seen an improvement by turning off\u00A0the spacecenter crew in the main game settings but YMMV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there are the mods. \u00A0KerbalEngineer definitely runs its deltaV calculations (partly) in a background thread but the impact should be minimal unless the vessel is large and complex and the calculations shouldn\u0027t run at all if the window is closed. \u00A0MechJeb may well do the same sort of thing. \u00A0FAR can do various complex calculations in the editor but I don\u0027t know if these happen all the time or just when the user explicitly asks for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should also check your output_log.txt file (or upload it to a file hosting service and post a link) for any error spam or other indications that your game is having issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stk2008","CreatedById":162264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T14:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for replying \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022
