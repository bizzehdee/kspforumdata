T\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to start modding KSP is start simple stupid, a fuel tank, for example , in theory if you can get a fuel tank to load in and display and more importantly function correctly, you can do the same for a city.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT there\u0027s a\u00A0 lot more to placing large models with KK and their interaction with the game and the load your object puts on the game than just plopping it in and saying it\u0027s done, a badly built static model can, crash your game, break KK, kill your frame rate, lock the game up,, so many things can go wrong and they do even to experienced mod makers.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJumping in at a city may seem like a great idea but do yourself a favor start with the easy stuff, it\u0027s easy to fix a problem on a fuel tank but not so easy to fix a problem with a city sized model, that\u0027s if you can even work out why you have a problem in the first place. Constantly struggling will just lead to disappointment and discouragement, and a bad experience early on could ruin your mod making aspirations just as it has done to many hundreds of others\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-29T20:24:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2017 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sp4nge","CreatedById":176316,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T21:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
