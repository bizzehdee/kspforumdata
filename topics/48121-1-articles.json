The usefulness of this plugin is shown when you have the B9 cargo bay, go to action groups, click on the cargo bay, the firespitter plugin will then prompt if you wish to have the cargo bay animation deployed or not (it\u0027s a simple Yes/No question). This is useful if you want to open the bay doors, place a probe inside THEN toggle the animation to close the doors BEFORE launch. It\u0027s worth keeping it for that alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
