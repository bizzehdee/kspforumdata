The cost for PBAN fuel is better than it was, but it still seems excessively high. According to what I\u0027ve been able to find, the Titan 3A cost around $31mil while the Titan 3C cost around $67mil. The only difference between the two is the addition of the two UA 1205 SRBs so you\u0027d think those cost about half of what a plain Titan 3A costs. In game, it costs about around 24k to put together a Titan 3A so you\u0027d expect a Titan 3C to cost around 52k but I\u0027m seeing costs close to 128k, all because of the unit cost for the PBAN fuel.
