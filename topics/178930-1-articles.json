The rescue ship has a Mk I Crew Cabin and for whatever reason I put the scientist and his data in there. Now I\u0027m back at the lab with the crew, can\u0027t get the data out of the crew cabin, and dumbly overwrote the save that could\u0027ve let me back up to send him into the capsule. I tried EVAing next to the crew cabin but can\u0027t seem to get a \u0022Take Data\u0022 option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to get data out of a Mk 1 Crew Cabin, or did I just hose myself out of a bunch of science?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-13T23:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour EVA kerbal just wasn\u0027t floating close enough to the correct pod. An EVA kerbal\u00A0can always get data out of any pod that has data in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the data is in the pod of the rescue ship where the scientist \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eboa\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Erded the ship\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0-- not where he ended up sitting for the return trip. So my guess is\u00A0that\u0027s not the crew cabin. So the reason why the crew cabin didn\u0027t have a \u0022take data\u0022 button is that the data is not in the crew cabin.

The data was actually in the crew cabin - when I sent the rescue ship I had the scientist board it directly. What I ended up having to do was to send him back into the capsule, EVA again, and then I was able to take the data from the crew cabin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
