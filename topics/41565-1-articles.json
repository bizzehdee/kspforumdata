However, I was thinking about this, if we have FTL drives, shouldn\u0027t there be some form of experimental intermediary stages of development between them? It seems odd in my head to jump from stuff like ion and nuclear engines to FTL speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo does anyone have any (rational) idea as what would be a good intermediary steps to get from where we are to FTL?
