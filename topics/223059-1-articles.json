I also totally understand wanting to go a few months between releases so the devs can go heads down and knock out new features. However, I think one of the stressors on the community is waiting so long between the little bug fixes. Stuff like engines staying locked after time warp, or spacebar not actually staging. Unless I\u0027m missing my mark, these aren\u0027t bugs that take months to fix, but because of the update schedule and not wanting to make things worse by posting constant untested bug fixes, or burn time on repeated QA passes on tiny releases, these bugs just hang around for months, fixed on paper but still broken and causing headaches so far as the community is concerned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my suggestion is this: Depending on how the dev team is branching the game, there is presumably a \u0022main\u0022 branch, and a bunch of feature branches, and branches for various bug fixes. In between major build releases, keep a branch that includes the main branch and all the bug fixes, and release that as a Beta. Players would only download this version if they manually went into the steam Betas system and opted in to using the \u0022experimental\u0022 branch, and thus would be accepting the risk that it could implode at any time because it hasn\u0027t been properly tested. Or create a similar option on the KSP Launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has two major advantages. For the community, we get bug fixes faster, and the developers get eyes on the fixes sooner, and maybe shave off some of the rough edges before rolling everything into a full release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously this could also be extended into experimental builds that contain unreleased features, such as base building... but I\u0027ll try not to get greedy here.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ncw33","CreatedById":225125,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-17T15:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a professional software engineer, all I can say is ... patience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou say \u0022these bugs hang around for months\u0022 \u2013 it really depends how many months you\u0027re thinking of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything in the range 6 weeks \u2013 2 months \u2013 3 months would seem a reasonable release cadence for a software team.
