I understand that Bobcat has a good add-on set, but I am looking for great. With the level of visual, accuracy, and (now with the new sounds of FASA rockets) audial detail of FASA. If Bobcat is working on improving his pack to this level then that will also work. If not, I would appreciate it if someone could begin work on such an add-on.

They seem to be almost \u0022stock\u0022 in their appearance which worried me. The exceptions to this were the products by dennyTX, but the L1 does not come with the lander, and the Proton has not been updated for .25 as far as I know (like you mentioned). I guess I will have to wait until he updates these projects. That said, the R7 series developed by raidernick looked very promising. I suppose I missed them because the post is titled as \u0022Soviet Probes\u0022 and must have missed the \u0022NOW WITH ROCKETS\u0022 somehow. Thank you.
