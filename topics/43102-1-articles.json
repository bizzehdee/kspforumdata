When you make the switch you need to be going at least 150-200 m/s vertical speed. You\u0027ll then shoot up into the thinner layer of air and quickly regain any lost overall velocity. Normally I aim to get at bit more out of the air breathing engines. Around 1500 m/s at 27000m and then dip down and back up to increase the vertical speed before switching to rockets, but I spam air intakes until my planes look ugly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Syhrus","CreatedById":64839,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T22:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Moar Boosters said is correct. Your goal for the swap over to rocket boosters should involve a sudden increase in vertical speed to fling yourself into the upper atmosphere. I usually run a few tests on SSTOs to find out where their ceiling is for air intake. Try to find the exact altitude where your engines will cut out and then aim to reach maximum speed 1-2km below that. Once you\u0027re there, pitch up a little (it doesn\u0027t take much at high speed to increase your vertical speed by 200m/s or more) and swap over to rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tidus Klein","CreatedById":72277,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T12:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys Ill try your perobolic sling-shot next time I get the chance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S I added 8 new wing pieces, six new intakes, two jet engines, and two saber s,s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPushing my TWR to 1.97 in jet mode and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E3.42?\u003C/span\u003E in rocket mode, I have the flight engineer and when in rocket mode it says my TWR is 3.42 this stumped me how do you go from 1.97 with 14 engines to 3.42 with four? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But then I realized jet engines never perform at full thrust.; EX if the jet has a max thrust of 225 the most you can get out of it may be 180 before having to cut back due to intake air.
