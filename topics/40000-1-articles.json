SSTOs are supposed to be harder to orbit. If you think this is hard, look into what it takes to orbit Earth in a reusable spaceplane. It always helps to redesign your plane to have a larger amount of it\u0027s mass as fuel. A rocket only SSTO, or true SSTO must be almost entirely fuel by weight. You can lift a large amount of weight to orbit with jets in the game though, the ramjet intakes somewhat convert every jet engine to Blackbird J-58 engines. My Crusader spaceplane lifts the 11-ton Warden spy drone spaceplane to orbit easily thanks to jets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-30T05:29:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2013 05:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jason_25\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
