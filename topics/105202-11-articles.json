I got a problem, my Krebal\u0027s do not get any negative effects and go in strike when they time out of snacks. I have a question, what are all the other mod requirements for this mod to work? Yesterday I was trying for a while to get it to work with no success at all, then I happened to read in this topic that someone else had issues and were told to install Module Manager.
