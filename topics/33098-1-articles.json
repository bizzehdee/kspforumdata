The lander (using a nuclear thermal engine) would insert itself into a Mars orbit, land, spend a few days on the surface and then leave the planet again and insert itself into a Solar orbit where it would meet up with the return vehicle. I\u0027d love to try that out in KSP, but it seems like you\u0027d need perfect timing. Is there somewhere more knowledgeable in these things that could tell me how to do this in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreenDragon","CreatedById":57759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T12:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust try it?

I don\u0027t think you could find much information about it for KSP, but I guess it\u0027s doable if you know a bit how orbit and rendez vous works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst think you would need to calculate the real KSP days for it (because 60 days are for our solar system, kerbol one hav different timing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you will need to figure out how much Dv your return stage need and your lander need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe timing will be important so you don\u0027t loose too much Dv, to rendez vous with the return stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I am not sure it would be an efficient way to do it. as you would need still need the Dv to get Duna SOI, plus the Dv to rendez vous in sun orbit. and the Dv for the return stage to rendez vous back with Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile normally you wouldn\u0027t need the Dv for rendez vous around the sun as you would do a direct Duna-\u0026gt;Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow who care about efficiency if it\u0027s a fun challenge?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
