Alas, I got stuck again! I\u0027m not sure where else to turn so I hope you guys are able to help:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m building a stock spaceship with a rotating turret. I\u0027ve gotten the turret to work quite nicely, but whenever I leave and re-enter the session on the ship with the turret, the turret goes flying as soon as I undock it from the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe axle of the turret is created by two rings of Cubic Octagonal Struts around Z-200 Rechargeable Battery banks with an FL-T100 in between to stop the axle from sliding up or down (see screenshot below). It uses an Advanced Grabbing unit to dock the turret with the ship for flight and time-warping. The grabbing unit works perfectly if I don\u0027t dock the turret to the ship when leaving a session and load straight back in. The problem with this is the turret then drifts from the ship if I timewarp in another session. Docking the two together prior to leaving the session results in the aforementioned kraken-like disintegration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to see what I\u0027m talking about, you can get the craft file at: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u947i804lhyt8aa/AABrxuIIYthtM4u1m4NsmFaxa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/u947i804lhyt8aa/AABrxuIIYthtM4u1m4NsmFaxa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll find the turret slot in the middle of the ship. There\u0027s a decoupler along the side of the turret (which is currently just Remote Guidance Unit) that initially connects it to the ship that you\u0027ll need to detach once in flight (you can see the decoupler on the right side of the screenshot below). You\u0027ll find the grabbing unit below the turret which you can arm to connect the turret to the ship. I then usually timewarp to get the decoupler to float out from inside the ship. You\u0027ll obviously need to cheat the ship to orbit to test this as I haven\u0027t included a launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00227RDPmxl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7RDPmxl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also tried a variation with a Clamp-o-tron Shielded Docking Port instead of the grabbing unit, but with this I can only seem to dock and undock it once, then it refuses to reconnect the turret.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading, looking very much forward to your responses! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-11T21:32:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2020 09:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Sheiss\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-13T00:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n(I couldn\u0027t properly load the craft because of\u00A0 a part from a mod that I don\u0027t have, but I think I get the idea.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, stock bearings cannot survive load/save or time-warp, as you say, because the two parts are separated craft and KSP puts them on their individual non-interacting orbits, which drift apart during time-warp.\u00A0 When time warp is over, the individual craft find them selves in the same location, and act as if they had been forcefully placed there and spring apart violently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour redockable rotation bearing is a good way to success; just re-dock it before any time-warp.\u00A0 See the craft \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/OHara/Tough-Twin-Electro-Prop\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E and the thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173202-stock-propeller-help/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for similar solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOffset the stack-separator in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and offset back the parts attached to, it so that the separator alone is outside the craft.\u00A0 Then you don\u0027t need the time-warp trick when you decoupler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are of course mods like \u0027Infernal Robotics\u0027 that provide bearings and Squad themselves now sell a robotics mod called \u0027Breaking Ground\u0027 if you want to build this more simply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
