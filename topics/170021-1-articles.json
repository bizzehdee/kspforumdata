I fixed Google Chrome by disabling hardware acceleration, and I fixed my screensaver by switching the rendering engine from OpenGL to DirectColor (which I\u0027ve never heard of before). However, looking at the limited graphics settings in KSP, I don\u0027t see anything that would accomplish similar functionality.
