(although you might want to still ditch the final stage once the re-entry effects stop so that you don\u0027t tip over when landing)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:14:23Z","Content":"Thank you, gonna try it tomorrow ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"DJK","CreatedById":114951,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:01:24Z","Content":"The default command pods are extremely effective at managing heat during re-entry.

So heatshields are completely worthless.\n\nThey aren\u0027t worthless, the heating mechanic that was added is to give you a challenge with unprotected parts and coming in from interplanetary space. If you head straight into Kerbin atmosphere on a return trip from Jool, you better have a heat shield. If you are trying to bring back anything other than a pod, you better have a heat shield. The pods are resilient, the rest not so much.

The pod survived just fine, not getting even close to the temperature limit of 2400. Running further tests at higher speeds, will edit when done.\n\nEDIT: second test at 7km/s: capsule flipped partially nose-first, STILL survived with extreme ease. The parachute partially overheated but did not explode. Safe to say reentry heat is more than a little underpowered...\n\nEDIT2: third test at 10km/s: capsule flipped, chute exploded, but the pod still survived the heat (although it was close). fourth test, still 10km/s but this time with a periapsis of 1.5km: pod did NOT flip, and survived the reentry with similar ease to the 7km straight down test.\n\nThis is all at the standard 100% reentry heat setting btw.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Initial conditions (used infinite fuel to get the craft into position, no other cheats besides the thermal debug info):\n\u003E \n\u003E ![3E5C45C7A164993A65322B7A04A18FC2CD823A82](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/713036568649942996/3E5C45C7A164993A65322B7A04A18FC2CD823A82/)\n\u003E \n\u003E Hitting the dense part of the atmosphere:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![DFFAD527D326CB4774531785819EC20D969BCD08](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/713036568649950174/DFFAD527D326CB4774531785819EC20D969BCD08/)\n\u003E \n\u003E Peak temperature:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![675CAF7CAE3DAAF68DD50DF063B337CE9C28BC91](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/713036568649951278/675CAF7CAE3DAAF68DD50DF063B337CE9C28BC91/)\n\u003E \n\u003E And just to show Jeb made it through in one piece:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![BE0793FF4D8C1413FA95234729B9EDCA727B871F](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/713036568649952294/BE0793FF4D8C1413FA95234729B9EDCA727B871F/)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T17:50:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by armagheddonsgw**"},{"CreatedByName":"DoToH","CreatedById":68428,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:23:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you head straight into Kerbin atmosphere on a return trip from Jool, you better have a heat shield.
