Apologies if this has already been discussed elsewhere but I am having a design nightmare. I haven\u0027t been playing this game long; I need to find a way to get a returnable lander and rover to the Mun. My first problem is how to attach a rover to the lander, so I can \u0027deploy\u0027 the lander on the Mun?... or make a combined rover/lander?... I really don\u0027t know which way to go with this? How do others achieve this? Any pointers would be very much appreciated.

If you really wanted you could make them as two separate spacecraft and land them separately, as in undock them from each other in munar orbit and land them one at a time. A simple sky-crane should suffice for the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that your options are limited. I suppose you could try to mount one to the side somehow, but that would make it impossible to recover to return. I think your best bet will be way playec mentioned. If you are desperate to have the rover return too, make it super super low profile so that you can drive it under the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for engines, pack a bunch of radial engines one there, or even better download Bobcat\u0027s HOME pack or the Lack Luster Labs pack and use the radial engines from there.

This means you may need to bring larger landing gear but it makes up for it in simplicity. For the engines use maybes 4 of the orange radial ones, mounted towards the bottom, they should be enough to get you of the moon with 1 tank and all Your gear. If your using a larger lander go for a pair of the large white radial engines and mount them in the same way. You may want to angle the engines (shift\u002Bw,a,s,d,q,e) to be sure they won\u0027t burn directly onto the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T3E","CreatedById":66021,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T12:53:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this thread can give you a basic idea how to build a rover \u002B a capsule \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31390-How-are-you-landing-your-rovers/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31390-How-are-you-landing-your-rovers/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my own creations, not manned with kerbals but maybe you can get the Idea how to land.Also keep in mind that wheels have quite some impact tolerance, so it isnt that bad if they also hit the ground while landing.
