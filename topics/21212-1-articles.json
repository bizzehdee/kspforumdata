Obviously with it\u0027s terrible TWR and excellent vac Isp it\u0027s intended to be used exclusively as orbital manoeuvring engine for spacecrafts. But why would you use it? Its little brother LV-909 has the exact same Isp performance in vacuum yet with better TWR. In fact if you cluster 5 LV-909 together you get an engine cluster with exact same mass and vac Isp as one single Poodle yet with 30N higher thrust. The only thing Poodle has against this 5 engine cluster is a bigger gimbal range, but are you really going to pay that kind of performance penalty for gimbal range on a spacecraft already with plenty of steering thanks to the command pod reaction wheel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut 5 LV-909 is going to be a bit unwieldy to install. But what if you replace that poodle with a LV-T30? You\u0027ll get:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.25kg less mass for spacecraft (this is pretty big amount when you consider that\u0027s weight saved at the very tip of the rocket)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5N less max thrust\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20s worse vac Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno gimbling\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I figure, most small spacecraft don\u0027t need a gimbling engine since command pod reaction wheel provide plenty of steering. 5N of thrust is negligible and you\u0027re not firing the two engines long enough to have that 20s Isp offset that massive difference in weight. If you are actually going to fire engines in space and use up that much fuel you\u0027re probably better off with nuclear engines. So if the poodle can\u0027t beat two different combinations of engines in its role of spacecraft propulsion then what\u0027s the point of it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the mainsail, it has terrible atm Isp but excellent TWR, making it good for first stage engine to lift heavy lifters off the ground. But still, Aerospike has a TRW just as good yet with much better Isp, both in atmosphere and at lift off. A cluster of 6 Aerospike provides the exact same thrust as a mailsail yet uses much less fuel at all stages of flight. The only advantage of mainsail to Aerospike cluster is gimbling which can easily fixed by adding winglets/canards to the Aerospike cluster powered rocket. Alternatively the Aerospike cluster can be built by mixing in a few LV-T45, trading Isp and TWR for some steering. A mainsail core engine is terribly fuel inefficent if you keep it burning all the way from ground to orbit with it\u0027s low Isp and heavy weight, where as a cluster can shed outer Aerospikes and keep the center LV-T45s as it ascends and trade the now unneeded TWR for less deadweight. This is aside from the point that mainsail have to compete with SRBs (which have even higher TWR) for the role of liftoff engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with efficiency in mind, is there any point in using the two big engines?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-03T23:35:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2012 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T14:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is this Poodle you speak of?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, my 2c.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine choice depends on what your trying to achieve.

The lower engine weight of the LV-T Series of engines doesn\u0027t make up for their lower ISP once you reach a certain weight. Every engine has an advantage in a specific situation. The advantage of the Mainsail is the gimbal and thrust. The 7 LV-T30\u0027s it would take to almost equal the thrust would have 4 more mass, there is a balance you have to find. I typically only use 1 of these engines on my heavy lifting craft where the large gimbal engine is needed for control, but I supplement that with higher ISP non gimbaling engines in the asparagus stages, and I jettison it before reaching orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s 2 things to consider. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. # of parts.

Yeah, that\u0027s right. One of these updates will bring a campaign mode (the option is already on the menu) and you will have to actually spend kerbalbucks on these things. Currently 1 Mainsail costs the same as 1 Aerospike. This is something we are going to have to take into account when campaign mode comes along, and when it does, if the prices are what they are now, there is no way you will slap 6 Aerospikes on instead of a mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-03T17:42:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2012 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Ziff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T17:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no reason you can\u0027t use fuel transfer pipes to feed multiple engines from one tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T18:16:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe C7 engines are terribly unbalanced compared to the regular rocket engines (A jet engine being able to lift a rocket?!
