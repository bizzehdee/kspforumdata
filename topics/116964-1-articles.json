Which I finally did manage to install successfully.\n\nSomehow KSP doesn\u0027t boot on this fresh new install. (yes I downloaded the linux version) Maybe it is because I\u0027m using 14.04 instead of ubuntu 15.\n\nWhenever I double click one of the exe it says ubuntu can\u0027t open it, it made me search for a appropriate program and it came up with pypar. But pypar doesn\u0027t open the KSP exe files. Upon research pypar seems to be a archive repair tool and has nothing to do with the purpose of opening a exe. By the way, how do I configure ubuntu to stop opening the ksp exe files automatically with pypar.\n\nI know lnux doesn\u0027t open exes, but it did on my old install.

If your binary is called \u0022KSP.x86\\_64.exe\u0022 you\u0027ve got the wrong download.\n\nThe easiest way to get some more information is to open up a terminal window, \u0022cd\u0022 to wherever you\u0027ve extracted/installed KSP, and try to run the binary.\n\neg, You\u0027ve installed it in your home directory, ~/KSP (I\u0027m making this up, I have no idea where a non-Steam install goes), then you\u0027d do the following (where \u0022$\u0022 means your command prompt, it\u0027s not something you\u0027d type in):\n\n$ **cd** ~/KSP\n\n -\u003E This **c**hanges **d**irectory to the KSP directory; replace \u0022~/KSP\u0022 with wherever you installed/extracted KSP.\n\n$ **ls** -l\n\n -\u003E This **l**i**s**ts (in **-** **l**ong format) the directory; check to make sure you have KSP.x86 and KSP.x86\\_64, and that they do NOT have the .exe endings, and that they are executable.\n\n$ LC\\_ALL=C **./KSP.x86\\_64**\n\n -\u003E This runs the KSP.x86\\_64 binary (assuming you\u0027re in the correct directory, the binary exists, and it is executable). The \u0022LC\\_ALL=C\u0022 is kinda optional, but it reduces problems on enough systems that I always recommend to add it; it won\u0027t break anything.\n\nYou should now either get KSP starting up, or get some sort of errors popping up on in the terminal. Please post the result.\n\nAs for fixing opening \u0022.exe\u0022\u0027s on Linux, generally you\u0027d need to install Wine (Wine Is Not an Emulator) which gives you access to some Windows APIs, allowing you to run (some) Windows binaries under Linux. How you\u0027d break the association with pypar I don\u0027t know - that depends on your desktop environment. If you\u0027re running standard Ubuntu that would be Unity, and I haven\u0027t used that in years, but there should be a configuration option somewhere."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T11:26:39Z","Content":"Don\u0027t open the .exe, that\u0027s the Windows binary.\n\nYou want \u0027KSP.x86\\_64\u0027, it should be marked executable (\\*nix equivalent of .exe file extension) already but if not a \u0027chmod \u002Bx KSP.x86\\_64\u0027 will make it so.\n\nDang ninjas ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAlso worth noting, I hear \u0022had to reinstall\u0022 far to often... almost any screwup can be fixed without a reinstall on GNU/Linux.
