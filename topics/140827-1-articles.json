I thought it would be amusing to try and do both at once, and I have access to the Rhino and Mammoth via experimental contracts, so I built a single huge ship to try and deliver a lander and a satellite to each in a single run. After a couple of launch attempts I got it on course for Duna, to arrive in about four months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the VAB it looked like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vab.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://files.feymarch.net/kerbal/vab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payload satellites/landers look like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022payload.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://files.feymarch.net/kerbal/payload.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach is pretty much a full-service job; all available science modules are on board, plenty of electricity, and the landers have RCS with a good bit of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the mothership in flight, en route:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022explorer.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://files.feymarch.net/kerbal/explorer.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks rather majestic, if I say so myself. The main tank has about one-quarter of its fuel left, which will be important later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, it was only after getting this beast on its way that I thought to ask about whether what I had in mind was likely to work on the far end. The payload has two stacked landers and two satellites, one each for Duna and Ike. The idea is to get the satellites into polar orbits and the landers on the ground -- preferably in one piece. Functionally, all the pieces are there. But I\u0027ve never been to Duna and don\u0027t really know what to expect as far as fuel requirements go. I based my design on Mun landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy flight plan: On approach to Duna, I want to release the two satellites. I\u0027m pretty sure the two terriers can get them into their respective orbits without much trouble, and it reduces the mass the mothership needs to push around. The landers are more difficult. I don\u0027t know how fast I\u0027m going to be going relative to my targets on the way in. They *might* be able to get into orbit and down to the surface under their own power unaided...but I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m thinking it might be best to use the remaining fuel in the main tank to get into Ike orbit with both landers attached. Assuming I can do that, the Ike lander should have no trouble getting down. That leaves the Duna lander, which will have to fall all the way to Duna and land under its own power. My main concern with this plan is that, while I know Duna has a thinner atmosphere and lower gravity than Kerbin, I don\u0027t know how that affects things. I have two radial parachutes, but no heat shield. I have a full fuel tank but it\u0027s not huge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I have spare fuel in the mothership to get out of Ike orbit and on course for Duna, that saves me some on the lander. Enough? Unsure. If I don\u0027t need to do mothership shenanigans, I\u0027d like to leave what\u0027s left of it in Ike orbit for future use as a tanker (hence the docking ports).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA possible alternate plan: If the Ike lander can get from inbound to surface on its own, I could detach it when I detach the satellites and have all the mothership fuel to help the Duna lander get down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, first question is, is either plan feasible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd second question: I\u0027d *like* to follow up this mission with a manned one. But I\u0027m concerned that by the time this mission arrives and I get to see how it works, Duna\u0027s orbital position will have fallen behind enough to make a second mission difficult. Do I need to launch my manned mission sooner?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-30T19:43:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2016 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Error_Sophius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGot Duna\u0026#039;s moon mixed up with Kerbol\u0026#039;s second planet.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T19:19:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you want to launch two satellites and two landers in a single mission and send one of each to Duna and Eve? Well... I suppose it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0possible, depending on your skill, but it would be much more feasible to send a different mission to each planet. You\u0027ll spend a lot more fuel going from Kerbin to Duna to Eve with one ship than you would with sending smaller spacecraft on separate launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding on Eve is stupid easy, you won\u0027t need to use an engine at all unless you didn\u0027t put a parachute or the lander is excessively heavy. Taking off from Eve is... not easy, but since you\u0027re sending a probe right now, there\u0027s no need to worry about that. Also, if you didn\u0027t bring a heatshield on the Eva lander, it\u0027s not going to land 9/10 times. Eve\u0027s atmosphere is many times thicker than Kerbin\u0027s and you will experience more brutal\u00A0heating effects for longer than you would on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause Duna has an atmosphere, it takes less DeltaV to land on it than it does to land on the Mun. Your parachutes will help you, but you will want to tweak them to deploy as soon as possible (just not so high up that they burn up). Unless you went crazy \u00A0and brought upwards of a dozen chutes, you will need to use that rocket engine, but with the huge fuel tank you\u0027ve gone with, you shouldn\u0027t run out of fuel. If you feel confident landing on the Mun, you should be ready for Duna. The planet\u0027s atmosphere is so thin that you shouldn\u0027t need a heatshield unless you come in at a crazy high speed, which won\u0027t happen as long as you insert the\u00A0lander into orbit before landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last suggestion regarding designing robotic landers for Duna/Eve; Make them as light as possible. The lighter they are, the less power you need to get them there, the easier they are to\u00A0control, and the easier they are to land. If you give me a few hours I\u0027ll see if I can either dig up one of my Duna landers from an older version of KSP or build an example one for you if it turns out that I accidentally deleted my older installs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n/lecture\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-30T19:22:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2016 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by pTrevTrevs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Error_Sophius","CreatedById":156232,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T19:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDamnit, I meant Ike, not Eve.
