What *is* an issue is that modules which convert resources to thrust are engines, so your propellor is always going to have to be an engine itself - so \u0022torque\u0022 is just fuel and you might as well remove the conversion bit. What we actually need is a custom engine module that converts fuel into some sort of power dependent on the engine type - controlled by throttle/other graphs - and power consumers which provide motion of some sort. The basics are simple - just have to cut the current engine module in half, really - hooking the parts together sensibly when they\u0027re stuck on a craft might be a bit harder. I say \u0022dependent on the engine type\u0022 because you will want to limit what consumers can be attached to what generators at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-14T12:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222716571\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022145861\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221471160733\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Van Disaster\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Van Disaster said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmodules which convert resources to thrust are engines, so your propellor is always going to have to be an engine itself - so \u0022torque\u0022 is just fuel and you might as well remove the conversion bit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EYes\u003C/strong\u003E, if all you want is a straightforward aesthetic propellor engine; \u003Cstrong\u003ENo\u003C/strong\u003E, if what you want is an electric motor that can have application-appropriate prop blades mounted to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m proposing is not that different from the air-intake part / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E engine part relationship:\u00A0 you must have an intake (motor) module to harvest/generate the vital resource, but you choose the appropriate engine (prop) depending on where and how you\u0027re going to use it.
