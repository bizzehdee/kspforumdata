Since not everyone would want to use certain mods, I decided to put EVA hatches anyway. Fusty\u0027s original Mk II Node models had a emergency escape hatch located on the side, which I found to be somewhat unrealistic, so in R0.01a and R0.02a, I instead reassigned the EVA hatches to the forward hatch mesh on the modules, where they would be covered up by docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, an invisible collider box is used to determined the bounds of the airlock area where the Kerbal on EVA would spawn in - this collider also checks to see if the hatch is being obstructed by other objects, and if so, prevents EVA from that location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock KSP and most mod command pods have their EVA hatches very close to their part origins (\u0026lt;1m in-game).
