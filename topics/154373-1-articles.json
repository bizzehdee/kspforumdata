I have an issue that I couldn\u0027t find already asked here. I have begun an orbital space station using the Umbra Space Industries Orbital Shipyard and the stock Mobile Processing Lab. These are the only two parts so far that have crew and productivity. I have both full (shipyard = 4, lab = 2) and all kerbals onboard are very low stupidity. I tried using each part (i.e. \u0022Starting Research\u0022 in the lab, and building a vessel in the shipyard), but found this problem right away: both of these parts have a productivity value of -2.9800322e-08. With both of these parts having identical productivity (even though the kerbals are different specialties and stupidity), something must be wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know what might cause this productivity issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hollyfeld","CreatedById":121771,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-09T02:58:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever figured out the cause of this productivity problem, but it apparently fixed itself by simply restarting KSP.
