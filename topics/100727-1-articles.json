Chapter 3 should be incoming sometime later this week.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, I\u0027m going to be taking advantage of this reply to move the first chapter out of the topic (so I can link to it properly).\n\n**Introduction**\n\n Fifty years ago, kerbalkind took its first small steps off of Kerbin and out into the wider universe. But while we all know the stories of the first M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn landings, very little is actually known about the people, technologies, and events that took us there. That is, until now. To celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of *Excelsior 5*, the KSA has released previously unavailable documents relating to the agency\u0027s early spaceflight programs. KBS has also been granted several exclusive interviews with many current and former KSA personnel. Now, KBS is proud to present, *Because It\u0027s There: The Untold Story of the KSA*.\n\n**Chapter 1: Liftoff**\n\n The Kerbal Space Agency began as the brainchild of His Greenness, Supreme Dictator for Life (Until His Untimely Death in a Pogo-Stick Accident), Joey S. Kerman. In his now famous speech to Kongress, His Greenness explained the logic behind its creation.\n\n\u0022Kongresskerbs, some of you have asked me why I want us to go to space. The answer is very simple: Because it\u0027s there. For thousands of years, kerbals have gazed up at the night sky, wondering if there are any snacks there. I say we should find out. We go to space to find the answers to the important questions. Questions like, \u0027Is Minmus really made of pudding?\u0027 and \u0027Are those seas of soda on Laythe?\u0027 Also, I was bored, and this seemed interesting.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 His Greenness, Supreme Dictator for Life (Until His Untimely Death in a Pogo-Stick Accident), Joey S. Kerman\n\n Unfortunately for the fledgling space agency, it would have to accomplish all of this on a shoestring budget. The Kerbal government had no money to fund a space program, having spent most of it on high performance pogo-sticks.\n\n However, what it lacked in funds, the agency more than made up for with talent. Using what little budget he had and large amounts of snacks, Administrator and Flight Director Gene Kerman managed to assemble a team of Kerbin\u0027s smartest scientists, its best engineers, and its greatest pilots.\n\n\u0022I remember the first time I met him, after applying to be a cosmonaut. He called me into his office for an interview, asked me what kind of experience I had. I told him I\u0027d been a test pilot for ten years, that I\u0027d been one of the first kerbals to break the sound barrier in controlled flight. That kind of thing. We talked for a while. At the end, he looked me straight in the eye and said, \u0027Jeb, we need pilots. Not just good pilots, not even great pilots. We need the best pilots there are. So tell me, are you that pilot? Do you have what it takes to go to space?\u0027 And I said, \u0027I don\u0027t know. Guess we\u0027ll have to try it and find out.\u0027 That\u0027s how I became the first cosmonaut.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Jebediah Kerman, Pilot\n\n The rockets that would carry these cosmonauts into space would be designed by Doctor Wernher von Kerman, a kerbal considered by many to be the father of modern rocketry.\n\n\u0022He was a genius. If it hadn\u0027t been for him, we\u0027d still be playing with fireworks. There will probably never be another rocket designer of his caliber. Certainly not in my lifetime. Of course, he was absolutely awful at naming things.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Ambrose Kerman, VAB Engineer\n\n The effort to place a kerbal into space was called the Excelsior program. The Excelsior program was to consist of six missions using progressively larger rockets and attaining greater heights each time, ultimately culminating in an orbital flight. Each mission would carry one cosmonaut to altitude, along with several scientific instruments. The position of pilot for each mission would rotate between the KSA\u0027s two pilots, Jebediah Kerman and Thomplin Kerman.\n\n\u0022Jeb was going to be the pilot for the first mission. This would have also made him the pilot for\n\n*Excelsior 5*\n\n, which was going to be the first mission to space, while I would pilot\n\n*Excelsior 6*\n\non the first orbital mission. Of course, we all know that things didn\u0027t work out that way.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\n\u0022Sitting in that tiny capsule atop several tons of explosives \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 because really, the R2 wasn\u0027t much more than a controlled explosion \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 sitting there, waiting for the countdown to finish and the engine to ignite \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it was the longest ten seconds of my life.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Jebediah Kerman, Pilot\n\n![N0iYOPr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/N0iYOPr.jpg)\n\n *Excelsior 1* worked perfectly. The Rocket 2 successfully carried it to an altitude of approximately 5000 meters before detaching from the capsule. The capsule splashed down safely in the ocean east of KSC, and was successfully recovered. The Rocket 2 used in the launch was lost when it splashed down at high speed, due to a lack of parachutes.\n\n *Excelsior 2* also went swimmingly. The capsule, containing Thomplin Kerman, was lofted to an altitude of around 11000 meters atop a Rocket 2b. The launch stage detached correctly, and both capsule and rocket splashed down safely east of KSC and were recovered.\n\n![js5OIi7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/js5OIi7.jpg)\n\n The next mission, *Excelsior 3*, went smoothly, successfully reaching an altitude of 22000 meters, although the capsule and rocket touched down very close to the VAB, which concerned some of the mission controllers.\n\n\u0022When they realized that the capsule was coming down over the VAB, mission control started freaking out. They were afraid that I would hit the edge and roll off, or that the parachute would get caught on a ledge. And even if I landed safely on the roof, they\u0027d still need to get a helicopter to get the capsule down. It was a pretty close thing, too. Ended up landing about 20 meters away from it.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Jebediah Kerman, Pilot\n\n![5SMaIyo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5SMaIyo.jpg)\n\n *Excelsior 4* achieved a height of over 33000 meters, touching down safely west of KSC.\n\n![ZeSkUwm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZeSkUwm.jpg)\n\n The next mission was *Excelsior 5*, which would use the same Rocket 3 used in the previous two missions to escape the atmosphere on a suborbital trajectory, carrying cosmonaut Jebediah Kerman into space.\n\n\u0022Was I angry that Jeb got to be the first kerbal in space? No, not at all. After all, I was going to be the first kerbal to achieve orbit. At least, that\u0027s what we thought at the time.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\n *Excelsior 5* successfully reached an altitude of almost 80 kilometers. At this height, the atmosphere is thin enough to allow an orbit with negligible atmospheric drag.\n\n\u0022The view from space is breathtaking. With no atmosphere to get in the way you can see so many more stars than you can on Kerbin. And Kerbin. Kerbin is beautiful. From that high up you can easily see the curvature of the planet. As you ascend, the horizons just fall away, curving back beyond the planet. It\u0027s amazing.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Jebediah Kerman, Pilot\n\n However, *Excelsior 5* was more than a sightseeing trip. The capsule carried several instruments to study the environment, and the descent back into the atmosphere would be used to test the aerodynamic properties of the capsule.\n\n\u0022Once I reached apoapsis, I was supposed to detach from the R3 launcher and orient the capsule for reentry. The idea was to try and control the reentry vector by using the small amount of lift generated by the lifting body effect on the capsule. It worked, too. I ended up landing almost a kilometer away from the R3, unlike previous flights which landed almost on top of it.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Jebediah Kerman, Pilot\n\n![X5QKHsa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/X5QKHsa.jpg)\n\n The string of successful missions that had begun with *Excelsior 1* ended with *Excelsior 6*. The command module of *Excelsior 6* was larger than those of previous flights, due to new instruments being carried aboard. This new command module would be placed into orbit by the three stage Rocket 5, which consisted of a Rocket 1 first stage, a Rocket 3 second stage, and a Rocket 4 orbital insertion stage. For stability reasons, three fins had been added to the second stage.\n\n![q9z0jwX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/q9z0jwX.jpg)\n\n\u0022It was the fins. They made the rocket too stable. To make orbit, I was supposed to pitch the rocket down along the 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 direction \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 basically, turn it east \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 decreasing the pitch as I got higher. But the fins kept the rocket pointing straight up, and I couldn\u0027t get the rocket to turn. Once I got up into the higher atmosphere, the fins lost most of their control, so I was able to turn using reaction wheels. I tried to do the orbit insertion, but I\u0027d wasted too much fuel going straight up. I ended up with an apoapsis of about 100 kilometers and a periapsis of 40 kilometers. Too deep inside the atmosphere.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\n![BY7BDgU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BY7BDgU.jpg)\n\n The fins were changed into control surfaces for *Excelsior 7*, which successfully reached orbit and safely reentered, landing in the ocean west of KSC. Its pilot was Jebediah Kerman.\n\n![5fz6vYP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5fz6vYP.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T04:07:18Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 04:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GreenWolf**\n  \nGuess"},{"CreatedByName":"GreenWolf","CreatedById":65798,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:15:11Z","Content":"**Chapter 2: Testbed**\n\nThe Excelsior Program was succeeded by the Zenith Program. The Zenith Program consisted of several orbital flights, all meant to test technologies and procedures necessary to go farther \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and beyond. Additionally, under the Zenith Program, the KSA recruited five more cosmonauts, bringing the total number to ten.\n\n\u0022Unlike Excelsior, there wasn\u0027t a lot of reuse of hardware in Zenith. All the Excelsior missions \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 except for six and seven \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 used the same command module design, and there was a lot of reuse of rockets in design and flight. R3 was mostly just a longer R2, R4 was basically R2 with a different engine, and R5 was literally just an R1, an R3, and an R4 stuck together. But Zenith used different hardware for almost every launch. It wasn\u0027t so much a spaceflight program as it was a bunch of different one-off missions with a common goal.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Ambrose Kerman, VAB Engineer\n\nThe first Zenith mission was flown by Thomplin Kerman into a High Kerbin Orbit. It used a Rocket 6 as the launch vehicle, and used a modified *Excelsior 6* command module. A commercial satellite was carried on top of the command module as a secondary payload. The mission goals included studying the space in HKO, delivering the satellite, and performing the first EVA.\n\n![x4zXj18.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/x4zXj18.jpg)\n\n\u0022The R6 is a monster. It\u0027s based off of the R5, but you wouldn\u0027t know that from flying it. The orbit insertion stage is a lengthened R4 and the launch stage is a lengthened R3, but that\u0027s not where the real difference is. See, the R5 used a single small SRB as a boost stage to give the rest of the rocket enough height and speed to get to orbit. But the R6 uses four larger strap-on SRBs as a boost stage.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\nThese strap-on boosters nearly destroyed the vehicle during launch.\n\n\u0022So the SRBs ignite, and the whole ship starts accelerating. The G-forces are tremendous. And remember, I can\u0027t see a thing, since the whole command module is enclosed in a fairing because the satellite being carried on the nose is such a weird shape. The whole rocket is vibrating violently, and I\u0027m worried that it\u0027s going to shake itself apart. CAPCOM is saying something about dynamic pressure rising, and I can hear someone at mission control saying the nose is wobbling.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\nTelemetry from the launch shows that a few seconds before SRB shutdown, the nose of the rocket had begun to wobble from side to side, causing a huge increase in dynamic pressure.\n\n\u0022Afterwards, control tells me that the nose of the rocket almost broke off during launch. Which would have sent me careening straight into the SRBs.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\n![EY0550r.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EY0550r.jpg)\n\nThe rest of the mission proceeds nominally, with satellite deployment and EVA going as planned\n\n![OKku33u.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OKku33u.jpg)\n\n\u0022Going on EVA for the first time ever was incredible. In the command module, you only have this tiny little window in the door. But when you\u0027re outside, you can see everything. It\u0027s just you, alone in the suit, floating 300 kilometers above Kerbin. It\u0027s so peaceful. There isn\u0027t a better view to be found in the universe.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\n*Zenith 1* safely splashes down east of KSC. However, the incident during the launch causes Gene Kerman to place a moratorium on the further use of SRBs on crewed vehicles\n\n Work began immediately on a liquid fueled replacement for Rocket 6. The result was Rocket 7, a massive launcher that would easily be able to fulfill the KSA\u0027s needs.\n\n\u0022The R7 was a paradigm shift from all previous launch vehicles. It took the long, spindly fuels tanks with single engines that had categorized previous launch vehicles, and replaced them with wide, short tanks with engine clusters. Whereas previous vehicles had been reusing older suborbital rockets as stages in an orbital rocket, each stage in the R7 was designed from the beginning to be used in an orbital launcher. And most importantly, the R7 dispensed with the solid rocket motors used in the R5 and R6, replacing them with liquid fueled boosters.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Ambrose Kerman, VAB Engineer\n\nThe new launch vehicle was first used to place *Zenith 2* and its piggyback payload into a highly inclined orbit. *Zenith 2* featured yet another redesign of the command module, and carried with it a small mapping satellite.\n\n\u0022\n\n*Zenith 2*\n\nwas my first flight as a cosmonaut. I had previous flight experience as a high-speed pogo-stick test pilot, but nothing can really prepare you for that moment when the engines light and you start to accelerate away from the launchpad. And the R7 is a powerful machine. On launch, the four core engines and the two booster engines are putting out a total of 1.29 million Newtons of thrust, giving the whole thing a thrust to weight ratio of 2.21.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Romal Kerman, Pilot\n\n![xahPfcs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xahPfcs.jpg)\n\nThe primary mission of *Zenith 2* was to test the new long duration command module. As this could be done in any orbit, the *Maxwell 1 Kerbin Altimetry Recorder* mission was folded into it, using the Zenith as a carrier. Because this would put the Zenith into a polar orbit, a secondary mission of making visual observations of the planet was also added to the mission profile.\n\n![tapQFUr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tapQFUr.jpg)\n![sjXj0NQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sjXj0NQ.jpg)\n\n\u0022Ascent and orbital insertion went perfectly, leaving the Zenith in a circular orbit 497 kilometers above Kerbin, with an inclination of approximately 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I deployed the satellite, then waited for it to reach a safe distance before doing another burn to lower my periapsis to 200 kilometers. After circularizing at 200 kilometers, the secondary mission began. Which basically meant enjoying the view for the next two days.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Romal Kerman, Pilot\n\n![WOFFJAr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WOFFJAr.jpg)\n![v5qYiWX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/v5qYiWX.jpg)\n\n*Zenith 2* safely landed a few kilometers south of the KSC.\n\nThe hardware for the next Zenith mission would take time to develop and build, and with another R7 already ready to launch, the KSA made the decision to use it to launch another commercial satellite.\n\nThe next Zenith mission was the *Zenith 3/Zenith 4* orbital rendezvous and docking test. It would make use of yet another new command module, and would test the new reaction control system and docking mechanisms. *Zenith 3* would be flown by Nelvey Kerman, while *Zenith 4* would be flown by Thomplin Kerman.\n\n![h9LEcbf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/h9LEcbf.jpg)\n\n\u0022Was I nervous? Of course I was! No one had ever attempted rendezvous and docking before, and now I was going to try to do it on my first mission! No pressure, right?\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Nelvey Kerman, Pilot\n\n![BDTTzDn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BDTTzDn.jpg)\n\n*Zenith 3* launched first, placing itself in a 250 kilometer equatorial orbit. *Zenith 4* launched shortly afterwards, inserting itself into a 100 kilometer parking orbit.\n\n![sy8PkBY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sy8PkBY.jpg)\n![WeZ4TGP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WeZ4TGP.jpg)\n\n\u0022The idea was for me to sit in the lower orbit until the phase angles were right. Then, I would do a burn to raise my apoapsis to 250 kilometers and bring our relative velocities to 0.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\n![hbCQUrS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hbCQUrS.jpg)\n\nThe rendezvous went fine, with Thomplin managing to bring the vessels within a kilometer of each other. However, it was at this point that the problems began.\n\n\u0022I couldn\u0027t see him. We were on the night side of the planet, and neither of us had running lights. And our docking cameras didn\u0027t work, because some idiot had installed them underneath the docking adapters. So we had to rely on instruments.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\n![srDVPlM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/srDVPlM.jpg)\n\nThomplin began bringing *Zenith 4* towards *Zenith 3*, successfully bringing them within ten meters of each other using just the instrumentation.\n\n\u0022I could just see the outline of his ship against the planet. At this point, we were close enough that if you\u0027d stuck your hand out of the airlock, you could have touched the other ship. We started final docking maneuvers, thinking that we were going to pull it off.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Nelvey Kerman, Pilot\n\n![tz2kf9F.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tz2kf9F.jpg)\n\nBut it was not to be. The two ships made multiple docking attempts, each time coming within centimeters of docking, but unable to dock the two ships.\n\n\u0022It was the rotation. See, as we orbited the planet, the ships would rotate with respect to the orientation direction. We\u0027d line up the ports and begin an approach, only to have the port rotate away. We tried to point along the north/south nodes, but we even then, we couldn\u0027t line up the velocity vectors correctly, because the RCS wasn\u0027t balanced properly. Lateral translation would change our forward motion, screwing up the approach.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\nMission control called for a mission abort, and ordered the two cosmonauts to return home. As the two cosmonauts prepared for reentry, KSA engineers had already started looking for solutions to the docking problem and begun preparing the next Zenith missions, which were planned to carry multiple cosmonauts into space in a single command module.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T04:08:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 04:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GreenWolf**\n  \nReasons"},{"CreatedByName":"GreenWolf","CreatedById":65798,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T16:57:43Z","Content":"**Chapter 3: Miracle**\n\nAfter *Zenith 3* and *Zenith 4* had failed to dock several times, mission control called for an abort to the test, and ordered the cosmonauts to come home. *Zenith 3* would return first, followed by *Zenith 4* a few hours later.\n\nOr at least, that was the plan.\n\n![Q4BTRCr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Q4BTRCr.jpg)\n\n\u0022I used the RCS in the command module to deorbit and set myself up on a trajectory that would splash down east of KSC. Reentry went fine, and everything seemed fine. Then, when it came time to deploy the parachutes, nothing happened. I tried deploying them again, and still nothing happened. And then I realized that I didn\u0027t have parachutes.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Nelvey Kerman, Pilot\n\n![OwLq7vd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OwLq7vd.jpg)\n\nDuring assembly in the VAB, the engineer responsible for installing the parachutes on *Zenith 3* and *Zenith 4* had been on sick leave. Due to an administrative oversight, no one else had been tasked with installing them, and so the two craft had been launched into space with no way of coming back.\n\n\u0022I didn\u0027t panic. I only had a few thousand meters left to act, and if I wanted to live, I couldn\u0027t afford to panic. Instead, I began firing the RCS, desperately trying to shed enough speed to survive lithobraking. I hit the sea going somewhere around 50 meters per second. The command module just disintegrated around me. Somehow, I survived.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Nelvey Kerman, Pilot\n\nAlthough Nelvey survived, he was far from unharmed. Most of the bones in his body were broken, and he had severe internal bleeding. If he hadn\u0027t splashed down right off the shore from KSC, he would have certainly died from his injuries. As it was, KSC first responders were able to stabilize him, and the cosmonaut was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery.\n\nTo make matters worse, the same oversight that had destroyed *Zenith 3* had also left *Zenith 4* without parachutes. Fortunately, *Zenith 4* had not yet started its deorbit burn when this was discovered, and the reentry was aborted. However, now Thomplin Kerman was stranded in orbit, with no way to get home.\n\n\u0022I wasn\u0027t too worried. I had enough supplies to last me half a month, and I knew from past turn around times that it would take KSA less time than that to get something up to me. Honestly, I was more concerned about Nelvey.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\nThomplin was correct in his assumption. KSA already had an R7 ready, and the two person Zenith 5 command module, which had been scheduled for testing on the next launch, was quickly refitted into a rescue craft. Jebediah Kerman, as the most experienced pilot at KSA, was chosen to fly the rescue mission.\n\n\u003E ![l7reSZA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/l7reSZA.jpg)\n\n\u0022The original mission plan for the\n\n*Zenith 5*\n\nwas for me and Bill to fly it into orbit for a flight test. What happened instead of that was, the Zenith was rushed to launchpad with most of its nonessential systems missing and a downmass tug strapped to the nose. I was supposed to fly it up to\n\n*Zenith 4*\n\nand dock if I could. If I couldn\u0027t I was supposed to get close enough for Thomplin to EVA over.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Jebediah Kerman, Pilot\n\n![Qj7RDG3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Qj7RDG3.jpg)\n![8vAADMm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8vAADMm.jpg)\n\n*Zenith 5* made the ascent to orbit as quickly as possible. Once in orbit, Jebediah rendezvoused with *Zenith 4*, carefully bringing the two craft closer together.\n\n![1wC60xC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1wC60xC.jpg)\n\n\u0022The plan was for Jeb to perform the rendezvous, and then for me to close the distance. Once I was close enough, Jeb would detach from the R7 upper stage and begin docking, since the RCS on his craft was properly balanced.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\n![L9BPA1R.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/L9BPA1R.jpg)\n\n\u0022The docking went incredibly smoothly. Tom pointed\n\n*Zenith 4*\n\n\u0027s nose along the north-south direction, keeping it from rotating, and then I slid in from above, killing lateral velocity with RCS. Once I was directly above the docking port, all I had to do was make a small RCS burn forwards.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Jebediah Kerman, Pilot\n\n![LMMml8O.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LMMml8O.jpg)\n\n\u0022Compared to the difficulties I\u0027d had docking with\n\n*Zenith 3*\n\n, the docking with\n\n*Zenith 5*\n\nwent perfectly. Once we were docked, I crawled over into\n\n*Zenith 5*\n\n, then we undocked, leaving the downmass tug attached to\n\n*Zenith 4*\n\n.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Thomplin Kerman, Pilot\n\n![OQIp7YC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OQIp7YC.jpg)\n![qYmX2aJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qYmX2aJ.jpg)\n\nJebediah and Thomplin then returned to Kerbin in *Zenith 5*. Once they had safely reentered, the downmass tug attached to *Zenith 4* deorbited the derelict ship.\n\n![4pWLKMj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4pWLKMj.jpg)\n![FBfaKns.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FBfaKns.jpg)\n\n![LiiJZT8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LiiJZT8.jpg)\n\n![HUxas9Q.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HUxas9Q.jpg)\n\n![ipB0Kt1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ipB0Kt1.jpg)\n\nFollowing the parachute debacle, the manned spaceflight program was put on hold until the internal investigation was finished. However, an unmanned commercial launch did happen during this time, with Satellite 3 being placed into orbit by the new Rocket 7b.\n\n![JMgKxh9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JMgKxh9.jpg)\n![13v7cmr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/13v7cmr.jpg)\n\n![QXFFbUB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QXFFbUB.jpg)\n\n![fMSh14G.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fMSh14G.jpg)\n\nThe internal investigation concluded shortly after this. Its final conclusion was that the primary reason for the loss of *Zenith 3* was administrative incompetence in the engineering department. It recommended sweeping reforms of this department, and an overhaul of its safety procedures. Once these were completed, the Zenith program could continue.\n\nTo make up for the loss of Nelvey Kerman, who was on indefinite medical leave following his crash in *Zenith 3*, two more cosmonauts were selected, Kenbree Kerman and Jermin Kerman. There were now active 11 cosmonauts working for KSA.\n\nThe first launch of the continued Zenith program was *Zenith Station*, an orbital space station, and by far the largest payload carried by a Rocket 7 up to that point in time. *Zenith Station* was placed into an equatorial, 250 kilometer orbit, and was launched uncrewed.\n\n\u003E ![Si81T8q.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Si81T8q.jpg)\n\n![d1YLjXH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/d1YLjXH.jpg)\n\n![O0MuxKG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/O0MuxKG.jpg)\n\nThe next launch after that was *Zenith 6*, which would carry Jermin Kerman and Ronbal Kerman up to *Zenith Station* to become its first crew. This launch proceeded smoothly, and the two cosmonauts were able to successfully dock to the space station.\n\n\u003E ![WTClaEU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WTClaEU.jpg)\n\n![X6VHskJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/X6VHskJ.jpg)\n\n![8Q895tz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8Q895tz.jpg)\n\n\u0022We didn\u0027t have any problems with the docking. The unbalanced RCS on\n\n*Zenith 3*\n\nand\n\n*Zenith 4*\n\nthat had kept them from docking had been corrected in\n\n*Zenith 5*\n\n, and then refined even further in\n\n*Zenith 6*\n\n.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Ronbal Kerman, Engineer\n\n![CZpliIx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CZpliIx.jpg)\n![jYHHjnx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jYHHjnx.jpg)\n\nOnce *Zenith 6* was securely docked to *Zenith Station*, the two cosmonauts detached the Rocket 7b upper stage that had put the station in orbit. The stage was then deorbited and recovered.\n\n![WeQZknY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WeQZknY.jpg)\n![R9rk5Rw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/R9rk5Rw.jpg)\n\nHowever, even as the Zenith program reached new heights, both figuratively and literally, it was nearing its end, as Gene Kerman and Wernher von Kerman prepared for the successor to Zenith: Project M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnshot.\n\nUsing the technologies developed and tested during the Zenith program, they planned to send cosmonauts to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Wernher von Kerman outlined the basic plan behind Project M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnshot in this memo to Gene Kerman.\n\n**PROJECT M\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u201CNSHOT**\n\n1.

It would require the development of four new spacecraft with very different functions and roles, as well as a launcher to put them into space.\n\nThe first of these were the orbital propellant depots, codenamed Prosperity, which would be placed in orbit around Kerbin and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. These depots were critical to any attempt to go to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, as without these the reusable space tug and lander would be impossible.\n\n\u0022The\n\n*Prosperity*\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Wernher wanted to name it Orbital Propellant Depot 1, but we\u0027d stopped letting him name things by that point \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the\n\n*Prosperity*\n\nwas the key to the whole thing. Without it, we couldn\u0027t have had the reusable lander or the space tug, and that would have meant throwing away hundreds of thousands of kredits worth of hardware with every mission.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Ambrose Kerman, VAB Engineer\n\n\u003E ![7wM1p3c.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7wM1p3c.jpg)\n\nThe final design of *Prosperity* would dictate the design constraints of all of the other craft. However, the vehicle most affected by *Prosperity*\u0027s design was the R7-Derived Multirole Launch Vehicle, dubbed *Liberty*, which would be used to place it, and all of the other hardware for Project M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnshot, into a 250 kilometer equatorial orbit around Kerbin.\n\n\u0022\n\n*Liberty*\n\nhad to be able to lift the 30 ton\n\n*Prosperity*\n\nmodule into orbit, preferably with all or most of its fuel. When this proved to be nearly impossible to achieve using current hardware, the design constraints were loosened. In the end,\n\n*Liberty*\n\nwould carry the module into orbit empty, then transfer most of the remaining fuel in the insertion stage into the module. Since launches of other M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnshot hardware using the\n\n*Liberty*\n\nwould almost certainly leave extra fuel in the upper stage, it was decided that the upper stage would be designed to be able to dock with and refuel the\n\n*Prosperity*\n\nmodule, to make up for its inability to carry the entire thing to orbit fully fueled.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Ambrose Kerman, VAB Engineer\n\n\u003E ![BVlWjdL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BVlWjdL.jpg)\n\nWith the design of the propellant depot and the launch vehicle completed, the next step was the crew vehicle. This spacecraft, called *Safety* by the design team, would need to be able to carry 3 kerbals to and from orbit, and house them during their journey to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and back.\n\n\u0022Unlike previous crew vehicles, which had been combined command/service modules,\n\n*Safety*\n\nwas composed of three separate modules, only one of which would return to Kerbin. This was because previous vehicles had only had to deal with very minor reentry heating on returning from LKO, while\n\n*Safety*\n\nwould be reentering at far higher M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar return velocities, with correspondingly greater heating. It was more economical to just shield the command module and ditch everything else instead of trying to bring everything back.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Ambrose Kerman, VAB Engineer\n\nThe three modules which comprised *Safety* were the command module, which housed the crew and would return to Kerbin, the service module, which carried the electrical systems, most of the life support, and some of the monopropellant, and the orbital module, which carried the rest of the monopropellant and the docking adapter. A launch escape system was mounted on top of all of this, which would be jettisoned before orbital insertion.\n\n\u003E ![1nIRA9a.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1nIRA9a.jpg)\n\nThe next vehicle was the *Delivery* Space Tug, which would carry all of the necessary hardware from Kerbin orbit to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. The design constraints for the tug were relatively light, with the most important being the ability to deliver approximately 30 tons to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit and return to Kerbin.\n\n\u003E ![4RzHrsQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4RzHrsQ.jpg)\n\nThe final vehicle was the *Discovery* Reusable M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar Lander. Of all of the vehicles, this was the one with the most rigid specifications.\n\n\u0022We went through at least three different designs before\n\n*Discovery*\n\nwas settled on. The lander had to be able to carry two cosmonauts from M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit to the surface and back, and it had to be able to do it in a single stage. Additionally, it was decided that it would also have to be able to carry a small amount of cargo down to the surface. During the design process, this cargo was almost always a detachable science module, although rovers and other pieces of small hardware could also be carried.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Ambrose Kerman, VAB Engineer\n\n\u003E ![jkK3C9g.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jkK3C9g.jpg)\n\nOne month after the launch of *Zenith 6*, *M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnshot 1* was ready to launch.

Watching Kerbin come up over the horizon, only a little bit bigger than the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn appears from it... it was amazing. Some people say that it\u0027s the most important photo from space ever taken. I don\u0027t know about that, but I do know that it was the most beautiful thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Romal Kerman, Pilot\n\n![LXIxhbu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/LXIxhbu.jpg)\n![OgsymS0.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OgsymS0.jpg)\n\n![0tVBc1P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0tVBc1P.jpg)\n\nTo conserve delta-v, *Delivery* would aerobrake at Kerbin, using the planet\u0027s upper atmosphere to slow itself down.\n\n![CsUgrf8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CsUgrf8.jpg)\n![Z554OE9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Z554OE9.jpg)\n\n![GqXsY1r.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GqXsY1r.jpg)\n\n![WsnPspN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WsnPspN.jpg)\n\n![JuVcab7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JuVcab7.jpg)\n\n![IeV3fCc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IeV3fCc.jpg)\n\n![rOxVZoG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rOxVZoG.jpg)\n\nAt the same time this was happening, *Safety* was continuing on its near free return trajectory. Upon reaching apoapsis, it performed a small braking burn with its RCS thrusters to lower its periapsis deep within Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\n\n![xSld4oI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xSld4oI.jpg)\n\n\u0022Our reentry trajectory was actually quite shallow. This was intentional, since we were going to reenter with the orbital module and the science module still attached. Taking a shallow trajectory allowed us to do this, since we bled off most of our speed in the upper atmosphere, where the compressive heating isn\u0027t as bad.\u0022 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Cosmonaut Jebediah Kerman, Pilot\n\n![SvSqxF8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SvSqxF8.jpg)\n![BWgTMUA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BWgTMUA.jpg)\n\n![rbRqyYm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rbRqyYm.jpg)\n\n![tyNl1xl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tyNl1xl.jpg)\n\n![SgcRPwX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SgcRPwX.jpg)\n\n![X8GCkgl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/X8GCkgl.jpg)\n\n![z9zjNFG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/z9zjNFG.jpg)\n\n![DO3LyOT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DO3LyOT.jpg)\n\n![UhUScgp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UhUScgp.jpg)\n\n![1D94JmU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1D94JmU.jpg)\n\n![GGNde3H.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GGNde3H.jpg)\n\n![jWWzCXD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jWWzCXD.jpg)\n\n*M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnshot 5* landed safely several hundred kilometers west of KSC, somewhat off course, but otherwise unharmed.
