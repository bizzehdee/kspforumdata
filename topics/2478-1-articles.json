When they interact with the water in the neutrino detector tank, a small flash of light is generated and light amplifiers make it detectable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the attenuation factor that normal matter has on neutrinos is extremely small, so for all practical purposes they can be said to (mostly) pass through matter without interacting with it. The only reason we can observe them is because the neutrino flux through everything is ridiculously huge - in fact there is speculation that a lot of the energy in the universe exists as neutrinos - and by the virtue of gargantuan water tanks and really good light amplifiers. The more mass (water) you can observe, the more neutrino flashes you see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeutrino pulses are observed simply as spikes in the amount of flashes, which sort of makes me wonder how reliably they can detect the neutrino pulses coming from CERN, and separate them from the background noise.
