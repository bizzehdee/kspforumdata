Just little things like that to show progress you\u0027ve made! I understand stuff such as time on planets and time in orbit may be able to distinguish from one another due to the way the game timer currently works, but at least time spent on missions for each Kerbal would be nice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T05:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebeen talked about indirectly but never a main subject, planned feature though. in fact it was stated a sort of autopiloet would be added based on the skill of the piolet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hotcrazyfruit","CreatedById":7492,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T05:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish I knew how many hours i\u0027ve played since 0.8. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s got to be at least a thousand, though.
