Just the way the game displays it might change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason it is a breaking change is that all of your existing ships will no longer have enough supplies. Instead of needing 1 unit of Oxygen (which weights 0.429 kg) to last one day, a Kerbal will need ~304 units of Oxygen (still totals 0.429 kg). So the command pods that are supposed to have 1 day worth of supplies (1 unit) would end up with only 4.7 minutes of Oxygen (1 unit) instead. You will not need to worry if you do not have any active manned flights. Just tweak your saved ships before launching them and all will be good.
