There might be some tools for doing this for KSP on the net already. There is no simple formula you can just plug numbers into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Here, I\u0027m talking about computing the actual aerobraking maneuver only. For computing how much delta-V you need to shed, see PakledHostage\u0027s answer bellow.

You can then estimate the delta-V required to transfer between them by calculateing the difference in speed between the two orbits at the point where they intersect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if your hyperbolic trajectory has an orbital speed at periapsis of 3500 m/s and your elliptical orbit has an orbital speed of 2250 m/s at a periapsis that matches the hyperbolic trajectory\u0027s periapsis, then you will need about 1250 m/s to enter the elliptical orbit from the hyperbolic trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality you will need a bit more delta-V than what you calculate with this method because you aren\u0027t executing your manoeuver instantaneously, but the estimate will be close.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
