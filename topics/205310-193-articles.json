They were two different ethnies (Positives were like humans and Negatives were twice as short as Pos. and had pointed ears, they are Gnomes for those who play D\u0026amp;D) and the government was two consuls: at any time there was one Positive consul and one Negative consul. They were \u0022refreshed\u0022 evey 15 years. One day the Pos. consul wanted to destroy Negatives beause he thought of \u003Cem\u003E[whatever he thought]\u003C/em\u003E. So he kidnapped the Neg. consul one night (he knocked her off with a bowl) and wrote a letter with her writing, stating that she stole some of the most precious jewels and flew away. He then put the letter in the Negative ex-consul\u0027s wardrobe (don\u0027t ask) and imprisonned her in a remote-located fortress he secretly built for that purpose (this was just a huge prison). Then he hid the jewels somewhere and the next morning everyone was, \u0022Oooh who stole the jewels, where is the Negative consul\u0022 and after a bit of searching a Negative citizen found \u003Cu\u003Ethe\u003C/u\u003E letter. The Pos. consul took it and read it before anyone could and the whole city was like, \u0022Damn Negatives are traitors\u0022, \u0022Damn this is a fake letter\u0022, depending of whether the person who said it was Pos. or Negative. Then the consul declared Negatives were traitors and they were all condemned to death. At this moment all the Negatives flew with the \u0022roman\u0022 aspect of the civilization (without slavery because yes the romans of antiquit had slaves but there was not slavery in this world).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey escaped on boats that has been prepared for a quick escape in secret harbours (because of an order of the Negative consul three months ago) but a third of the Negatives were killed before they could fly and that\u0027s the beginning of the First Number War. The first third of the war was Negatives trying to get to the boats, the second third was the Negatives escaping (battles on sea) and the third third was battles to prevent the Negatives from flying too far (these completely failed). At the end of the war rthe Negatives were secretly installed on two islands in the southern cold seas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224119246\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205310\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221650313048\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022215483\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SSTO Crasher\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E Crasher said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey took no prisoners.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat story explains why.
