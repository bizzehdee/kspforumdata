When I decelerate time back to 1x, the camera shifts a tiny amount and I\u0027m back to the original problem. When I look at the map orbit view, I have a tiny apoapsis at 87 meters and a periapsis way down in the center of the earth, so the launchpads somehow make the rocket in flight/free fall.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-08T18:24:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2013 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by andqui\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SFJackBauer","CreatedById":82269,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T21:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDamn!
