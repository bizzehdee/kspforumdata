Not the biggest rocket engine period (that probably goes to the space shuttle SRBs, those things are insane... they each have almost twice the thrust of an F-1!) but damn big nevertheless. The main issue it had was that it sacrificed everything for thrust, because the Saturn V was just so darn gigantic and heavy. As a result, the F-1 ended up with really poor overall efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they\u0027re looking at a new version of it for the SLS, it\u0027s probably going to be an at least partial, if not complete rebuild. It\u0027s basically required, because the F-1 runs on kerosene, while the SLS appears to be going the liquid H2 route - it is built around a space shuttle tank, which is a LH2/LO2 carrier. Doing so allows them to use existing production lines and proven technology, which is a huge cost saver. I highly doubt they\u0027ll build an entirely different first stage variant, which would have to be designed, manufactured, tested and validated, just to hook up an engine with different fuel requirements... Unless the superheavy lifter gets a completely different main stage in the first place that doesn\u0027t build upon existing parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Merlin D-series, you really gotta respect it\u0027s impressive thrust/weight ratio.
