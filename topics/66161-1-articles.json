I plan to become a science educator when I graduate, but I can\u0027t wait until then.

What is TWR, what is dV, how are they related, how do they change.

Start with the difference between space and orbit, and why orbits are stable. Then talk about about using rocket thrust to change your path in space; how you need the same amount of fuel whether you want to go 1 km/s faster or 1 km/s slower. From there, discuss orbital manouvres. Point out that an orbit is a loop, so if you make some thrust at some point, your orbit still brings you back to that point; it\u0027s from that that you get things like burn at your lowest point (periapsis) to change your highest point (apoapsis).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T03:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know, KSP would be a good platform for teaching kids about relative velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T16:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI completely agree.

Work on the script of what you want to say and the sound-quality at least as much as the visuals. Also consider just writing (with illustrations) for anything you want to explain in detail - text books exist for a reason. You can write longer articles/tutorials than you can pack into a video, people can take their time reading them, easily flip forwards/backwards to check references and it\u0027s easier to translate for all those people in the world that don\u0027t happen to speak your language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus an awful lot of us have to pay for the internet and/or don\u0027t have a connection that can (reliably) handle video.
