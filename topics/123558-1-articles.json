I am using the Outer Planets Mod and have sent a probe to Tal (one small moon) to scan it for resources. The moment the survey completes, everything goes wrong:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no resource overlays. When I enter map mode, my craft disappear (all of them) and also the orbital paths of the celestial bodies. Sometimes I can go to the Space Center and then get back to my craft if I am lucky. But as soon as I focus on Tal, the problem acts up again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am basically stuck with a broken savegame due to this particular moon not wanting to be scanned. Any ideas how I could get that working again? Does anyone of you already have tried scanning Tal in OPM?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashingKirby148","CreatedById":130193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T20:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was gonna say that to make sure that you have all the icons on the top white so it shows you the crafts, but it seems that that isn\u0027t the case.
