Then just to try my construction, I send a little ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to do the hardest job and now my two vessels are in contact. But as you can guess, they don\u0027t want to dock... I\u0027ve searched on this forum and on some others, many times the problem seems to be the orientation of the docking port. I\u0027ve try in construction mode to see how the docking port where suppose to be, apparently I\u0027ve done nothing wrong about that (you can also see it on the screenshot if you zoom a bit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is it then ? I believe it is something stupid but I just can\u0027t figure out what it is.

Assuming you did all the \u0022control from here\u0022 and \u0022set as target\u0022 stuff correctly, then my only theory is that you maybe put the docking port on too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn annoying feature of docking ports is that they can clip through other ship parts in the VAB. They have attachment nodes on the top and you want to attach them to the ship with the bottom node. But because the ports can clip, if you\u0027re not careful you can move the port too far towards the ship. Then the port actually attaches to the ship by its top node, which is the one needed for docking. Because that node is now occupied with the structural connection to the ship, the port becomes useless for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid this be very careful when attaching docking ports in the VAB. They turn green in 2 positions. When you first bring the docking port up to the ship, it will turn green when its bottom node is in contact. But if you keep moving the port towards the ship, the bottom node will clip in and the port will briefly turn red, then turn green again as the top node comes into contact. So before clicking to attach the port, always wiggle it around to make sure it\u0027s attaching by the bottom node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiniMatt","CreatedById":78749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T13:09:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally dark picture but I think it looks like it should dock ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong shot but it might be possible that the left hand docking port is clipped into the girder such that to the game you\u0027re lining up a docking port with a girder rather than two docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you get any hint of \u0022docking wobble\u0022 as the two ports came close and docking port magnetism started moving ships around? (if you do, at this point I generally find it easiest to turn off SAS and RCS to prevent your ship from fighting against this force).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOccasionally ports need to reset, such that if you\u0027ve recently undocked it might not want to accept a re-docking quickly. I can\u0027t remember off the top of my head the cure for that, but going back to the tracking station, or time warping for a bit will likely fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T13:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have SAS on - with a light craft and enough SAS torque, it\u0027s enough to prevent you from docking.
