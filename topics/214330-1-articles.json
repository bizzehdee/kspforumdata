Once you\u0027re out of atmo you\u0027ll certainly need them, and they seem to do about what you\u0027d expect. I\u0027ve been able to turn the pointing of even fairly large craft - one outside atmo and with a reasonable amount of reaction wheels. That said, the behavior of KSP2 in atmo is... umm... odd? Yeah... I\u0027ll go with odd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve seen in KSP2 is that no matter what I do with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, reaction wheels, gimballing of motors, etc., in atmo things are just waaaaay more tippy and less stable. I\u0027ve switched to using size MD Control Surfaces in places I\u0027d ordinarily think I need at most a size SM Stabilizer. In fact, some of the \u0022odd\u0022 behavior makes me think the problem is more about bugs in the atmo physics part than with the reaction wheels. Especially since reaction wheels seem to do OK and perform about like I\u0027d expect out of atmo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make a good controllable rocket you want the CP to always be behind the CG. That\u0027s basic, right? So, if you take your design, drain all the fuel out of it, and find that the CG is *still* well ahead of CP then you might think, dang, this thing ought to be pretty stable! If part of that stability was some reasonably sized *Stabilizers*, then you might really expect the darn thing to do quite well on ascent. Nope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTear off those so-called stabilizers and replace them with Size Whatever *Control Surfaces*. These are basically like cannard wings - the whole darn things pivot, not just a flap. And if Size MD Stabilizers looked sane/rational/reasonable to you, then go with Size MD Control Surfaces. Oh, and when this bugger gets to Max Q watch them flip back and forth trying to control things! Your LV\u0027s will look more Buck Rodgers than NASA, but they may get out of the atmo a bit more reliably. I say *may* because, hey, this is KSP2 EA, and *may* is about all I\u0027d promise even with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only other tip I\u0027d offer is make your gravity turn a bit later. On a well behaved LV I usually start my turn around 100 m/s and have hit 45 degrees by the time I\u0027m at 10K m AGL. On a troublesome LV that really wants to flip I delay the gravity turn quite a bit and don\u0027t even get to 45 degrees until I\u0027m well into the upper atmosphere. It\u0027s just nuts. Things should not be like that - and it\u0027s frankly antithetical to the whole \u0022KSP2 will be easier for new players\u0022 thing. Nope!
