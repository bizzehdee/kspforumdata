I hope you enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbol is going supernova. Eve and Moho have already been engulfed by the flames! Kerbal scientists have concluded that Kerbin is next, but their instruments over at the tracking station have predicted that Duna will be just out of its reach! It\u0027s up to you to get as many Kerbals to Duna, or beyond before Kerbin is destroyed. You have 10 years game time to get as many Kerbals to Duna as possible. Or on hard mode, 5 or less! After this amount of time has passed you can no longer launch any missions from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

You can\u0027t restart the flight if you crash and kerbals are destroyed! You can quicksave, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must start on a new save, and all ships used must also be made by you!
