But looking at the \u0022max fuel usage\u0022 (full throttle?), the Omnimax seems to be a little more efficient than the FTmN, despite FTmN claiming a higher ISP. (Reasoning: at full throttle they both produce 40 thrust, but the FTmN appears to use \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E fuel per second at max throttle due to the maximum.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s going on here? Does the fuel usage at full throttle change depending on whether you\u0027re in vacuum? Maybe the FTmN maximum values are non-vacuum but the maximum Omnimax are in vacuum? If that\u0027s the case shouldn\u0027t there be two maximum values displayed, one for vacuum and one for non-vacuum?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFTmN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E280 ASL - 800 Vac - 800 Peak\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiqfuel max: 1.3093/sec max\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxi max: 1.6002/sec max\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOmnimax\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E290 ASL - 390 Vac\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiqfuel max: 1.2641/sec max \u0026lt;---- Uses less fuel/ox but much lower Vac ISP???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxi max: 1.5451/sec max\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T18:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe maximum usage is for atmospheric ISP, and since the FTmN has the lower aISP, it chugs down more LFO in atmosphere than the Omnimax.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T20:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso Isp is \u0022per unit of thrust\u0022 so if one has more thrust than they other it may \u003Cstrong\u003Eboth\u003C/strong\u003E be more efficient \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E use more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garoad","CreatedById":62077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T20:20:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe maximum usage is for atmospheric ISP, and since the FTmN has the lower aISP, it chugs down more LFO in atmosphere than the Omnimax.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk yeah that\u0027s what I was suspecting.
