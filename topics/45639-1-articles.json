I\u0027m new to the forums, though (but have been lurking for a while...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just thought that it would be very useful to be able to combine a number of parts (with or without a command module) and then re-use them without having to save an entire ship. If the group of parts could be made to appear in a tab in the VAB, this would make re-use of a successful structure much easier. It would allow for quick experimenting with different combinations of rockets and payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdam\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T15:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood day, please see the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022What not to suggest\u0022\u003C/a\u003E post at the top.Sub assemblies are on that list as an upcoming feature and are also handeld by mods at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
