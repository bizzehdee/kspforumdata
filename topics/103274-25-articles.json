If not, every single sci-fi replica will die, since i NEED clipped wings and control surfaces for half of these replicas to work. Yes it isnt realistic, but neither are sci-fi replicas and in general futuristic stuff. Also, its most likely a 50/50 chance. on one hand, it is unrealistic (not that i care), but on the other hand its WAY WAY WAY more hardware intensive to do dynamic modeling of wings. Worst case theyll make them shielded if inside another part, but there will most likely be ways to glitch this so its not visible but game thinks its outside (such as wings inside a open cargo bay, with another cargo bay covering the open side).\n\u003E Still, im so keeping 0.90 forever as there are just way too many epic builds i have that either rely on the overpowered jets to pull off crazy feats (laythe roundtrip with a single 150 LF fuel tank), or relying on clipping wings inside hulls. \n\u003E \n\u003E I know theres a large subvset of the community that probably hates me for enjoying overpowered parts and clipping, but if you arent at all interested in replicating real life, then this stuff comes in handy.\n\nI think that clipped wings ARE realistic. IRL there\u0027s no reason you can\u0027t make a bigger wing shape! Sure in KSP It woud be a wing shape that is slightly more dense in some sections, but I certainly don\u0027t think it is unrealistic and I suspect it will work fine in the aerodynamics model.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So is there some actual \u0027Countdown\u0027 announcement or was that just a pointless tease?\n\nLooks like some pointless tease, but my *MONITOR-O-MATIC Steamcharged Monitor Screen* is displaying some countdown, but it\u0027s so blurrer I can\u0027t see the numbers.
