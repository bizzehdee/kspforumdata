The decals that are applied to the part persist, even when you change flags at the space center, like you would expect. I agree with Scottiths that the large flags don\u0027t work well on rounded hulls - they would look good attached to square or triangular girders on a big space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of little adjustments would make these better, I think: Instead of separate normal and reversed flag parts, have one two-sided flag for each size. This would especially help if the flag isn\u0027t flush against something solid, since right now it\u0027s invisible from the back. If you are able to do that, we\u0027d also need a way to determine the orientation of the flag, since the game doesn\u0027t apply the decal in the VAB (which is a pity). Can you color the left and top edges of the flag part without that color bleeding over onto the decal, maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, at least now it\u0027s possible to put mission flags on the ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kujuman","CreatedById":28299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T18:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuick update,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done some testing and it is indeed possible to put markings on the object that shows up in the VAB.
