Next week\u0027s episode is the season final, and is going to be very important, and climactic. A ship full of Cybermen, the Master, and judging by the trailer, FLYING JETPACK-CYBERMAN! Anyway, this is just a topic to talk about Dr Who, whether it be the villians, what happened in an episode, theories (can\u0027t be completely silly, must have sensible grounds to base it on!), companions, even memes!

It\u0027s basically a giant tube. Inside that tube, could be Mondas. The Mondasian Cybermen used a crapton of engines to physically \u003Cem\u003Emove\u003C/em\u003E their \u003Cem\u003Eentire\u003C/em\u003E planet, like the Death Star, back onto a trajectory that intercepts Earth, as told by a Cyberman in the \u003Cem\u003ETenth Planet\u003C/em\u003E episode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy theory is that the Master used the black hole to go back in time to meet Mondas, because the Mondasian medical staff and everything were only beginning to research into \u0027curing\u0027 people of eventual death by putting them in cybersuits and what not, and bring them into the present (how you can get \u0027out\u0027 of a black hole, I don\u0027t know).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Master wouldn\u0027t of been seen as a threat to the Mondasians, as\u00A0the Mondasian Cybermen and all other Cybermen up until John Lim\u0027s paradox universe Cybermen only converted \u003Cem\u003Ehumans\u003C/em\u003E into Cybermen, and so other species were safe, unless they triggered them. The Master already had a \u0027relationship\u0027 with the Cybermen, actually working with them to hunt down the Doctor, achieve world domination, or even use them as disposable landmine clearers (old Tom Baker episode, can\u0027t remember name).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m thinking that the planet Mondas was floating around in space, and either the ship was built \u003Cem\u003Earound\u003C/em\u003E the planet, or the ship was already built, and the planet moved into the ship, like new neighbours coming to live in your street or something. But then, why would there be your normal, friendly, day to day, blue-coloured janitor on the ship? As far as I know, Cybermen don\u0027t make messes, or leave rubbish lying around, so why would there be a cleaner onboard a ship housing Mondas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just wonder: \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EIs there a gold foundry or radioactive area onboard? \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-27T03:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry to poop the party, guys, but \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/31593-regarding-fan-threads/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethreads like this have caused problems in the past\u003C/a\u003E.
