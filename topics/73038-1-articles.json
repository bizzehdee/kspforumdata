The calculations worked like a charm, I just set up my maneuver nodes like the told me, fiddled with them for about 10 minutes and I was off. One correction burn not even on the ascending or descending node and I had four encounters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve decided to call them the \u0022Moho Conga Line.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the lesson learned is that after all my inaccuracies and navigational errors, I\u0027m left with this in my Kerbal Alarm Clock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbe 6: SOI change to Moho: 94d, 1h, 43 min\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbe 5: SOI change to Moho: 94d, 1h, 46 min (!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbe 7: SOI change to Moho: 94d, 2h, 13 min\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbe 8: SOI change to Moho: 94d, 2h, 47 min\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind that the way these probes are configured I\u0027m expecting a capture burn to take about 10 minutes. I\u0027m hoping to fix things in the refinement burns when I adjust periapsis on approach to Moho. Hopefully that will spread the arrivals out some.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T08:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes too much precision can be detrimental you your (mental) health and well-being \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Careful with fiddling - Moho\u0027s SoI is small, and that darn planet is fast.
