You could end up having a massive sci-fi battle to take over (or just destroy) the opposing planet. If this were the case, I would be buying a four-pack on Steam right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T21:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad aren\u0027t going to add weapons, sorry, KSP is about space flight and exploration, not violence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombat and weapons are on the list of what not to suggest for this very reason, so this would be better off as an addon request after multiplayer is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T06:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 to this idea\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want bananas, green shells and Bob-oms to throw at other spaceships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceKadet","CreatedById":91850,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T07:54:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I would think that a VS mode in a multi-player situation would work for ksp is two competing space agencies.
