I thought, how cool would it be to use only glimmeroids? I further decided that I only wanted to use really big ones, so I tested and built an appropriately capable ship and set out for E-class asteroids, hoping to find one that glowed. I had poked around and found a thread that discussed these asteroids and the conclusion of the discussion is that they appear in about 1 of 20 encounters, and can be a variety of colors. What It had not been determined/discussed as to when the asteroid becomes \u0022magic.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter much hunting I finally found one, and decided to put a question in my mind to the test: is the \u0022magic\u0022 determination made when the asteroid comes into physics range and spawns, or is that decided when the asteroid appears in the tracking station? The answer is: physics range! Therefore, if you quicksave when you are en route and before you match velocities, then you can reload over and over again until the asteroid becomes a magic one. In doing that I agree that they show up somewhere between 1 in 15 to 1 in 20 times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, in that old thread many people reported that their glimmeroids tended to be on the low end of the mass range. I have not found that to be the case, at least with the E-class ones. I came across a true behemoth, a gold one that was over 3000t!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn color I have come across red, cyan, orange, yellow, gold, and several shades of purples, greens and pinks. I am guessing that any value on the color wheel is possible, and there does seem to be at least a little variation on the color saturation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this answers some questions for anyone curious about these asteroids!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coyotesfrontier","CreatedById":181596,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-20T19:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReminds me a bit of Pokemon shiny hunting, lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strike_2.0","CreatedById":213912,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-26T09:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nim gonna try that as part of my space station, im gonna keep a quicksave of before deciding asteroid \u0022magic\u0022 and im gonna get a quicksave when i see a magic asteroid and name it the color of the asteroid, just to have a set of colors to choose from\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
