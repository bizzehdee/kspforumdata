I built the 2.5m rocket and got that puppy up to orbit. That\u0027s when I happened to glace over at the fuel gauge and see that the fuel for the main stage is at 50%! That was when I realised my stupendous error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had chosen to put RCS on my craft, and to balance the thrusters with the CoM I drained the fuel to 50%. It seemed the engineers had forgotten to fill it up again. Endo Kerman probably had a rant at them after he got back...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission had to go on regardless. I still had 2.2km of DV to play around with, but I had a lot of maneuverers to do - Mun injection burn, circularization burn, inclination change, course correction, ejection burn and retrograde burn. That 2.2km didn\u0027t seem so large anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eafter the course correction I had 25 seconds of burn time... after the ejection burn 14 seconds... after the retrograde 1 second - but Endo was certainly happy to be getting home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
