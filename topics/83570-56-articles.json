There are 2 new stock cockpits (can\u0027t recall their names, the pointy aerodynamic one and the one that\u0027s missing the pointy tip), and I would absolutely love for it to have one of these amazing IVAs... Is there a way for a newb like myself to do this? or would it require a monumental amount of work if at all possible?
