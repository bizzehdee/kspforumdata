Or I did until I noticed that the mod had updated today, so I upgraded it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mainly started with this mod, because I also use TAC-LS, and food was my biggest concern, as it was the only thing keeping me from being self sufficient. So the goals for my Duna base are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStage 1:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEstablish a base that can\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Produce food, possibly by consuming Waste from TAC-LS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Harvest and store resources in preparation for stage 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Support at least 5 kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No supply runs needed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStage 2:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Produce, refuel, and launch ships from said base\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo my questions then are:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Which parts do I need to send for stage 1? I thought I had an idea, but as I said, there was an update today, where some parts were removed, and some added. I decided to take a step back and unlearn what I (thought I) knew already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Which parts do I need for stage 2, in addition to what Extraplanetary Launchpads add\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo need to list the connecting tubes and the module base, as they are obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did try to use the MKS tutorial, but it seems very outdated, as it referred to both parts and resources that do not seem to exist in my installation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPS:\u003C/strong\u003E I don\u0027t want to bother with orbital stations at the moment, and I need to reduce the amount of parts for the sake of my ability to keep track of what I have, so can I just delete all parts starting with OKS in the parts folder?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the record: Using UKS version 0.31.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T19:42:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T20:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA single base won\u0027t actually do what you want it to. You\u0027re going to need access to all of the MKS resources, and while Duna has all of them, they aren\u0027t all in the same place. Your stage one needs a suborbital delivery vehicle or very long range megarover capable of bringing you water (or a source of water like kethane), substrate, some sort of LFO source (water works, but I think it\u0027s pretty inefficient compared to ore or kethane) metallicore, minerals, and probably uranite (self sustaining life support needs huge power requirements, you need either need a nuclear power plant or the top tier near future solar panels if you want anything like a sane partcount, or possibly the new RTGs but I don\u0027t know how to refuel them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that i really suggest looking through/asking in the Kolonization thread, not many people know the new parts yet (i\u0027m pretty sure nothing was actually removed, since RoverDude originally thought that this was gonna be backwards compatible), and it should be substantially easier to get set up for rocketpart and machinery production than before, since he added mark II versions of the Mark III parts (which you can use to build your better Mark III parts once stage 2 is in place).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
