I also got confused as I clearly had a kerbal in my craft, so now pilots are pilots, engineers are engineers, and scientists are scientists are scientists. I recommend you launch Jeb up to your ship with Bill and Lemeny in it, the ship in which Bill and Lemeny are in will not be able to use SAS however they can still move the ship around.

When launched would almost immediately lose control. Then when engines were cut, would slowly gain speed upward. If you tried to recover on the launchpad it would not let you and when attempting to exit warned that there was a ship in flight and would revert to previous autosave. If you attempted launchpad eva the ship would fall apart. Any suggestions on this account would be appreciated.
