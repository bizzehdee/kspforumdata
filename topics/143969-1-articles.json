The docking port I have attached to the top of it is still there as well as the inter-stage attached to the bottom. It\u0027s like it\u0027s just invisible. As well as this I\u0027m experiencing the camera glitch where is slowly slights behind the vehicle further and further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0This is only the case with this one particular vehicle. I even made a completely new vehicle with a lab, but much simpler design to keep part count down, but it still persists. All of my other vehicles work fine, no camera glitch or anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I\u0027m running on 1.1.2 on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-01 with a total of 48 mods. I haven\u0027t added anymore mods, nor updated anything to make this happen. Also before anyone says ram I upgraded to 16 Gb just for KSP lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone knows what\u0027s going on please let me know, I haven\u0027t found a single thing on this (besides the camera glitch).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Killer","CreatedById":166689,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T05:36:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk.
