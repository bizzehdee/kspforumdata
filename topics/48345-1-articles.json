My reason for this is that I want a mod that makes nose-cones, fairings, etc, necessary for efficient launches, but I find that FAR makes getting to space too easy - I did a test with a small solid booster without a nose-cone in both stock KSP and with FAR and found that it actually went 4km higher with FAR installed, and that is \u003Cstrong\u003Ewithout\u003C/strong\u003E a nose-cone! With a nose cone FAR just makes it too easy! So if anyone knows of a mod that alters the drag model to be more realistic, but still maintains a similar level of difficulty to stock KSP (for example, worse performance than stock without nose-cone, and similar or slightly better performance than stock with nose-cone), a link would be much appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Thanks, Proply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] While no other mods such as I described exist at present, Ferram has made the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52882\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Isp Difficulty Scaler\u003C/a\u003E which addresses my concerns.

A single part with very high TWR, lots of fuel, no payload and very little extra mass is not exactly indicative of what you will see from actual launches in FAR. While it is true that you can shave off 1000 Delta-v to orbit, the difficulty comes back in actually flying the rocket. With actual Aerodynamics, the direction of travel into the wind or through the air is very important - Planes and rockets alike can and will stall, spin and break up due to aerodynamic stresses caused by high Angles of Attack. I have many launches fail during MaxQ as side forces flipped my rocket around and I did not go to space. Mechjeb is has a hard time of launching a rocket in FAR.

The point of FAR is to make design matter and add realism to aerodynamics - not make the game easier by any stretch. But in doing what it does it makes rockets stupidly overpowered. Tuning the rockets down is not a solution - they are balanced against the masses they must lift, for vacuum as well as atmosphere.
