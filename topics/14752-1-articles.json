They wobble a lot, so much so in fact that one of my rockets shook itself to pieces just from the force of the vectoring engines during my gravity turn. The impression I\\\u0027m getting from the new parts is that they\\\u0027re far from finished. There\\\u0027s not even an SAS scaled for the new parts. Which is understandable since they had a lot to do in just a short time that they just couldn\\\u0027t get them done in time. That\\\u0027s perfectly fine, but I think I\\\u0027ll hold off on using the new engines, command pod and fuel tanks for now. They look really good, and are very well made, but I\\\u0027m pretty sure that they\\\u0027re going to be very hard to use until the team works on them a bit more. I really do appreciate the work you guys at Squad do and I\\\u0027m still extremely grateful the new parts even made it in at all. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JebThrillMaster","CreatedById":2434,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-21T03:22:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy 2 rockets seem to be doing just fine, if you need something to get a good flight ill have a download [ftp=ftp://www.dropbox.com/s/cprivvlgoh4fl8e/Titan%202.craft]here[/ftp] to one of my rockets that can get to orbit of Kerbin and back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Aramchek_","CreatedById":12588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-21T05:21:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had just the opposite experience, the new stuff is very stable so far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kymlaar","CreatedById":24642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-21T08:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve run into the instability as well.

LOTS of struts. 8 struts between each stages over the engine, additional struts between 1st and 2nd stage and tons of cross-struts between side-by-side 3M tanks of first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill wobbly, but no longer gets ripped apart even with 400ton\u002B takeoff weights (my 3M-based test setup for future interplanetary missions)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3M decoupler is problematic tho. 1M decoupler also is very weak for separating 3M parts which are so much heavier, so you have to stage carefully. Also radial decouplers are still fairly weak. Easy to cause unintended collisions...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: With some serious tinkering managed to get 730 ton monster off the pad... had to do lots of little tweaks to prevent it from tearing into bits... but in the end I have 73 tons of rocket on 180km circular orbit, ready to insert to an interplanetary trajectory. This is fairly close to the maximum as long as we have this tower; the rocket is already twice as high as the launch tower and can\\\u0027t fit more stuff radially without hitting the tower \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kymlaar","CreatedById":24642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-21T20:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed some of these same issues in the past when I was using NovaSilisko\\\u0027s mod parts in ways they weren\\\u0027t designed for, specifically the larger parts.
