At current records I\u0027d suggest the overall advantage lies with skids but I note that the friction inherent in skid designs appears to put limits on the total amount of thrust which can be applied before craft disintegration.

Like I say, no mods really make the challenge easier, they just change the course. A stock craft won\u0027t be optimal for a FAR course, and a FAR craft won\u0027t be optimal for a stock course - they cease to be comparable but that is not to diminish the design ingenuity required to make either craft work. Giving them their own category makes such designs comparable once again \u003Cem\u003Eto other craft driving the same course\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-18T14:14:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2014 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MiniMatt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T14:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFunny, I put up the FAR vs. Non-FAR to show that FAR increased the top speed from 391 m/s or so to 474 m/s.

Wheels inherently want to move in the direction they are facing. So if you have any yaw occurring, you\u0027ll get a sideways vector. For me, this usually ends up rolling my rocket car as the sideways force vector from the wheels is obviously below my center of mass. Skids on the other hand, have no \u0022preference\u0022 for which way to \u0022roll.\u0022 So yawing isn\u0027t such a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: Anybody getting the \u0022Yoyodyne\u0022 reference?
