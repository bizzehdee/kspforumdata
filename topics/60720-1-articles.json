So I\u0027m fairly sure they\u0027ll keep it like that. LOX-LH2 is often used for second stages thanks to its high energy density per mass unit. But you don\u0027t want to use it on your first stage since LOX-LH2 has a very low density, so your thrust tends to be low. When you use LOX-LH2 in your first stage its almost always a booster assisted stage. The space shuttle or the Ariane V are good examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want extra types of fuel you should try out the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64118-0-23-Real-Fuels-v4-3-1-20-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReal Fuels mod\u003C/a\u003E by NathanKell.
