I am currently about to land my first space shuttle from orbit, but it\\\u0027s in a giant field about half the world away. I CAN land on the Kerbal continent, but the pin point runway is a completely different story. If anyone can give me some exact procedures, that would be great. Also, is there anyway to practice landing spaceplanes without having to get them into orbit first? It takes a long time and I want to practice landing several times."},{"CreatedByName":"ping111","CreatedById":8679,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-29T20:09:32Z","Content":"Of course we\\\u0027ve done it - we\\\u0027ve done it blindly from the Mun! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSorry, can\\\u0027t help you there, though."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-29T20:11:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Of course we\\\u0027ve done it - we\\\u0027ve done it blindly from the Mun! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry, can\\\u0027t help you there, though.\n\nSo you say you\\\u0027ve landed at the KSC runway all the way from the mun (blindly), but you can\\\u0027t help?

I\\\u0027d suggest trying to time your deorbit burn from 70 km so that your trajectory is displayed as slightly overshooting KSC and a few kilometers in the ocean. During reentry the trajectory will change, and then you want to glide to the runway.\n\nI haven\\\u0027t flown a shuttle yet, but that\\\u0027s the way I\\\u0027d do it. Make sure you save before your deorbit burn so you can play with your timing until you feel comfortable enough to do this consistently, and everything should go well."},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-29T22:41:29Z","Content":"Practice landing by building a small, simple airplane, and just... don\\\u0027t go to orbit.

This hasn\\\u0027t been implemented yet (in 0.14.4).\n\nWhile I don\\\u0027t have a step-by-step procedure, I can think of a few tips that might help:\n\n1) F5 quicksave just before your deorbit burn, so that you can do some trial-and-error,\n\n2) set your trajectory to overshoot KSC and a few Km eastward to compensate for Kerbin\\\u0027s rotation,\n\n3) MechJeb has a landing calculator (not intended for planes, but it should deorbit on time to get you close),\n\n4) this sounds like an extreme challenge, so do some test flights to make sure your plane is stable throughout the various phases.\n\nBy the way, the techniques used by the real-life shuttle are just fascinating. The shuttle had (relatively) much more control of the reentry corridor than capsule-type craft like Mercury and Apollo. Basically they would trim the ship so that the angle-of-attack caused a constant 2-4 G, then kept doing rolls to steer the thing like a directional conduit borer."},{"CreatedByName":"hubbazoot","CreatedById":21881,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-02T23:16:08Z","Content":"I managed to land at the KSP base...once.
