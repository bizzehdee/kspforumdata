I am currently about to land my first space shuttle from orbit, but it\\\u0027s in a giant field about half the world away. I CAN land on the Kerbal continent, but the pin point runway is a completely different story. If anyone can give me some exact procedures, that would be great. Also, is there anyway to practice landing spaceplanes without having to get them into orbit first?
