I have done a few prior to this one with a little 2 fuselage plane no problem but this one obviously is outside its range. I have tried a few different designs with the parts and size limit I have to no joy. The big problem is I can\u0027t find a stable build that will continue to fly as fuel empties. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least I am assuming fuel emptying is the problem.

To avoid conflict with landing gear you can launch vertically or at a high angle using launch clamps, since you won\u0027t have to land with them. They tend not to mess with center of mass very much since they can be attached right near the center of mass. I recently used this method to fly to the north tundra area with 3 jets, 2 round mk 1 tanks each and 1 drop tank each. I ended up with tons of fuel to spare even after flying around to the various targets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other idea would be similar to a Dreamchaser but with 2 jet engines (since you can\u0027t attach a jet engine to a stack you\u0027ll have to have at least 2 on either side of a central body) and liquid fuel. It would be launched vertically into orbit on a disposable rocket with large wings to keep it aerodynamically stable, then it would reenter on the far side and be able to fly around the area with the mission targets, assuming they aren\u0027t too far apart. This method will bump up your cost and decrease recoverable value but cut real life mission time down by a lot since you can timewarp to the farside rather than physics warp at 4x only if you have a very stable plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T06:03:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s easy with turbojets, a complete pain without.
