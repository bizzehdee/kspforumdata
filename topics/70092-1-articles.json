Unlike aerobraking it can be planned in detail long ahead as the patched conics system allows you to see you\u0027re going to have Laythe/Tylo encounter all the way from LKO and allows you to set up the slingshot accurately as soon as you enter Jool SOI at the latest. Also unlike aerocapture, you can use the slingshot to fix your inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T09:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have MechJeb, it has a realtime aerobrake calculator that you can use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if your target is Laythe, you can aerocapture there directly.
