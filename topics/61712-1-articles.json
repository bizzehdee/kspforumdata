You would create a warp in space which would give you an apparent velocity of FTL (or 0.3 in your case) while still having an actual velocity of 3000 m/s. You could think of the warp like a bridge and the initial velocity of 3000 m/s as the velocity necessary to cross the bridge. You would then emerge from your warp with a velocity of 3000 m/s relative to your origin.

Because velocity is relative, I can always find an object moving at 3,000m/s relative to you. So say you\u0027ve enabled warp drive, and now travel at .3c relative to that object. How fast are you traveling relative to object with respect to which you were at rest before enabling warp drive? Well, .3c - 3000m/s almost on the dot. There is going to be a slight relativistic correction, but you are still performing an STL warp relative to that initial point, despite never moving relative to it. So you don\u0027t actually have to have an initial velocity to perform a warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere this works a bit funky is with interplanetary travel. If I want to travel from Earth to Jupiter, for example, I\u0027ve just left Earth\u0027s orbit, and I engage warp drives. If I did manage to warp to Jupiter, I\u0027d find that my ship\u0027s total mechanical energy is actually negative. That can\u0027t happen. You can compensate for this with warp drive, but it gets all sorts of complicated. More realistically, I need to be on an Earth-Jupiter transfer orbit already before I engage the warp drive. Hence, the \u0022initial velocity\u0022. But this is only relevant because we are working within Sun\u0027s gravitational field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that said, I don\u0027t know if STL warp is conceptually different from FTL one. Certainly, it\u0027d take less energy to perform, so it\u0027d be the first thing we do. But I don\u0027t think there is anything special that happens at the speed of light for the warp bubble that would prevent you from just scaling up your STL tech until it\u0027s FTL capable. So if we figure out how to do STL warp, we will figure out how to do FTL warp as well, eventually. Whether we ever get to that former stage is a separate question entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
