I hope you\u0027re all having a great day. I\u0027d like to share a video I produced recently. A friend and I re-did all the sound in this 3 minute scene from Five Deadly Venoms. It\u0027s a funny little adaptation of the original dialog. Along with all new sound effects recorded in my own apartment.
