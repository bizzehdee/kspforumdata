I found a setting called \u0022EVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE = True\u0022, I changed it to \u0022EVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE = False\u0022 but every time I boot up the game, it changes back to default. Am I looking at the correct setting? Why does it switch back? How do I permanently change it so that it does not automatically rotate the Kerbals and waste EVA propellant?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T00:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the Settings menu, under the Input/Other tab, there\u0027s a button labeled \u0022EVAs auto-rotate to camera\u0022.
