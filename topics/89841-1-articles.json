So I decided to fill them with fuel. While adding a mod like FAR will make nose cones useful again, it does change the way the whole game is played in atmospheres and some people don\u0027t want to do that. Also any coded mod can have problems when KSP updates. I realise that I am using the brilliant ModuleManager, but due to it\u0027s nature it is less likely to have update problems. As all this mod does is add fuel to items it is also very unlikely to break even if ModuleManager does. With the introduction of Tweakables adding fuel to an item is also reversible without taking out the mod and as it\u0027s mass it not changed (apart from tow of them) it is almost exactly the same when empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Technical part: The first thing I did was decide on which parts to add fuel to. I decided on all adapters and nose cones that didn\u0027t have another purpose (intakes and air sensors are not included) and looked big enough to have fuel in them (FL-A5 Adapter is too flat). Next I used their mass and the mass to fuel ratio of standard tanks to work out their fuel. Most tanks have a empty fuel to mass ratio of 0.000625 (less is better) so I added the fuel at 0.000833. This means they are less mass efficient than most tanks. I can always make them less efficient if people think this is too high. Finally I added fuel and oxidizer in 11:9 ratio to the parts based on their starting mass. After all this I found the tiny nose cone held more fuel than a FL-T100 Fuel Tank and had the same mass as ten RAM intakes when empty. It is also three times heavier than the next largest cone. I suspect it\u0027s mass is a type and should be 0.01 not 0.1. So I changed it to such and its fuel is now 5.4:6.6. I also reduced the tiny to small adapter to 0.1 from 0.3 for the same reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModule manager: This mod requires the wonderful ModuleManager to work and as such is included in the download \u0022Plugin developers and other modders have my explicit permission to redistribute this .dll with their own works, so long as you give credit to me and provide a URL back to this forum post.\u0022 And here is the forum post. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/31342-0-20-ModuleManager-1-3-for-all-your-stock-modding-needs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/31342-0-20-ModuleManager-1-3-for-all-your-stock-modding-needs\u003C/a\u003E Here is a screen shot of all the data if you are interested. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EData\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1th1YaX.png?1\u0022 alt=\u00221th1YaX.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EChange log:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.03\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded Licenses inside install file\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.02 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded support for real fuels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdited small nose cones to have the correct maximum fuel limit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded installation instruction and license inside the file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoved Herobrine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.01 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstall release\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EOther Mods\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpare Parts \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107407-0-90-Clockwork-s-Spare-Parts-%28v1-00-15th-Jan-2015%29?p=1671858#post1671858\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107407-0-90-Clockwork-s-Spare-Parts-%28v1-00-15th-Jan-2015%29?p=1671858#post1671858\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrudent Strategies \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107745-0-90-Clockwork-s-Prudent-Strategies-%28v1-01-18th-Jan-2015%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107745-0-90-Clockwork-s-Prudent-Strategies-%28v1-01-18th-Jan-2015%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T21:01:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork_werewolf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T16:15:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.
