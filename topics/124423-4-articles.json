Consider yourselves lucky you plane-builders are getting so much love in this update round. All the buoyancy and jet engine/cockpit parts coming in 1.05 almost exclusively benefit aircraft (or boat, even weirder) builders.

I appreciate the efforts of the developers to fine tune their baby to their hearts content and the hard work that goes into that. But I kinda felt more disappointed then enthusiastic about this particular change as I don\u0027t feel this adds anything but an aesthetic restriction to using the (these?) engines. I can only speak to my own playstyle of course, but I\u0027ve always liked the freedom of the \u0022place-anywhere\u0022 lego aspect of the original jet engines (and every other part for that matter), in lieu of more rigid requirements for the sake of a little engineering accuracy. I can\u0027t see them adding the same thing for air intakes, rocket engines, or other parts... right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I build crafts, I just assume the relevant internals are inside the structural elements in the craft and don\u0027t worry about the specifics. In this case, if I use \u0027em as VTOL engines, I just assume they are ducted from some guts in the heart of the craft, and get to flyin\u0027. Poorly. If I wanted more realism, I could always roleplay and build the craft to exacting specifications using the parts at hand as flavorparts, the same way I do with adding unnecessary habitat parts to give my Kerbals the illusion of living space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf SQUAD wants a mechanism to justify/explain the CoM difference, could we make this overlay only for the VAB, and not for post-launch? Or provide a means to turn it off? Or would SQUAD consider releasing centerline and radial hinge parts so that engines can be mounted F35/Halo Pelican style? What about dedicated high thrust/high overheat VTOL engines with low(er) profiles that can act like ducted engine parts? (I\u0027ve always wanted something similar in the mods that feature fusion engines et al. - the inclusion of a short-use-time, high thrust fusion engines that can be used for touchdown... but only touchdown.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my two cents. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr 1.62 cents, American.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
