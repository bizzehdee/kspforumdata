Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E of this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107432-13-kerballoons-v042-balloons-for-ksp/) explicitly states that the license is All Rights Reserved.  Second, the [CurseForge page for the mod](https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/kerballoons) also states All Rights Reserved.  So, nothing from those pages can be modified or redistributed by anyone.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, Fengist said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E the CurseForge listing for the .dll says that it can be redistributed\n\u003E \n\nI assume you\u0027re talking about [this page here](https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/kerballoons-v0-3-dll-only), where the author has made KerBalloons available as a DLL-only download.  On that page, he states,\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *Redistributing any part of KerBalloons other than this .dll or the contents of KerBalloons/Sounds is forbidden.*\n\u003E \n\n...which implies that yes, it\u0027s okay to redistribute *\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethat\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E* DLL.\n\nHowever, that\u0027s not what you\u0027re doing here.  You\u0027re *\u003Cu\u003Emodifying\u003C/u\u003E* the original source code and re-compiling it.  In other words, you\u0027re redistributing a *\u003Cu\u003Emodified version\u003C/u\u003E*, and nowhere does the author state that that\u0027s allowed.\n\nFurthermore... even if redistributing a modified version *\u003Cu\u003Ewere\u003C/u\u003E* allowed by the mod\u0027s license-- even if the mod had been released into the public domain-- it\u0027s KSP forum policy (add-on posting rules) that one is not allowed to post binaries without posting the source code.  Therefore, posting a DLL download link, without the source code that was used to generate that DLL, would be prohibited regardless of license, even if you were the original author.\n\nBasically, the upshot of all this is that this mod is completely dead, and will remain so until such time as [@JoePatrick1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104094-joepatrick1/) *\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffff00;\u0022\u003Ehimself\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E* either fixes it, or else changes the license to something more permissive to allow someone else to fix it.  Which is a darn shame, because this looks like a fun, cool mod.  ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)  But that\u0027s how it works.\n\n(Moral of the story:  If you\u0027re a mod author, and you make your mod All Rights Reserved, then your mod will die as soon as *\u003Cu\u003Eyou, personally\u003C/u\u003E* stop updating it.  If that\u0027s not what you want to happen, don\u0027t use All Rights Reserved.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, Fengist said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Joe, if you see this, I hope you don\u0027t mind.\n\u003E \n\n^ Politely spoken.  Unfortunately, it doesn\u0027t work that way.  Yes, it\u0027s easier to get forgiveness than permission... but when it comes to licenses, permission is what\u0027s required.\n\nWe\u0027re sorry we had to snip the link and rain on everyone\u0027s parade, here.
