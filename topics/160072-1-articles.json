I was expecting that the probe core, either via its internal antenna, or the Communotron 16, would relay via my stage and its RA-2\u0027s back to Kerbin, but no. The only antenna that give me any kind of connection is a DTS-M1, and that shows as communicating directly back to Kerbin, rather than through the relay. A DTS-M1 is not going to survive Eve re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think its a range issue, as I loose control of my landing probe as soon as I separate, I have extended antennas, and even tried re-orienting the stage with relays just in case the stage body was occluding the signal from my probe to the relay antenna, but no luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSpedia show a table that gives ranges for different combinations of antennas - Class 0 (Probes) unto class 5, as well as the different upgrade levels of the Kerbin Ground Station, but I can\u0027t see in the parts guide what class a particular antenna would be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am using KSP 1.21.1604 on Mac.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts/suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPaul\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-02T11:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRightclick the antenna in the editor.

If not, then you are either out of range (which might happen if Kerbin and Eve are in direct opposition, but with two stacked antennas I\u0027d doubt it) or occluded by a moon or planet in the way.
