All for just capturing an asteroid! Well, sure, it was a Class C asteroid, but that\u0027s not too bad, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I captured the asteroid and put it in Kerbin orbit, but somehow, the mission did not show as complete. So I looked at it more closely to see what I hadn\u0027t done right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClass C asteroid? Check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn orbit?

Bop? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m supposed to haul a Class-C asteroid to BOP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome day I will learn to read the missions completely. If there is a big payoff like that, it\u0027s probably because the mission is really hard, and this one was definitely hard. I mean, I\u0027ve returned a Kerbal from Eve before, and this mission was HARD. I considered abandoning the mission many times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest problems was that asteroids that big are really hard to move around, just because the Claw tends to flex a lot, so it\u0027s hard to keep it oriented right. Then of course the asteroid weighs something like 80 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to tell you what it cost me to launch several missions to connect to the asteroid, then connect a transfer stage, then refuel the transfer stage.... let\u0027s just say I made a profit on the mission, but not a lot of profit. I spent at least 750,000 credits on launches to accomplish this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here are the pics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fihHXLw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fihHXLw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the accursed mission.
