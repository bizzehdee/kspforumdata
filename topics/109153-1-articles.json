I know the lab can hold 2 scientists, but is it required? Can I just stick 1 scientist in each one (maybe with a pet rock or something for company), and still get the research speed bonus? Also even assuming 1 is all I need per lab, are there any bonuses to putting 2 scientists in each one?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T00:30:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veldez\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xkay7","CreatedById":129537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T04:25:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Escience labs \u003Cstrong\u003Erequire\u003C/strong\u003E two scientists\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T05:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScience lab itself require two scientist but you can put as many scientist as you like in a craft that is connected to the lab and those scientists will still give you bonus. So more scientists ftw. Just a note; multiple science labs don\u0027t work well with each other in the same craft.
