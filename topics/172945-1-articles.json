I can pretty much delete 37 of my 40 saves.\u00A0 Also if deleting is triggering these issues .. a dedicated Load button on the main title would let me also clean up without the auto save firing off and taking forever to let me cleanup saves\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbolloxim\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrganizedChaos","CreatedById":179666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-25T15:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA semi solution to your issue might be what I tend to do when saving. \u00A0 I usually just overwrite \u00A0my existing save. \u00A0For instance I have career save that I named Career1 and every time\u00A0I save after a mission I edit the save name to Career1 and just save over my previous save. \u00A0Occasionally I have a second save that I\u0027ll use as a back up. \u00A0 \u00A0Also when saving during a mission I just overwrite\u00A0the quick save file as it always comes up as quicksave and doesn\u0027t create a new save file like when manually saving at space center. \u00A0That way I only have 4 or 5 save files at anytime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other thing, you should never delete the save file that is listed as \u0022persistent\u0022. \u00A0That is the auto save file that overwrites itself when auto saving. \u00A0 I\u0027ve\u00A0seen people post with saving issues that might have been related to deleting that file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-25T15:17:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2018 03:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by OrganizedChaos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
