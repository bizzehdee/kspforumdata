Itd be way to unnatural if there were no surprise attacks, but in general once combat starts no scripting, what happens happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm defenetely gonna continue (im about half way through the redone chapter 1), but its taking way more time as ive switched to a more comic style (actual dialogue photoshoped into images and it actually looks liek a comic, not just a bunch of screenshots). Ive decided to go with quality over quantity, and well, coupled with the fact im in college and started another sememster (already got slammed with suite alot of work from teh start), that and the fact that i dont play games the whole time im not working or sleeping means that time is short for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i will include more logistics (and even stuff like development of warships with scientists and all commenting ect), so i think itll be more varied (the 1st chapter doesnt have much action as it is kinda setting the scene).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the factions, i made a few changes from before. For one im making the so called \u0022technological superiority\u0022 better defined. For example pirates (a new faction i added that kinda adds some storyline and even gets an entire strike fleet wiped out by a single squadron of AKS fighters) are more or less limited to the worse ISP engines, and do not use any of the sleeker parts such as MK-2 or MK-3 fuselages/bays, while B-Corp is kinda mid-range group with rather varied tech but unable to use nukes, ions, rapiers, and while they do use plenty of MK-2 and MK-3, they also have a good variety of pirate like vessels in the appearance category. As for weapons, in the majority of cases (there are exceptions to the rule ofc) pirates are limited to 0.6m unguided weapons (they mostly use ant\u002Boscar torpedoes and weaker railguns with the occasional stolen guided missile), AKS tends to favor alot of guided smart weapons such as the KDrone series or others too with some railguns here and there, and B-Corp is kinda in the middle, some guided, some unguided. AKS im also making kinda more into teh whole cyber-warfare too, which puts limits on other factions to use minimal probes (anything unmanned without crazy firewalls will be hacked by AKS), and provided it has been in transit long enough, even B-Corp\u0027s guided missiles can be hacked (which limits B-Corp to engaging within ~10 km with such weapons to avoid the risks of having missiles taken over by AKS). Then im also making so called stealth vessels, which essentially any craft that has a relatively sleek shape with no exterior weapons gets (most AKS fighters and utility ships would be stealths), so those are basically invisible unless they get very close or fire weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, i think the newer series is better, more polished, and well, since it is more comic style is more entertaining (then just images and captions). I cant give you a deadline i plan to have the 1st chapter released, but im defenetely going to release it whenever its done and to the point im happy with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and the new story starts after the 1st battle for minmus (which is what the stuff i have sofar leads into).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe battle essentially involved AKS having 4 outposts on Minmus (which are discovered after a suicide scout flies into low orbit and stays alive long enough to scout the bases), and B-Corp decides that having AKS mining facilities operational is bad, and sends their fleet to Minmus. Ofc both sides suffer losses, and AKS deploys a super massive cruiser that gets wiped out by a single fighter after it destroys 3 B-Corp frigates due to a structural flaw. Afterwards, it essentially falls to the mercs stationed on the ground to defend the ground facilities, 2 of which flee and the equipment gets destroyed by a joint tank and bomber force, one of them gets sabotaged from inside by B-Corp agents posing as mercs, and the last one manages to hold off the attack long enough for AKS to bring in 2 SK-CRV-Ig4s alongside HK-200 and HK-201 fighters that completely obliterate every remaining B-Corp vessel in orbit, and just barely manage to hold Minmus (since B-Corp essentially runs out of ships at that point). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, AKS slowly rebuilt Minmus Site-1, the last remaining location that was saved by the sacrifice of \u0022The Minmus Elite\u0022, the toughest band of mercs they had (and the only group that was truly loyal to their cause). Although the battle massively destroyed most of AKS resources, what was left was just enough to rebuild, and with the passage of a new treaty on kerbin that forbade any and all combat below 5 million kilometers regardless of faction or allegiances, AKS was free to start utilizing the facilities they had on kerbin to send more craft to try to rebuild their assets on minmus, while 2 brave merc pilots working for AKS were sent beyond kerbin orbit to try to find a more permanent solution that involved settiling down on a planet or moon that B-Corp technology was unable to reach with any reliability. The new story starts out with these 2 pilots (and alot of the background is explained by them). Right now im working on another scene that involves deteriorating relations between AKS and a particular band of the pirates that used to support them, ending in some carnage around Minmus orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-07T23:39:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2015 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AxleMC131","CreatedById":150186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T04:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, can\u0027t wait for the next instalment then! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T07:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdated with the first few slides of the opening scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis takes way longer then the old format, but i think i can call it actually half decent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm also glad to take any suggestions when it comes to layout improvements (how do you think i can make the comic look better), and if you have some ideas for future story i will take them under advisement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also officially taking other people\u0027s ships, so if anyone has a ship they would like to see in the series feel free to submit it in this thread.

I am not saying im going to keep this stock indefinitely, but for now i see no reason to use mods since combat is arguable the most fun and challenging pure stock (and who doesnt like using peaceful exploratory parts to destroy other craft?). The only mods i find essential is hyperedit and targetron. Hedit i use to fix bugs and to automate deployment of vessels as if i get one fighter to X location, im not going to spend ages getting more of them there (many fighters are ill suited to being launched en-mass and need to be done one at a time), ill just teleport it nearby the other craft of its type and remove fuel until they both match fuel levels and location. As for targetron, us military players have all faced those painful flip through 30 debris until you get control of that one missile you just decoupled, only to find that by the time you get to it the 2 ships have drifted apart so far you now need to spend another 5 minutes doing correction burns. This mod lets me instantly swap to the missile i deployed and in general makes it easier to flip through vessels avoiding debris (which i set targetron to not even display). Then ofc i also use enchanced atmospheres (actually a custom modded version of that mod to fix some of its bugs and visual artefacts such as the major broken Eve atmosphere that comes with the mod). Visuals like that really add to the game far more then anything else would have and makes those screenies feel more lifelike and realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Posterus, i will deploy it as a flagship (since it has better armor then most AKS ships, and i kinda view flagships as heavier armor allowing them to spearhead assaults). As for the weapons, i might replace your ibeam missiles for simpler ones since most ship-on-ship battles involve at least 1 vs 2 or so capitals and some stray fighters. In single 1 vs 1 combat even 500 part ships are playeable, but 1 vs 1 just doesnt look right. Ive already done a small 1 v 1 skrimish (spoiler alert) around Minmus, but i think itll be the first and last 1 v 1 battle since it does not make much sense for anyone, especially AKS or B-Corp to deploy even a corvette without a fighter escort at the bare minimum beside it. Im still adding that battle (as in ~half done with that and some other stuff) but 1 v 1s are just not gonna happen anymore, it doesnt feel natural for even smaller capital ships to be unescorted and all alone especially in friendly territory (unless its a random pirate vessel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, im continuing the series although something id like to do is make an actual render for the front page (which should have say a formation engaging another formation). Too bad i SUCK a rendering, mostly limited to photoshopping some random effects to make screenies look cooler. If anyone knows someone who is good at renders and takes requests id really like an actually decent front page to use for this series.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T17:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs for 1v1\u0027s, I love them!

So unless you want to, you dont actually need to create launch stages as i already have a launcher that works (and AKS also has its launch systems, although they would be launching like 10 at once since the only launcher they have is for like 200t capitals, you can easily cram alot of fighter sin there).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, does anyone have anything against me disabling EVE mod for continuation.

If you feel that that mod makes the comic much better, ill leave it in, but i really am considering disabling it as game just runs better without clouds.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T18:32:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ogcorp Squirrel","CreatedById":143949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T23:00:04Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027panzer1b\u0027]Thanks for the ships, i really like them, and ill defenetely implement a few in the series. I hope you dont mind if some craft have minor alterations done to them (or well, AKS will have major issues with docking cause not a single facility of theirs at the moment has small docking ports on it, so that would be a minor issue if you ask me). Actually, i might keep it as is, to make say some scenario where the alliance buys fighters and then ends up realizing they arent compatible with their current bases. Actually, now that i think about it, i think ill try to convert everything to pure claw since its the most versatile.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOhh, and youll be happy to know all of the ones (that dont have launchers) are compatible with the standard light universal launch system B-Corp uses (i might have to use a larger fairing for some of them, but none are above the maximum mass that lifter can deal with).

I really don\u0026#39;t care about the alterations, but if it is not a bother, could you show me the alterations to them, if any? Oh, and the Python class (Which is my first carrier) may have a Mk.2 made Just for AKS ships, like the HK-200\u0026#39;s and, maybe (IF I CAN GET THE BLODDY THING TO NOT CRASH INTO THE GROUND, or water, no offense to your engineering skills) a few HK-201\u0026#39;s, but no promises.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nalso: B-corp can use the Python carrier (adjust the lights to their lighting) and the Bladerunner line, AKS has everything else, because you really deserve to use the bulk, as you have inspired me to create more ships without mods, and your skills with building and flying fighters are very impressive.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nP.S. I know how much lag SUCKS, and how much crashing hurts data, so my opinion, take off EVE.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Ogcorp CEO :D\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T23:38:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 11:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ogcorp CEO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
