The problem has been coordinating launches, particularly since the reference plane is not the solar system plane. I can get around this but the problem I am having is\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat MeanAnomolyAtEpochD variable lacks any definition that I can find. This problem is compounded by the fact that in the System viewer it is very difficult to isolate and visualize inclination nodes without have equi-orbital objects already in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is the J2000 and J1950 and J2011 definitions but there is no EpochD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sure would be nice to have some kind of formula for each celestial that would give its position at various times.
