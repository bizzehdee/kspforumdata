I think we all know this is very, very wrong. I\u0027m quite sure this is also highly unrealistic in addition to being highly unsatisfying.

I don\u0027t even need to prove that. All I need to do is slow down before the slope and go over it slowly. You don\u0027t go barreling off a hill IRL unless you intend to do some stunts, same thing applies to KSP.
