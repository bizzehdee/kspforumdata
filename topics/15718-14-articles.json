I mean, Serenity is gray, the human ships in \u0027Stargate\u0027 are mostly gray, plus so are the Puddle Jumpers in \u0027Atlantis\u0027. I could go on...

Everything sounds well thought out, so I have no major comments, save one: about the HAB unit and waiting until Squad implements native crew transfer functionality - well, cool, that\u0027s your decision, but I feel that folks who want to have that ability probably won\u0027t mind using one of the three mods (that I know of, anyway: Crew Manifest; Ship Manifest; and Crew Transfer, I believe) available for that purpose. I myself use Crew Manifest all the time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E And those who don\u0027t mind the EVA requirement or don\u0027t worry about transferring crew will likely continue to not mind or not care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I\u0027m biased on that issue anyway, because I\u0027d rather not wait longer to get the finished \u0027First Light\u0027 pack if I can avoid it, lol. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E So of course I\u0027ll encourage you to keep working and therefore release sooner rather than later. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor myself, I don\u0027t really see a huge need for bespoke external lights, unless you really want or need them to be very large, and/or placed in a specific location on the vessel, and would therefore want them to blend in and match the look of the rest of the ship. Now, solar panels... hmmm. I kind of like what BobCat did on his last iteration of the HOME parts, where he made a panel that matches the contour and paint job of the rest of the system, but they\u0027re still kind of clunky, and don\u0027t really look right when put on anything other than a HOME module, so they\u0027re still not perfect. But I do think that it would be nice to have some sci-fi looking solar panels that: are fairly sturdy when deployed; generate a decent amount of ec/s; fit the look of the ship and look like they BELONG on the ship, and not just tacked-on as an afterthought; and finally and most importantly are covered and protected against atmospheric entry when closed, once again being properly faired-in and made to look like they belong in that exact location on the ship. But this is all merely a suggestion. Totally up to you if you want to go to this much trouble. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a request for further Dune Raider development.

This project came out of my problems launching and assembling the First Light spacecraft. The parts were relatively light but bulky. Only the Anvil IV had the volume and only after I designed special fairings. Even then it wasn\u0027t physically large enough to do everything I wanted to do with it. It would have taken half a dozen missions just to get the First Light assembled and mission ready. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks: design a rocket big enough to launch the whole thing together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMAXIMUS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Maximus has a unique configuration where the inside is hollow and the engines and fuel are located on the perimeter. The total diameter is 10m... TEN METERS... with an internal payload capacity of 7m diameter. Think of a hollow rocket with built-in SRBs. In fact, that\u0027s where the design started. I created a payload shell and attached very, very large SRBs on the outside to take it into orbit. Unfortunately KSP/Unity is not designed to accommodate that kind of mass and stress on the attach nodes. The first design could get off the ground but would spin out of control as each SRB bent and pointed in a different direction. Solution: build the engines directly into the payload shell making one, un-bendable, structure. It works like a charm! Despite being one of the most massive rockets I have ever seen in the game it flies like a laser beam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Caution* because the mass of the rocket is so gargantuan at lift off and it\u0027s a SSTO it becomes challenging to control when it nears empty. The trust to weight just rockets off the chart. To counter that gently ease off the throttle progressively throughout the launch cycle. It seems like its best to match thrust % to fuel % (50% thrust at 50% fuel). Your results may vary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe side effect of this solution is that I have also created a one-stop shop for launching entire space stations into orbit. A creative player may find a way to pack all the necessary parts together and launch it. Once in orbit you could then unpack it and put it all together.

I failed to realize that by putting all of the ~50 tonnes of fuel in the aft 20% of the ship that it would result in a very awkward control scheme with pitching, yawing or translating. Furthermore, as the fuel load burns off the CG of the ship shifts quite significantly aft to forward. That means it is impossible for me to design an RCS system that would work. A whole week was dedicated to designing a solution that I think is quite clever. I redesigned the fuel tank. Instead of one tank at the back of the ship there is now two tanks; one in the aft and one in the front. Not only does that shift the starting CG to the center of the ship but it allows the player to transfer fuel from one tank to the other. In other words you\u0027ll be able to shift the CG front to back on command. Okay, maybe its not so clever considering mariners have been using ballast to keep their boats from tipping over for thousands of years but I still gave myself a pat on the back. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had planned on redesigning the fuel tanks eventually anyway so I don\u0027t consider that whole week a set-back.
