The L1 (or R1 I believe) moves the mouse icon slower. For example, when I want to move my node around the orbit, you can\u0027t click and hold the middle circle to move if the AP or PE texts pop up under it, so I hold L1 and move in slow to catch just the edge of that circle without highlighting anything under it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t give you a solid solution, but\u00A0here is a list of what I do. Try not to have too many auto saved ships, or hit save multiple times in one build. Dont have too many parts placed in red, if you\u0027re saving\u00A0a big section to place later use the subassembly. And I know this isn\u0027t ideal, but I always freeze in the plane builder and it seems always after I test then revert to hanger, so i build my plane stuff in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E then load into plane hanger for finalization . One last thing is to reboot the game every hour or two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-17T18:03:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2017 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbal-Willie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMy phone and fat thumbs are not friends\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fireball787","CreatedById":176858,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-19T04:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223021760\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159219\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221492236465\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176174\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Nye the pedant Guy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 15/04/2017 at 3:37 PM, Bill Nye the pedant Guy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be able to use maneuver just fine but out of nowhere it bugs out and I close the maneuver and open a new one and it won\u0027t work so I leave and resume and it won\u0027t even let me make a maneuver now!
