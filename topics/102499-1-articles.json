It is a triple-star system near a nebula at the center of Andromeda, and two of the stars are contact binary, it has several gas giants, one with a smaller gas giant orbiting it a s a moon, a desert planet that is tidally locked and has 4 asteroid moons, a gas giant with about 60 visible moons that is about 1/3 as big as one of the stars, and also contains a comet. Pics soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERS 1186-946-7-730132-499\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mordin86","CreatedById":29223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T08:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve travelled to your system, and I must say its very interesting!

The brown dwarf also has its own dwarf planets and even a mini asteroid belt consisting of only a handful of asteroids (no more than ten!). All of these dwarf planets and asteroids had an orbital period of at most four days, so the system was extremely small. Also, because of this smallness, everything was \u003Cem\u003Ehot.\u003C/em\u003E The dwarf planets were all over 3000 degrees Fahrenheit, one peaking at around 5000 degrees, and all of the asteroids actually melting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T19:43:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeesh! I don\u0027t have as many stories, because I only just started playing. I\u0027ve had it a while, but could start playing yesterday, when I got a GTX 750 Ti to replace a 610.
