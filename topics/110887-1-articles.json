Even though I had no issue with the clamps, I installed it anyway.\n\nNow the part won\u0027t load and nor will any of the ships/subassemblies that I have built with launch clamps on them.\n\nDoes someone mind just sending me a DropBox link to a copy of their own stock Launch Clamp folder?\n\nMany thanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T22:15:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wulf899**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T13:09:34Z","Content":"I assume it\u0027s just the .cfg you\u0027re after, [get it while it\u0027s hot.](http://paste2.org/1tcIn6bN)"},{"CreatedByName":"wulf899","CreatedById":67061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T21:59:43Z","Content":"Unfortuntely it\u0027s the \u0022sounds\u0022 file, sorry.
