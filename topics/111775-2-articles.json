The idea that they\u0027ll use it just 5 times is based on the idea that SpaceX will get used instead, but SpaceX\u0027s system will have a higher marginal cost (they have to turn a profit, NASA doesn\u0027t for its own payloads), so there\u0027s no reason to ever pay SpaceX to launch a single NASA payload once the SLS is complete, if they don\u0027t return to the old heavy launch schedule once Orion is ready for some reason Falcon is also going to be useless to them.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNot to mention, upon review of the Falcon heavy abilities, even the SLS-70 will outperform it, let alone the SLS-130."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T05:13:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E SLS is a boondoggle, plain and simple. Shuttle is a terrible model for doing, well, anything at all. The launch cost estimates for SLS are about as realistic as it was to call Shuttle \u0022a space truck.\u0022 remember when it was supposed to be cheap, and fly twice a month? LOL.\n\u003E What do you put on top of a rocket with no mission? I guess a spacecraft with no mission.\n\nI agree that the word \u0022cost estimate\u0022 is a problem in regards these massive programs. But the Shuttle (which wasn\u0027t cheap, as you say) did get close to a twice a month schedule, and it had a mission at the time - putting up the ISS. Launches were becoming routine enough, that they no longer led network news programs. Unfortunately, twice a month proved unrealistic... Challenger happened.\nI don\u0027t really know what to do with SLS, either. Robotic exploration is becoming so very good at traipsing across endless landscapes for months... years, at a time.
