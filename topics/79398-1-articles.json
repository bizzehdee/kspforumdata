I just started playing and I\u0027ve gotten through the first few training missions to familiarize myself with gameplay. What I am finding on the Orbiting 101 mission in training is that I do everything correct, but run out of liquid fuel before reaching the 800,000m, which of course will not let me continue with the mission. I have watched youtube videos of this being done, and I seem to be doing everything correctly. Is there a bug in the amount of fuel expended. Tried this several times, was hoping someone with experience can run the mission and see if they run into the same issues. If they don\u0027t perhaps they can tell me what I might be doing wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrizart\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-25T18:20:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2014 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Grizart\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T02:06:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe craft itself is somewhat messed up, there\u0027s a fuel-flow issue ... if you REALLY want to do this, you can manually transfer fuel (alt-right-click on two tanks to transfer between them) to continue burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T02:46:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.24 changed the Radial engine body part into a fuel tank, unfortunately this messes up the fuel flow on the ship used for this tutorial, best way to fix it is to right click those intake bodies then turn of the liquid fuel flow(click the green play symbol, it will turn into a red stop sign) then it should work as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jztemple","CreatedById":57512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T03:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new update 0.24.1 has supposedly fixed this, give it a try!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T07:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jztemple\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jztemple\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe new update 0.24.1 has supposedly fixed this, give it a try!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that is one way of fixing it I suppose:huh:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grizart","CreatedById":116625,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T18:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the updates and tips!
