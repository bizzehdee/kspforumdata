If you don\u0027t know where to put the manuever node, you might have to waste a lot of time in a higher or lower orbit to slide the satellite into the correct position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Solution:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple device anybody can make for themselves, assuming you start from a 100km orbit, and don\u0027t place the node more than about 1/4 of an orbit before your ship reaches the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/oywuJZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3879/14807926813_bb2ed685de_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214807926813_bb2ed685de_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
