But me and most others are going into fields closely related to flight mechanics. I could see you getting a leg up if you went into orbital mechanics though. I checked out Cambridge\u0027s intro text book for AE orbital mechanics and felt I already knew a lot of it. Maybe 1/3- 1/2 of what I knew came from ksp. Sadly though the simulators they use in those classes are nothing close to ksp. The programs are accurate to real life settings but they are more equivelent to a page you punch numbers into and it spits numbers back out. Anyways keep it up!
