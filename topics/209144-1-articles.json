Ironically, I see this as a positive in the system. As we have discussed before, just being able to move a slider or tick a different box cuts out gameplay as well as grind, so this massive efficiency loss incentivizes players to fly missions instead of tweak sliders, if they want to have an efficient network. This way, players can prioritize what resources they want delivered efficiently, and what resources they would find grindy to deliver separately.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, dealing with the inefficiencies is a gameplay loop on its own, you can just bruteforce your supply routes or work 10 times more to make them 20% more efficient, you can just run with your old cargo movers forever or design improvement after improvement for hundred if not thousands of hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0You could build a fully reusable cargo lander with standard containers, or just bruteforce the problem away with a solid booster factory and tons of disposable rockets each one carrying a single specific resource.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-30T10:26:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReminder that we\u0027ve seen parts looking like containers (though not cuboid shaped) on a lander near the end of cinematic trailer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond reminder that we probably can just carry fuel in regular tanks (obviously specific for each type).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-30T10:27:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2022 10:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by The Aziz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-30T10:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224159410\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022209144\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221659174852\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268648\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master39\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, Master39 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPast a certain amount, if containing a substance requires special condition you can just say \u0022Nope, this substance can\u0027t be put into standard containers\u0022 as long as it\u0027s not everything having weird and exotic requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwapping out containers for additional ship parts is something I\u0027d put strictly in the \u0022different vessel you have to rerun the route\u0022 side of things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I was hoping for in these kinds of systems, not to be forced to run a mission for every kind of resource, especially when they are similar, but also not cutting out gameplay entirely by just having your one well-designed mission be able to run all the way to the end game.
