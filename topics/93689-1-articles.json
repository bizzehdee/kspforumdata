Still i\u0027m more or less able to do without MechJeb anything i can do with MechJeb, minus one really important thing: planetary transfer. Plotting a precise transfer in vanilla KSP is nearly impossible. Even using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ean external tool \u003C/a\u003E, it\u0027s really difficoult to tansfer that data to a precise manouvering node. This is manily because you don\u0027t have precise informations on the manouvering node. Getting to Eve or Duna without a proper mod, is a unrealistical not-really-funny try-and-error process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the new \u0022buildings upgrades\u0022 in the 0.90, it would make sense to have the ability to plot some type of orbital manouvers, mainly planetary transfer, from the upgraded Tracking Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel transfer and Center of Mass in spaceplanes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding an SSTO spaceplane and getting into orbit is not that hard, even without RAPIER engine. The main problem is to be able to land when you consumed a lot of fuel (and maybe released a satellite), moving your COM away from your Center of Lift making your plane totally unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get back some stability moving fuel around, but not having info on your COM/COL make that another try-and-error annoying process. When you are back in atmo, you can have some feedback, but it can be too late and it can be a mess. There\u0027s a mod that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80581-0-23-5-Vessel-Viewer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egives you some useful info\u003C/a\u003E and with TAC fuel balancer you can get some decent results, but all-in-all is a comples solution for a not-so-complex problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne easy solution would be to have the info on COM/COL in flight. Another would be to have a system to automatically move fuel around trying to keep COM fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts for building incremental space stations\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace stations doens\u0027t have that much functionalities but they are fun to build. This is somewhat a pity in career mode, when you have to work with money constraint. In the actual contract system, you would never assembly a space station in orbit and with all the new mega-boosters you would never assembly anything in orbit probably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne simple solution would be a set of contracts that says \u0022put in orbit a space station with that-and-that-and-that and two docking ports, named KSS-01\u0022 and then issue another contract that says \u0022Attach that-and-that-and-that to KSS-01\u0022 or \u0022Put three new kerbals in KSS-01\u0022 or \u0022Raise Electric power capacity of KSS-01 to X\u0022 and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be also extended to contracts to build a spacecraft in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBalance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIon engines\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIon engines are very low thrust and very low thrust-to-weight. Ok, this is realistic. They are not really useless, you can build some very small, very light satellite with a lot of delta-v and still ~0.4 TWR. But now with a staggering cost of ~15.000, even considering the rocket equation, they aren\u0027t very useful. Unless you have to put some satellite somewhere where you need EXTREME amounts of delta-v, so much that you probably never need so much, a LV-N or LV-909 is way a better, more economical, simpler way of moving your satellite around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Unnerf ION engines, increasing (even a little, 3kn? 4kn?) thrust and/or ISP, lowering weight, lowering cost\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make some ION specific contracts (but this sucks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience transmit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransmitting science is more or less useless.

The budget of the contract has more than enough money to come back and you want to bring a kerbal to collect eva reports, crew reports and suface sample and then you have to come back (if you are not Danny2462...). Therefore antennas are useless for science and that\u0027s a pity.\u003Cp\u003ESolutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do contracts for unmanned exploration of some parts of the solar system, with a lower money yield.
