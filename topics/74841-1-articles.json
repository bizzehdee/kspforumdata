In real life there isn\u0027t any, because:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u0027s very very hard to fit 8 Km/s of Dv into a single stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Your RAPIER could hardly go past the third use without heavy manteinance, not to talk about your booster.

In KSP, SSTOs have just one disadvantage compared to conventional rockets and that\u0027s limited payload capacity. Besides that there are only advantages as KSP does not implement any kind of part wear or random failures so from the financial point of view, running a fully reusable SSTO is going to cost way less than running a space program based on conventional rockets that lose stages in process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, players should be rewarded for changing and improving their designs over time rather than for using the same ship over and over again.
