Hence you cannot build certain designs period. so replicas area a waist of time. Large ones at least. To solve this there would have to be a Cross shaped part with 80ms resistance(preferably one of those medel wire frames and or a beam.). And god knows what else they have to stop it even then. And they will 100% say they will not do it because it violates their game design. they are restricting things on purpose. It\u0027s not about visuals. My ship does not look anything like the ship outside of basic internal and engine/base item layout because there isn\u0027t more. It is already basic.

Sorry, if I thought a game backed up by NASA would be made to some real standard. They could have done a lot less than I could imagine just as easily and still get a very rich thorough game.

They put all their effort into restricting everyone very thoroughly instead of doing real work and making the game more rich.

It\u0027s quite correct! You and others need to stop being so condescending and stop stifling criticism of the game and leave people alone! These are completely valid issues and I have every reason to be upset as this game and how it misrepresents itself horribly to potential buyers(Specifically me!). This even more so with how the fans mindlessly help purport an unrealistic view of this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: And a little hint hint here. If you want to add most of these things you do not have to change the game. You get people, even for free as this is suppose to be educational, and modularize things with the new content and funnel into the existing format. Say a parts fabrication facility that uses realistic info on iron and titanium and other metals and how to use them to make parts then turn them into items that can be stuck in the existing framework. Anything would work. And it would not affect the existing game. All you need is enough info and the programming would then be easy to do. All the cost weight etc could be automated from the chosen items. The most of the work for such a thing is from the planning stage. This games design doesn\u0027t even use much of it. But at least you could get closer. The rest of the features could be easily added to an end item like electrical flow or other things if the game is every made more complicated. And in fact making such a thing would lay most of the groundwork and show probably a huge amount of the things that need to be added. And there are tons of people with education, most of which would help for free, who would help do it online.(Don\u0027t trust them if they want money.

I\u0027m stuck because I cannot test the separation stage for the engines that take it into orbit. The game crashes atm every time. Hopefully when the game engine is improved I can try. Also still using a mockup verion of the ship. Still have to design the electrical and how much storage it needs for ore compared to converts and stuff. Then probes etc and other functionalities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, sadly, I may not be able to finish this until performance improvements happen. This is always what stops me. And it\u0027s always parts counts! I cannot build small ships..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s currently at 1.6k tons or so full of fuel and no ore. about 8k tons total for takeoff and up to 10k tons if I add more solid rocket boosters to aid it on the way up. It\u0027s got a base of 36 mammoth engines at the moment for takeoff and will have up to 96 of the largest solid rocket boosters on the bottom phase for takeoff. The model should weight approx. what the end ship will weigh give or take a few 100 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can currently get it above 70k easily and partially circularize but I can\u0027t separate the first phase to lighten and finish the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, quick question, how tall can a ship be in the VAB? The actual Orion is 170m. If I figure out the structural problems I might be able to build one actual scale... 8) If only we had a larger building to build in... Maybe a space construction site... Or is that in the they won\u0027t make list. It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve looked at that. (looking up now.)

Too much weight for the fuel. How much do you need to get a vehicle like this useful(I currently have 366k fuel). I\u0027m assuming asteroids do not contain 144000 ore also! 8p How do you get massive ships working in this game. Has anyone succesfully gotten a 2500ton\u002B ship done before? This will now weigh almost 3k total without ore. And up to near 5k with full ore and fuel if that is possible. A little more than I was expecting. I think it has a max potential of 4k delta v with no ore and only 2k with it full.

If you aren\u0027t opposed to mods, check out SpaceY and SpaceY Expanded or Behemoth Aerospace. Both have large parts in 3.75, 5, and even 7.5 and 10 meter sizes. Try to avoid clipping especially for a ship this big. You have the right idea - launch full of fuel with no ore and use its own engines to get to orbit. Rhino engines have great efficiency for their size, so use them for space propulsion, but you probably won\u0027t get more than 5k dV out of your ship without nuclear or ion power. Also remember that with full fuel and full ore you have more dV since you can convert your ore in flight while your ship transfers to another planet. 2k delta V with ore \u002B convert \u002B 4k delta V without ore. 6k dV is enough to go to any planet\u0027s orbit and back (except maybe Moho).
