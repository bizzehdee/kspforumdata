I can load the vessel, but the game will either crash in a few seconds, or the whole driver will die causing a bluescreen and forcing a restart. It seems to be caused by the new terrain shaders being set to High. Setting the terrain shader to Medium seems to have tentatively fixed the issue but I haven\u0027t played for very long after this. I\u0027m not getting immediate crashes with it set to Medium so far like it was when set to High. I thought this was a video card overheating issue but the temps on the card never get past 65C which is well within operating range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSteps taken:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFresh unmodded KSP install\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemoved display drivers with DDU and reinstalled latest drivers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1.8.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAMD R9 390\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16GB RAM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthlon II X4 2.8\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-02T23:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne common fix is to turn down your terrain shaders\u00A0to \u0022medium\u0022 or turn down your render quality in the KSP settings.\u00A0If that doesn\u0027t work and you have AMD drivers, follow the instructions below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to your KSP folder\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen the file \u0022Launcher.exe\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClick on the settings icon (a white cog on a blue background)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to the \u0022Advanced\u0022 tab\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClick \u0022Run in AMD compatability mode\u0022 Click apply/accept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully this can help you a little! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
