Fairly stable in flight, but its suggested to have stabilization assist on and have a pilot in control.\n\nWARNING! \n\nDO NOT go to max thrust with the VTOL engines, it gets pretty hard to control and begins to roll. Around half thrust is all you need.\n\nKeys:\n\n1: Toggles main engine\n\n2: Toggles VTOL Thrusters\n\nB: Wheels brakes and Airbrake\n\nGetting this thing to maintain level flight on VTOL engines was a pain but I think I got it working. It can take off vertically, but landing is best done at very low speeds or on the main engine. Probably not a good idea to use both sets of engines at the same time. One or the other.\n\nIt\u0027s got great range and maneuverability but the speed isn\u0027t going to set any records. Useful for scouting out alternate landing sites for aborted launches or landings gone bad. \n\nDOWNLOAD\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/r3j88jjq7ijkfys/XF-88.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r3j88jjq7ijkfys/XF-88.craft?dl=0)"}]}
