Fairly stable in flight, but its suggested to have stabilization assist on and have a pilot in control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWARNING! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDO NOT go to max thrust with the VTOL engines, it gets pretty hard to control and begins to roll. Around half thrust is all you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeys:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Toggles main engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Toggles VTOL Thrusters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: Wheels brakes and Airbrake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting this thing to maintain level flight on VTOL engines was a pain but I think I got it working. It can take off vertically, but landing is best done at very low speeds or on the main engine. Probably not a good idea to use both sets of engines at the same time. One or the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s got great range and maneuverability but the speed isn\u0027t going to set any records. Useful for scouting out alternate landing sites for aborted launches or landings gone bad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDOWNLOAD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/r3j88jjq7ijkfys/XF-88.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/r3j88jjq7ijkfys/XF-88.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
