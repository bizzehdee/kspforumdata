There are many reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- One is that the gas giant could have somewhat shielded the moon against the formation of the neutron star (through its magnetic field and by just being in-between for the worst part). This could give you greater flexibility in the kind of life which could be present after a reasonably short time but don\u0027t think it makes the damage small in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Another is that you can use the far side of the gas giant as the \u0022safe\u0022 zone (I\u0027m being optimistic here) instead of just saying the ship got blown out far enough to survive. (Have your ship rapidly approaching the safer side when the star starts to go boom.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The creation of severe fluctuations and radiation bands in the magnetic field of the gas giant during the explosion makes the reasoning behind your electrical failures more obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Multi-body dynamics makes it generally easier to throw things around. The interaction between the moon, the gas giant, other moons, etc. could be what sends your ship towards the black hole. In particular, I think the expanding atmosphere of the gas giant (due to heat from the supernova) could create an unexpected aerobrake. Use this to send your crew towards a moon encounter they didn\u0027t see coming and gravity-asist them out of the gas giant SOI and into the black hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a little iffy on that last point since I\u0027m not that clear on the details of gas giant atmosphere but hey, it\u0027s probably better than what you get in most sci-fi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been severely underplaying the damage from a supernova. Might I suggest anything smaller? Besides the obvious explosion, debris from a supernova is so hot it puts out around 10^42J of optical energy over the year following the explosion. Your supernova survivor is probably getting fried no matter which direction he goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to stick with a supernova the best I can think of is parking the lifeboat in a deep canyon on a tidally locked moon, facing the planet, and using some sort of hybernation chamber for a number of years. It might not work if the atmosphere swells enough to deorbit tidally locked moons or if drag from the supernova debris does the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that your planet must be quite far from the neutron star, since anything close in would have been devoured during the red giant phase. Also, stars lose a lot of mass late in life and planets drift a little out. In particular, the maximum possible mass of a neutron star is probably less than three solar masses while the minimum mass of a star that goes supernova (and thus to a neutron star) is around 8 solar masses and up. These numbers are actually a lot more debatable than what Discovery Channel et al. will lead you to believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne terminology issue: A giant star on the verge of core collapse is not \u0022main-sequence\u0022. The latter refers to a star in the hydrogen-buring phase. It swells up around the time it starts to burn heavier elements, if at all. In the case of one that goes supernova, it will have already burnt elements up to about silicon in the core. The final, silicon-burning phase will last days and the core collapse is on the order of a second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep your secondary star a giant no matter what you change. Its habitable zone is farther out (and larger) allowing you to have more plausible lifeforms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what Wesreidau said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zuni","CreatedById":85203,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T03:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the info, christok.

Any star can enter the giant phase if it is sufficiently massive to ignite helium fusion--about half a solar mass is sufficient. However, such a small star has a very long life. The ideal mass of a star is the so-called \u0022Fundamental Stellar Mass\u0022 (denoted M-subscript-*), which balances various physical laws to produce a star which is massive enough to achieve and maintain fusion reliably and small enough to not blow itself up early on. It\u0027s around 1.85 solar masses--the sun\u0027s proximity to the Fundamental Stellar Mass is perhaps a part of why we humans can exist. For a simple boom you\u0027d want something bigger than the Fundamental Stellar Mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what to do, it is very difficult to pick a stellar event which doesn\u0027t completely destroy your ship. (That 10^42J/year I spoke about? That\u0027s a hundred million suns right next to you.) My best suggestion would be a regular, non-super nova in a trinary star system. The largest has already exploded (stripping some mass from the others in the process) to create your neutron star. The other two are a white dwarf slightly less than half a solar mass and a slightly more massive red giant. The dwarf and giant are orbiting one another and spiraling together--the dense white dwarf is already stealing mass from the giant. These two together orbit the neutron star at a considerable distance. The planet is in an elliptical orbit around the neutron star. You can excuse its presence so close to a supernova remnant because it was originally orbiting one of the other stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the white dwarf has taken enough mass from the giant, a helium flash occurs. (See the wiki page on helium flash for a brief introduction.) If your gas giant is behind the neutron star at this time, you might be able to hand-wave the physics sufficiently to get within a few orders of magnitude of survival. Remember that mass will be lost and temperatures raised in the nova.

I can\u0027t really comment on the science, as I try hard science myself, and don\u0027t know how routed you are in the current plot/setting. If it was me, I\u0027d make the concentration all about the supernova, and the black hole the afterthought/deep impression. The black hole is not their problem, or what they are running from, but it is all that will be \u0022remembered\u0022 or left over. The supernova is their death dealing enemy, the black hole is just their skeleton remains... (fade to eery sci-fi music).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS, I\u0027ve toyed with a similar idea planned for Space Engineers Machina (or anything really, but SE could let me do the artwork in 3d quickly). The story has FTL, and FTL coms. A star goes supernova, so the local corporation pulls out mining and coms from near by systems. Thing is, stars are 3\u002B LY away from each other, then more so for surrounding systems. So they have years to move equipment. Not so much time for within the system though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPPS, QM transmission of data is impossible in all instances. Sorry, tis the facts. But you can just \u0022handwave\u0022 it or \u0022lampshade\u0022 it. We write sotries for \u0022what ifs\u0022 and \u0022imagine if\u0022. FTL is the imagination. As long as your clear it\u0027s possible in the story, and happy our real world is different, both the writer and the reader can get on well. It\u0027s when people wish the imaginary to be real, or make a story all about imagination (it becomes too random) and no facts (consistencies) it gets more difficult. So you can keep your story consistent and allow FTL, as long as you don\u0027t try to involve relativity, as the two are not compatible. Might get away with throwing out locality instead, but that\u0027s a whole other ball game, so I just stick to lampshading and what if\u0027ing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPPPS, what Wesreida said. I\u0027ll refrain from posting my current sci-fi short story (very amature I hasten to add), but I do what Wesreida says. While I\u0027ve used some reasonable plot device vehicles to move the characters around the story, at the end, the enemy is human nature. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-22T20:11:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2013 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Technical Ben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T20:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwhip\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwhip\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother good read from Larry Niven: \u003Cem\u003ENeutron Star\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescribes accurately what would happen close to a star like that.
