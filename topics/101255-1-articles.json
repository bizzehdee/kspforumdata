Then, start putting the craft files you took out back in, one at a time, testing the Load button each time. When it stops working, you\u0027ve found the broken file. There\u0027s not much you\u0027ll be able to do other than deleting it, I\u0027m afraid. Broken files that cause this kind of error are typically missing just about everything, so rebuilding from scratch is more or less the only option there is, unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ofir","CreatedById":137926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T00:04:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, but when doing this do I have to fully close ksp or just click on load?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T00:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can freely move the .craft files around, and try clicking on Load in between.
