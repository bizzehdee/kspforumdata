Its a beautiful sunny day here in Eastern Kerbin, the waters flat and there isn\u0027t a cloud in sight or a breath of wind. Oh what do we have here, the racers are moving their planes into the water, would you listen to the crowd roar!!! Alright everyone\u0027s started their engines, five, four, three, two, one.... And their off!!! My god ladies and gentlemen were in for a show today!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i was thinking of doing an air racing challenge based off of the 1910\u0027s to 1930\u0027s Schneider Trophy air races, with each racer running a time trial on their own PC and forwarding the results, as KSP doesn\u0027t have a stable, easy to use multiplayer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently my thoughts are to use Infinite Dice\u0027s ICE pack so racers have to manage their engines so they can finish the race, as well as having a FAR and stock aero categories. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of the course itself, I\u0027m going to make and distribute a save with pylons set up in the water surrounding the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs well as finalize the details i will also make some floats to go with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bubbadevlin","CreatedById":136524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T21:45:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe there is a mod somewhere that already adds race pylons (I know it uses Kerbal Konstructs), and sounds like cool idea!. I don\u0027t suggest trying to compare individual entries, just base it on mission times\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
