So the fuel efficiency difference would be ~10-15%. if your lander\u0027s weight and fuel requirement fits for a Terrier or Poodle there would be even less of a reason to do the whole docking thing. In general I think most people probably just use these engines for vacuum landers (=option 2), thus foregoing all the hassle and their efficiency offsets a lot the engine weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there fuel efficiency stats for the different stages used on the moon missions?

The Mun departure burn from Munar orbit is so tiny it\u0027s not much extra fuel to take down the the surface, and the small size of the Mun means taking it down isn\u0027t hard.

But there are also many other reasons I did not see being mentioned , which are more or less these :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Engineering constraints- literally, the engines were a mess to work with. Most engines were unable to be throttled at almost any degree, and could only be fired once (The S-IV actually was designed to fire twice, but even that feat was stretching it) : both problems are still a major problem for the space industry. Therefore,each part of both the Saturn V and its payload was designed to meet certain Propulsion needs at specific times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Decent Propulsion System (the LM\u0027s engine) managed to circumvent both problems at a certain degree, but with ways too experimental to be fully trusted, and the solution posed its own problems; the engine was pressure fed with helium gas, whose pressure would build up through the trip, until the system vented it into space- saving the engine from blowing up, but rendering it inoperable. This usually happened a while after the lander was safely on the Moon, which would not be a concern only if the Engine was not expected to fire again after that point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Celestial body diameter. Both the Moon and Earth are HUGE compared to the Mun and Kerbin respectively. While they have the same respective gravitational forces, the Delta -V requirements to circularisation are give or take four times higher. In those ranges, and along with the distance between Earth and Moon, that\u0027s when the \u0022every gram counts\u0022 rule really kicks in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Redundancy. Oh yeah, that\u0027s the big one. See, manned spaceflight is nowhere as simple and reliable as stock KSP has lead us to believe -especially since NASA didn\u0027t have other space companies to ask which way they did it. Systems may break up, engines may fail, tanks may leak, guidance may go haywire, connection may be lost, accidents may happen -and let\u0027s face i: I don\u0027t care how bonded you are to your little green big headed (literally) suicidal maniacs, a humans life is worth much more than the life of a digital character, and much harder to preserve in space. And when something as grand as a round trip to the Moon is done for the first time in the history of forever, the risks are huge. Therefore, you have to provide your pioneers with only one way to complete the mission, but dozens of ways to walk on the Earth\u0027s crust again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some major examples of necessary redundancy on the Lunar Orbital Rendevous Profile, as demonstrated throughout the Apollo Program itself :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei) As demonstrated on Apollo 10, the distinction between the descent and ascent stage provided the astronauts with a way to Abort a Moon landing while it\u0027s done; if the descent engine failed for whatever reason, the ascent stage could be separated and ignited while still on a suborbital trajectory (which would obviously not be enough after a certain amount of Velocity was shed) and circularise again, with the useless descent stage fully embracing the regolith in all its glory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eii) Obviously, Apollo 13 is the greatest example of why redundancy was necessary. The Lunar Module served both as a lifeboat, providing communication and life support, and as a Propulsion System to head the whole Assembly back at home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eiii) During the Apollo 15 landing, the DPS collided with the Lunar soil, which obviously is not as easy to get away with IRL as it is in KSP. The engine bell was designed to crumple harmlessly in such a turn of events, but an engine without a nozzle is extremely inefficient and totally gimbal-free, which would be a problem if the Engine had to fire again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T01:52:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo words: Dry.

It\u0027s just easier to make an all-in-one and recover a bit more of the costs upon return. One of the problems here is that KSP fuel cans are in such discrete sizes, and as \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008080;\u0022\u003Epincushionman\u003C/span\u003E said above, the dry mass of the tank is very big compared to its fuel.

This umbilical WAS used in reverse during the famous Apollo 13 mission to provide the extra power necessary to top of the CM\u0027s batteries prior to LEM release and subsequent reentry.
