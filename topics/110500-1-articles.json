Although I have never tried a rendezvous nor even a close landing before.\n\nI don\u0027t have RCS unlocked and forgot to tell Jeb to stop doing SAS so I had two orbits with no reaction wheels. I built big and managed to get 5 FLT-800s with LVT 909s in space with 3 Capsules on.\n\nSo I managed to rendezvous taking about 3 hours realtime but about 3 days from mission launch.\n\nIt is so satisfying to manage it, even though I think it was more luck than judgment.\n\nGot another to save on a similar orbit so hope I can grab her aswell.\n\nI have had KSP a while, got it on steam before 0.90 but cannot remember when I started (it did have all planets/moons though) and picked it up/put it down here and there but am having a lot of fun and frustration with the Career mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T15:50:59Z","Content":"Congratz! \n\nRendezvous are one of the hardest things to figure out when you\u0027re just starting out on the game and they are also good training for interplanetary travel as well. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
