The earliest Rover is 6 wheel drive... which is ok but 8 is much better. I also got it there buy itself and landed a Kerbanaut later to pilot it... this was safer and allowed me to not worry about having fuel to get back. A pick up mission will be done later with a three man module with only one or less pilot nad have all three Mun rovers travel to a common point for pick up and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways hope this interesting for someone to read. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.s this is my first post so forgive me if it isn\u0027t up to your standards.
