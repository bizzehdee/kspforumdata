It was a difficult maneuver with an unwieldly part, and as a result, the rotation is off. It\u0027s slanted like 30 degrees to the side from what I want it to look like. Now the transport stage is still attacked, so I could just undock the part, rotate it as I want, and dock it again. I would be perfectly aligned and there would be no need to translate, so it should be easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in practical application, after you undock, the docking collars don\u0027t \u0022like\u0022 each other anymore. You can touch them together but they won\u0027t connect. My question is - how do you make it so that it connects again? Do I have to be a minimum distance away, or does a minimum amount of time have to pass, or anything like it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-21T16:02:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2014 04:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMarking as answered.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T14:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a trick for this that another poster recommended: Undock, rotate to desired orientation, quicksave, quickload.
