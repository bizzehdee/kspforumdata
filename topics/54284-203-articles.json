This should be somewhere in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E instructions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what happens with physics hold on. I think I\u0027ve been too busy making sure my bases don\u0027t explode before worrying about hitting a button (and I usually have to open the build window anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the stakes: actually, a single -Y bounds stake behaves exactly the same as a single origin stake. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s in your copy of the manual (but will be in the version linked from the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E), but section 3.2 goes into detail about stake operation. But for the moment...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe positions of all \u003Cstrong\u003EOrigin\u003C/strong\u003E stakes (Bounds or Direction: no difference for Origin) are averaged to find the site\u0027s center. IE, the point above which the craft\u0027s root node will be placed with the bottom of the craft\u0027s bounding box touching the center (unless other stakes are used). If there are no \u003Cstrong\u003EOrigin\u003C/strong\u003E stakes, then the positions of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E stakes are averaged (this is to ensure there is a center). This means that using two Origin stakes is sufficient to create a site where the build craft will not hit the stakes if they are sufficiently separated (about the size of the craft is enough). Also the center of the site is actually about 19cm above the ground (by design: this gives a little leeway on uneven ground).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe default orientation of the site is such that editor (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) up is local up and the parts pointing towards the door will point towards east. This is where \u003Cstrong\u003EDirection\u003C/strong\u003E stakes come in. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u002BX\u003C/strong\u003E is towards the editor door (east on the launch pad), \u003Cstrong\u003E\u002BY\u003C/strong\u003E is up and \u003Cstrong\u003E\u002BZ\u003C/strong\u003E is north, I guess (I get confused by the left-handed system). The positions of all direction stakes with the same axis are averaged and the line joining the site\u0027s center to the axis point forms the relevant axis of the site. Do note that \u003Cstrong\u003EY Direction\u003C/strong\u003E stakes can be dangerous and must be used with extreme care (ie, in conjunction with bounds stakes), otherwise your craft absolutely will be built paritially in the ground. Also, when the site\u0027s axes are not mutually perpendicular, they will be rectified so up is up (unless you have Y Direction stakes) and the other errors minimized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy default, the craft is built with the root directly over the site\u0027s center. Adjusting this is where \u003Cstrong\u003EBounds\u003C/strong\u003E stakes are used. In general, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edo not use\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u002BY Bounds\u003C/strong\u003E stake, as that is the top of the craft\u0027s bounding box. It is there because there may be times it is useful. Anyway, again, all stakes with the same setting are averaged. The way bounds stakes work is that if you have only one bounds point on an axis then that side of the craft\u0027s bounding box will touch that bounds point: eg, with a \u002BX Bounds point, the door facing side of the craft will \u0022slide\u0022 along the bounds point as \u0022adjustments\u0022 are made on the Y or Z axis. However, if two bounds points are specified for an axis (eg, \u002BX and -X), then the craft\u0027s bounding box will be centered over the point halfway between the two bounds points on that axis. Any \u0022sliding\u0022 occurs along the site\u0027s axis planes (for a site with X bounds stakes, the sliding will be in the site\u0027s Y-Z plane).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does all this mean?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s how to do a build for a large craft on unfriendly terrain (eg, the side of a Mun crater: title page of EL\u0027s manual:)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPlace an \u003Cstrong\u003EOrigin\u003C/strong\u003E stake somewhere convenient.

More importantly, this gives very clear meaning (to yoU!) to the bounds stakes you will use.

You want your X and Z bounds stakes to be the corner over the highest terrain for the site with the craft over the lower terrain. If you get mixed up, your craft will spawn over (and in) higher terrain. You then put your -Y bounds stake a little bit higher than the X and Z bounds stakes, and your craft will spawn clear of the ground. Do be aware that for steep terrain your craft may spawn quite far from the ground, so launch clamps are highly recommended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis didn\u0027t quite fit, but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe line connecting the \u003Cstrong\u003EOrigin\u003C/strong\u003E stake to the \u003Cstrong\u003EDirection\u003C/strong\u003E stake, projected onto the local horizontal plane, will form that axis of the site (-X stake will be the -X axis of the site).

As usual trying to view a 3D image in 2D is not as easy as it seems. I wonder if two dotted lines would help? I think the base of the launch towers is a rectangle with one corner bounded by the \u002BZ Bound Stake and the \u002BX Bound Stake? A dotted line from the \u002BX Bound Stake projected along the ground towards the actual footprint of the spawned craft (the launch towers) and another one from the \u002BZ Bound Stake. All I am suggesting is a little annotation on the drawing to aid the user in visualizing the situation in conjunction with your written descriptions. As they say, an image is worth a thousand words, but an image with a couple of notes added goes much further.

Mostly a judgment call. However, I take things like the part\u0027s primary purpose into account, thus why command pods have very low productivity. The various \u0022passenger\u0022 parts have slightly higher productivity because I figure there might be more room for tools and better accessibility. It\u0027s easy to imagine the science lab coming with some tools. Also, I did not want to alter the masses or costs of stock parts, thus again the low productivity. The rocket workbench (funny tower in pods) I settled on 1 being a good factor because though there\u0027s little room for tools, it has fantastic accessibility (also, I figured out how to make use of it long after coming up with the build system). The main workshop I consider to be the limit. If you look inside it, you\u0027ll see that despite the big parts storage in the center, it\u0027s quite spacious, particularly the lower \u0022deck\u0022 (though, admittedly, looking down there can be problematic). The 5 is pretty arbitrary (I certainly do not recommend using higher, rather I recommend lower in general), but it comes into the mass and cost of the part. That 15t is made up of 6-8t hull (guesstimate based on 4t for a Jumbo-64) and the rest heavy equipment. And then that equipment is \u003Cem\u003Eexpensive\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you meant how long it takes to make a part, that\u0027s just 5 kerbal-hours per ton of dry-mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the initial assumption...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen it comes to part cost, I worked out a cost for RocketParts based on the prices of the various stock tanks with a 20% markup (and then back-calculated costs for Metal and MetalOre). I then went through the parts calculating their cost in RocketParts, the value of those parts, and a markup which varies from 1.1 (structural parts) to 44 (science parts). The workshop is at 25. While writing this I realized that productivity factor should come into the markup (it currently doesn\u0027t: it\u0027s a flat 25)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re curious, take a look at partcost.py in my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/taniwha/cfgnode\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecfgnode repository\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apaseall","CreatedById":176515,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-04T01:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see I took a number of items into account. Mainly I went for the mass per kerbal. What I thought was there seemed to be quite a penalty for low mass per kerbal. That I took with the description to mean that things were rather a tight squeeze. Bonuses for the right equipment if it was designated as a work shop. With smaller bonus for equipment if it was a science lab. I was trying to work on some form of PF per kerbal, plus space bonus plus equipment bonus. Space bonus being tiny or negative for small spaces, determined by the mass per kerbal. Anyway it was more of a curiosity/have I got it right sort of thing. I did try a few equations in a spreadsheet, the first one was way off, the second I used as a guide to see if my PF was way out.
