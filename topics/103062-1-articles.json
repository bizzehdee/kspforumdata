Either we assume stock battery has 20 Wh/kg. Then 130Wh/kg would be equivalent to mid-tier flywheel (5-6x more energy density). So then I could rename flywheel names. Alternatively (as I did) we could assume that KSP stock batteries are equivalent to best technology we have today (LiPolymer batt.) so 150Wh/kg. Then we could assume that mid-tier and top-tier composite flywheels are connected to the future material science technology (see Boeing presentation) that has yet to be researched ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThe only thing is how to name 1st tier flywheel - graphite composite or carbon fiber composite?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI\u0027m also thinking about adding some kind of disadvantage to those batteries to balance them against stock (additionaly to a high price for career and end-tier technology requirement for science mode). So for someone playing sandbox usage of them will be somewhat balanced as well.\n\n1. First thing that came to my mind is usage of EC either constant or connected to spinspeed (so % of battery load). \n\n1a. RL background for constant EC usage would be usage of some kind of hybrid system comprising of passive (no-maintenance) or electromagnetic bearings and active magnetic bearings (to overcome additional G-forces experienced during rocket motor burns). \n\n2b. RL background for EC usage connected to battery load would be spinspeed that produces increased friction and heat. Nowadays this is one of a capacity limiting factor for NASA G2 flywheel.\n\n3. EC usage connected to experienced G-force (RL background - active magnetic bearings activate to counteract excessive G-forces applied on flywheel)\n\n4. Heat production and accumulation so one would need some kind of radiators or else battery capacities would be throttled as heat increases.\n\n5. No surface attachment possible (to not disturb magnetic fields).\n\n6. Easy to destroy (high G-forces experienced by too harsh landing might deform spinning wheel and damage battery).\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T07:28:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 07:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite**"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T14:55:51Z","Content":"some tests with Nertea\u0027s engines, big interplanetary tug for heavy weights, 2nd reusable stage, with vasmir engines.

Let\u0027s compare:\n\nStock KSP battery (chemical):\n\n- unlimited lifespan and doesn\u0027t discharge when unused - in RL they have very limited lifespan and discharge slowly over time when unused - not realistic\n\n- capacity doesn\u0027t change over time - in RL batteries have very limited charge/discharge numbers and their capacity decreases with each charge / recharge\n\n- same battery effieciency no matter what load - in RL battery efficiency drop dramatically when overloaded (and then rest is released as heat) - and let\u0027s not forget that chemical batteries used in space are used mostly for low loads - not realistic\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/dnd6xxb.png](http://i.imgur.com/dnd6xxb.png)\n\n- very-wide / unlimited operating temperature range - in RL most high-capacity batteries have very limited operating temperature range - not realistic\n\n- can discharge / recharge quickly - in RL chemical batteries have low power density -\u003E are very limited when it comes to recharge/discharge rate, rapid discharge is domain of capacitors that have unfortunately low energy density - not realistic\n\n- able to provide energy for different voltages with high power quality - in RL chemical batteries doesn\u0027t have this ability, not to mention limited ability when it comes to peak shaving, load leveling, reactive power support etc. so generally they wouldn\u0027t be able to sustain different electrical systems at the same time - not realistic\n\n- doesn\u0027t require cooling - assuming they are Li-Polymer and are densely packed they should require cooling some form of cooling - not realistic\n\nNow let\u0027s see where we land with flywheel batteries (mechanical) compared to KSP battery behaviour:\n\n- RL practically maintenance free and cycle life times \u003E25 years due to non-touch bearings - so in KSP you could use it for very long duration missions - realistic\n\n- RL practically unlimited charge/recharge cycles and they doesn\u0027t affect capacity - see above - realistic\n\n- RL ability so sustain heavy loads and high overall efficiency (90%) - so quite realistic\n\n- RL wide temperature operating range - much wider than chemical batteries - realistic\n\n- RL can discharge / recharge quickly - so it\u0027s in line with KSP battery behaviour - realistic\n\n- RL able to provide energy for different voltages with high power quality - and they are perfect for load leveling peak shaving etc - realistic\n\n- RL require cooling, yes, but even then using energy for cooling their discharge rate is comparable with chemical batteries when we use superconducting bearings (touchless) (and let\u0027s remember that primary battery usage is for microgravity) - so semi-realistic now, that\u0027s why I thought about implementing some small EC usage for those kind of batteries\n\nproof:\n\n![OdJHZZy.png](http://i.imgur.com/OdJHZZy.png)\n\nAlso with development of high temperature superconductors the cost decreases and low temperature point for cooling increases.\n\nNASA uses HTSC:\n\n[http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/haefele1/](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/haefele1/)\n\nAs for your point 1:\n\n![QHJnIx2.png](http://i.imgur.com/QHJnIx2.png)\n\nSo the general research in flywheels is to maximize spin speed (w2) and minimize mass (I). So in effect flywheel mass to vehicle mass is usually very small to make undesired spin movement. Also we can use counterrotating flywheels in tandems so they cancel each others torque when changing rotation speed.\n\n![3rjVcZR.png](http://i.imgur.com/3rjVcZR.png)\n\n*from B. Bolund - flywheel energy storage systems.*\n\nAs for your 2nd point - mass and safety:\n\nI think we are talking about two different types of flywheels, large steel ones and very small light composite ones. Composite flywheels doesn\u0027t break apart and damage everything as steel ones, composite material tend to micro-deform but is regarded much safer for eventual failure fallout. So no heavy casing. Besides composite flywheels are ultra-light and small, very low density, also composite shape is different than metal one (so no broad wheels rather hollow long narrow ones due to different optimal shape for max Ec between steel and composite ones).\n\nI cited NASA G2 flywheel specifications for the whole system, not flywheel itself. The whole G2 system weighs 98.9kg. And that weight includes everything. G2\u0027s flywheel weighs 22.7 kg so only 23% of total system. \n\nMore on safety: G2 flywheel bearings can sustain (touchless) 3 times heavier flywheel (even if it\u0027s not spinning). So flywheel can safely operate under 3G accelerations. That\u0027s enough for me to use it in KSP. We can assume some kind of springs / dampeners for micro/noise accelerations.\n\n3rd point - losses.\n\nMost of it I explained earlier on. Also flywheel has on average higher efficiency than batteries used in space applications (90%).\n\n4rd point - explanation same as 1st point.\n\n----------\n\nAll in all, material cited above gives me strong scientific background to use it in KSP alongside stock batteries. IMHO the idea is much more realistic for KSP battery behaviour than stock chemical batteries.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If I may make a suggestion:\n\u003E The Flywheel should not behave like Ksp battery, which behave like an accumulator which can discharge all power in an instant except it does not lose power over time (like real capacitors do). Your fly wheel should only be allowed to convert Electric charge into Kinetic Energy and back to Electric Charge at a maximum rate. Preferable, it automatically stores excess Electric Charge and generate Electric Charge when it is low.\n\nWell I would argue that KSP stock battery should not behave like KSP battery ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAim of this mod is to keep things as simple as possible, one reason being that I\u0027m not a coder, other being I don\u0027t think it is necessary to over-complicate this.\n\nThe proposed function you describe is what currently Nertea\u0027s capacitors do except they don\u0027t automatically charge/discharge (and they use more generic name \u0027stored energy\u0027).\n\nI mean why create another type of resource (kinetic energy), when composite (NASA G2 and future) flywheels are able to store energy practically without losses in micro-g environment and discharge it very quickly when needed? So RL flywheel behaviour is pretty much equivalent of stock KSP battery?\n\nThe main restriction of flywheels I\u0027m thinking of now is just that they will require small amounts of energy to operate. This will be explained by both need to cool super-conducting bearings and small kinetic energy looses over time. This solution is very elegant since it is enough realisti-sh for me and doesn\u0027t require any code to write ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T09:32:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 09:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite**"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T11:16:11Z","Content":"Man I realy love this stuff, it\u0027s a nice opportunity to learn to know cutting edge technologies ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nI\u0027m looking at the Boeing [FlyWheel technology](https://www.uaf.edu/files/acep/BoeingFlywheelOverview_06_20_2012.pdf), it\u0027s quite impresive.

As a first step you might want to use the resource converters found in Regolith with 2 conversion buttons, store and release. A second step would be to use a part specialised in energy storage.

But I wonder what happens if the bearing fail when this flywheel is at full speed (500.000 RPM) ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E Welll unless you want to superseed the Kerbal level of realism, you going to need a part which simulates this. As a first step you might want to use the resource converters found in Regolith with 2 conversion buttons, store and release. A second step would be to use a part specialised in energy storage.

Although ment for chemical properties, it should also be usefull for abstract etherial resources like Kenetic Energy. It would have to be automated, effectively charging when you have an energy surplus and supply electrical charge when you have a shortage.\n\nAs for fail I assume two types- overspin which won\u0027t be an option since momentum is controlled and throttled back if needed. 2nd type will be ofc excessive g-forces and I guess battery will simply go Kerbal-boom ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAs for charge/discharge efficiency and maximum powerload throughoutput - it isn\u0027t a problem for a flywheel so why not just leave it behaving like a battery? In the end I\u0027m not seeing the difference whether I use EC or kinetic energy for storage. In the end excess EC ends up in energy storage and when there\u0027s a need it is released from storage. Only way to justify this would be to introduce cap on charge/discharge rate or specific usage for KSPI(?). However flywheels aren\u0027t powerload-capped unlike chemical batteries.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T11:39:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite**"},{"CreatedByName":"funk","CreatedById":118840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T13:47:37Z","Content":"I agree mostly with your statements, assuming less losses in kereality.\n\nThe picture in your post regarding efficiency over time is tbh a nice slide to show.

To get anywhere near realistic (KSPI) power levels, you would have to multiply power consumption of Nertea engines by about 2000. Now you 18x Flywheel Energy Density Batteries no longer look so overpowered, rather the opposite.

As for Nertea\u0027s engines I\u0027ve never researched them. However from the game balancing point they were much more enjoyable for me than KSPI (only my personal experience) since end-game engines didn\u0027t have practically unlimited dV and high TWR. Earlier on I was fascinated by Interstellar mod however I\u0027ve lost interested in it when I started using an engine that was also used by Scott Manley in a plane with reactor to fly wherever he wanted without fuel and dV consideration. \n\nSo yah I found nice scientific background for flywheel batteries but my ultimate goal is to balance them nicely not to broke and overpower high-end Nertea\u0027s engines (and maybe FTT mk2 nuclear engines). If those batteries are also useful and not overpowering KSPI at the same time it\u0027s an added bonus.\n\nEdit: well when this mod is ready it can be easily patched to suit more whatever other want from it to do ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T09:38:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite**"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T11:56:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So yah I found nice scientific background for flywheel batteries but my ultimate goal is to balance them nicely not to broke and overpower high-end Nertea\u0027s engines (and maybe FTT mk2 nuclear engines).
