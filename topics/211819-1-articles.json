I went back a few pages searching.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast night:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was in a landscape of worn peach stone with strange ancient carved and black bronze sculptures and ruins. I climbed down a small ravine of water-smoothed rocks with a brook running through it. I found a secret doorway and underground acolytes in black robes and veils were forging stacks of silver bricks. I tapped a small silver hammer at a stone pass-through window to get their attention but just got odd looks. No one spoke English and I didn\u2019t know their language. A woman with a worn face and deep green eyes came to the pass-through and gave me a hard look. I could not match it and she walked away without saying a word.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found a way through following an acolyte and came out into a more modern city. I was looking for a place to sleep and went into a bookstore. Everyone seemed to be avoiding me like I was crazy. The young clerk seemed to think I was homeless, said I smelled bad and kept trying to make me leave. I walked down to a park where music was playing and my dad and brother were drinking beer and enjoying themselves at a crowded picnic table. They didn\u2019t recognize me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was chaos and rubble everywhere and someone was saying a dragon was attacking the city. I was a journalist now. It wasn\u2019t exactly a dragon, more like a giant segmented beetle encrusted in the rubble it was consuming with a human-like stone face and glowing coal eyes. It left burn marks where it gnawed at the concrete.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was in the ancient fantasy world again and I was a warrior in a pale wool robe with a smooth black bow. There was a broken sword I had to fix to slay the beetle, and I made my way into a torchlit cavern where an old man with a white beard and beads around his neck painted the pieces of the broken sword with black sticky paste. The stones in the cavern were hot but I had trouble mending the material and it crusted over in calcified rock in weird shapes. The old man helped heat the rocks again and I fit the strange stone pieces together. The black paste turned to a sticky clear liquid healing the seams and the stone turned to fur. The shape stirred warm under my hands and turned into a lion. She was long with patches of gray fur and I knew that she was to be my protector.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was more about sneaking past guards and making colorful paints in geodes in a workshop\u2026 I think Gwendoline Christie was there?

I try to figure out how to clean it but it catches fire so I rewind the dream (!) and put it on a boat. I\u2019m walking around this floating restaurant thing trying to figure out how to store it and restore it, and it was creepy because of my submechanophobia. But as the TV set is closing down, I and some other people get in EVA suits to go play on the fake Moon, one of whom was \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/206195-steve9728/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022206195\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/206195-steve9728/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@steve9728\u003C/a\u003E. He and another dude drop like 50 meters down a ravine but survive. Meanwhile I walk along the ridge to the base. Some lady finds some odd biological specimen, and I hurry back off the set (which was located on the grounds of my elementary school!) and find a needle floating around. Even though it\u2019s all fake, I try my best not to get punctured by it so I don\u2019t die. The lady decides to do some tests on the biological specimen by putting it in a puddle and it begins to grow rapidly, and I freak out and run away knowing it could be a monster. As I leave the school grounds I see soldiers fighting zombies in the neighborhood nearby, and assume they are from the biological specimen. I head back to the school to find these Utapaun, Squidward like creatures trying to eat everybody. I head along the school hallways and see everyone evacuating, and me, a black detective dude, and the lady run away from the monsters for awhile before finally escaping in a truck. We make it back to a military blockade, and the monsters who were chasing us were destroyed by lasers on Portland class LSDs\u2026 which were somehow in the river near the neighborhood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I woke up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-17T05:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeing this thread reminded me of a dream i had last night. I had been watching a youtube series called Fridays With Frank. Its by the Pinal County Sheriffs Office. Its a fun watch. Anyway in my dream I was a police officer and my partner was the guy from another youtube channel called Fire Department Chronicles. So, in the dream we are on patrol and encounter this guy in a white chevy suv. I initiate a traffic stop for some reason and the driver runs. We initiate pursuit. The driver/suspect crashes and flees on foot. My partner bails and chases, i take our unit to try to cut the guy off. I watch as the suspect runs up this long staircase and my partner chases. I eventually catch up. We arrest the guy and we charge him. Felony fleeing to elude, assault on a police officer, unauthorized possession and operation of a motor vehicle, reckless driving, criminal speed.
