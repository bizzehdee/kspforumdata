It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve played the game, but for some reason all of a sudden I can\u0027t interact with my mysterious goo containers or take down crew reports.

No pop ups.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo maybe some other things have changed, but you used to be able to take crew reports, etc at all altitudes, including on the launch pad. Is that still true?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHa. never mind I\u0027ve figured it out. It\u0027s something weird with the touch pad. Apparently, command\u002Bclick on a touchpad it doesnt work, but if you use a mouse and right click the parts action menu comes up.
