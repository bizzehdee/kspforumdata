Any chance those could be bigger?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso also - I found it rather difficult to click and drag a maneuver point. This is important when planning a Hahlman transfer as your delta-v doesn\u0027t change, but you have to time things right...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso also also - why can\u0027t I left-bumper-click more than four modes of time-warp?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrDave","CreatedById":64401,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T21:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, there is no way to resize the font in the map view, unfortunately. If you hover over it with the cursor and press B it\u0027ll stay displayed, if that helps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you press and hold the right or left bumper and then adjust your maneuver node, you\u0027ll have finer control. I usually\u00A0adjust the map view so nothing is right behind the maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can click on the time warp arrows above the clock with the cursor to activate regular time warp. I\u0027ll also click a spot on my orbit and select \u0022warp to here\u0022 which activates warp, and if you\u0027ve placed a node, you can click on the projected orbit (dotted yellow line) and select \u0022warp to maneuver\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
