Until it comes to normal maps. Converting a normal map from .mbm to .pbm, using HxD, just gives me a bad return. It looks like the normal map x3 across and a lot of empty space bellow which would make me think that I am trying to convert it to the wrong size but I have tried 1024x1024, 512 x 512 and 256 x 256 so I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any idea what seems to be the matter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailing that, could anyone show me a ready to photoshop normal map .pbm for the mk1 command pod as an example so I can compare?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheebsta","CreatedById":74167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T23:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, Unity complains when you add normal maps and says they aren\u0027t marked as normals, upon which you just click to \u0022mark\u0022 them, whatever that means.
