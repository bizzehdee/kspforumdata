It does not take any space in you modded KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first, thought about making a petition, but then I thought \u0022what the hell have I the right to petition for something that mod makers give freely?\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I think a poll where people like me (users) that do not know nothing about modding KSP would like to use this. Also, to know if some modders in the community would start using AVC as a standard in their mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to pretend if it is easy or hard to incorporate AVC in all the mods, no will I try because I do not know nothing about modding KSP (I wish) so, sometimes, in some mods it might not be practical or easy to implement AVC. I leave this to the modders community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do not know what AVC is, been you a modder (I doubt it) or a simple gamer like me that uses other peoples mods to enhance my gaming experience (thank you btw) you can check the original thread of the author \u003Cstrong\u003Ecybutek\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a typo on the first option of the poll, my keyboard sucks.

Of course when a new KSP version is released, everyone is going to run to the respective threads to see if they get updated, but when some minor changes are made like bug fixes in the same KSP version, AVC is very cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is to \u0022convince\u0022 the modding community to get into a standard.

First off I am by no means against AVC, my thoughts and opinions apply only to myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAVC\u0027s goal is to inform users on the mods that they have installed currently and tell them when a new version of that mod is available; This is it\u0027s key difference from CKAN, whose primary goal is to simplify the process of creating an instance by providing machine readable assembly and dependency information, but I assume it can do the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I play is that when I think of a task I want to attempt in KSP, I collect and assemble the relevant mods into an instance, and then assuming all mods work as intended for my task and I don\u0027t run into any show stopping bugs; I never update the components of that instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only be sure that all the components of that instance are intended to work with each other when I construct it. Afterwords it becomes increadingly difficult to say if updating any one component may cause conflict with other components and updating all components risks the integrity of the save file which the entire instance exists to support. I typically have one save file per instance if you couldn\u0027t guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such the only time I care about new versions of mods in an instance is when I\u0027m building a whole new instance which will then have a new save file, and this typically occurs when A, a major new mod that interests me comes out; B, a mod I\u0027m interested releases a major new feature or feature set; and C, 2 months after a KSP update when stuff is less broken and I can be reasonably sure that there won\u0027t be a new minor version update for KSP the day after I get to the mun, which breaks all my mods and fixes something that I care about, such as crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such for me as a player AVC has no appeal, the service it provides is unnecessary and generally unwanted; it\u0027s like waggling a sweet fish sandwich in front of somebody who doesn\u0027t currently want to each a fish sandwich, but does like fish sandwiches, but they can\u0027t have one because of their diet and they know they will have one later, just not now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a modder, well I mainly make my mods for me, so I\u0027m not going to add in things that I don\u0027t want. I\u0027m skeptical of CKAN too, as I\u0027ve seen it thus far it looks to be a mod manager type system, and I\u0027ve argued against them in the past, but CKAN is fairly young at this point, so I\u0027ll review my opinion later once it\u0027s seen wider use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModder, Nope, don\u0027t want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must say, that poll has a really loaded set of options.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
