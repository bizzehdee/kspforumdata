All of the mods I used on the old one function fine now, including KW, FAR, Hot Rockets, and Docking Port Alignment, the only mod that doesn\u0027t work is B9. On my old Mac I downloaded the pack from spaceport and all was peachy. When I upgraded, the mod would prevent the game from launching (I checked by reinstalling every other mod). So I downloaded the unofficial pack from Curse. Although this made progress, the game would freeze after entering the VAB or R\u0026amp;D. If anyone has an answer or could help, that would be great!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
