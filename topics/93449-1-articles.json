I think this is sad because, for me, it feels like im being cheated of a great experience trying to make it as a space program! the same goes for the rest of the buildings (or at least some of them!), the training facilities let you hold 5 kerbals from the get-go and BOOM upgrade!, now take your 17 kerbals out.. what ... the ... F... from 5 to 17 ? really.... i would like to see a more balanced system where i go from 30t to about 60-70t that is more than enough to make it to minmus or the mun and kerbal wise from 5 to 8\u0027ish?.. i get that some people like to just crazy it up with 1000\u0027s of kerbals and spacecraft the size of the mun, but those players tend to play the sandbox or on easy settings.. make some more stages of the buildings or just balance the current ones at least.. or just make an option to edit how big of a jump the building takes pr upgrade.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope im not alone in this, i really just want to have an experience where im getting pushed towards creative designs that are of more realistic nature instead of just being able to put tons of boosters on.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that some of the higher tier items are heavier and the big jump could be to counter it out, but i kinda like the idea that on hard-mode you have to refuel in space before going further towards the mun/minmus that early in the game.. with a 60t craft you can easily go to mun/minmus, maybe not so easy to get back every time, but thats why you have probes, flybys and satellites, so you are able to get some science to get the docking ports and so on, before you tempt to land with kerbals! all this will extend the early gameplay a bit, but i like that, i like the challenge! end game is always the same, why hurry so much to get there? when the real hard fun is the early game where you struggle to become a successful space program \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crimson Sunrise","CreatedById":132102,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T01:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, first the mass of some parts have to be fixed before this is taken into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank327","CreatedById":115926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T11:26:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jduen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jduen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI go from a max of 30t to 140t in one upgrade!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIt\u0027s actually even from 18t to 140t.\u003Cp\u003EI mostly agree although it has to be said that the VAB and launch pad limits are limiting at different points. You need a pad upgrade for munar missions and a VAB upgrade after that for interplanetary. So it\u0027s not exactly from one to infinity. But between level 1 and 2 there should be another step and the costs should probably be spread out accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
