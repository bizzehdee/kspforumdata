The rate of specializations fees pretty ballanced, though I guess RNG can play jokes on specific players. But scientists slowly lose their value as the tech-tree fills up, while engineers get more welcomed as mining operations spread. So it\u0027s kinda\u0027 doesn\u0027t matter who you get on the long run. Yeah, it\u0027s harder to find a good use for pilots, as a cheap OCTO-core can do what they can (and Jeb overshadows them anyways). I have a secret tendency to send noname pilots on missions where returning is a not-so-high priority.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T17:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes the fly by wire is game breaking for pilots. A little challenging to design around if you like docking head first. But it is low in the tech tree, it is very light and it is better until your pilot hits level 3. They should add in pilots have a chance to recruit free recruits of the opposite gender after returning to Kerbal from a mission. Percentage chance depends on the challenge of the mission i.e. first time back from orbit is practically 100%. It could also be tied in with upgrading the administration building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes the RNG played a major joke on me. my first 15 rescues were 13 pilots 1 scientist 1 engineer.
