Lock SAS at before launch.\n\n2. Increase Thrust to get liftoff, then move throttle to just below the Lower Throttle Marking \u0027See last image above\u0027\n\n3. Use D with the next step to help push your aircraft in its flight direction.\n\n4. Use F to release and Re-Orientate Aircraft.\n\n5. Don\\\u0027t panic you have a Parachute \u0027No Promises though\u0027\n\nFinal Thought\\\u0027s:\n\nI dont plan on any further development of this craft \u0027Its Project-K for a reason, quick, dirty, and works 89% of the time\u0027\n\nAlso I hope that more of you give the UFO - VTOL type aircraft a try."},{"CreatedByName":"Mustangrande","CreatedById":21742,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T02:35:46Z","Content":"What is this I don\\\u0027t even...\n\nThis object flies on unnatural properties. :|"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T03:43:16Z","Content":"It\\\u0027s different...
