Note the beautiful corkscrew trail below - I don\u0027t even know if I could fly it well enough to produce that!\n\nCarrying a satellite with a different scanner causes no problems. Problem is very specific to carrying an M700. Might be wobbling in flight (but cannot be spacetaped), or might not be properly shielded by the cargo bay?\n\n![ydXflqM.png](http://i.imgur.com/ydXflqM.png)\n\n\\*edit to close without bumping\\* \n\nThis bug has been claimed by New Horizons: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114092-1-0-2-Kopernicus-New-Horizons-v1-4-2-11-5-15-Vote-now-for-your-chance-to-win-a-new-star%21?p=1927810\u0026viewfull=1#post1927810](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114092-1-0-2-Kopernicus-New-Horizons-v1-4-2-11-5-15-Vote-now-for-your-chance-to-win-a-new-star%21?p=1927810\u0026viewfull=1#post1927810)\n\n(Although I\u0027m not entirely sure anything he can have done would be the cause...)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T11:04:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 11:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**"}]}
