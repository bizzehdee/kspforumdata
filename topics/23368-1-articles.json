In other words, your craft will immediately start using RCS spurts to try to stop the rotation (because you have an ASAS module), which can cause a rather nasty oscillation if you have a large and/or imbalanced craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, SAS modules do make a different if you have SAS turned on, but leave RCS off. The SAS module will stop your rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn thing that can help is to aggressively manage the RCS toggle. If you merely leave RCS on all the time and then perform orientation maneuvers, you will be using RCS fuel when technically you could perform the maneuver with just your capsule/probe\u0027s internal flywheel alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is to balance your RCS thrusters more carefully, which can be difficult to do when you have a large ship with a shifting center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T19:42:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry getting into the habit of toggling RCS on and off; add a SAS module and use that to reorient your spacecraft. The main use of RCS when docking is translation, so use it wisely. Also, you might be able to remove a few RCS ports from your ship, as sometimes you don\u0027t need a whole lot, especially with a small craft. If all else fails, just add more radial tanks or consider upgrading to the massive tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
