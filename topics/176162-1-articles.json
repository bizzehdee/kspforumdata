Steam controller interface wants to treat my X-52 Pro as a Xbox360 like gamepad. and trying to modify the controllers settings from the big picture game page causes a no controller detected message. I can assign buttons from with in KSP, but i am unable to assign any of the axis\u0027s, rotation axis\u0027s, or sliders, that exist on the joystick.Is there something i am missing? I have tried looking through the menus,but have yet to see anything in KSP that would allow setup of a HOTAS. I even tried using the profiler software that came with the joystick,\u00A0 but that seemed to introduce some minor input lag. where can i find the newly added hotas profile and how do i activate it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-24T23:51:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2018 11:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Chris Solomon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
