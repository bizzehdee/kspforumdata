I am an astrophysicist and am developing an astrophysics oriented mod as a sort of self tutorial process. I do have many years of programming experience, but not really in 3D modeling and game making, etc. So my question is this, I would like to place some astrophysical object markers at particular positions in the sky. I would like them to be just a small marker (perhaps having different icons for different types of objects) with a floating text name that don\u0027t move relative to the sky and at some point I think I would like to make them clickable to give a popup window with extra info, for example. I was thinking maybe I could spawn empty objects at really large distances (we are talking about kiloparsecs so no Kerbal should be capable of visiting these objects in the foreseeable future, so I don\u0027t need textures, etc., just clickable labeled objects). Does anyone have a good suggestion for how to implement this or where to start? Besides this point, the mod is off to a good start and I hope to be able to share it with you all at some point and maybe even open source it if I get that far. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T16:05:49Z","Content":"I guess a good starting point would be [distant object enhancement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69907). It would show you how to display far away object in the right place. \n\nNot sure how to do the text properly/easily, but I guess others would know ."}]}
