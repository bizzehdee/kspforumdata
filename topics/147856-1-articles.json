I want it to be similar in construct to Ace Combat: Shattered Skies for my PS2, and it would allow you to throttle up and down easily, so I would like it if someone could write a plugin to automatically lock throttle to 75% and when I press the (shift) throttle up button it will increase it to 100% but \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u003C/strong\u003E as I press the button. Once released it should return to 75% throttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a coder, cool mod idea for making my BDA experience more enjoyable.
