That said, I find overall design to be much more important, if you started out with a bad design, leading edge control surfaces aren\u0027t going to help you much.   \n\nLeading edge extensions are more important in terms of delaying stall, like the ones you find on the F/A-18, which generate vortices that sticks to the main wing. The surfaces atop the F22, F35, or the more recent Chengdu J20 intake can also generate vortices, though I had little success in recreating them, mainly because they are so small in size an require intricate design. I would love to hear if anyone successfully incorporated those in their designs.   \n![c6435133540def38b4cdea18a7856280--fighte](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c6/43/51/c6435133540def38b4cdea18a7856280--fighter-aircraft-fighter-jets.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-09T11:09:01Z","Content":"They seem to work, at least the flight model of my KU-57 seems realistic enough, although i have limited elements of comparison (SU-33 simulation in DCS or other flight sims).

Putting a G limiter on AA makes it fly mostly like an agile SU-27. The real world SU-27 has also very wide flight characteristics and is able to pull damaging G\u0027s if you override the joystick limiter, to pull aerobatic figures like the \u0022cobra\u0022.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Seems like the usual trick is to set them up to -\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E% in the right click menu(so they would be at a smaller \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E compared to the surface behind)\n\u003E \n\nYeah that turns out to be similar to how they work on real models, you can watch them in DCS for example on SU-27 you\u0027ll see the leading edge slats countering \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E. Same goes for the F-15 \u0022side pods\u0022 extensions, they do move counter to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E (although in a very limited manner). And yeah on that F-22 photo you can see them clearly too.\n\n(edit) on that very nice SU-57 photo they are also quite obvious:\n\n![3c129bfa4d22d4dd1867a9d1241363a8_0.jpg?i](http://nationalinterest.org/files/styles/main_image_on_posts/public/main_images/3c129bfa4d22d4dd1867a9d1241363a8_0.jpg?itok=ZERZ4MfM)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-09T11:27:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2017 11:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Surefoot**"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-09T23:35:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 hours ago, maas1248 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How good are leading edge control surfaces at improving maneuverability?

Admittedly it was a simpler design before the addition of high lift system, which i eventually persuaded to work.   You can now mash full nose up with full flaps and wallow along at under 80 m/s, it used to depart without warning below 130 m/s.     \n\n![rVs10c4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/rVs10c4.jpg)\n\nI still had a couple of self disassembly events - it seems running \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E below 3 at supersonic speed causes something to happen so suddenly i am unable to describe the event, suffice to say it disassembled the airplane.\n\nIf you avoid such pitfalls, it eventually gets to orbit, more or less.    Hypersonic lift/drag ratio of less than 2 however i am not happy with.  In stock aero i can beat that even with a mk2,  some of my mk1 / 2.5m ships have over 4:1 at this point.     It does produce somewhat more realistic looking aircraft, though in this case i have to wonder  - tandem wing?\n\n![Gl3w5NK.png](https://i.imgur.com/Gl3w5NK.png)\n\nWith high lift devices\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/3t45vn6oh1sb28q/fa5.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3t45vn6oh1sb28q/fa5.craft?dl=0)\n\nWithout high lift devices\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/mqutrh4kjvilfob/fa4.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mqutrh4kjvilfob/fa4.craft?dl=0)\n\nFuel fraction needs to be increased,  i fell about 50 m/s short of circularising my orbit (could remove a cabin for more fuel i suppose)"},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T00:27:03Z","Content":"Procedural wings is a must have, keeps part count a lot more reasonable."},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T17:16:50Z","Content":"So, this is a little off-topic, but im trying to make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E craft in realism overhaul, but there is this slightly well know problem and thats the bumpy terrain bug.
