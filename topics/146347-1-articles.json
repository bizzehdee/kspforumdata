It has been fully functional and I decided to add RP-0 to utilize Career Mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I start a new career mode and enter mission control. There are contracts available. I select the contracts, exit mission control. They appear under the contracts tab. I then enter the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and the contract tab wipes itself.
