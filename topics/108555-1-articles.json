Time has paid, and we shall see through this challenge.\n\nThis is a challenge regrouping the most ingenious, most creative, most powerful, and most impressing designs.\n\n* * *\n**RULES :**\n**Objective :** Build a missile detaching into several bombs, aslo known as a Cluster missile. You may detonate it wherever you see fit, and detaching process may occur wherever you see fit. Your Cluster, your way !\n\n**Restrictions :** What is classed as a bomb is a small end payload detached from the Cluster or Sub-Cluster that possess no propulsion method, else it will be considered a Sub-Cluster. A bomb must NOT be made of only a decoupler/separator or it will be considered as a debris. \n\n**Mods :** Any major mods may be used, except for weaponry orientated mods (like BDArmory). The use of cheat mods (such as MechJeb\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 and HyperEdit) are forbidden.\n\n**Variants :** For interstellar mod, you may build special cluster missiles such as Nuclear/Radiating. All of it will count towards the terror factor (described below).\n\n**Entry :** The price of the missile must be specified by a screenshot / video of the VAB or else the Entry will not be counted for Efficiency.\n\nFurther rules bay be enacted if judged necessary.\n\n* * *\n\n**LEADERBOARD :**\n\nThe leaderboard will be divised into 4 categories : The most clustered (More bombs are better), The most efficient (more bang for the buck), The most terrorizing (Civilians will scream), The most ingenious (Creation is key!)\n\n[TABLE=class: outer\\_border, width: 300, align: left]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]\n\n**The most clustered**\n\n(Most bombs)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]1. **ToTheMun** - 288 Bombs[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]2. **DJ Daemonix** - 64 Bombs[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]3.[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE=class: outer\\_border, width: 300, align: left]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]\n\n**The most Efficient**\n\n(most bang for the buck)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]1.[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]2.[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]3.[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE=class: outer\\_border, width: 300, align: left]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]\n\n**The most terrorizing**\n\n(Civilians hate them!)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]1. **DJ Daemonix** - Radius of effect : 3Km[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]2. **ToTheMun** - Radius of effect : 1Km[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]3.[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE=class: outer\\_border, width: 300]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]\n\n**The most Ingenious**\n\n(Best engineers)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]1. **DJ Daemonix**[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]2. **ToTheMun**[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]3.[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n* * *\n**MY ENTRY :**\nName : Project Clusterstorm\n\nSpecs : 64 Standard RCS Bombs, Space ICBM-like detonation (Sequential or All-in), Wide spread, expensive\n\nMods used : KW Rocketry, TweakScale, Ferram AR (Flight)\n\nPictures : [http://imgur.com/a/NVJJN](http://imgur.com/a/NVJJN)\n\n* * *\n\nGood luck everyone,\n\nDJ Daemonix\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T14:54:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 02:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DJ Daemonix**\n  \nUpdated Leaderboards"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T10:46:23Z","Content":"My entry:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zt7PbuxVivM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n288 Bombs.\n\nBTW, How is Mechjeb a \u0022cheat mod\u0022; all it does is provide information about the craft and several autopilots.
