As an example, an interplanetary ship with a crew of 5, but \u0027space\u0027 for 15, including a porkworks centrifigum, should not impose undue penalties on the crew who happen to be in the command cabin. It could be assumed that they are moving around within the ship during the voyage, even if they are (in game-mechanics terms alone) staying seated in the command cabin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T04:58:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see a change from the current \u0022per module\u0022 qualitative system to a \u0022total vessel\u0022 quantitative system. For example, each module could be assigned a \u0022comfortLevel\u0022 ranging 1 to 30 (with \u00221\u0022 being a mk2 cockpit and \u002230\u0022 being a large inflato). Then add up the total comfortLevel for the whole vessel, and divide that by the number of Kerbals on the vessel to determine the \u0022meanComfortLevel\u0022. From there, an algorithm could be used to determine the fitness loss per day. This algorithm could be as simple as: fitnessLoss = 0.5 * (10 - meanComfortLevel) [if fitnessLoss \u0026lt;0, then fitnessLoss = 0], yielding a range of 0% to 4.5%, with a requirement of at least 10 comfortLevel per Kerbal to remain fitness neutral.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven more ideally, I would change that if/then to \u0022if fitnessLoss \u0026lt;0.5, then fitnessLoss = 0.5,\u0022 yielding a range of 0.5% to 4.5% fitness loss per day, and make it such that only the presence of gravity can allow a neutral/positive fitness level (and allow centrifuge parts to provided a limited amount of gravity, divided among the Kerbals on the vessel).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothke","CreatedById":51185,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T05:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis idea is so ludicrous on the first glance and makes me wonder that you should connect it to a real treadmill and make players run in real life to make the Kerbals fit. xD Oh...
