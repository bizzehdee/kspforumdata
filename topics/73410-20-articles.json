But with RF alone, a tank that costs 250 in stock and 204 empty, is made 204 by the modification I made, then by adding Kerosene and LOX, jump back to 250. Works great.

You see, any non-procedural 1200L tank, only gets 1000L of usable volume by choice of the RealFuel mod. So it already has a 85% utilization, regardless of tank type (from what I can tell). So if on top of that, I force a 0.85 utilization , suddenly you get only 850L, which is a huge reduction. Well, no worries, I just increase the volume of all Real Fuel tanks by 1/0.85 so that the tank remains at about 1000L after my mod. In fact, I\u0027ll make 2 versions of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- first one will change all tank types by 1/0.85 so any balloon tanks will get a boost, while all service tanks will get a reduction (this depends on how that tanks was modded by RealFuels)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- second one will change every tank type by 1/\u0022their_utilization\u0022, so that they all get back to their original values. In this way, only people using Procedural Tanks will be affected in any way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, I\u0027ve managed to retweak prices to make the LoX fuel combinations a bit more spread out. Kerosene was much too OP for my taste, smashing Ethanol in every way and making Hydrolox useless except for high TWR launches. Now it\u0027s a bit nicer. I\u0027ve simply made these changes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- first, multiplied all fuels by 1743\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- multiplied again Liquid Oxygen by 1.3087, so that Kerolox costs exactly as stock fuel and Hydrolox and Ethanol get a boost in price (they need less LOX than Kerosene)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Halved the price of Liquid Hydrogen. That\u0027s right... it was waaaaaay to expensive to make it worth while. Now it\u0027s a proper cheap option for first and second stages. Even early orbital can be achieved well with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I didn\u0027t touch were the hypergolics. They are properly expensive compared to non-hypergolics, but I can\u0027t vouch for how balanced they may be with eachother (I only use KW and stock engines).

So, the big orange tank has a pill within it that is the actual vessel that holds fuel. The percentage of the volume that the pill takes up within the cylinder works out to around 87%. That\u0027s where that number comes into play. Not sure using that to differentiate tanks is the best idea, though. Cost is still probably a better way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you could do is make the cost of putting cryogenic fuels in a non-cryo tank. There is a number that dictates this, so that you could nudge that penalization up a bit, making cryo tanks more useful for cryogenic resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso of note, is that NathanKell pulled the costs of all the fuels to match 1965 prices in 1000\u0027s of US dollars (1 KSP Money = $1000 USD). So, the costs are grounded in some kind of reality. The benefit of LH2 is that it has high Isp. It\u0027s a pain to keep cold enough to be useful, even if hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, so the high price doesn\u0027t surprise me. Ethanol is cheaper (I assume) than RP-1, but we use RP-1 in rockets because it\u0027s better. The cost/benefit spectrum isn\u0027t fully useful in KSP, because things like toxicity or manufacturing/storage issues aren\u0027t addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScaling the fuels to stock is a good start, though, and I\u0027d basically make kerolox match the cost of LF/O for any given tank, then scale the others accordingly. It keeps the balance of RF while being in-line with stock KSP.

The file I had was nice and allowed further tweaking around the base \u0022default tank\u0022 values. I\u0027ll include at the end for inspiration, but it will have a*.bak extension. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t use it in the mod because of a huge problem. Procedural tanks mess up whenever I press the automatic XX%/YY% button in the interface. Basically it\u0027s always stuck at stock utilization. There is a way to work around it, but it\u0027s an ugly one so I\u0027ve abandoned that route. What I will do is something I should\u0027ve done from the start: make 5 different procedural tanks. I\u0027ll limit myself to Default, Cryo, Balloon, Balloon Cryo, ServiceModule, Structural. These will be copies of the normal RF procedural tank but allow for cleaner separation between the tank types. Want different crashTolerance or max temperature? Well, now you can. Maybe some helpful modder can integrate them into the career tech tree more nicely (rather then having all of them from the start). They\u0027ll even come with different textures so you can tell them apart easier. Also you\u0027ll be able to see the fuel details for each, to figure out which has Pressurized or Insulated stuff. Heck we can even add electrical charge needed for pressurization, Failure in Dangit, things like this. These were things which were impossible with the current Procedural setup. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout prices: currently, my mod first removes all traces of old fuels, so you start with empty costed tanks. Kerosene\u002BLox jump them back to exactly the old full price. The rest of the price changes I already listed in the previous comment. They are not great changes, I like the realism that Nathan provided. Why did I change them a little bit? First of all, the 2096 multiplier I first used made Hypergolics excruciatingly expensive. By reducing it to 1743 and increasing the price LOX to bring Kerolox back to the stock LiquidFuel value, I\u0027ve also made Hypergolics a bit more bearable. Secondly, I\u0027ve made myself a crappy Excel file to show me the economical efficiency of any rocket, in different situations (launch, second stage, orbital maneuvering, deep space). The file took into account ratios of cost, deltav, twr, cryo etc. and it gave me a score for each situation, with weighting applied for various \u0022Desired\u0022 factors (such as Delta V and TWR at launch, cryo in deep space). That file showed me that the Hydrolox combination was NEVER useful except in rare occasions at launch. By changing the price just a bit, I got the difference from a max 0.5 efficiency compared to Kerolox to about 0.8 in almost all situations when long term boiloff isn\u0027t an issue . This also improved Ethanol a little bit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Anyway, the changes are easy to remove if you don\u0027t like them, I\u0027ll put instructions in the cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow about tank type prices: when empty, all tank types cost exactly the same. Consider it the shell\u002Ba basic tank inside. But if you add resources listed as \u0022pressurized\u0022 or \u0022insulated\u0022, the cost of the empty tank suddenly jumps. Quite a lot so far, you guys might want to lower it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- pressurized adds 300 credits per 1000L (the basic 1.25m*1m tank), basically doubles the cost of the empty tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- insulation adds 200 credits per 1000L\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- both of them add 500 credits per 1000L\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, a cryo tank provides insulation for LOx and LH, but not for Kerosene (not needed). The Kerosene parcel inside the Cryo tank will cost exactly as inside a Default tank. But the LOx will be more expensive. LH\u002BLOx will be even more expensive since both have the \u0022is insulated\u0022 property. Thus, Cryo tanks will be viable for orbital manuevers, but not for launch (the size makes them humongously more expensive). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBalloon tanks are OP. About 10% jump in DeltaV as opposed to Default tank? Balloon tanks will add 600 credits per 1000L on top of the above, for every resource. So a Balloon Cryo actually costs you 800 credits per 1000L.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain these prices do not include the actual fuel, nor the price of the base tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: an empty Jumbo can hold 32000L and costs about 9862 credits when empty. RealFuels lists it as a Cryo tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Price with Kerosene: 12149.6 (the entire 32000L of Kerosene costs 2287.6)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Price with Kerolox: 17037 (12000L Kerosene at 1064 credits, 20000L of LOx at 2075credits and a whopping 4137 credits just to set up the LoX insulation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Price with HiLoX: 21371 credits at full, 16662 when empty, so a maximum of 6800 credits which comes from just 200 credits for every 1000L of volume (actually it calculates for 34kL, not 32kL, don\u0027t worry that is a consequence of that Utilization file I\u0027m still using). See, I told you HiLox was expensive. Cause it still is \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same way, a Balloon Cryo tank of the same size will cost up to 25600 more credits (when empty). Ouch. Of course, that\u0027s by design. You\u0027ll have to think twice before using it for launch, better go with Default one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If you want to see the absolute max, use Nitrous Oxide which is also pressurized, hehe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease remember that I\u0027m only talking about empty tanks here, which you can recover for a bucketload of cash.
