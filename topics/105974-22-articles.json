Also make sure the Animation script (if you have one) is a child, not on the exporter object. All objects that are to move with the turret should be a child/grandchild etc of the exporter object.  Take a look here: [http://puu.sh/mXZIp/266e624c87.jpg](http://puu.sh/mXZIp/266e624c87.jpg)\n\nI changed how the boosters on missiles work a little bit.  If you have a booster transform, then only the particles in the booster will be fired during the boost phase.  Any particle emitter that\u0027s not a child of a booster transform is assumed to be particles for the cruise phase.
