I started on it years ago, but it fell by the wayside as work became more important. Recently I decided to finish it and release it for the KSP community.\n\nWhen I first started using Unity about 5 years ago, I couldn\u0027t stand the way the GUI system was designed. I was used to the declarative model and rich data binding capabilities of frameworks like WPF, so I set out to design my own in Unity. This is the result.\n\n**Features**\n\n- Declarative UI \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 specify what you want your GUI to do, the framework takes care of the rest. No minutia of plumbing values in and out of GUILayout calls.\n- Rich data binding without a big performance impact. Unlike WPF, there is no reflection, only function calls.\n- Skin and style support\n- Full set of controls wrapping existing Unity controls, plus new controls such as TabControl\n- Floating tool tip rendering\n- Interoperable with any existing GUI code\n- No fancy confusing magic, easy to read code\n\nIt\u0027s really, really easy to build very complex GUIs and new controls with this library. I put together a short example of the basic capabilities:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lL2A5YwBqIw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIt\u0027s pretty flexible and powerful, and there\u0027s still a lot I could add. I\u0027m unsure, however, of the future value of this project given that KSP will be migrating to Unity 5. But maybe it will be useful for legacy projects.\n\n**If you think this is useful, please let me know!** I\u0027ll continue to work on this project and support it if people are interested. There are more features that could be added, as well as documentation and tests.\n\n**Project on GitHub**\n\nReleases, example project, and information on how to build can be found here:\n\n[https://github.com/mattolenik/AffinityUI](https://github.com/mattolenik/AffinityUI)"},{"CreatedByName":"atomicfury","CreatedById":120037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T04:16:18Z","Content":"Wow this looks cool! I will tinker with this. I\u0027ve had a few mod ideas but the GUI development process is intimidating. Is this intended to work as an API like blizzy\u0027s toolbar (looks REALLY close already) and what license do you plan?\n\nAlso, I\u0027m thinking you should add your /lib directory (with the dependence .dlls) on github to .gitignore and remove them from github. I could be wrong, but I recall that being an issue in the past.\n\nSummary: **I think this is useful!**"},{"CreatedByName":"nalitia","CreatedById":117727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:05:27Z","Content":"It\u0027s not an API like blizzy\u0027s toolbar, it\u0027s just an abstraction over the Unity GUI API. You can use it for any game, there isn\u0027t even anything KSP specific.\n\nAlso, the binaries in lib are actually symlinks, they\u0027re not really there. I wasn\u0027t sure if they were redistributable.\n\nThanks for asking about the license. It\u0027s supposed to be MIT, I\u0027d just forgotten to add it to the repo."},{"CreatedByName":"timmers_uk","CreatedById":97413,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:26:48Z","Content":"I\u0027m tempted to try this out for the redo of Keepfit\u0027s ui.

I may look into writing something similar for the new UI. There are other Unity projects that already do data binding, but the only ones I\u0027ve seen either cost money, or use heavyweight XML markup and a lot of reflection.\n\nI *think* the legacy UI still works in the newer Unity, but is considered deprecated. Maybe still useful for mods that don\u0027t want to do a complete rewrite? I don\u0027t know much about it, and I don\u0027t know how things will work w.r.t KSP. I\u0027ll have to look into it."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:54:25Z","Content":"The Unity 5 docs have all of the old GUI stuff listed under legacy, so I imagine it\u0027s all still supported. And as far as I know all of the new UI stuff came in Unity 4.6, which KSP already uses, so old GUI code will probably continue working for the foreseeable future.\n\nI have a very simple UI mod that I came up with from something I saw in the suggestions forum (a row of icons in the space center and keyboard shortcuts for highlighting and entering different buildings). After getting frustrated trying to find instances of the Space Center Buildings I realized I should try to use the new UI system. I figure it would serve as a simple exercise in the new UI coding. I\u0027ll make sure to document everything well if I can get it working."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T09:49:55Z","Content":"Dmagic and others.

It\u0027s all done in the editor, but it still gives a good idea of what\u0027s possible."},{"CreatedByName":"nalitia","CreatedById":117727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T20:43:13Z","Content":"That\u0027s very useful, thank you! My first glance at the new UI showed it to be done in the editor, which would be a problem for KSP or other games where we\u0027re doing work with mods.

Everything is manually positioned, I think there is some kind of layout system, but I don\u0027t know how it works. I extended the base UI.Button class to add things like right-click and mouse-over detection (which seem to be half-way implemented already), but otherwise I\u0027m just using basic UI objects.\n\nThe new UI system is begging for some kind of abstraction like you have here for the legacy GUI stuff. Creating each object is a bit tedious and there are several things I can\u0027t get to work. I don\u0027t know how to assign a background image to the buttons for instance, each one only seems to accept one image object. And I can\u0027t get the UI elements on top of that bottom bar."}]}
