Hello everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently installed the Mapsat mod and wanted to investigate some anomalies on the Mun. I tried a lander and rover combo. Landed near an anomaly and tried to drive there in the rover. The main problem is it still takes forever to drive there. I then went to fast and flipped out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy new plan is to attach big wheels to the lander and drive that over. Maybe the extra weight will make it more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailing this I may try and make a flying rover, but I\u0027ve found these impossible to control in Kerbin tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso might try a mod for better wheels but don\u0027t know which\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing anything? What\u0027s the best way to get around quickly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZingidyZongxxx","CreatedById":58363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T19:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the best way to get around \u003Cem\u003Equickly\u003C/em\u003E is with with a rocket. But with short distance, just make sure your rover has a low center of mass and plenty of distance between the wheels. Then there will be less chance of it flipping out at high speeds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use timewarp and mechjeb 2.0, which has a rover autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
