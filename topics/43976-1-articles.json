I was looking for a Game like this a loong time. Some came close to what i wanted, but this one really nailed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first i had bad trouble learning the Game but that was to expected. I saw some Tutorial Videos on Youtube (mainly Scott Manleys) and i got more and more ambitious. I learned how to Orbit, how to Dock, how to get to the Mun and beyond and it was time for me to establish a real presence in Space. So i went to work. I put some Satellites and Spacestations in Orbit of Kerbin and Mun and was ready to Construct a Munbase. The trouble began right there: I designed a Vehicle that could double as a Rover and a Base on the Mun. To get it to the Surface i constructed a Skycrane-like Lifting Vehicle on top of the Thing. I tested it on the Surface of Kerbin to see if it would survive the Dropdown. This took some time, but i was ready to invest it. Everything looked good, until i got to the Mun. By that time i had installed MechJeb, the Kethaine Mod and the Docking Alignement System. Mechjeb was unable to Land the Skycrane on the Mun because it would Spiral out of control for some reason. This was not Mechjebs fault, just poor design decisions. Then i thought to myself: Time to redesign. So i did. This time the Lifter was so heavy it started to Sandwich the Mun Base at liftoff until it was crushed. I switched some Rockets and had success. The drawback was, i had to refill the Lifter in Space. No Problem, i just send my Fueltanker up in Space and refill. The Fueltanker was my most reliable, most stable Spacecraft and had never failed me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Liftoff there was no Problem, but at roughly 5km up it startet compressing and ultimately exploded. Well sh*t happens, i tried again. This time the Separators wouldn\u0027t seperate. Not only that, Mechjeb activated all stages in rapid succesion. This happened 5 times in a row. FINALLY i got the bloody thing in Space. I told mechjeb to Auto Ascend. It did it countless times but this time it was flummoxed by my command and burned retrograde and crashed into Kerbin. Well fine Mr. Mechjeb, if you want to play that way... This time i did it by hand and got into Orbit. My time was running out, because i had to go to work soon so i got Mechjeb another Chance. I told it to rendezvous with the other Spacecraft so i could dock and refuel. This time i watched it closely. It set up the Manouver Nodes correctly and when it came time to execute the Node he hit the mark perfectly. Then something really strange happened: The Blue Marker pointed Retrograde instead of Prograde. I doublechecked the Map, but the dotted line showed exactly the Manouver it should have taken. It started to burn at the right time, but as i then expected the Orbit shrunk down second by second and would eventually crash in the Planet. I tried this numerous times. Everytime the Nodes pointed in exactly the opposite direction. I don\u0027t know what is going on here, because this glitch is compeltely new to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any clue to what is happening here? I don\u0027t think that this is Mechjebs fault, because it was just doing what the Manouver Nodes told him. And i don\u0027t know why the Stage-Seperators failed so badly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the Moment i\u0027m a bit pissed, because i didn\u0027t even get to the hard Part of the Mission. I\u0027m at work now. I\u0027m downloading the Game again and reinstall in hopes this is getting rid off the glitches. Then one by one i will reinstall the Add-ons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your biggest \u0022What the Hell?\u0022 Moments in the Game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T12:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have heard that Mechjeb doesn\u0027t do the best job at a rendezvous.

Mechjeb won\u0027t cope with that. Hard to tell what\u0027s up with the separators without a picture, we need to know which ones you\u0027re using, what they\u0027re supposed to be doing, and how they are attached to make a diagnosis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb\u0027s autostage fires when it detects and engine flameout, I believe.
