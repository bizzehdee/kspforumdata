Well, I got a new computer and I moved my files and I updated just the other day to 1.0.5. Well, a few of the parts that I had unlocked prior to the update are uh... unavailable to me, despite being unlocked. For example: the 3.75 m faring. I had unlocked that in 1.0.4 and now it doesn\u0026#39;t even exists in my build inventory. I look in the research center and it says I have it unlocked and owned, but it just simply doesn\u0026#39;t appear in my build inventory! Help, please? Dx I don\u0026#39;t want to have to start aallll over again in my career mode. I hope everyone understand what I am saying...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: Nevermind, I figured out that some of the research parts were changed around and I guess I have to re unlock the component.

I had to start fresh with 1.0.5, moist of my crafts used the structural pylon which was replaced breaking all my missions.
