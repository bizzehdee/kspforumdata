Since qualia are by definition isolated to a single brain, no one sees the same colors. The quale of \u0022redness\u0022 is an illusion, there is no such thing as redness. (Silly you. I bet you even believe that the sense of self is real.) There are long wavelengths of visible light, but that\u0027s not the quale of redness. All \u0022redness\u0022 is is a certain way in which neurons fire in your brain. Since a different brain is a different brain involving different neurons, it is senseless to wonder whether your red is the same or different than my red. They are different sensations, different qualia, by the simple fact that they are occurring in different brains. So a quale, like \u0022redness\u0022, is a process that is unique to a certain brain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I said about all this a month ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are speaking of what are known as \u0022qualia\u0022- the actual \u0022substance\u0022 of sensory perception. Like the sensation of the color blue or the sensation of a high pitched noise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that viewing the brain as a chemical-electrical computer (there is overwhelming scientific evidence after all that the brain is \u0022nothing but\u0022 this) can inform us of the nature of qualia. A quale (quale- singular form of qualia) you experience is thus the firing of certain synapses that exist only in your brain. Thus, by definition, qualia other sentient beings experience are different than yours, since it\u0027s a different brain. The sensation of \u0022blueness\u0022 doesn\u0027t have any physical meaning outside of this process that creates it. So a qualia is a process unique to each being that experiences it. This is enough to make the comparison of qualia invalid IMO, but if you want to go even further, you could point out that the brains of all sentient beings are all wired very differently from each other, so not only is a different instance of a sensory process going on when each sentient being views a certain color, but a different configuration of neurons is involved as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, we even know for a fact that sensory perception can involve vastly different processes for different people. There are people who \u0022suffer\u0022 from synthesia, which is a sensory phenomenon where an individual experiences cross-overs between the sensory systems, like being able to \u0022taste\u0022 colors or \u0022feel\u0022 sounds. (Studies of mice have even suggested that they have evolved synthesia and make deliberate use of it, experiencing a sensation dubbed \u0022smound\u0022 that is a mix of olfaction and auditory perception.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think that, just in the inherent way that qualia are produced and defined, as being a specific process in a specific sentient being, it is invalid to compare them. Apples and oranges. And then add on that sentient beings all have differently-wired brains, it just makes trying to compare them even more invalid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as we can tell, the interpretation of colour within the brain is in fact very similar between most people, so the experience is likely to be broadly the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t we already discussed it in some thread back then ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own reaction: I\u0027d argue that just the same as a baby need not to be told how to breathe, move fingers, cry, smell, feel, and taste, vision should be the same - it has to be genetic.
