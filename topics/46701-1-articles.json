I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like the launch point for the system to be anywhere on the planet- not just high altitudes where the atmosphere is thinner. I am willing (and already do) to use any number of mods to accomplish this, just so long as the mods are realistic (so no ion-propelled airplanes for me, no thanks!!!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two plans, both of which involve launching a high delta V, single stage rocket/space plane from a lofted position above most of the atmosphere. I have created single stage, high TWR, high delta-V (6000 m/s-6500 m/s) landers and rocket rovers for reusable Tylo landings already. Actually, the landers/rovers were OVERDESIGNED for Tylo, as after landing, taking off, and reaching orbit, they still have like 1000\u002B m/s delta-V left over. (Apparently, it only really requires like 5000-5300 m/s delta V for a typical Tylo de-orbit, landing, and re-orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAY, I am reasonably certain that 6000 m/s is enough to easily get into orbit from the upper atmosphere of Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Eve orbital velocity is \u0022only\u0022 like around 3200 m/s at at an altitude just above the atmosphere, I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to loft my single stage, ascent stage to the upper atmosphere of Eve, I see two options really-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EBalloon-launched rocket system\u003C/span\u003E- a balloon from the Hooligan labs mod will be used to lift the rocket above most of the atmosphere. The only real issue I have with this mod is that, from what I have seen, the balloons are ridiculously undersized compared to what they would be in reality. I have been told though that I can configure this to a more realistic set of values. The strength of the dirigible approach is that it should be relatively easy to re-attach a landed ascent vehicle- just hover over to it and dock with it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 in theory, at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENuclear powered, propeller-driven aircraft\u003C/span\u003E- an aircraft will be used to lift the rocket above most of the atmosphere. The aircraft will be driven using a nuclear reactor (NOT RTGs) and the electric propellers I BELIEVE are included with the Firespitter propeller pack (right?). The aircraft will also be an excellent method to explore the surface of Eve, as it will have unlimited endurance. The biggest issues with the aircraft will be whether it is truly possible to create a practically-sized aircraft that flies on Eve using a nuclear reactor, AND has enough lift left to loft an ascent stage, and also, getting this aircraft to Eve in the first place, as it will be rather large and unwieldy outside of an atmosphere. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m positive I can find some way of working out a way to get it there, if such an aircraft is in fact possible to build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EANYWAY\u003C/strong\u003E- now that my question has been put into the proper context, here is my question at last - is what I want to do even \u003Cem\u003Epossible \u003C/em\u003E?! I will have a piloted aircraft or piloted dirigible and piloted rocket that will separate from each other in the atmosphere.

Considering that the orbital velocity just above the atmosphere is 3200 m/s, I doubt I will have to go to extreme altitudes to make 6000 m/s more than suitable. The vast majority (maybe 75%) of the delta V requirement for a traditional Eve launch vehicle is just overcoming the ridiculously thick atmosphere, the balloon/airplane removes that requirement mostly, and that\u0027s why I want to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T19:53:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T20:28:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done a balloon launched non-SSTO and have considered but never tested the electric propeller idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting 6Km/sec delta-v out of a rocket without dropping the balloons/wings/whatever may be hard to achieve.
