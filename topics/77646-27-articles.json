I\u0027m thinking of the bean-sprouting experiment for kids, which is simple and gives us lots of educational potential. We can measure which plants sprout \u0022correctly\u0022 with the root growing down (=out) and the stem up (=in), as well as the growth rate. These should be affected by the gravity in each ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Coriolis effects may also cause the plants to grow at an angle. This would give us some cool photographs for public outreach/education.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Because we don\u0027t want to sprout the seeds weeks before launch, we\u0027ll need some way of watering them during or after launch. I think some kind of fragile water reservoir would work well; designed to break during launch. We would need an exception to put a new water reservoir and seeds in after vibration/drop testing, but I think we could motivate it successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We don\u0027t expose the experiment to direct sunlight. Instead, we have a small amount of light provided either by one or several LEDs or by reflections off the structure of the spacecraft incorporated into the design, or perhaps sunlight filtered through other spacecraft components that are semi-transparent. This not only prevents us from cooking the plants on the day side but also provides better insulation on the night side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The light is mainly for the camera to see the experiment, but will also allow us to observe the plants grow (and photosynthesise) beyond the initial experiment. We\u0027ll need to design it carefully so that we don\u0027t give more light to either the outer or the inner rings if we do it this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We don\u0027t need a complex biosphere because the main experiment is quite short. Anything we get after that is a bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s easy for all forum members and the general public to test the basic conditions (common seeds in a small closed space) at home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If we use beans, we get a plant that comes with its own nitrogen-fixing bacteria and is a food crop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketmanRower","CreatedById":116549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T15:53:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if we use electrospray prop, which isn\u0027t that expensive relative to other options and I have access to through my lab at school, we could get ISP of 3500.

I have a chemist friend of mine I am going to speak toabout the CO2 problem. He might be able to suggest a safe and efficient chemical reaction that we could utilized. Say mixing two non-pressurized chemicals together? Something like that. Mary Musgrave (whom I have had difficulty in contacting. I will try more tonight or tomorrow) identified that one problem the plants get is that they suck in all the CO2 and then suffocate because there is only O2 left in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T21:50:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShall think about the structure, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027 ve seen that you can buy already assembled main structures, at a cost not below 1000$.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould be an option to build our own, considered that the raw material (anodized Al 7075, for example) costs way less?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T01:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou would use some kind of tether (or the same conection wires) to increase the long and quality of the gravity simulation?\u003Cp\u003EBecause if you dont do it, the gravity in the plant root would be higher than the plant top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou plan to use solar light to the plant growth or artificial?

It would require better attitude control on both the primary and counterweight. The base mission would simply have 0.5U of \u0022cargo\u0022 space, and the entire cube will rotate. That\u0027s sufficient for 0.1G. Tethered version would allow 1G\u002B, of course, which has advantages. For a funding\u002B\u002B, I could even see tethered system of several trays at different G levels, with two 0.5U on the ends for control. But that\u0027d require a 2U-3U unit that would unfold.
