To programme\u0027s feature is on new Lunar photos of the dark side of the Moon taken by Russian satellites, and discussion of theories relating to the Lunar surface. To put this programme into perspective, this TV show episode was made in an era of space exploration that was still pre-Gagarin. While the sticky tape idea mentioned is a bit far-fetched, it\u0027s great to be reminded just how clever scientists and astronomers were back then, particularly as Patrick Moore got his prediction regarding the surface texture of the light areas spot on, despite the available data at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0142pvr/the-sky-at-night-the-moon\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Sky at Night - 1960\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uncle Mort","CreatedById":57933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T09:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat find.
