For example it looks like the kerbal is about to stop cartwheeling and all of a sudden it will bounce a very odd angle and 5 times the velocity into the air. This reminds me of the launch pad physics before 0.25, were a vessel of a certain size simply starts hopping higher and higher until it kills itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a ton of EVA issues, this is not the only one. Another one is when the Kerbal steps out of the pod, the view locks so that you cannot zoom in or out or rotate it. Then you have to hit \u0022]\u0022 or \u0022[\u0022 or go to space center, \u0022V\u0022 wont work. Another problem is with the docking, which is apparently a moot subject so I wont mention it. If the kerbal graps at a grasp it can be thrown away at again 3 or 4 meters per second. In addition if two ships touch each other only slightly on ship will end up being thrown away or into a crazy spin with many time more rotational velocity than was originally apparent. Same thing the kerbals, if they bounce the ship in the right way the ship will develop a crazy faster spin. I\u0027ve actually used this to restore power to a vessel that had a bad panel/sun angle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIOW there are a bunch of issues that are in the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T11:38:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the Minmus is too slippery.
