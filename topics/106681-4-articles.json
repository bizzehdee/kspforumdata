In 1.0, there was barely any time to deploy the parachutes between going subsonic and hitting ground, but now the descent feels quite similar to 0.90 with FAR. If you think that planes no longer behave as they should, maybe it\u0027s the plane parts that have been broken all the time, and the aerodynamics fixes in 1.01 just revealed it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joespeed52","CreatedById":82738,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T10:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why I\u0027m not directly updating. \u00C3\u00B0\u00C5\u00B8\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Grumman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Grumman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want an atmosphere that enables \u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E.
