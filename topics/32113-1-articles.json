Theres two solutions to this: either you deactivate the autostage after launch, either you download the new dev build, The_Duck fixed the issue, it\u0027s working properly now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
