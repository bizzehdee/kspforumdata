When you put in any time, the planner can look forward and see where the asteroid is in all future orbits. And back, I presume, if it was coded that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-03T03:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I got it now!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
