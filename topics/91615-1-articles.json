However, I know where this leads: This leads to the madness of really low frame rates like 4 frames per second or 4 seconds per frame or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, there are graphics options I can turn down, but since I haven\u0027t actually hit this issue yet this is more of a \u0022I was wondering and I haven\u0027t seen anything in the mods like it\u0022 question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any mods out there or in development that reduces all of the graphics elements to simple geometric shapes? Like cylinders, cones and spheres or is that not even a feasible pipe dream given the way the way the program is set up? Would that even affect the frame rate for really large orbiting structures?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, if this is a really newbie-modder question.
