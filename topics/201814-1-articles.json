After copying a lot of game files into an external folder, overwriting my save, then reloading the original save just after docking with the space station then all of the probe cores were hibernating. Went into my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and checked the probes in the subassembly, hibernation on, checked the vessel I originally put them into the subassembly from and the probe was not hibernating. No idea how it was caused or resolved. So didn\u0027t feel it contained valuable enough information for anyone looking for a resolution to a similar issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
