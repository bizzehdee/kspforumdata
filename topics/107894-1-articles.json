I have reproduced this with multiple ships orbiting kerbin, the mun, and minmus (not tested outside the kerbin system).\n\n**Mods/Add-ons**: First noticed with KER \u0026 distant object enhancement bis (latest versions), reproduced with stock.\n\n**Steps to replicate:**\n\n1) Launch or load a ship in orbit\n\n2) Activate the Time Warp To feature.\n\n3) While Time Warp To is active, click on any panel on the toolbar or kerbal knowledge base (in map view). If any are open, attempt to scroll.\n\n**Result**: Nothing happens.\n\n**Expected Behaviour**: The relevant panels toggle when clicked. Scrollable panels scroll when scrolled.\n\n**System Specs:** \n\n(I don\u0027t know what some of this stuff is, so I added everything that looked important)\n\nOperating System: Windows 8.1 64-bit (6.3, Build 9600) (9600.winblue\\_r9.150322-1500)\n\nLanguage: English (Regional Setting: English)\n\nSystem Manufacturer: TOSHIBA\n\nSystem Model: SATELLITE C50-A-157\n\nBIOS: 1.10\n\nProcessor: Intel\u00AE Core i3-3110M CPU @ 2.40GHz (4 CPUs), ~2.4GHz\n\nMemory: 4096MB RAM\n\nAvailable OS Memory: 3972MB RAM\n\nPage File: 5176MB used, 3216MB available\n\nWindows Dir: C:\\WINDOWS\n\nDirectX Version: DirectX 11"}]}
