Propellers don\u0027t apply lift up, they apply it forward.

At worst, it should be providing a side force counter to the direction of rotation. Also the drag was through the roof at low angles of attack, probably also due to something with the prop. However, it appears that this problem is more aesthetic than truly present because the plane flies just fine, being (according to FAR) just barely stable [Cm-alpha negative].

All stages separated as planned; the craft handled just as it should. Though reentry wasn\u0027t spot on, \u0022it\u0027s nice to know we can crash land if we need to. That\u0027s probably my greatest discovery on this voyage,\u0022 Jenning supplied with a laugh, \u0022though I image water is much nicer.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LlE9OxC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LlE9OxC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OFdZ7Di.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OFdZ7Di.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FcFe5Ex.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FcFe5Ex.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJenning is scheduled for another flight, next time for a full orbit.
