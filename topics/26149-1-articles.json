If you use the quantum struts mod you can build really stable space stations. I have redesigned my stations because of the massive lag they had. So now their unmanned probe controlled structures.

Each part has a RCS tug as it\u0027s probe core. Though only 1 of the 7 RCS tugs are kept on the station. The rest I redocked to the launcher then docked to the station, dumped all but enough fuel to deorbit, once I got the tanks installed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 orange tanks 1 per launch, a RCS module with 3 tanks, the truss they are docked to and the truss with the solar array. With the RCS tug docked on top. The quantum struts set around the docking ports, and on the adapters on top and bottom of the tanks make this thing rock solid. I accidently ran into it while putting the solar array on top and while it did go spinning, not a single instance of wobbling parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy launchers are obviously big, but most of these parts are near 50 ton each save for the solar array. If anyone is interested I\u0027ll put together my craft files for the station and my ships designed to fill them (kethan mining) and post them. The launchers can be used for anything of similar weights. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough a lot of mods will need to be installed to use my files. MechJeb 2.0.7, Firespitter 4.1, Quantum Struts, quantum fuel transfer, ISA Mapsat 3.3.4, NovaPunch Pack, KSPX, Kethane, MPSS Nautilus 1.2 \u002B FLY Orbital tug 1.0, B9 Aerospace R2-5, Hybrid Ion engine \u002B Mod, empty Fuel Tanks Mod, I believe thats everything I used parts from O.o ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ship launchers use a decoupler so you will need to strut the hell out of whatever you put on top. Subassembly Loader Mod also recommended. The station launchers have a docking port on top so using a adapter with a docking port and quantum struts to secure your payload is the best option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain if anyone is interested I\u0027ll make a zip file with everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-09T15:16:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2013 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HGGundamReviews\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kidneythump","CreatedById":62038,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T14:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a proper asparagus setup you can get almost anything into orbit.
