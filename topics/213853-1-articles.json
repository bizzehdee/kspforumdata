I regain control when I exit map view, only to lose it again once I re-enter. This has messed up multiple burns that I have used map mode to monitor, not realising until too late that the vehicle was uncontrollable, and I would be grateful if it was fixed soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"11JRidding","CreatedById":57765,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T19:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: So it turns out I wasn\u0027t losing control in the map view. There\u0027s just a serious issue where for some reason, pushing the engines from 0% throttle to 100% throttle results in a complete loss of control of the ship, as it begins to tilt way off course for like 10 seconds before finally being able to slow down and correct its turning. Yes, the centre of mass is in the centre of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"11JRidding","CreatedById":57765,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T10:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate 2: This only happens when I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on.
