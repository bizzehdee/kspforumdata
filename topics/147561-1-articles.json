Despite the fact that there are a few problems going around I still wanted to thank the team for everything they\u0027ve done the last few years. I can say from personal experience that this game has definitely changed my life completely, and without\u00A0a doubt it has changed my life for the better. It\u0027s been a ride for nearly\u00A0five years now since the first public release, and it has been a wild ride for both the game and the community behind it. Kerbal Space Program is no doubt the result of many hours of care and hope put into the game for those of you behind the development of it, and it shows. This is a beautiful game that has brought some many to learn the awesomeness of spaceflight and aerospace engineering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nSpeaking personally, I was begging for a game of this kind nearly 6 months before I discovered it, and from first hearing of the game\u0027s existence, it wasn\u0027t 48 hours before I owned it and was playing it for myself, and four years later, I\u0027m still playing it, and still loving every second. This game challenges the mind in a fashion that other games can only dream about, not to mention having the comical humor the game posses. Squad has done an amazing job carrying for it\u0027s game, it\u0027s fans and it\u0027s community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThe fact that Squad\u0027s developers such as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002275006\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@NathanKell\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/32604-arsonide/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002232604\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/32604-arsonide/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Arsonide\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0have been so active in the growth and development of this community has only helped improved what the game has to offer. Squad has always listened to the community\u0027s hopes and dreams for this game, and not every game developer does. Some keep simply to the idea in their own head and never listen to what the people might have to say. Thanks to this, Squad has gone down paths they might not have without the community\u0027s input. That input may be through requests, successful mods for the game, or even, the one off comment by someone that happened to be interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nSpeaking of this community, I want to make a call out to the amazing moderating team managing this very forum. We have 28 fantastic moderators who have been looking over this community very closely, and more to their credit, they\u0027ve been more than just moderators, they\u0027ve been dear friends to me. I have to give a specific shoutout to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125662\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Snark\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/62955-deddly/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002262955\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/62955-deddly/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Deddly\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0as both of them have been there to let me explain myself when I\u0027ve had a bad day and it showed here on the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nMany of us may want to be upset with the moderators for some of their actions, but having known so many of them for so long I can finally say that they do in fact do it with good reason. One of the curses of being a moderator is that you might have to be the bad guy if you\u00A0must establish order. When they do something, they have reason, so if you ever have a question as to why they did something then I highly suggest you ask any of them as to why they did what they did.\u00A0As harsh as they sometimes must be, there is a person on the other side of that forum avatar, and they understand why you might be confused or upset and they want to help allow you to enjoy the forum more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThe moderators hope that by pointing out your wrongs and misdoings, that you will avoid them in the future. They don\u0027t mean to do it to be mean, but rather to allow you to learn your boundaries and with them known, enjoy the community they have for you. They\u0027re like \u0022bumpers\u0022 you use for bowling when your a kid, they\u0027re not they\u0027re to ruin your fun, but rather to provide a guide as to what they want you stay within, for your own enjoyment (and others) using the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nThat being said, the moderators are of course, human. They can make mistakes and as such I would make a simple comment as a normal nothing special member of this community. One of the things that made this community so great when I first joined was that moderators used their power selectively based on the issue at hand. As written in the community guidelines (specifically the second sentence of 1.4), moderators should look at every infraction individually. Simply put, moderators should look at every offense and judge whether it; could lead to further offenses of the same kind or greater; if it poses a current harm to the forums; or if it could to additional offenses by the poster or others. I\u0027m more than certain that the forums could find a robot to filter through all posts made on this forum and find if each of those posts had content that would be violating the rules, but Squad would not do that because again, they want to judge each offense fairly, and humanly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nI will admit that with all my personal life issues and past infractions, I\u0027ll \u003Cem\u003Elikely\u003C/em\u003E never be moderator material. However, being a person that will spend the rest of my time here dreaming about one, I can only ask that moderators just keep doing the best you always have. Some of us will be ripe material for moderating this forum, some of us, like myself, will not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nLike all communities, members will come and go. Some will be loved, some will be hated, some will be memorable, some will unknown. I personally hope to be at least a friendly face that \u003Cem\u003Emost \u003C/em\u003Ecan enjoy talking to. Having said that, make sure to\u00A0enjoy having those members you have, since they may end up\u00A0vanishing\u00A0from this forum. I know I\u0027ve lost several cool friends that I\u00A0only knew through this forum, such as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/23840-zekes/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002223840\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/23840-zekes/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@zekes\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/94383-_jack/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002294383\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/94383-_jack/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@_jack\u003C/a\u003E.
