Doing the same or similar thing with different objects gives a bit more variety. Otherwise like with the probe missions I pretty much built one cheap probe design and just keep sending it up into orbit. Thus far the only shake up I\u0027ve seen is it once required me to have a Goo container on board and I didn\u0027t notice that because after half a dozen probe launches before it hadn\u0027t change. You say you want people to learn from the contracts, or at least imply it with talk of learning how to do orbits on probe missions, well necessity is the mother of invention and if you change up the requirements it forces people to build new designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said I think the send a probe out of the solar system is a bad mission contract because it\u0027s practically a free-be. In the stock game there are 2 types of missions I accept every time because they are free-bes. First is test part while landed, just put on launch pad thrust at 0 then active and collect reward. The second is part test escape trajectory from kerbin, this is because you just slap an unman probe control on a bunch of cheap solid state boosters plus the part that needs testing and launch straight up. I think the developers intended you to do it the normal way of going into orbit then leaving put this way is more fuel efficient and it doesn\u0027t matter where your going you just have to be leaving orbit. After that you test the part and collect your reward. The probe out of solar system is basically the same thing, throw a ton of delta-v on a ship and go straight. No real challenge or interesting gameplay there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you could actually track individual ships on some level that opens up options. So if the leave the solar system mission was more a voyager style endeavor that would be great. So it\u0027s mission is to do a fly by within a curtain distance of a couple planets or moons before leaving the solar system that could be interesting, try to teach people to do gravity assist maneuvers as that will be the more efficient way to accomplish the contract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have quite a few ideas for contracts but not sure how feasible they are given what you may or may not be able to keep track of and do with the contract system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spheniscine","CreatedById":125755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T19:04:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paul23\u0022 data-cite=\u0022paul23\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for orbital overlaps: would be best if you saw a \u0022line\u0022 to your current spaceship\u0027s orbit from the inclination points..\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah that is currently missing; however I have learned a kinda crude way of finding your ascending/descending nodes: position your camera so that both your current orbit and your target orbit look like straight lines (you should end up viewing right through the center of the orbited body).
