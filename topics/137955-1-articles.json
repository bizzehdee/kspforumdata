They\u0027re similar to geostationary orbits, where you want to minimise the amount that your surface-based dish has to move. Point at a particular patch of sky and there\u0027ll always be a satellite there. Let\u0027s discuss these two orbits a bit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EGeosynchronous Orbits\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeostationary orbits (or Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbits: GEO) acheive this by matching the orbital period to the earth\u0027s rotation in a circular orbit. Because a geostationary satellite is exactly over the equator it remains perfectly stationary from the earth\u0027s reference frame and your surface dish therefore doesn\u0027t need any off-axis or tracking capabilities. They also remain perfectly stationary with respect to each other, which simplifies sat to sat communications, making global relay networks simpler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever there are a couple of disadvantages. Because they have to orbit at a specific height very closely, and because there\u0027s a minimum spacing between satellites before you start to get radio interference, there are only so many satellites that can operate in GEO. Yes, countries and corporations actually have arguments about this, and there\u0027s an international body that mediates. Secondly, for countries in high latitudes to point your dish at a satellite in GEO means pointing it at or near the horizon, which is very bad for reception because you start picking up ground-based interference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMolniya Orbits\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t get a satellite to hover over a high latitude in a circular synchronous orbit. Inclined orbits must necessarily cross the equator, which means your satellite will disappear below the horizon frequently. Worse, it moves rapidly across the sky, meaning you have to track it with your dish. It also shares an orbital height with sats in GEO and thus takes up a slot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMolniya orbits attempt to solve a couple of these problems for high latitude applications. Because satellites in eliptical orbits move more slowly near apoapsis, if you place them in a highly eliptical orbit they spend \u003Cem\u003Emost \u003C/em\u003Eof their time in the higher part of their orbit. Orbits don\u0027t need to be circular to have a period of 24 hours, so you can place them in a highly eliptical inclined orbit and they will appear to \u0027dwell\u0027 over a particular surface location at the same time each day, which means your surface dish can again be pretty simple as long as you\u0027re prepared to wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr you can discard the 24h requirement and have several sats in still more eliptical orbits. You won\u0027t get the same satellite at the same time each day, but as they\u0027re further away each satellite will spend even more time in an even smaller area of sky, and by the time it\u0027s leaving your area of reception another will be entering it. There are also any number of these orbits, so bandwidth slots are far less restricted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a couple of drawbacks to molniya orbits (as might be expected). Because they go much further away, they require more signal power and bigger dishes to communicate with. Secondly, because the orbits are not circular it\u0027s much harder for satelites to stay in contact with each other as the angles between them change wildly over the course of an orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: For mission control, having a satellite with a high dwell time isn\u0027t a huge problem, because you can just invest in a dish that can track it and hire ground stations over the horizon for when you can\u0027t see a satellite directly. Dwell time becomes much more important in commercial applications. 100,000 trackable dishes, paid for by households? GEO and Molniya suddenly look much more attractive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EKSP\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, in KSP even Remote Tech does not model dish orientations, with each dish having perfect 360deg tracking. Tell a dish it\u0027s trying to point at KSP, and as far as it\u0027s concerned it \u003Cstrong\u003Eactually is\u003C/strong\u003E, no matter that it\u0027s physically pointing at Jool at this instant and the angle to KSP is changing at 25deg/s. It is thus highly unlikely that any stock solution will concern itself with which way dishes are pointing. It\u0027s a level of difficulty too far for most casual players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in KSP we don\u0027t have to deal with dish orientation/tracking, and we\u0027re not trying to reach 100,000 households with simple dishes. There\u0027s just no need outside of a specific contract to put a satellite in KEO or Molniya. They\u0027re not more useful than any other orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EMe, Personally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen playing with Remote Tech, I use a network of 3 sats at approximately 800km altitude. This gives them enough line of sight over the horizon to allow them some margin for error for phase angle and phase angle drift. In actuality, they go in an orbit with an orbital period of a round number of minutes and a 5/6th orbital period that is also a round number of minutes. They aren\u0027t in stationary orbits, but they don\u0027t have to be. All dishes in this game have perfect tracking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use Excel to work out the target orbital height/period\u00A0and KER to match those in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI launch three sats on the same launcher to the target apoapsis and 5/6th orbital period. I detach one sat and use its on-board monoprop to circularise. I like my sats heavy, but with loads of RCS they circularise pretty easily. Two orbits later the launcher has fallen 1/3 of an orbit behind (because 5/6 period!) and I detach and circularise a second relay at apoapsis. Two orbits later I do the same thing again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I disable most of the onboard RCS, and use just one or two thrusters and fine-control mode to exactly match orbital periods using KER. These usually don\u0027t end up being perfectly circular! That\u0027s far too much of a pain. There may be 100m or so between apoapsis and periapsis. It\u0027s only the orbital period that matters and usually I get them down to 0.01s per orbit, which is enough to keep them in phase for ages. High mass/low thrust help do this accurately. Maintenance-free relay network! And even if they do fall out of phase, just deboost the offending sat into a fractional orbit for a few rotations before circularising and fine-tuning again. But I\u0027ve never actually had to do that yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpanding the network is a variation on this theme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-25T09:42:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2016 09:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RCgothic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T12:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I think you\u0027ll benefit from most is a satellite constellation, rather than trying to make them co-orbital. KSP orbital precision just isn\u0027t good enough, it\u0027s verging on impossible to plant multiple satellites with exactly the same period, with the result that over several\u00A0years (say enough time to for a probe to get to Jool) they all bunch up, spread out, bunch up again - and may well be bunched up on the wrong side of Kerbin when you need them most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy having several (4-6) comsats in\u00A0staggered elliptical\u00A0orbits, you move away from precision planning (which KSP is bad at)\u00A0to the idea that \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008080;\u0022\u003Emost of the time one or more of them will have LoS to ground control\u003C/span\u003E\u0022.

Two apparently co-orbital or co-periodic satellites\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0at some point bunch up. If you have them where their orbits are only 1 second apart, then once they are bunched (e.g. all low at the same time) they are going to stay bunched for several hundred more orbits. If they have significantly different periods, then the bunching will happen more times throughout the year, but only for 10-15 minutes at a time, since they\u0027ll all be back to high orbit again and out of step for the next pass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust 2p born of my own experience.
