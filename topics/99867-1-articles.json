This is a long shot, but as the title says. I\u0027ve got them connected by a joint, (but not docked) in realtime. Obviously, as KSP treats them as the same vessel, when time warp hits they drift apart. There may be no solution to this, other than \u0022dock them for timewarp\u0022, but it\u0027s worth an ask.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve fiddled about with a few things - setting positions or whatnot - but most seem to get overridden by the flightintegrator.
