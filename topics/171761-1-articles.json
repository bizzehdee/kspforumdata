I can\u0027t remember exactly what I was doing when it happened, but I believe it occurred right after loading a quicksave or maybe reverting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E right after launch. Can\u0027t really remember. But I can confirm this definitely does happen, even if only rarely. If I recall, it would actually play the music only after I left the screen that the music was supposed to be playing for. So like if I was in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, it would be silent, but then when I left the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, it would start the play the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E music for a few seconds on the loading screen, but then it would stop when it got back to the main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E overview screen, and it would be completely silent again until I transitioned to another building, where it would start to play the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E overview music for a few seconds again, then stop, and so on. I do have mods installed currently, but it did this before I had mods installed on this version. I did a complete clean re-install when it was updated to 1.4 so it wasn\u0027t any upgrade issues or leftover files. But like I said, it only happened once and it went away and hasn\u0027t come back since then, so I don\u0027t think I can really help pin this one down. Also,\u00A0I haven\u0027t noticed the thing about the icons for the strategies, but then again I haven\u0027t looked too closely at them in the first place, and even if they were a lower resolution than the previous version, I don\u0027t know that I would have recognized that that was the case anyway. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
