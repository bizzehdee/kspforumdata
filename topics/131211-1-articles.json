So i\u0027m going Jebediah and post this over modded section \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has been adressed already, but I\u0027d like a fresh point of view with data that may have been distilled over multiples threads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo put it bluntly, the MET timer is ALWAYS yellow and will turn red when going over the mach1 bar with a 150parts aircraft. Which mean there is time dilation for calculation, that I understand. What I don\u0027t, is why i\u0027m having the MET flickering fast green/yellow with a 19parts aircraft sitting on the runway ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is also happening in kerbin\u0027s orbit, regardless the craft size (well, with smaller craft \u0026gt;20parts the MET flicker from green to yellow, any bigger will make it stop flickering for a steady yellow, anything over 100parts, is almost unplayable)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to set KSP\u0027s afinity on only one core, then two core, to see if there is a difference, but definitly no. (probably my CPU is too weak to allow the game to run without time dilation ?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried fiddling with the max physic delta-time per frame option, but while I can get me the green MET again by doing so, I get a performance hit (getting under the 25fps bar, which is what I get with default settings of 0.04, half res). If I was playing on a laptop, I could have understood, but that\u0027s totally not the case for me as i\u0027m using a custom desktop rig with a decent CPU (looks, it\u0027s an amd fx8350 black ed, I said decent, not awesome, yeah ok, its single core performances barely compare to an I5 4690K, but still, is that the cause ?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndxdiag : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/mn5mb5m04zspxxl/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/mn5mb5m04zspxxl/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod list : Toolbar, DistantObject, Haystack, KAS, KIS, KER, KJR, PlanetShine, CriticalTempGauge, ScienceAlert, StageRecovery, TACFuelBalancer, KerbalAlarmClock, WindowTransferPlanner\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically the question is :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a community made fix ?

I\u0027m running on stock cooling, so I\u0027m not overclocking more anyway), but time dilation code yellow is still there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit2 : I gave another try with a fresh stock installation, yup, 100parts craft sitting on the runway, steady yellow. 19parts craft sitting on the runway, flickering yellow.
