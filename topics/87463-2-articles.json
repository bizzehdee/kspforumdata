I was trying to figure out the values with Kerbal Engineer and I was getting frustrated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Sorry if it sounded whiny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, build a rocket with a MK 1 pod, 2 FL-T800 tanks, and an LV-T45 engine. KER will tell you that it has 3836 m/s of vacuum delta v with a TRW of 1.80 \u003Cstrong\u003Eor \u003C/strong\u003E3237 m/s of delta v at sea level with a TRW of 1.52. When you put the rocket on the launchpad, KER simulates it to have 3244 m/s of delta v available with a current TRW of 1.52.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you used the \u0022Amount of Delta-V Expended\u0022 for the map that explains why the rocket was not getting in orbit even if it should have more than enough vacuum delta v. BTW, that rocket should be able to get in orbit no matter how you flight it because it does not have enough TRW to be efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw the video but I do not think that that is an example for a common launch, but more as a proof of concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the clarification! The map makes much more sense now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kowgan","CreatedById":116874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T08:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad I could be helpful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T08:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*reads revised map*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, those transfer numbers are smaller than I remember - but wait!
