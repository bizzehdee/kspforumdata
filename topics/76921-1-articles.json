The ship is surrounded by glowing superheated air and subjecting the pilot(s) to noticeable g forces as it decelerates. I don\u0027t like the idea of watching flames engulf my parachutes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually re-enter with a periapsis of 31-35km, so that my pilots can experience a smooth ride down, experiencing no more than 3 g of deceleration as they do so. I know I can\u0027t actually burn up my ship in the stock game (yet), but plunging into the atmosphere at steep angles produces some scary looking fireballs! Therefore, for roleplaying purposes I go easy on my ships and their pilots during re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship makes an initial aerobraking pass through the upper atmosphere, taking care not to dip below 30km altitude as the ship passes periapsis. The ship is still technically in orbit at this point, but atmospheric drag continues to decay the ship\u0027s orbit, preventing it from climbing back out of the atmosphere. As the ship climbs back up to 40-50km, it finally bleeds off enough speed to drop the ship\u0027s apoapsis into the atmosphere. The ship then slowly descends, gently decelerating, until it gets to around 10km altitude. At this point, the ship has bled off almost all of it\u0027s speed and is falling almost vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the ship falls further, it quickly slows to terminal velocity. Just as it does this, the parachutes partially deploy and take over the job of decelerating the ship to a safe speed for landing. To do this, I set the parachutes to partially deploy at 0.4 atmospheric pressure, which equates to approximately 5km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the mountains on Kerbin are higher than 5km...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe expert medical staff at KSC have assured me that Bob Kerman\u0027s injuries are serious, but not life threatening, and that he is expected to make a full recovery in time.
