The end of Kerbalkind approaches, while the player on the other hand is trying to build a ridiculous tree swing on one of the Mun arches...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am looking for a mod which will add a contract for every asteroid that is on a near pass trajectory with Kerbin. These contracts get completed once the Asteroids trajectory is no longer a threat. It should be simple:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 - Default: If you don\u0027t want to do it, then just don\u0027t take these contracts. If you do take them, you get the usual penalty for canceling them etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 - Hard: These contracts are forced upon you, there is no backing out. Long term time-warping will be a real problem this way, but to each his own.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe you HAVE to leave a kerbal behind on each asteroid, their name changing to Bruce Willis for a moment\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-26T20:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes!
