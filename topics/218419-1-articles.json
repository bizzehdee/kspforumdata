The problem is when I tap the D key the rocket is very slow to pitch over (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E enabled). I\u0027m flying copies of ships from youtube (Scott Manley, Mike Aben, QUill 18) and unlike the ships in those videos, my rockets just won\u0027t pitch over. By the time I reach 10 km I\u0027m only pitched by about 10 degrees. I\u0027m stumped. I know these rockets are orbit-capable, so it must be something I\u0027m doing but I can\u0027t figure out what that might be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-14T20:11:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might have accidentally set it to \u0022fine control\u0022 (reduces the degree by which steering is imposed) or you might be going faster than the original example was (air resistance fighting the steering) or one thing or another. But you might also simply need to alter the design.
