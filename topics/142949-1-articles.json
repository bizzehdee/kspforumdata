Instead of going all the way down into the floor, now they are floating? Is that it? Do they work anyway on the pad? I think the important question is what happens with them on the pad, not in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-02T17:51:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, they don\u0027t work on the pad.
