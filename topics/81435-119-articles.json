Ofc the whole SSTO feature added ALOT of extra mass, and im making a new C variant (the A is the SSTO version, B is atmospheric version) that will be space only, and it will both cut down alot of mass, get even better dV, and be far superior in terms of space combat, and the cost of being unable to take off/land on KSC. That should be a suitable replacement for the HK-121s and HK-122s that have been my short range carrier based interceptors up to this point, but are overly heavy for their role, too big, and like the HK-133, unwieldy and overengineered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, im messing around with a H frame for my new capital ships, and it showing good performance and armor (its more or less like having 2 ships that can each individually function stuck together, sop the odds of 1 shotting the whole craft are basically none.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T22:15:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScriptKitt3h","CreatedById":82780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T20:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re waiting for the last person to setup and post their tanks (plus the latest save) to move first in the tank battle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astecarmyman","CreatedById":65422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T02:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ScriptKitt3h\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ScriptKitt3h\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe\u0027re waiting for the last person to setup and post their tanks (plus the latest save) to move first in the tank battle.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edude we\u0027ve already got 4 ppl -.-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou, Squid, Me, and Zam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits UR turn\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScriptKitt3h","CreatedById":82780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T15:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EZamo posted last, so he will move first.
