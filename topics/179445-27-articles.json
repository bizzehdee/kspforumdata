This means you have to either have: large wings, flaps or the ability to fly at high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E (or a combination of those). Flying at high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E at low speed normally requires powerful control surfaces with high deflection and/or center of lift close to center of gravity. (I will use this opportunity to advertise the dynamic deflection control option that helps with this \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0but many other possibilities exists). I also tune the wing strength and often you can reduce it a bit to make your craft lighter which makes low speed flying easier. I also\u00A0bind the \u0022deflect more\u0022 or \u0022deflect less \u0022 commands of the flaps to action groups to have quick access to them.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBeing able to reduce speed\u003C/strong\u003E.

Be aware that depending on your flap\u00A0location they can also adversely\u00A0affect your maneuverability and increase your aircraft pitch up or pitch down tendencies. In the video you can see how I use 4 spoilers to generate very large drag. If you do not want that you can also do some turning to reduce speed or anything that increases drag.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHave a good controllable\u00A0plane\u003C/strong\u003E.

This can be done by good design that is stable without continuous\u00A0control inputs (can also be trimmed) or relying on stability assist systems. The stock and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E system are often enough but I personally like the Atmosphere\u00A0Autopilot mod on default (this also helps with long distance flights to hold altitude).
