Installed it, played, the game crashed, the savegame was corrupt, restarted a new city, crashed, again got stuck with corrupted savegames, started over and over and over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a MONTH I was so annoyed that I left the game and swore to God, that I will never buy a game from EA again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen after weeks not playing any games at all, KSP came back into my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I searched for the Video which I took a glimpse at while I was hooked on SimCity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDP3ZpSpqa8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd boom... I was hooked again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI watched all KSP-Let\u0027s Plays I could find and then I got stuck on the Videos of Scott Manley.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/55b4diBjvzY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd because I am a litte Astrofreak allthough I am pretty bad when it comes to Math, I fell in love with the huge grade of reality KSP brings with it. Orbits, Debris, Phase Angles, Different Planets and Moons and the Possibility to land at them just got me at my weakest point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I was still frightened to be overwhelmed by hopes and dreams again like I was with SimCity and didnt want to spend the money to be disappointed again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all, Squad brought this game on Steam and with it, a 33%-off Special Deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that was the Point of no return. I purchased the game, downloaded it, installed it, played it, killed every kerbal who got into my rockets and had a great time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it occurs to me that I have learned, that an Alpha like KSP can be far more stable than a Gold-Version of a game which is developed by a gigantic Company. Plus, that it gives me the great joy of not crashing and not having corrupt savefiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus I am fully convinced, that the Squad-Team and everyone else working on KSP and Mods does a much better Job than EA pushing their Games onto the Market while they are bugged and unbalanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to tell you folks a big thanks for having me with you here on this Board and playing your little but joybringing Game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo please go on with this Game and take this little Story as my personal Compliment to all the Sweat, Blood and Tears you have already put into this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003EI really really appreciate your hard work on Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-07T23:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEA got greedy with a product that had the appeal of design and testing.
