Are you able to run it?\n\nIt seems like the patcher halted on trying to transfer a file it was currently writing to, which shouldn\u0027t be too much of an issue... the only potential issue that might turn up is if there are other files it needs to download after that one. Hmm...\n\nWorst comes to worst, you can always download a complete copy from the KSP Store instead of using the patcher, but it might work as-is, so might be worth trying to run it."}]}
