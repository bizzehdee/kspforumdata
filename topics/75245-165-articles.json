So I\u0027m playing with RemoteTech on RSS, which has much greater distances involved than stock, such that even the largest dishes are insufficient for contact with most of the outer solar system. Additionally, I was vaguely considering the plausibility of adding in the recently \u0022discovered\u0022 Planet X, which hovers somewhere around 600 AU out, 20 times further than Neptune, which is already completely out of range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is - does Tweakscale work with RT dish antennae, allowing you to increase the size of a dish and with it, its range?

Going by the proportional surface area to range thing above, a 70 meter dish would have a range of about 935 AU.

Additionally, I think I probably already changed my RT settings to something pretty similar to RO - I activated Root mode anyway, which I think is much more interesting than Standard (and yes, very helpful when it comes to RSS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two problems with this solution, as I see it, and thus my post above. The first is that, for a couple reasons, I don\u0027t like the Deep Space Network ground station approach. For one, in a stock solar system game with RT, you have to put a great deal of work into building a communications network over Kerbin in the first place to bounce the not-too-impressive signal of the KSC to everywhere you need it in space reliably. With the three DSN ground stations in RSS, this problem (and thus, challenge, and fun value) is greatly reduced, if not outright eliminated. Secondly, the game nominally starts at the beginning of 1951 in RSS, a time when the space program was indeed in its infancy and the Deep Space Network stations were not even built. For both of these reasons, I would very much like to instead have the ability to build, essentially, the Deep Space Network stations myself, in game, and remove the ground stations from the config. The only thing I\u0027m missing is the ability to build a big enough dish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second problem is just that with the huge distances in RSS, even the ground stations and the root model aren\u0027t always sufficient for all of the purposes you need. It would just be useful to be able to build some properly more powerful antennae. I could just increase the range modifier by several times, but in my opinion, this would fairly upset the balance and difficulty curve of the existing antennae and I\u0027d prefer not to. All in all, to me the best option really just seems to be able to increase the size of at least one of the dishes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-25T18:20:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2016 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by mr_trousers\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis Von Green","CreatedById":160824,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T18:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave two\u00A0short questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
