Just turned off the ocean refraction setting and suddenly I wasn\u0027t getting NREs.

Second, I don\u0027t understand the log much but I removed Scatterer, the hi-res textures and a scatterer sunflare config via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.  Reinstalled Scatterer manually iaw the instructions.  There are still a lot of NREs, mostly associated with my focusing on unmanned craft (I think), but I\u0027m not noticing any freezes/delays.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, Krakatoa said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just turned off the ocean refraction setting\n\u003E \n\nHow does one turn them off?\n\nMy next step is to restart the game, go directly to an unmanned craft and watch the output log until I get the NRE.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-20T06:52:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2017 06:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Brigadier**"}]}
