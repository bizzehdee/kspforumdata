For the moon base this might entail hauling a number of containers of \u0022parts\u0022 to the build site, and waiting while construction occurs. The base might then have a few different upgrades. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a parts recovery facility that could collect \u0026amp; refurbish landed parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a VAB that would allow parts brought to the moon to be built into new spacecraft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a refinery or fuel storage that would allow these craft to be refueled\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It would be interesting to unlock things other than parts in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T03:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I really do not like the idea of Moon bases that cannot be destroyed when you mess up a landing.

I think if anything, you should have to build and launch off-world assembly systems yourself, rather than static magically appearing bases. There could be foundry module that draws resources and current to make parts, and an assembly pad/gantry for constructing things in orbit or offworld. I\u0027ve also seen some really cool things with kerbal attachment system. Just as game mechanic the ability replace broken or forgotten parts, weld struts and fuel lines on EVA could really, really make things more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Juanfro","CreatedById":61552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T20:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the old CM mentioned quite some time ago something about building stuff like runways on other planets.
