I don\u0027t yet have a solution or workaround, but I can at least narrow it down somewhat. Here\u0027s what I\u0027ve got:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLike you, I built an apollo-style Mun mission, with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E on top, then Apollo-style CSM assembly, then Munar-lander with separate ascent/decent stages, and then three stages underneath that. Several things bugged out and im not sure which of them are separate bugs, and which of them are the same bug manifesting multiple symptoms. In order of appearance:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFuel drained from the decent stage of my lander when the third-stage engine of my burned, even though they were separated by a decouple.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter CSM separation for the Lem\u002BTransfer stage assembly, while controlling\u00A0 the CSM, right clicking on the Lem\u0027s docking port did not give me an option to set it as target. Quicksaving and quickloading at that point\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EDoes\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 restore the option to target, but\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EDoes Not\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Prevent any and of the other bugs, which appear regardless of whether I quicksave/quickload or dock without targeting and continue the mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRoll and Pitch control authority on the reaction wheels is lost sometime between the munar transfer burn and arriving in the muns \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Yaw continues to work, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and Engine gimbaling still have full freedom of movement on all axes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter munar capture, undocking the craft while not under timewarp results in a vessel destroyed message. Despite this, going to the tracking station shows that the vessel is\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Estill there\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0and can be controlled, however the docking ports no longer function at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf instead, I try undocking *while* under time warp, one or both new craft get a prograde acceleration of about 500 m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy first thought was that this was a rare bug involving all docking ports but only affecting me and a small handful of others, so to test this I spent most of this morning building a small orbital station. The docking ports were a little... imprecise? sometimes registering connection when the craft were at very wide angles, or very far apart, but docking and undocking worked without destroying anything, I can therefore rule out a general docking port bug.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIm currently testing the lander legs. The feul flow issues with those are pretty bizarre, and seem like an obvious place to test next; Ive read elsewhere in the forum that putting the legs on radial decouples prevents the feul flow issues, so I did that. If it works, I\u0027ll see if I still bug out when trying to undock.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I do, I\u0027ll build a lander that lands on struts - no legs at all - and see what effect that has.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf the bug persists I\u0027ll build a CSM version with radial engines so I don\u0027t need to flip it around for its transfer burn, and see if its the flipping or the redocking to the same craft you launched on that causes it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDepending how that goes, I\u0027ll probably have more station testing to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Talisar","CreatedById":62035,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T05:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have encountered a similar situation with undocking

I\u2019ve seen this slow where my first stage drains from tanks in stages 4 and 6.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure thing. The problem occurs for me due to a bug with lander legs; if you attach lander legs to a fuel tank, that fuel tank will drain into other stages, regardless of what any decouplers have to say about it. The solution is to separate the lander legs from that stage. Adding radial decouplers where you want your landing legs to attach, and then bolting the landing legs onto those decouplers prevents the bug, you just need to remember to check your staging to make sure you don\u0027t accidently decouple your landing legs.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomeone doing a proper investigation of this bug might want to try using other radial parts like struts, and/or radial parts with toggleable fuel flow toggled on and off, but I have like 3 other bugs I\u0027m trying to figure out before I have time for that. Anywho I hope that helps \u003Cspan\u003E:-)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224245273\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212916\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677465317\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180026\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RabidSmurf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, RabidSmurf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately due to another bug, my Mun mission crashed into the surface due to some mysterious orbital decay (it was a stable orbit at 32km when I left it). I believe it was caused by some kind of continuity bug where activating engines on a completely separate craft on kerbin somehow activated the engines on the craft orbiting Mun, so I\u0027ll need to refly that mission, but I am going to wait for the first round of bug fixes I think.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the risk of further derailing this thread, I might have a lead for this one. Ive had a few instances where unselected craft in orbit refuse to update any of their orbital characteristics when not-selected. The craft just hangs there in its same position forever, not actually orbiting, just hovering, even though its orbital path is shown. Switching to the stuck craft will \u003Cstrong\u003Eusually\u003C/strong\u003E fix it, but sometimes the fix is incomplete; the craft will update its position and begin moving again, but keep its old orbital velocity... including relative direction of movement to the body its orbiting. This can result in some serious orbital shenanigans as the angle of the orbit no longer matches\u00A0 the crafts position, and a previously circular orbit can suddenly partially, or completely, radially out or in from the planet instead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"schlosrat","CreatedById":141963,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T12:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/180026-rabidsmurf/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022180026\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/180026-rabidsmurf/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RabidSmurf\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Thanks!
