(LOL) But obviously that won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work. For the purposes of this discussion let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s assume the following nice round number: you are in low orbit of a body, at 1000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethod 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA simple 2000 m/s retrograde burn. Problem, unless you have a ridiculous amount of thrust, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re probably going to deorbit and crash before you finish the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMethod 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA series of perigee kicks to raise the apogee into an elliptical orbit (so the vehicle will be much slower at apogee) theoretically we could reduce speed at apogee to 500 m/s. Then it would only take a 1000 m/s to reverse direction, and you are much higher so you have much more time. But something tells me it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going to cost about 500 m/s to raise the apogee , and another 500 m/s to get back down, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still at a total of 2000 m/s. (I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not a physicist but that just sounds right to me).

Let me guess, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be a 2000 m/s total, right?
