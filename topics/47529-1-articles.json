But building a stock lifter isn\u0027t that much harder, slap a bunch of SRBs on to a 9ton tank, and put a rockomax decoupler on it slap the orange tank on the top with a few smaller tanks on the side with regular rockets and you can blow it to an orbit of 70km. And use SRBs to return to surface with chutes and landing gear, job done. It won\u0027t be pretty but it is possible.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting parachutes on your SRBs does not mean it\u0027s an SSTO.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T19:52:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPutting parachutes on your SRBs does not mean it\u0027s an SSTO.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does if you don\u0027t jettison them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T21:46:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI highly recommend switching out the rectangular \u0022structural wings\u0022 for swept wings, it makes big aircraft lifts so much easier... and IMO it looks nicer too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KlCqAHa.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022KlCqAHa.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MBwCoqd.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022MBwCoqd.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheaterman","CreatedById":32757,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T05:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOMFG Norad II!!! /me WANTS!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
