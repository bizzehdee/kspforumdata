You probably know more space science than I do, I come from the military side of things. The point I was making is that there are only certain instances were the \u0022shape\u0022 of the reactor is important, as in the Pebble bed Reactor you mentioned, and even then; the shape has more to do with the limitations of the technology involved rather than any aesthetic choices by the designers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven in cases where the Reactor itself has to be cylindrical, (or the Pebble Bed for instance) I still think that when looking at a real working engine from the outside, you\u0027d only see the Spherical pressure vessel, which holds the Reactor (what ever shape it is) and it\u0027s attendant cooling systems, and exhaust nozzle. While the machinery inside the Sphere would differ depending on the Reactor type used, the outside appearance (which is all KSP models anyway) would still be spherical (or any shape really).
