To see how to do this with a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/214418-large-rover-descent-and-landing-stage/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Elarger rover\u003C/a\u003E look here instead. Assuming you want a small(er) rover suitable for a single Kerbal to drive around, then here\u0027s a solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Dq3rsUD.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:transparent;\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Dq3rsUD.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022694\u0022 style=\u0022border-style:none;vertical-align:middle;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Dq3rsUD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuild your rover around an RC-R \u0022RoveMate\u0022. You can either leave it unmanned or add an EAS-1 \u0022Grumble Seat\u0022, I opted for the latter. If you\u0027ve gone with a Grumble Seat, then you may also want a small ladder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor wheels go with the smallest as these will help you fit your rover under the lander (RoveMax S2).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor comms I used a Communotron HG-5 since that folds down to make things compact for stowage - plus it looks cool when deployed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou\u0027ll want to keep the CG low and add a reaction wheel kit to help you keep it headed in the right direction. I put a TRW-0625 on the bottom node of my RoveMate frame. BTW, when driving, set your\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0to prograde - that seems to help keep you upright and level.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor power I went with a pair of PB-NUK\u0027s and a Z-200 battery. The battery is a good idea, plus has the added bonus of helping with slinging the rover under the lander as you\u0027ll see. The PB-NUKs are much more rugged than solar, can be mounted to help keep the CG lower, offer power night or day, and can also be used to help warm up your snacks. Once you strand your Kerbal on the Mun or Minums it\u0027s not like their reproductive capacity will ever matter, right? If you consider the max power draw of the wheels and the power output of the PB-NUKs you might think it\u0027s underpowered, but it\u0027s not. Most of the time you\u0027re just cruising along (coasting). Your wheels only really use power to start you moving and stop you, so your main power draw is actually the lights!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor lights I went with twin\u00A0 Hi-Intensity Photonic Generators in the front canted slightly outwards (headlights), twin Broad Range Photonic Generators in the back canted more outwards (taillights and good for maneuvering while in reverse). Four Two-Dimensional Photonic Generators (one on each side of the rover, plus front and back), and then three Advanced Photonic Generators on the fuel tank... What fuel tank, you ask? The empty one on top of the battery that works a lot better than a small strut for holding lights and giving the decoupler something to hold on to!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAn empty Oscar-B is on top of the battery as a light weight cylindrical object to (a) mount lights on, and (b) give the decoupler something to hold on to. This seems to work more reliably than a little structural box, though why is probably a matter for KSP2 bug squashers...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSave this little rover in it\u0027s own file so you can \u0022merge\u0022 it with your lander, or just keep on trucking with building the lander!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou will need a size M engine mount facing down (the normal direction for these) with an XS decoupler where you might expect to find an engine. Attach your rover to the decoupler and adjust the interstage node of the engine mount so that it\u0027s a bit below the rover\u0027s wheels.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAbove the engine mount I like to put an MRW-250 with four radial decouplers with LT-2 Wombats attached. Be sure to move the wombats down until the extended legs stop well below the rover. You can test deploying the rover on Kerbin, and if you\u0027re able to let it go and drive off with it, then your legs are more than low enough for the reduced gravity of Mun or Minums.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAbove the RW\u0027s I put an X200-8 fuel tank with a full load.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAttach a couple of Mk-55 Thuds to the fuel tank and move them low enough that they\u0027re positioned with their skirts ending at about the top of the MRW-250.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSlap four OX-4L solar panels onto the X200 -8, to complete the descent/return part of the package\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAttach Kelus Long ladder to the X200-8 so your kerbals can climb up and down as needed\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAbove the fuel tank attach a size M decoupler\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuild your re-entry capsule with a heat shield (optional presently, but good form to have it), parachutes, and an antenna. Mount this onto the decoupler.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLitter some lights around where you think they\u0027ll help\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom here, you need to build or merge and attach a launch vehicle able to put this into a low circular orbit around the Mun or Minmus. I assume that\u0027s not a challenge for anyone ready to deploy rovers to the Mun or Minmus!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027d like to download the example craft I\u0027ve put together, you\u0027ll find it\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19TGzHyg5mxsmIdM8F4UECbBvYqxROcsl?usp=share_link\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use this, there are a couple of \u0022gotchas\u0022 with the current EA of the game that you should (and may already) know about. I\u0027ll list them here in case anyone else finds this and doesn\u0027t already know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry your best to land in a *very*\u00A0flat space. This is necessary because of the next issue, which is a KSP2 bug AFAIK.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen you decouple your rover it will drop to the surface and may start rolling down hill. This is because a deployed craft starts without any comms connection, and so no ability to control it. To fix this, press \u0022[\u0022 to switch to your rover and then\u00A0\u00A0use\u00A0F5(quick save), and F9 (quick load). That should let your little rover realize it\u0027s actually able to communicate and so you can apply breaks, turn on\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, drive it around, etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you goof this a little bit (as I did in my landing on Minmus), then the poor little rover may be in motion rolling (or even tumbling) down hill even after your F5/F9.

Keep in mind that with a Rover as your probe core, right side up means your navball pointer (the --v--) will be at or near the horizon with the \u0022v\u0022 part pointing into the ground. If you\u0027re accustomed to other kinds of probes, this will be different for you - so keep this in mind while you right your rover and get it stopped.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen you put your rover into deliberate motion, then be sure\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0is turned on with a Prograde mode. This can help keep it from popping wheelies (or conversely stoppies) due to the high torque of the electric motors.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a shot of the lander on Minmus after the rover was deployed.
