Unfortunately there\u0027s a bug with stock KSP (since 0.24) that causes time to stop advancing when the KSC locks are activated (which shouldn\u0027t be related at all and I\u0027m very frustrated about it). I have to enable those locks because of another bug in 0.24 that causes windows to get clicked through to the buildings behind them. I\u0027m very unhappy with the GUI changes Squad made in 0.24 and then subsequently ignored my bug report about, only to later realize were a big issue and (possibly) haven\u0027t realized that they weren\u0027t issues prior to 0.24.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure that is actually a bug.

I (eventually) plan on adding the ability to just refuel and relaunch a vessel without waiting times (or severely reduced wait times) but use the ship as-is (so no new parts can be added, all damage is kept). It\u0027s just not a high priority and since I don\u0027t have loads of time anymore it\u0027ll be a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent priority list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Vessel rollout time instead of reconditioning\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Max reconditioning time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Revamped simulations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4ish) Contracts (regarding simulations and other things, like build a vessel worth X BP and launch it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5ish) Improved recovery mechanics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then somewhere mixed in is support for the ScrapYard, which is not currently updated to 0.25 and the KCT version for it doesn\u0027t work yet.

No.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I thought KSP would end up working was you would buy parts. You remember the part counter from pre-0.24 right? It used to say 999 because you didn\u0027t have to pay to unlock them or anything. I figured you\u0027d queue up parts you wanted to build and have them available. That would mean that the parts you recovered would be worth more because you wouldn\u0027t need to pay to have them manufactured. So really, what you built here is pretty close to how I thought the game would work. Since 0.26 I guess is supposed to have Kerbals that progress in experience, it wouldn\u0027t surprise me to see the ability to upgrade the KSC as well (or did they mention that and I forgot?).
