On their prebuilt planes i noticed that the Ailerons and elevators actually work together with the rudders. Lets say you hit the A Key, then a left Aileron will work simultaneous with with the rudder. NOT using the Q or E. This makes the planes you build actually controll like a normal plane should for turning. theoretically anyway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the help. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E I found the answer, mods can delete this thread now thank you\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-05T22:10:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2013 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by viperwolf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WCOLE360","CreatedById":57227,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T13:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you try posting this in the \u003Cstrong\u003EAdd-On Requests and Support\u003C/strong\u003E forum, where addon support goes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t seem to see the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"viperwolf","CreatedById":66190,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T13:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WCOLE360\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WCOLE360\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid you try posting this in the \u003Cstrong\u003EAdd-On Requests and Support\u003C/strong\u003E forum, where addon support goes?\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I don\u0027t seem to see the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not familiar with that forum, im new at this sorry. I mean i posted in their official forum where everyone is asking questions and having issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem- When you fly a plane and you want to turn, you Hit Akey to turn left. But only the rudder will turn. so you have to manipulate with the Qkey. On their prebuilt planes, you can hit the Akey and a selected flap( which now acts as an alieron) will work with the rudder to turn the plane.

I dissected their planes to see if they added something that i missed. But i cannot figure it out. I was hoping that someone that uses the mod alot would know what i need to do. btw i know this is my lack of knowledge with their parts or something. I have searched everywhere i know of, and cannot find descriptions or anything that explains the parts in detail. I thought it may be a control part you could add features to an action group, but that did not work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T13:51:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI mean does that included aircraft have the avionics package installed.
