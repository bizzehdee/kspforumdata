That seems odd since SRBs are used quite a bit in real life launches.\n\nAnyway, I was looking up SRBs today and was amazed at the amount of thrust, burn time and size. The two space shuttle SRBs weigh in at 2.8 million pounds and constitute 62.6% of the entire launch weight despite being smaller (combined even) than external tank.\n\nCompare that to the KSP SRBs which all of a sudden appear very large with low thrust.\n\nThat makes me wonder if the solid fuel that KSP has setup is just not dense enough and the SRBs produce too little thrust for their size.\n\nJust some thoughts and wondering what other people think."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T15:25:39Z","Content":"You can\u0027t compare the ratio of SRBs to the STS external tank to the ratio of SRBs to liquid fuel tanks in KSP.\n\nThe space shuttle had a hydrogen tank. Hydrogen tanks must be made *ginormous* for any sort of useful content, because liquid hydrogen is ridiculously low density, incredibly cold and absurdly hard to contain. At the same time, the Isp of hydrogen engines is very high, meaning you only need to carry small fuel masses, making the sheer weight of the SRBs seem even bigger by comparison; and the thrust of hydrogen engines is generally low, making the sheer thrust of the SRBs seem even bigger by comparison. Basically everything about the shuttle exaggerates everything about the SRBs by comparison.\n\nMeanwhile, KSP liquid fuel is more analoguous to kerosene (RP-1) fuel. It\u0027s much more dense, and thus comes in much smaller tanks. Kerosene engines have less Isp, so the liquid tanks of the rockets must be heavier. And so on and so forth. Thus SRBs automatically seem less massive and less performance-per-size.\n\nFinally: never forget that values in KSP are all fudged for playability in the tiny stock planetary system with its tiny velocities and tiny dV costs and much smaller sized creatures.

Let\u0027s look at Atlas V which uses RP-1/LOLX for the first stage an SRBs. \n\nRD-180 engine produces 4,152 kN of thrust and first stage burns for 253 seconds.\n\nAJ-60A SRBs produce 1,270 kN of thrust each and burn for 94 seconds. \n\nOkay, if we are to compare that to KSP engines what would we choose? I mean Kickback produces 670 kN Vac thrust and if we compare that to Twin Boar (2,000 kN Vac thrust), the ratio would be close to RD-180/AJ-60A. The problem is AJ-60A are small boosters, while Kickback is the largest we have.
