My guess is that C7 added filtering either on the feedback input or the PID output, and adjusted the scaling to account for both control authority / inertia ratios. The filtering would prevent/limit the oscillations as the controller won\u0027t drive high frequency, while the scaling would ensure control doesn\u0027t go bang-bang unless you have little control to start with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, FAR adds in a few significant complications. First, control authority in FAR is heavily dependent on flight conditions and varies with altitude and airspeed (dynamic pressure really). My guess is that while the SAS gains \u0027adjust\u0027 in real time with the vehicle inertias, I doubt the scaling accounts for any FAR adjusting items.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, and perhaps more troubling, is that aircraft have significantly more complicated and variable cross-axis coupling - with roll-yaw coupling being the simplest. The cross axis coupling is both design and flight condition dependent, and real aircraft designers have to take this into account when setting up control aids and/or autopilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the extra variables, its likely that the \u0027properly damped\u0027 SAS for rockets is under damped for many FAR planes, at least under certain flight conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only solution I\u0027ve found so far is to have a stable and properly trimmed plane until I get high/fast enough for SAS to be stable... and that varies with each airplane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leicontis","CreatedById":9874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T19:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a Version History for this mod anywhere?

The L/D scaling bug has been fixed and the majority of the blunt body drag code has been reset; the only part remaining is the change to drag for a part in crossflow. I suspect some of the drag complaints might simply be driven by the erroneous L/D graph (basically, I screwed up and the 1/10 scaling was removed).

Parachutes are the only thing that add drag to the drag calculator. (I don\u0027t even use a part for MJ; it\u0027s MM\u0027d onto the probes and pods). It\u0027s really only a bad problem with very aerodynamic rockets (where I expect total deltaV expenditure for 75x75 orbit on the order of 3100m/s); on less aerodynamic ones it\u0027s a much smaller portion of the total.
