Along with that, the direction hold on the high-tech probes and high-skill pilots is still a little twitchy and wobbly on its own, even without active thrust power adding to the problems. One of the main things seems to be that SAS doesn\u0027t like slow gimbal response times. (EDIT: To be clear, I mean engines that actually HAVE slow response times, like the Vector or the Nuclear Lightbulb from Porkjet\u0027s Atomic Age mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it might be time for SAS to get another rework.

As soon as the rocket passes vertical in the other direction, the same problem happens. And the larger the gimbal, the greater chance that these vibrations intensify until the craft shakes itself apart, as you described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem would still occur with slower-gimbal engines, but it wouldn\u0027t happen as spontaneously, if my mind-physics is working properly today. Another way to fix this problem is simply to add fins, which do a good job of damping the vibrations. I think that while a SAS rework may be needed, it might be better to implement a \u003Cem\u003Eslower\u003C/em\u003E gimbal (for realism\u0027s sake and to perhaps reduce the risk of the rocket shaking itself apart.)

Under full control input, yes, they do go to full control, but under smaller in inputs they do not. Even though many of them do not have response speeds set up for them, the Vector engine does to try and damp things out. In fact, as any of the Realism Overhaul modders will point out, too slow a gimbal speed actually makes things worse with SAS as it is currently; it simply does not know how to handle it because it is too set on getting the problem fixed instantly.
