How can i make 900 science with going around with stupid vessels that ALSO looks incredibly ugly if they have to be functionals (because lack of parts). Few experiments around are like 10 science, less, i don\u0027t even have ladders and electricity to send back experiments and i have around 20 science now.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s seriously GRINDING and it\u0027s not fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nReally you want me to walk all around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E to gather science? WALKING? it would take hours, obviously i don\u0027t have wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, you don\u0027t need to build \u0022stupid, ugly, glitchy ships\u0022 or walk around for hours.\u00A0 At least not on default difficulty settings or anything close to them.\u00A0 What you DO have to do is be smart about which contracts you take and especially which nodes you unlock in what order.\u00A0 At each step in your progression, think carefully about which things you will need for the next step and unlock those.\u00A0 Top priorities early on will be more science experiments and better rocket parts so you can get into orbit, then batteries and solar panels.\u00A0 Once you do get into orbit, just doing EVAs over each biome will give you a lot of science.\u00A0 And don\u0027t forget that you can also get science from high orbit as well before you need to move on to the moon.\u00A0 And from whatever biomes you land in or fly over on the way to and from space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for contracts,only take ones which either are easy to complete or which you can accomplish on missions that you were planning to do anyway(or ones that look especially fun if you\u0027re not TOO worried about optimizing for efficiency).\u00A0 Read the fine print carefully.\u00A0 Part test on the launchpad?\u00A0 Easy, take it.\u00A0 Part test between 32500 and 32600m and between 200-275m/s?\u00A0 Skip it unless you want to abuse the fact that it unlocks that part until you complete the contract.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as you\u0027re smart about these things, money should be no problem early on(world firsts alone will cover most of what you need even without taking a lot of extra contracts) and there\u0027s plenty of science available as well.\u00A0 You might need a couple \u0022extra\u0022 missions early on to get all of it, but not a huge amount of grinding or building anything ridiculous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
