I think it shows a message saying when that is the issue, but I don\u0027t recall right now. Look at the numbers in the lower left corner of the screen - it shows two numbers, the top one is how much your current vessel costs, the bottom one how much funds you have. If the bottom nr is bigger, you can\u0027t pay for the ship and it won\u0027t launch (assuming a career game).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlso possible in career: if you built a ship that has exceeds the dimensions, nr of parts, or weight limit of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/launchpad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYet another is if you loaded a ship that includes parts that you have not unlocked yet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA 4th reason can be that you left a ship on the launchpad (or even a single part... a launch clamp?).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt could also be caused by a memory leak. If you\u0027ve had the game open for a while and launched and reverted a number of times, especially in the newer versions, it eventually gets into an error state. Just save your game, exit, and restart the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
