(A part that outputs to an online writeable file)","CreatedByName":"Krisism","CreatedById":71149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T07:32:19Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Krisism","CreatedById":71149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T07:32:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking about an idea the other day and wondering if someone with more knowledge can help me understand if this is even possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I love the whole challenges thread and think community challenges are an awesome way to amp people up over this game and keep them interested. So, to continue with that idea - what about having a part you can add to a vessel which will actually record information about flight status/position/ect. This part would have a tiny GUI that pops up at the beginning and end of a flight, allowing users to select a challenge (which will then give the part a set of variables to record), or to submit the flight data respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight data/variables would then need to be pushed into a script somehow. I can figure it out past that (as I work with web development) - but before that I have no clue what is possible. It would also be important have the ability to update the challenges (shown at flight beginning) - so that someone could just click \u0027update\u0027 and it will look in another online file to download a log of active challenges (and maybe the top 3 leaders too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there is a lot too it - but mainly the issue I have no clue about is the read/write to online file during gameplay. Any help or just feedback on the idea is appreciated.
