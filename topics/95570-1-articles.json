The plane itself is fairly uninteresting, with a Mk2 cockpit and staffed with 2 kerbals, 1 of which is a pilot. The instrument package is an OKTO core with a barometer, Mk16 parachute, and a battery. They are attached together using a mini docking port on the plane as a retaining location. I have an action group set up which deploys the parachute and decouples the docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring my attempts, I\u0027d fly over the location at ~700m. Once I enter the correct zone, I\u0027d hit the action group, the probe would decouple with the parachute extended, and I\u0027d put the plane into a gentle climb. Then I\u0027d quicksave the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I kept focus on the plane, I can fly back, land, and recover without incident.
