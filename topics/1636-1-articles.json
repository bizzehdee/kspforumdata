For example I\u0027d like to use bigger SRBs and proportion the stages better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, my v. 1.0 can get you past 45k with the first stage (well, second, if you count the SRBs as a stage). I burn about an eighth of a tank on the second (or third) stage to maximize altitude and then do the turn-over into the horizontal for orbit... more than enough delta v to get into a good orbit. The third (or fourth) stage is good for orbital changes as well as for the de-orbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf pointed straight up, burnout is at around 500k going around 3k m/s (using v. 0.9)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoach\u0027s heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMTS Tuned automatic stabilizers (small blue)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESunday Punch\u0027s parts pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"texasyojimbo","CreatedById":6102,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-14T19:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to do something like the Dyna-Soar... but my experiments so far tend to lead to very unstable rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
