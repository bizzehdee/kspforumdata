Feel free to get share your screenshots over in the Fan Works section, or perhaps to try your hand at helping develop a few mods if you\u0027ve got any programming skills (KSP-Interstellar Extension Config, which I help develop despite my lack of real modding skills, is in particular always looking for additional talent... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\nRegards,\n\nNorthstar"}]}
