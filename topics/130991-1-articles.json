So I unlock the Large size radiator, and I cover that last booster with the things - I think about 20 large radiators overall, covering every exposed surface. Launch again...\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand again the thing explodes with no apparent change\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI eventually decided to use the slightly less powerful Mainsail for that last stage, which had no such overheating problem, and I got the payload into orbit. But now I\u0027m thoroughly confused about the radiators. What do they do? What are they for? It would appear they do nothing at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntbh, I\u0027m not entirely sure how well radiators in KSP model radiated energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, in real life there is no point having more than 4x symmetry for edge-mounted radiators. In fact, anything more than 2x symmetry will be inefficient because the heat radiated from the radiators (bearing in mind that they work purely by radiation in space, so they are never optimised for convection) is in turn radiated back into the other radiators. A radiator arrangement that looks like the fins on a motorbike engine would be utterly inefficient in space: most of the heat would be radiated straight back into the next radiator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming that KSP does model radiated heat from engines properly, your problem is probably that while all of your Twin Boars are running they are heating each other up significantly. By the time you get to your last Twin Boar, it is already at the limit of its suvivable temperature and there is too little fuel left to soak up the excess heat. The amount of heat is simply far too much for fixed radiators to cope with (especially since they too have been heated by the atmosphere and each other). So it goes boom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if a similarly-powered engine works where the Twin Boar doesn\u0027t, that indicates a bug of sorts. The obvious difference is that the fuel and engine are combined in one part, so (like SRBs) the whole part heats more explosively than when the heat-shifting mechanic functions between an engine and an attached fuel tank. This would suggest that as it uses up its fuel, it loses its ability to absorb more heat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when it comes down to it, the radiators and Twin Boar end up being relatively realistic. If anything, it is the Mainsail that is OP by not exploding in the same situation ; )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T23:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe great thing about the foldable radiators is that you can start using them from 30000 meters on up in Kerbal\u0027s atmosphere. \u00A030000-70000 meters is where any heating problem will probably occur, from either taxing the engine or reentry. \u00A0I haven\u0027t tested them in the atmosphere at interplanetary intercept speeds yet though, so any panels\u00A0extended is an unknown to me past 2500 m/s. \u00A0[I also did the test during 1.0.4, so it\u0027s possible they changed it since then]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PPR","CreatedById":70000,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T16:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve used the static panels to reduce atmospheric heating for high-speed aircraft. \u00A0This may seem an odd choice, but there is a logic to it. \u00A0If you look in the .cfg file for a part, you will see a value called \u0022emissiveConstant\u0022. \u00A0This is a value less than 1.0 which tells how quickly a part gets rid of heat. \u00A0Parts that have good values (.9 to .95) include: engines, wings, the pre-cooler, and radiators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why choose a radiator when a wing will provide the same function and provide lift as well? \u00A0The panels tend to have less mass than the other parts mentioned, which keeps the thrust-to-weight ratio high and allows for high\u00A0speed travel in atmospheric flight. \u00A0I\u0027ve managed sustained flight over long distances at a speeds of mach 4.5\u002B. \u00A0The other bonus is that the radiator panels don\u0027t impact lift, so you can attach them to the specific part that is in danger of overheating. \u00A0For example, cockpits don\u0027t naturally radiate heat and can have a low maximum internal temperature. \u00A0If that part overheats, you lose everything. \u00A0You could attach wings to the part, but that might throw off the center of lift. \u00A0You might attach a pre-cooler, but that might throw off the center of mass. \u00A0Since the radiator doesn\u0027t impact lift and has a smaller mass than other parts, it has little impact on the balance between center of mass and center of lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do slightly increase drag, but I\u0027ve found it a worthwhile trade-off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T17:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222461374\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458232135\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270000\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PPR\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n47 minutes ago, PPR said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other bonus is that the radiator panels don\u0027t impact lift, so you can attach them to the specific part that is in danger of overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that as of 1.0.5, it doesn\u0027t matter where you attach the radiator, since they pull heat from anywhere on the craft.\u00A0 Supposedly the static panels are supposed to work only up to 2 parts away from the radiator, but my experience has been that they actually pull heat from the whole craft.\u00A0 I assume this is a bug, we\u0027ll see whether they fix that in 1.1. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T19:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy non\u00A0expandable\u00A0panels do not pull heat out of my ISRU which is 6 parts away.
