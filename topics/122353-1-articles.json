After restarting it I cant open the Resume Saved menu, clicking it makes the game pause for a brief moment as if loading but then nothing and clicking it again doesnt even make it pause. I have the following mods installed: Chatterer, Chute Safety Indicator, Kerbal Engineer, MechJeb, Portrait Stats, Protractor, Trigger Tech. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had several Kopernicus expanded Kerbol system mods but I removed them when I tried trouble shooting it myself, I have just left Kerbin\u0027s SoI so it was no big loss. I also tried removing all the mods to see if that could be an issue. I also tried deleting the quicksave in the save folder, didnt work either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink to copy of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/xrasi7j2hhcafkx/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epersistent.sfs\u003C/a\u003E and link to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/nc5ke9bkpsi2juc/quicksave.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Equicksave.sfs\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
