I have only staypukic core so built this huge space ship (i\u0027ve not unlocked any robocorp parts yet) that Jeb could fly up, and thus leave the probe in place and come back. I figured burn the ap up to the right height on ascent, then correct pe at ap with the core as I\u0027d only have to burn forwards... Well it went fine, except my balanced probe spun for some reason... opps. and then I noticed that the orbit needed to be polar, but it never even crossed over the ksc... sigh... so I needed another 2000 dv or more to get it in place... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I think I need to time my launch better! lol... wait till ksc is under the desired orbit... sigh... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason this has totally messed me up is I spent out of money impriving the launch pad and the vab to handle more than 30 parts...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
