On the other hand, MFSC (and the Stretchy SRB) are incompatible with KIDS entirely. However, if you want to scale Isps, just open MFT/RealFuels/RealSettings.cfg and scale the Isps yourself.

Given the low resolution of the planet mesh (more noticeable with RSS since the planet is 11x as big but the mesh density is the same) you\u0027ll get straight lines instead of curves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no reason to doubt your, KhaosCorp\u0027s, visual acuity in this matter, so let\u0027s say you can see it at somewhere between 166m and 1km. The reason you can\u0027t in KSP with RSS is because while the curve of the earth is essentially a polygon of infinite sides, the one in KSP is of quite finite sides. With the scaleup, the length of each side of that polygon increased, so stretches will look flatter (because they are flat, except at the corners) rather than constantly curving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, regarding RSS and MFS...hoo boy, lot of posts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, yes, an overview of fuels would make sense. That\u0027s a good point, KhaosCorp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EiVG is pretty much spot on but here\u0027s my goto summary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*LiquidFuel (aka kerosene aka RP-1) and LOx is the \u0022standard\u0022 / \u0022benchmark\u0022 fuel. It\u0027s what the early launchers used, and what many still do. It\u0027s non-toxic, quite dense, and the LOx is only mildly cryogenic, which means LOx boiloff is not a big issue except for weeks\u002B missions. For all these reasons, RP-1/LOx is the fuel of choice for lower stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Liquid H2 and LOx is a high-performance fuel. It gives you more \u0022bang for your buck\u0022 but it\u0027s less dense so you need more tanks (though the tanks are lighter). However, engines burning LH2/LOx generally have a lower TWR than other engines (in MFS, 75%). Also, it is generally less efficient at sea level (proportionally) than other fuel mixes. The main complication however is that LH2 must be kept extremely cold; boiloff is a serious issue even in insulated (cryogenic) tanks. You should always use cryogenic tanks with this mixture; they mass less for hydrolox than do regular tanks. Given these advantages and disadvantages, LH2/LOx is best for upper stages that are fired during the launch or a few days after; however, some lower-stage use has been done (Delta IV, Ariane 5, Shuttle / Ares / SLS) though often in combination with solid boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Liquid Methane and LOx is midway between RP-1/LOx and LH2/LOx: lower performance than hydrolox but denser, and less cryogenic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Various hypergolics. They are various nitrogen-based storable (but highly toxic) liquid fuels. They perform less well than RP-1/LOx (about 95% the specific impulse), but are slightly denser and non-cryogenic: they can be stored for months at a time. Given their advantage in density, in actual use they are better than 95% as efficient--tankage for them masses much less. Further, another key advatange is that they do not need ignition: hypergolic means that if the two substances are put in contact, they will burn with no outside trigger. N2O4 is the storable oxidizer used; the latest MFS will include four different fuels to go with it. UDMH is the most stable and least-high-performing fuel, and least dense; Hydrazine is the highest-performing and densest but is unstable and thus not often suitable for use. Aerozine-50 is a 50-50 blend of the two; it\u0027s what the Titan II-IV and Proton and Apollo SPS all use. It performs quite well, and has a density between the two. MMH is often used as the fuel for maneuvering systems (Gemini and Shuttle OMS for example); it is about the same performance in terms of specific impulse as AZ-50 but rather denser, leading to a better-performing stage all-around. Given their storability and hypergolic nature, hypergolics are the fuel of choice for upper stages, maneuverinig systems, and bipropellant RCS, though some hypergolic lower stages (Proton, Titan) have been used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, regarding masses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTATS DON\u0027T MATTER WITHOUT USE CASES.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn isolation it is true that MFS with realistic masses will give you much lighter rockets for a given amount of delta V. That\u0027s because KSP engines mass about 3.2x what they would in real life for their thrust, and KSP tanks mass on the order of 2-10x what they would in real life. RM exists to correct that. (Though I\u0027m constantly refining it; RM tank mass is a little low in 3.2, and a lot low in 3.0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your rocket, with RM, is 100 tons lighter, then RM is doing its job. The point of RM is to \u003Cstrong\u003Emake rocket performance in KSP closely parallel real life\u003C/strong\u003E rocket performance. Why? Because the solar system is no longer shrunken and thus flight \u003Cstrong\u003Ealso\u003C/strong\u003E now parallels real life \u003Cstrong\u003Erequirements\u003C/strong\u003E.

Obviously, when falling, your downward force is dictated by gravity, whereas the opposing vector is your drag (dictated by your surface area and shape). FAR doesn\u0027t change gravity, but it does change drag, rather significantly. Originally, KSP simply calculates drag as the lump sum of the drag of all of your components, regardless of whether they\u0027re exposed to the airflow or not. FAR does much better modeling here, and so by virtue of rockets being pointy at one end and having a much smaller surface area, their drag is far less in that direction. Therefore, your engines don\u0027t have to overcome nearly as much drag and so your terminal velocity on ascent is much higher, to the point where you almost don\u0027t have to worry about it at all. The overall tradeoff is that you should start doing your gravity turn much sooner, so that you minimize the amount of time you\u0027re burning against Kerbin\u0027s gravity. I typically start at around 400-600m, or about 20-30s after liftoff. Be careful about too aggressive maneuvers with FAR though - since FAR takes your relative angle to the airstream into account, any strong maneuvering while in the thick of the atmosphere at significant speeds (typical rocket Max-Q comes at around 400-500m/s at ~10-15km in altitude, ~1 minute after liftoff) can cause the dynamic pressures to overcome your thruster/fin control authority and tear your craft apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRFirefox","CreatedById":67434,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T01:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022metaphor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022metaphor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027re right, if you go above terminal velocity you would be wasting fuel.

It isn\u0027t that the drag of parts is lower (often, it isn\u0027t), but that the craft is treated as a whole and not the sum of it\u0027s parts. Therefore a strangely shaped payload will usually flip out in FAR due to drag, whereas adding a fairing around said payload will both significantly reduce drag and increase control. Nosecones on boosters are a must for the same reason.

The Procedural Fairings mod might also help. Also keep in mind that since the delta-v budget requirements with RSS are much higher, the resulting payload-to-launcher mass ratios are much greater (i.e. larger launchers, smaller payloads), so you\u0027re probably gonna have to do a whole lot of on-orbit or post-landing assembly anyway. That\u0027s how in real life the MIR the ISS and everything else larger in space was built, and that\u0027s also how all long-term Lunar and Martian outposts are planned to be constructed. There\u0027s no launcher in the world that will bring several hundred tons of payload into orbit in one go, much less send it to the Moon or Mars and land them there. The biggest, most capable thing that we ever built was the Saturn V, and even that maxed out at 120t.
