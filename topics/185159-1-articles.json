The requirements are \u0022Build a new unmanned that probe\u0022 (I don\u0027t know why it says \u0022that\u0022 between \u0022unmanned\u0022 and \u0022probe\u0022) with the note saying \u0022Please note that this must be a new unmanned probe built for Kerbal Motion LLC after the contract is accepted\u0022, then \u0022Reach the designated polar orbit around Kerbin within reasonable deviation\u0022, and \u0022Maintain stability for ten seconds\u0022. I have built a new unmanned probe, and launched it into space, and placed it in the \u0022polar orbit\u0022 after accepting the contract. The second and third requirements are completed, but the \u0022Build a new unmanned that probe\u0022 isn\u0027t. I don\u0027t know if I should build a probe with only \u0022Kerbal Motion LLC\u0022 parts, but that manufacturer doesn\u0027t have parts required to build a probe.
