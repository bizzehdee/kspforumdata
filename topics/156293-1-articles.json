few reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem #1:\u00A0 Suspension of disbelief.\u00A0 I have trouble swallowing it, since I don\u0027t think that any \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereal\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E spaceship ever does anything like this, at all.\u00A0 They\u0027re designed to enter at a certain orientation and maintain that orientation, and that\u0027s what they do.\u00A0 They\u0027re designed so that when they\u0027re in that orientation, they\u0027re fine, which means that no such system is necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem #2:\u00A0 Not really necessary.\u00A0 KSP already has a mechanism for this:\u00A0 design the ship to be able to handle reentry.\u00A0 Skilled players can get really fancy with it.\u00A0 Newbie players can just do the simple thing, which is what every single IRL spaceship except the space shuttle does:\u00A0 stick a heat shield on the front, and design the ship so that it\u0027s aerodynamically stable with the heat shield facing forward.\u00A0 Problem solved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem #3:\u00A0 Difficult to even make it work.\u00A0 A ship in reentry tends to be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Every\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E strongly controlled by aerodynamic stability.\u00A0 Chances are good that even if you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehad\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E such a system, it won\u0027t actually have the physical ability to turn the ship in a way that does any good, because there\u0027s simply not enough control authority available.\u00A0 Yes, it\u0027s possible for a skilled player to design a ship that has the ability to steer and orient itself even during reentry... but if they have that much skill, they also have enough skill that they don\u0027t need this thing anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem #4:\u00A0 I have trouble seeing how it would actually be all that helpful.\u00A0 KSP does a pretty good job of warning \u0022this thing is overheating!\u0022 well in advance of it going kaboom.\u00A0 If you just watch the ship, and see something overheating, and steer that thing away from the blowtorch... how is that hard?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this might be an interesting idea for a mod or something, but it really seems like a stretch to me to have it in stock-- especially given the finite development resources at Squad.\u00A0 Personally, I think their time would be better spent
