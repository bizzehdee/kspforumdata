EDIT: Looks like they added the same parts from V90 then added some Config files to convert fuel resources; IE you collect the resources then just refine them into the fuels that Interstellar uses rather than use these resources directly; like saying Liquid Hydrogen is a Liquid Fuel or ArgonGas is a Liquid Fuel; this may have been my problem if Liquid Fuel is the resource used for \u0022ALL\u0022 engines; then resource rates apply as the liquid fuel is used up? I am thinking this line:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@PART[reactor-0625]:Final\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverrides and exisiting CFG\u0027s - that remains to be seen; I was thinking of adding these; I hate to modify other modules or parts indirectly; KSPI-Near Future suggests improvement without modifying the files directly. Maybe I can add these CFG\u0027s last and see what transpires after I run tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Another IMPORTANT POINT (!): I have ported \u0027ALL\u0027 TweakScale Declarations into one TweakScale file called Z-MultiPart(Rate)_TweakScale.cfg; that way there are no duplicates of parts and TweakScale data; this was all moved from allthe KSPI MODS (v90, Lite, Extended); then I am rechecking the default TweakScale cfgs... I noted the the TweakScale author has done all this work for \u0027MANY\u0027 MODS; this must have been extremely laborius; I am thinking it is best for Modders to do their own TweakScale work especially if rate changes are involved (and can be included hint (!!) using TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS... EDIT (!): I found a default TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS.cfg in TweakScale so I am checking that now I can delete the abovementioned file then I need to check Interstellar again...this is why its probly best to use the MODDER\u0027s TS data; I just dont want to miss a thing LOL !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Near Future ups the ANTY on the reactors; not sure actually but changes the module definitions; I will check the forum later on this version; it might make them more realistic...another thing to check last it seems...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Now I think I discovered a REAL problem; TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS.cfg in TweakScale affects rates...well there are reactor rate changes; Module Generator rate change and if I use this resource generator for anything and remove this in TE above my rates are gonna be messed up; I wish I knew this was in here before; okay it is almost becmong a MESS; luckily there isnt too much to check and my Module Generator useage; well...I have to check them all now...I may not be streaming this afternoon until I get it all sorted...I will be on tonite tho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: WOW what a chore that was - I got all the TweakScale stuff updated and checked; modified some rates with it on my resource converters and I am giving it a try...there may be a way to use one drill to extract different resources out of it...ugh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECmdr Zeta\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T20:00:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cdr_Zeta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T00:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had kind of a rough day I think I wont stream tonite...but I should be around most all day off and on this weekend.

I know some of you are trying and have done an incredible amount of work and time with them and that is why I play this game; because we can modify them to our own tastes and pursuits; which in my case is to \u0027play\u0027 KSP as a SIM-Game (there will always be a game aspect so as to allow fun and not making it too much of a grind).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically; we dont build rockets in space overnight; though my resource acquistion rates now seem to have to be abit on the high side, I am now looking at the costs of building rockets in space; well; sort of!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally in my SIM it is supposed to take a week to build a small rocket from getting the ore, smelting, and other resource useages, to building it; I think I have that in place.

While MKS/OKS is a great SIM in it\u0027s own right, it did not meet my requirements for REALISM; close but no cigar as they say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow while my KSP SIM is \u0027ALSO\u0027 not actually realistic, it uses actual CHEMICAL REAL WORLD data to create RESOURCES that one would need to survive in space. I have solved a few of the most complex problems in a rather simple way; as to whether or not this survival SIM would work in reality is unknown; but it was a good attempt by me to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe processes are in no way attached to any particular MOD, especially MKS/OKS or USI as it is called; just to be clear so if someone says what MOD am I using I am using, for the most part, MOD MODELS and my own code; I have kept some of the original MODs\u0027 intent to showcase them; so in a sense yes I am using those MODS; I AM NOT using the MKS Resource Line; I AM NOT using BioMass or Extraplanetary as they were originally written; they have been OVERHAULED !!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will add my resource tree to my website.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also dont like the fact that some MODS are making Liquid Fuel out of Hydrogen and electricity; same with Monopropellant. At least MKS has a design using H2Peroxide; but the amounts used in MKS are allowing rocket builds in practically a day; I make about 500 rocket parts a day but that is only with full production capacity which includes 8 drills. The initial cost to build a small rocket in my KSP Resource SIM is well over 1 MILL !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still have to trim out a few more MODS and do my Tech Tree (TODAY !!) then I am ready ! I did some testing last night and have a memory creep to deal with which seems worse but probly cause I have more MODS; I still have a good hours worth of gameplay before a game restart which is a MAIN GOAL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont know how long the TREE will take me; maybe a couple days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also be placing flags in rememberance of well known people who have contributed to Science (and this game !); the key MODDERS without which my resource SIM would NOT have been possible will be showcased !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, the original authors include the MODS of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane - The Code\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMKS/OKS USI Umbra Space Industries - The Buildings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads - The reason for playing Kerbal Space Program - The Resources !

A great thanks and KUDOS to the above Authors who will have their place amongst the Moons Of Kerbal System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Briefly...Resources have Real World densities but the game uses 1 millionth of the real world values which is reflected in the metric tonne (I believe and hope!) in the game; this is to show that 1 Metric Tonne of water has a mass of 1 Metric Tonne in the game; to do this the density for water in the CRP is set to 0.001 (Period End Of Story and dont ask me how or why it just is; it is a wierd setup but it works...IE 0.001 is 0.001 KG/cu-m density of Water). Real world densities for the most part are in Kg/cu-m and are related to 0.001 - easy ya !!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECmdr Zeta\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T12:23:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 12:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cdr_Zeta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T15:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you dont know it, I have a website:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://vncvw9.webs.com/spacepgm.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://vncvw9.webs.com/spacepgm.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has been updated with a few goodies...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am workin on my Tech Tree now !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECmdr Zeta\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T03:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I been watchin some streamers...ya...and MKS-Orig...well my re-design of MKS is not really a re-design; it is a replacement of code; I added more code to the same model(s) to reduce the number of models needed; this will help reduce the LAGG that everyone is complaining about; even still I will have 5-6 units in close proximity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I think I wont use those expando tubes if they increase game lagg...most of my parts will just be connected to each other but...ya...that I shall see when I go to work on this Career Mode !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main Tech Tree 1st stage is actually done (!); took me 2 hours just to start working on it about about 2 to get it done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to finish MOD parts that wouldnt load; short list; should be done tomorrow; then My KSP Resource Game is ready (Finally !) for Career Mode !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked at some Contracts; they seem fine; and I got Outer Planets back with some atmospherics ( Ya ! ); I also tapered memory down to hopefully a solid hour\u0027s worth of gameplay but the initial memory creep is still 250megs in the first 15 minutes or so (I am at 3Gigs on game start; awesome for the number of MODS I have and 2000\u002B patches from Module Manager !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was gonna restart but I will wait til v1.0; I also moved up a few parts for earlier access; it will be difficult enough as it is; I am expecting v1.0 KSP out in about 1-2 months so I have plenty of time; I will be in Career Mode (NO SIMULATION!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may however run simulations of launches etc and I will have a notice on stream what mode I am in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am extremely happy with all the work I have done on KSP Resource; in my opinion it is better than anything out there but is based on MODDER\u0027s work; trouble is I dont think I will be saving any of this as a MOD per se.
