Most of my rockets couldn\u0027t get away from their ICBM origins. This is my log of my misadventures aimed at getting into orbit and beyond. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy list of goals are divided into stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get a satellite into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Send unmanned missions to moon orbit and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Deploy unmanned missions to set up moon base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 Begin setting up space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 3 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Begin testing of unmanned interplanetary probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Attempt orbit of other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Have probes repeat moon experiment. (the crashing idea is from Ebb and flow.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Being setting up bases on what planets I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther misc thing to say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not using mods. If I find a few that I like I\u0027ll probably edit these goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note I\u0027d appreciate a few suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from Mech jeb, kethane and Extraplanetary Launchpads I don\u0027t know what else I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand finally I do know a bit more than what I am going to be letting on. Playing dumb at times it enjoyable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that that\u0027s done let us being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntry 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I loaded up KSP V.21 with the intent of playing seriously. My first goals are to get an unmanned satellite into space and into an orbit. So I started on my first rocket space probe test Mk1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[insert png screenshot 2 here.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see I decided to go with a four engine design spacecraft. Why? Because I could that\u0027s why. my initial flight tests yielded a few interesting results Running this rocket like a bat out of hell indicates that it can achieve orbit. I just have to work on my fine control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[insert png screeshot 6 ]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere as being conservative and attempting to use maneuver nods makes it more difficult. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[insert png screenshot 3,4,5]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t get orbit either attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after careful consideration I have two choices, study orbital and rocket science and create a proper mission plan or More power. (Grunt grunt grunt.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter more consideration I chose the obvious one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[insert png screenshot 1]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the sepratrons? I believe firing them at the correct (best guess) time will give me orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults will come soon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to work out my image hosting problem and I have to be up for 6AM tomorrow to go to work. Submitting this as I did put a bit of time into writing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
