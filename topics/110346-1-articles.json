They\u0027d also be for stabilizing landers or out of control aircraft, which with the new aero should actually work. They should also work as a higher speed drogue replacement, speed reduction wouldn\u0027t be much.\n\nMaking it work with MechJeb would be very nice, keeping the lander aimed the right direction should help its accuracy.\n\nI tried using parachutes in pre-1.0.x to pull aircraft out of spins or plummeting tail first but it just didn\u0027t work. The chute\u0027s large amount of drag and being attached well behind the COM \\*should have\\* had the plane hanging nose down from the chute, or yanked it back to flying straight with engine thrust on. Just crazy having an airplane hanging UP from the bottom of a parachute."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T12:17:02Z","Content":"There are drogue chutes in stock, and if you don\u0027t like them you can look at [RealChutes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57988)"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T01:35:51Z","Content":"Those are parachutes, intended to drastically slow a craft down. A ribbon chute is more for stability than drag."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T01:52:10Z","Content":"Sounds good to me, especially if they were reasonably heat resistant and could be deployed early in the descent. I often find myself wanting something besides airbrakes I can deploy high up that will stabilize my craft through the heating phase. Maybe something as simple as heat resistant metal cables trailing out behind the craft?"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T02:50:27Z","Content":"I read..

The idea is to have a pop out device to add stabilizing drag without mucking up MechJeb\u0027s landing guidance, because it\u0027s not a \u0022parachute\u0022. It would also help in manual landings for the same reason, keeping the hot end pointed the right direction.\n\nA ribbon would be the most real world drag stabilizing device. Something rigid and extendible / retractable would work, as long as it doesn\u0027t effect lift and drag when retracted. There\u0027s a Stock Bug Fix for the stock airbrakes that fixes them having lift/drag when retracted but those things are rather large and awkward to fit onto a lander."}]}
