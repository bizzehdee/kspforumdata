I believe the last update I got for KSP was a bug update, and that was almost two years ago. I\u0027ve complained about this multiple times and I won\u0027t stop until we get an update. Please, someone just update the game, it shouldn\u0027t take a team of multiple people more than 2 years to code an update. I\u0027ve seen single person developer games get updated every couple of months before, advanced games too. So even if it is just a bug update, please give it to us. Not everyone can afford a new console or a PC, but they still do what they can to play the game, that\u0027s why I play on PS4, yes I\u0027m saving up for a PS5, but please, just for now, give us an update or at least tell us that you\u0027re working on one, because I\u0027ve heard virtually nothing over the past 2 years about PS4 and Xbox One getting updates, so a heads up that you\u0027re working on one would do just fine too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-25T22:31:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2022 10:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by BigStar Aerospace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TokiGlassBlower","CreatedById":219852,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-29T21:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224106874\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207420\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221648247422\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204131\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigStar Aerospace\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/25/2022 at 6:30 PM, BigStar Aerospace said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the last update I got for KSP was a bug update, and that was almost two years ago\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think that since they are saying that the PS version of KSP2 will be released at the same time as the PC version will that they are focused on that instead of working on the PS version of KSP, lets admit that the PS system is a little under powered for this game, even the PS5 needs to have better processors and ram for the bigger games and Sony will not take the system there, I think Sony like Apple does not want you to have the best you can, but for what reason I don\u0027t know other than some sales scheme they have??? look at iPhones and iPads which could have 5 terabytes of storage and 10x the speed but they chose to NOT do that and its been shown that its not because of money or product cost???.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigStar Aerospace","CreatedById":204131,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-02T03:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is one of the reasons, we have extremely advanced technology and these companies refuse to put it into our new systems, it is annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
