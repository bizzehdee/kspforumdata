I had my first fatalities last night, and am trying to assess where the fault lies (someone has to be cashiered, right?), so I would like to ask if anyone care to offer an opinion upon the following tragedy (eventuality);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission was a sub-orbital hop for 4 Private Enterprise Individuals (tourists). The rocket was tested on a 6 km flight down the coast from KSC, and functioned nominally with full recovery. Upon the Sub-orbital attempt all 4 tourists were killed upon un-decelerated contact with ground following terminal staging and re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoost stage was nominal, and the upper stage was delivered to roughly 75k altitude on a polar trajectory. Final stage was then pointed retrograde and all remaining fuel burned off prior to terminal staging, thrusting concluding at about 67k altitude, speed about 1050 m/sec. The 5 solo-capsules were then jettisoned. All 5 were toggled to and showed good chute pre-deployment, valid heat shields, and nominal orientation. Re-entry heating began rather lower in the atmosphere than expected, right about 20k, and persisted down to about 12k. About 14k MC began receiving reports of Primary \u0026amp; Back-up chute failures on the 4 tourist capsules, with the eventual \u0026amp; resulting impacts terminating flight operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot conclude if the error was to trust in pre-deployment of the chutes, or if the low-altitude re-entry heating was anomalous and un-predictable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease offer any advice which may occur to our fledgling, now tainted program-\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T16:54:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you pre-deployed the chutes, they got torn off/burnt off during re-entry.

(Also, try going for final burn when re-entry friction starts fading away rather than so early, as this should bring your final speed much lower than burning before the re-entry friction - you can take a lot of re-entry friction punishment, so you might as well make use of the free aero-braking).
