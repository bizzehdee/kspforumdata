I had my first fatalities last night, and am trying to assess where the fault lies (someone has to be cashiered, right?), so I would like to ask if anyone care to offer an opinion upon the following tragedy (eventuality);\n\nThe mission was a sub-orbital hop for 4 Private Enterprise Individuals (tourists). The rocket was tested on a 6 km flight down the coast from KSC, and functioned nominally with full recovery. Upon the Sub-orbital attempt all 4 tourists were killed upon un-decelerated contact with ground following terminal staging and re-entry.\n\nBoost stage was nominal, and the upper stage was delivered to roughly 75k altitude on a polar trajectory. Final stage was then pointed retrograde and all remaining fuel burned off prior to terminal staging, thrusting concluding at about 67k altitude, speed about 1050 m/sec. The 5 solo-capsules were then jettisoned. All 5 were toggled to and showed good chute pre-deployment, valid heat shields, and nominal orientation. Re-entry heating began rather lower in the atmosphere than expected, right about 20k, and persisted down to about 12k. About 14k MC began receiving reports of Primary \u0026 Back-up chute failures on the 4 tourist capsules, with the eventual \u0026 resulting impacts terminating flight operations.\n\nI cannot conclude if the error was to trust in pre-deployment of the chutes, or if the low-altitude re-entry heating was anomalous and un-predictable.\n\nPlease offer any advice which may occur to our fledgling, now tainted program-"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T16:54:17Z","Content":"If you pre-deployed the chutes, they got torn off/burnt off during re-entry.

It is obvious. At least - like so many of the perils in KSP - it is obvious after the first time you see it happen to you! (I am not ruling out the prospect of other problems too, but this definitely WILL be a problem.)\n\nAdjusting the deployment pressure higher may help - I have not actually tried it, but I trust the person who said it first in this thread because everything else he said appeared true and correct. Adjusting the deployment altitude will NOT help!\n\nIt seems \u0027chutes actually get deployed in two parts - the pressure affects when they are initially released (after which they can be burned / torn off by airflow), the altitude affects when they bloom (spread out, becoming more effective at slowing you down). The first phase slows you down a little, the second phase slow you down a lot.\n\nMy actual advice would be to separate the craft AFTER re-entry, maybe around 10-15km. (Also, try going for final burn when re-entry friction starts fading away rather than so early, as this should bring your final speed much lower than burning before the re-entry friction - you can take a lot of re-entry friction punishment, so you might as well make use of the free aero-braking). If you can\u0027t or won\u0027t do that then definitely experiment with the deployment PRESSURE settings. Altitude can probably stay where it is for now (I have not yet had to adjust it).\n\nI was actually running into similar problems trying to salvage my early lift stages with automatic \u0027chutes (saving the planet and money at the same time!) so I will have to play with the deployment pressure settings on those when I get home.\n\nAs for the person who said this was probably a bug...

Staging all 5 capsules at once did separate them, however the de-couplers did not themselves break off- they remained around the heat shield, with the shield visible immediately within. This may be a simple \u0022bug\u0022 which \\*does\\* occur in such high-dynamic situations, but yet I do not believe played any part in the accident.\n\nIt seems most logical after hearing opinions here that the fault was the pre-deployment during the end of re-entry heating, and their subsequent burn-off. It was a rookie mistake on my part, not realizing that re-entry heating could occur so low in the atmosphere. However, while I did see the extra parameters (RMB) while right-clicking the chutes in the VAB, I could not see any means by which to edit them. Does this require a mod to change their deployment factors?"},{"CreatedByName":"lost_in_space","CreatedById":142158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T15:22:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I set the blame on the design team that put together a craft and flight plan that left room for this kind of eventuality.
