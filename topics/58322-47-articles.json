I don\u0027t know what the solution to that would be. Skillful needs heat as it\u0027s 1/3 of the damage system. What is happening is the part is heating up from deadly reentry - once it hits a certain temperature, my code sees it as an internal fire then that\u0027s when my code starts adding to the heat. I need to assume a part is burning at some point since when you reach max heat KSP by default will just explode the part, and then it\u0027s game over. Once you have fire burning inside a closed area with fuel or something, bad things are likely to happen.
