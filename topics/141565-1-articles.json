I suspect this is due to the wing design? Also, I think I\u0027m getting extra drag, with each wing segment adding its own drag rather than being obscured. I had them separately attached to the center for stability, but maybe I should have the wing components attached front to back to eachother?

Build speed at sea level \u0027till 500m/s or greater, then start to climb. Make certain your TWR and thrust are going up, otherwise level out and accelerate more before climbing. Shallow climb, aim for 1200/1300m/s before the engines start to drop off. Kick in the Skipper before flameout. Once the Whiplashes die, hit 5 to close the intakes and let the rapiers autoswitch. Push your trajectory up to 40-50km then hit 2 to kill the rapiers and follow orbital prograde to desired AP with the skipper. When delivering fuel, keep the very front nosecone full (minus a bit of ox if you want) and empty the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-entry:\u00A0PE to 30km over KSC (if using trajectories mod, just put the X on KSC).

Main thing to watch is overheating the RCS, but it\u0027s not too troublesome.\u00A0Feel free to invert and pull \u0022up\u0022 towards the ground to avoid overshooting KSC. I\u0027ve was screaming over the mountains at 1700m/s and still had no trouble bringing it down with inversion and airbrakes.

The flat wing edit helps with the stability though. I\u0027ll definitely try the double-forward-up-tilted-canards to see if that makes the climb easier.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, what I really need to do is rejigger the whole thing to have a few nukes somewhere onboard for orbital operations. Built a new utility SSTO that\u0027s one-stop-to-anywhere. ISRU onboard and just needs a bit of fuel from my orbital dock to reach Minmus. If I ditch the ISRU for more onboard, it\u0027s nonstop\u00A0minmus-and-back for 6 kerbals. Four rapiers and three nukes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn long-run-config below. The front long mk2 gets switched for an inverted bay with fuel equipment. It also needs a second set of small gear, with the long gear retracting so the drills can touch the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ONZdXB6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ONZdXB6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsed your recommended shock-cone-on-long-adapter here too, and it works great. Obviously, if it can carry ISRU gear, that front tank can be a cargo bay with whatever is wanted for basic orbital operations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Jarin/Artemis-Utility-SSTO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft here\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-11T23:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my testing on my own spaceplanes, I actually found that the advanced canards are significantly\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0efficient than the AV-R8s that you were using initially.
