You\u0027re equating a longer burn time with more delta-V, but that is not necessarily the case. Delta-V is not measured in units of time but in units of speed; it represents the potential change of velocity of a craft. It is calculated by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, which is regarded as the most important formula in all of rocketry:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV= Isp * g * ln(m0/m1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV is the amount of delta-V in m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp is the Isp of the engine, a measure of its efficiency\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg is the gravity constant, 9.82\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eln is the natural logarithm function (available on any scientific calculator)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em0 is the mass of the ship fully fueled (\u0022wet weight\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em1 is the mass of the ship empty (\u0022dry weight\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom this equation you should be able to see three factors affect delta-V. You can increase delta-V by changing those factors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp - Switching to a more efficient, higher Isp engine results in increased dV. You\u0027ve already selected the best non-ion engine in this regard, the LV-N.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em0 - Adding more fuel will increase delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em1 - Decreasing the dry mass will increase delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding engines increases the dry mass (m1) without adding any propellant, so the fraction m0/m1 gets smaller, thus there is less dV.
