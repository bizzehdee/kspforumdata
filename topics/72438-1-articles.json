The air density acts as a source of drag and as a medium for the turbine blades to push against, and if it gets reduced then the turbine has less drag and less to push against so it speeds up. By definition you cannot have a fixed RPM turbine controlled by air inlets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fuel combustion requires a certain fuel/air mixture ratio in order to work. The jet turbine controls its own mixture ratio by virtue of rotation speed and fuel input being linked - if you throw in more fuel, the engine speeds up, which in turn pulls in more air so the mixture is kept within operational ranges. If you deprive the turbine of its ability to do this by limiting its access to air, you could literally shut down your engine by accident, especially at high throttle settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Whatever acts as a shutter on the inlet will be a major source of aerodynamic drag for the plane as a whole, and will need to be fairly sturdy as the turbine inside will create a sharp pressure differential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Turbonfan engines generate most of their thrust from their bypass flow - that is, only very little air goes through the turbine, the largest amount is simply blown out back, bypassing the turbine. The turbofan is essentially a large high-performance ducted fan driven by a turbine. Most commercial and many military large aircraft use these engines. And in this design, it is literally impossible to close an intake on the turbine without also closing it on the bypass, which would instantly cut its thrust to near-nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there\u0027s more...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T15:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVariable geometry jet intakes are a very real thing, the F-14, F-15 and SR-71 all used them, probably others, too.

On the turbofan engines used on commercial airliners, the piece of hardware that controls the fuel flow is typically called a hydro-mechanical unit (HMU) or Fuel Control Unit (FCU). Depending on how modern the engine is, the throttle will be connected directly to the HMU/FCU or to a computer which is in turn connected to the HMU/FCU. The most sophisticated engine control computers are called FADEC systems. FADEC stands for \u0022Fully Automatic Digital Engine Control\u0022. The FADEC computer manages fuel flow in response from throttle inputs and to keep engine parameters within operating limits. Throttle response on turbofan engines is slow due to the engine\u0027s spool up time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurboprop powered aircraft typically have variable pitch props and their throttle response is quicker, despite the fact that the core of the engine is really no different than that of a turbofan. Propellers on turboprop aircraft like Dash 8s are constant speed propellers. They are governed to turn at a fixed RPM, regardless of throttle setting. You don\u0027t have to wait for them to spool up and spool down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an interesting side note, you can actually hear the governors on turboprop airliners like Dash 8s working during takeoff if you pay attention. During initial climb, you will often hear an annoying \u0022wow-wow-wow\u0022 sound that fades to a uniform droning of the propellers once you\u0027re climbing comfortably. The annoying sound is called beating. It is caused by the difference in RPM between the two props. The governors are synchronized to each other during normal flight to eliminate the beating sound, but the system is normally turned off during takeoff because you don\u0027t want the slave engine\u0027s RPM to follow the master\u0027s down if the master quits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
