The RP for players and their kerbals.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI suggest they add a museum to include things like this.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think adding more playable interactions via Kerbal to Kerbal would be a wonderful idea for when multiplayer comes out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022231588\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed957906196\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/221736-suggestion-ksc-museum/?do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndo you think we can build this idea together?

No emotes, no interactions, no sitting, talking, or anything.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSame with a lot more games, multiplayer should be more for a big community like this.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d like to see this unfold\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-25T14:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunctions would be nice.
