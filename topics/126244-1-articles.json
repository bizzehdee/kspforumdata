I know ballistic transfer is efficient to change inclination, but this results in an orbit whose periapsis almost equals AN/DN. What if I want to go to an orbit with a non-trivial argument of periapsis? Extreme case is an eccentric orbit whose Ap/Pe are over poles. How to efficiently transfer to those orbits?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy scenario is I\u0026#39;m trying to tow an asteroid (periapsis at high latitude) to my equatorial space station. So I\u0026#39;m starting with such orbit and I want to transfer to equatorial orbit (i.e. reverse procedure of above). So things like directly launch to the desired orbit is out of the picture. In that case, what options do I have?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T06:23:27Z","Content":"\nThe standard option is to raise your AP so it\u0026#39;s really high, then fix your inclination once you\u0026#39;re high up/and super slow.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gooru","CreatedById":150733,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T07:27:42Z","Content":"\nTHis would require the AP to be in the equatorial plane.

If you are in a highly eccentric polar orbit whose apoapsis is over the north pole, there exists no burn you can make at apoapsis that will raise the altitude of the AN or DN up high; burning normal/antinormal will just shift their longitudes around, which doesn\u0026#39;t help if you want to end up equatorial.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, if your apoapsis is way up high, you can do a relatively cheap burn at apoapsis to circularize up there. Then do another cheap burn at AN or DN to get your inclination to match the target orbit and to drop the periapsis back down again.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T09:01:13Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027sardia\u0027]The standard option is to raise your AP so it\u0026#39;s really high, then fix your inclination once you\u0026#39;re high up/and super slow.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0026#39;s a tradeoff here, and for most near-circular orbits, the most delta-v efficient way to change inclination is to set a maneuver with static direction throughout the burn so that you reach your desired inclination.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T09:03:15Z","Content":"\nIn this case, I\u0026#39;d burn at Ap to bring my orbit in contact with Mun\u0026#39;s orbit, and then use Mun to gravity assist myself into an orbit that was both equatorial and with an Ap near Mun and a Pe in the atmosphere.
