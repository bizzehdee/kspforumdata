It might be a bit extreme at the moment, but real rockets have to be built and flown carefully so they don\u0027t fold in half too. Tall skinny rockets are supposed to be more unstable. The unrealistic part is how flexible they are, in real life they would just snap and explode long before going banana shaped. I guess that was ruled out for being too unforgiving, but it would be way too easy to build rockets that don\u0027t look like rockets if they were processed as one rigid body. I\u0027m sure they will find the right balance between rigid and noodle sooner or later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nechochwen","CreatedById":226206,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T05:54:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue. And I would be all for having crumple thresholds and other deformation parameters, the problem is that the current connection points are mathematical points and they have nonzero torque limits. Frankly I believe that this is the root cause of \u0022The Kraken\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
