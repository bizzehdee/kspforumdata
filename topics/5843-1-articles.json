But a few hours later and I had it downloaded and was doing the in game tut. Next thing I know I\\\u0027ve been up for hours building rockets bigger and bigger getting used to everything. I did my first orbit then I did two orbits. I was close to leo. I just had to build bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day I was experimenting with many designs. But something was wrong, every time I went to build something big I would build on the fly and would end up messing up the in game symmetry tool. Every time it would mess up I would try to correct it by grabbing an object higher up and trying to get that to place everything right and after many failures I started to manually place things on visual lines on other parts so they would be correct all around. VERY ANNOYING! Still working on using all the things I\\\u0027ve learned. But I can say, no stock wobbly rockets being built here any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that night I finally built a very nice stable rocket, I was going to the MUN! My first shot I used up all the fuel on the way and just smashed into it. Next time I slowed down and did a very risky full throttle burn right at the last minute. I was slowing down and then I engaged the last stage shooting the command module at the very last second and did a horrible landing forcing Jeb, and poor Bill and Bob stuck on the moon in a tiny command module. I felt bad so next round with the same rocket as the last two times I decided to get into a Munar orbit then return. I was so tired when I landed back on Kerbin all I could do was get up, turn the lights off and goto sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next few days consisted of me making so many ships and so many that I loved because they did exactly what I wanted. But also a ton of misc. ships to test things out, that I now just mash the keyboard in an area that I feel it should be at for the name of it till I know that it isn\\\u0027t going to get so big and complicated that I have to manually add single parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as I sit here typing this you ask. \u0027He must be bored\u0027 You are right, I am currently watching a craft slowly moving to an Apoapsis of over 3 trillion meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote 6 digits are not shown on the alt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.colten45.com/screenshot3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Yes if you\\\u0027ve never seen a 13\u002B digit in ksp I shall tell you, you don\\\u0027t want to see it. not unless your velocity is at least half that.
