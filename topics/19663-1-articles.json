If you are like me, you also want to return, so lander is a bit heavier. I found try to avoid complex rockets. You want to brute force out of kerbin as fast as you can get it. I had these big multistaged things, but I accelerated slowly off planet, so most of my fuel was spent in the time offsetting gravity. remember, that holding stable altitude is just accelerating up the same rate gravity is pulling you down. So by burning more fuel, you burn less fuel. Once you get powered out into orbit or escape, you can keep it light, but maintain a patience game with very slow acceleration rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I had a minimalist lander design. It could just get off kerbin, and get enough to capture another planet\u0027s orbit minimized as much as I could. It theoretically works fine, I can return from any place, but couldn\u0027t get there to begin with trying to keep smaller stagings with nuc fuel etc. I finally got fed up, stripped everything I added to the lander and just added an equal amount of components (less actually) but had alot firing all at once. The result was the increase in thrust got me to space fast, and still had big engines to get the major acceleration done. Allowing smaller efficent engines for my maneuvering and capture as apposed to the dead weight of a larger fuel supplied efficent transfer stage. Doing that got me to Eve orbit quicker and easier with more fuel left over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Person012345","CreatedById":33728,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T21:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/18hOS\u0022 alt=\u002218hOS\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sits on a 370 ton rocket made exclusively out of the \u0022small\u0022 stock parts (although as you see I built it around a mechjeb module).
