It was just a core, SAS, Power stuff, a bunch of jet fuel, and a nuke. I had two core jet fuel tanks, and 4 jettison-able tanks, and I made it to Duna without even having to get rid of one. Now, since it also has a docking port, it\u0027s sitting in Duna orbit as a refueler. What I would suggest is an Apollo mission, but if you don\u0027t have much practice like me, then send your CSM equivalent(return stage, basically) but with more fuel. Get that in Duna orbit, then send your lander module seperately so you don\u0027t have as much to push with one little nuke(I forgot to say, for me, nukes are the way to go).

Take advantage of aerobraking to save fuel for entering orbit and landing. Use Slingshot maneuvering to get an Ike intercept and orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, as always, while ships are on their way to Duna, you could always be doing contracts, more exploration of Mun and Minmus, and send one way probes to Eve and the Jool system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Mods, things can become much easier. With the Hooligan Lab mod, landing and return from Eve is possible without the need to build a massive lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T21:18:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p14082003","CreatedById":130955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:11:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChanging to answered as soon as I make to Duna. alredy have the ship. 4200 dv for transfer stage. i will post a picture soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T08:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first time I went to Duna I sent 2 distinct missions with nearly the same payload mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first one was a lander for Ike (able to do 1 hop) and the second one was a lander for Duna (no hop).
