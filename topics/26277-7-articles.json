For landing and more fine work, a bunch of radial liquid engines (I had 12) with a pair of action group keys that lets you switch them off and on is good for fine tuning orbits etc., just match as close to the speed you want with charges then flickj the OMS engines on and off to fine tune it. Steering the sucker needs a lot of SAS torque or just a ton of RCS fuel and thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually like that it\u0027s disconnected from the throttle controls as it makes it easier to control and give you the option for fine control via conventional engines above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is great. I\u0027ve tried to explain Orion to so many people and they simply cannot get their heads around it. A video of this thing in action is just what\u0027s needed. They can see, graphically how the ide of the pusher plate and the charges works to propel the vehicle using Newtonian physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t Freeman Dyson do a calculation that a typical launch of Orion would risk killing an average of 0.11 people per launch or something crazy?

Did you make any screen caps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need tons of torque because the blasted bomb magazine module is almost 50 tons. And in the future that may go up, if I can get the individual magazine option to work. The rack will hold up to 3,600 bombs, for a total mass of 295 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad the Orion mod is educational, since the educational nature of KSP is what originally made me an enthusiastic fan. Orion = action and reaction in one easy lesson.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC Freeman\u0027s calculation was based on the increase in background radiation and rising cancer risk with a few Orion launches.
