It\u0027s velocity starts dying rapidly, I can keep it in the air for a little bit, but not long. It keeps wanting to nose down and to the right.

You should put some rudders on that puppy to gain some control over yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You should try using one of the cockpits designed for spaceplanes, they\u0027re prettier IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Is your center of mass in front of your center of lift? If not, you\u0027re going to have a bad day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I would personally use an engine with a higher ISP than those radial engines, you\u0027ll have more delta V when you switch over to the rocket engine(s). The Aeris 4A is a good starting point in terms of fuel loadout, engine configuration etc., however in its stock configuration it\u0027s center of mass is behind the center of lift. If you decide to modify the Aeris 4A move some of the control surfaces backwards/forwards and replace the rocket engine with the aerospike until the CoM is in front of the CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceisbeautifulul","CreatedById":68592,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T21:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
