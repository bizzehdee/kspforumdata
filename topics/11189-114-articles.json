I would give you a better name, but as a joke the actual craft file is titled \u0022\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Skylon\u0022 cause I needed to drag it to the top. It was never actually at the top and now my spaceplane hanger\u0027s craft list is a huge excrements storm of \u0022\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_untitled space craft\u0022. Or you can just call it explorer since I renamed it after I put it on the runway the first time.\n\n2. I started flying this back in December. If I remember correctly it has landed at the runway every time. The previous version started at the normal cape then fly over to the desert after a mission though!\n\n3. Yup (ignoring some quicksaves on landing and turning to the correct inclination, as its a massive chungus soooooooo. The runway is 6 degrees inclined so I have to fly to the equator, for some reason the wings would rip off on earlier missions. I wasnt pulling many g\u0027s either ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif \u0022:huh:\u0022))\n\n4. Does it necessarily have to release it? I have one payload thats specifically for carrying crew to my space station/deep space ships. I have used it once, but it still sitting unrecovered on its original truck near my gantry.\n\n5. So that is literally a docking port, a hab and a fuel tank. No engines, no deployment, only fueled on the ground. It just used the extra fuel to do the mun flyby. It was also originally designed to help refuel deep space vehicles.\n\nHere\u0027s some pictures on orbit after it completed some missions:\n\n**\u003Cu\u003EDuna Satellites:\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n![vubWZzw.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vubWZzw.jpg)\n\nThis was a 2 mission set where one was to carry a satellite and an adapter and the second was to carry the second satellite. Thats what you see in the middle of the large spacecraft in this image (2 launches)\n\n**\u003Cu\u003EMun Transport (Abandoned):\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n![ANvYbwI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ANvYbwI.jpg)\n\nBuilt this entire vehicle. The lander attached at the top was originally designed as the main propulsion and transfer element. After design of a larger more capable vehicle this vehicle was left in orbit abandoned. (4 launches)\n\n**\u003Cu\u003EUntitled Mission:\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n![nHNIHpA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/nHNIHpA.jpg)\n\nDon\u0027t remember what this was but this has both the new upperstage (top right with 2 cheetahs. payload is attached to it then the whole thing is deployed. The upperstage does a spacex like boostback burn to rendezvous with the skylon) and that hab (Middle right) bit that was in question.\n\nEdit: I will be adding more to this in a few minutes with a few pics of the current launch complex\n\n**\u003Cu\u003ECurrent Complex:\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n![4v2u5XQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4v2u5XQ.jpg)\n\n![wJCyrwG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wJCyrwG.jpg)\n\n**\u003Cu\u003ENew Arm Payload\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n![YN0OiZy.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YN0OiZy.jpg)\n\nThis is still in the design phase and has yet to fly. Im planning for it to be removable and for it to be put in alongside a regular payload. Its using krakentech ball joints and a BG servo.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-05T00:21:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2019 12:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Dman Revolution**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman Revolution","CreatedById":118094,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-04T23:41:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/4/2019 at 7:10 PM, Dman Revolution said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAlso my full mission log for this thing.

It takes me a very long time to design, integrate and fly payloads, let alone complete large multilaunch missions, so it won\u0027t be all that often.\n\nFor example, I did end up testing that arm I showed off in a previous post last night on ESF-14. I had to actually integrate 2 payloads, deintegrate both, then reintegrate them since that initial arm I showed didnt fit like I wanted it to. Ended up taking me about 5 hours in total for the whole mission.\n\nHeres the initial integration:\n\n![vej7tQo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vej7tQo.jpg)\n\n![YMmXwl2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YMmXwl2.jpg)\n\n![WxdYr5U.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/WxdYr5U.jpg)\n\n![mdMgdJ8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/mdMgdJ8.jpg)\n\n![zeG1Y1M.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/zeG1Y1M.jpg)\n\n![YQbQwC5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YQbQwC5.jpg)\n\nThe mission log:\n\nESF-14:  \n\n    Crew:  \n\n        Jessen  \n\n        Jebney  \n\n        Rodlock  \n\n        Seegard  \n\n    Payload:  \n\n        KerbalArm Skylon  \n\n        Demo Payload  \n\n    Mission:  \n\n        Test the KerbalArm Skylon by manuevering the Demo payload to the Skylon\u0027s main docking port, then back into the payload bay  \n\n    Conclusions:  \n\n        Flight to inclination: Successful  \n\n        Orbit: Successful  \n\n        Rendezvous: Successful  \n\n        Docking: Successful  \n\n        Payload Mission: Successful  \n\n        Undocking: Successful  \n\n        Reentry: Successful  \n\n        Landing: Relatively hard.

It is very wonky to move around with payloads as large as the Demo payload.  \n\n        New Flight profile researched. May allow for larger payloads/ smaller payloads to deep space. In a simulation (quicksave and quickload)  \n\n        it was discovered that this new flight profile allowed for Explorer to rearch Munar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E with around 20t of payload.\n\nAnd some pictures in space:\n\n![quYPElH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/quYPElH.jpg)\n\n![oUOCc9o.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oUOCc9o.jpg)\n\n![Bn2Arvk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Bn2Arvk.jpg)\n\nThere weren\u0027t any payloads actually deployed so idk how that fits, but I did maneuver this test payload around for a bit\n\nOh, and then I completely rebuilt my gantry crane.
