It likely was a case of pilot error, maybe he thought deploying it early wouldn\u0027t matter so much. Maybe they recently improved the system so it operated faster than usual and he was practiced on it taking so long to enable so he was trying to time it to activate when it passed 1.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that the pilot managed to escape with fairly severe injuries indicates that there is a chance that the copilot might simply have been knocked unconcious or even killed before he could begin any sort of escape procedures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brethern","CreatedById":15602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T20:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow could he make such a big mistake?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame way the guy who dropped the apollo 13 oxygen tanks though it wasn\u0027t a big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame way the guy who designed apollo 1 to use pure oxygen and have an in swing hatch though it wasn\u0027t a big deal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame way they though that launching a saturn V during a storm was ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re human and they make mistakes.
