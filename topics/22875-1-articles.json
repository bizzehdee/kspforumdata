I don\u0027t have any trouble connecting docking ports to the top and bottom of the object, but when I try to add a docking port to any of the 4 ports on the side of the object it won\u0027t work and won\u0027t let me connect anything. Is there a trick to this? Not sure if I\u0027m missing something, if it\u0027s a bug, or just really finicky. Help is appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tuguley","CreatedById":43744,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T16:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you rotating the docking ports when you are trying to attach them? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen holding the docking ports, press WASDQE to rotate the port so that it lines up with the connection points on the multipoint connector.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jokurr","CreatedById":57496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T16:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhhh, I had no idea you could rotate parts like that.
