I understand the mod community represents an obscene amount of resources cumulatively, that you all can\u0027t compete with. That said, I\u0027d hate to end up with a game that is just OK out of the box once it\u0027s released, and great with mods. I think a good example is a lot of MMORPGs. There have been mods for a lot of these that are all but required to play.

The majority of the KSPX parts pack did get added to the stock parts list, for example, and I\u0027ve heard that the spaceplane hanger itself only came about after C7 put together the existing spaceplane parts and the devs made spaceplanes a part of KSP (after not including them in the scope of the game, originally).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of curiosity, what makes you think Squad might not be adding more core functionality?

If implemented as-is (a way to refuel in-situation) as a stock feature, It wouldn\u0027t change the game fundamentally, only adding to existing features (good); but on the flipside, I feel it\u0027s a feature that would not be universally used by all players (not as good). Why: It\u0027s frankly a pain in the neck to set up Kethane supply lines when you have the alternative of just bringing more fuel (either on the same ship or via refuelers). Interestingly, this may change completely when career mode involves budgets... Free fuel just sitting around on Minmus becomes very attractive when you\u0027re paying a premium to fuel your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS is a little better. It doesn\u0027t change what a player will be doing, but gives new, attractive options for how to do them. It\u0027s only downside, in my opinion, is its complexity: Containers for parts, EVA grabbing and placing parts, winches with multiple attachments, connectors, EVA place-able pipes and struts. Essentially, KAS would need to be broken down into separate features and those individual features weighed for their \u0022stock-fitness\u0022. Though I admit, even as-is, I wouldn\u0027t mind it being stock and made bug-free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skyler4856\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Skyler4856\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUgh DLC....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was about to go way off topic talking about predatory DLC vs fair DLC, the increasing cost of making games contrasting the decreasing prices offered to consumers, and the complication of companies and consumers doing business in the wake of an economic recession...
