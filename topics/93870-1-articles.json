It goes where I want it to go, everything is nominal. Sometimes, I need to return to the space station briefly, after which I return to that ship. Everything is still fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when I quit the game, relaunch it later, then try to reload the ship...bad things happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor starters, engines refuse to work. Engine exhaust appears to come out both the nozzle and the side of the engine, the latter of which is not normal. When I throttle them up, they consume fuel at a normal rate, but don\u0027t add any thrust. This has happened several times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost recently, the problem got worse. Not only did the engines freak out like before, the ENTIRE SHIP freaked out. A couple radial parts flew off (while many other radial parts stayed \u0022attached\u0022, at least as far as the game recognizes), then every part on the ship visually detached, spun like crazy, and flew in various directions, leaving the camera looking at basically nothing. When I time-warped up, the detached parts returned slowly to camera view, but remained visually detached, and all spinning wildly, and individually. Time-warping back to x1 had no effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried reloading the ship several times, and did occasionally get it to remain whole (minus the few parts that broke off). It was still spinning wildly, and mechjeb\u0027s \u0022kill rotation\u0022 function had no effect. I was able to kill the rotation myself after considerable effort.
