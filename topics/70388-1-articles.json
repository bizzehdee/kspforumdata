I\u0027ve been wondering, is there a way we could make the Cleverbot AI \u0022predictable?\u0022 For those of you who don\u0027t know, Cleverbot is an \u0022AI\u0022 (more of like how a parrot functions, repeating phrases said by humans earlier based on what the human said now, not really much of an AI sort of thing) that is supposed to mimic human-like conversation. You start by typing something in, usually a phrase like \u0022How are you,\u0022 and the bot \u0022responds\u0022 based on what a human said when\u003Cem\u003E it\u003C/em\u003E said the phrase you did. So, bot says \u0022I smell like raisins,\u0022 which, of course, the logical response to which would be \u0022As do I.\u0022 The bot will remember that response and might use it in the future the next time a human says \u0022I smell like raisins\u0022 to it. So, anyways, any ideas on how one could make the bot\u0027s response constant, the same, every time you say a key phrase? I was thinking that I could write a simple .vbs script to type in a sentence, hit the respond button, write another \u0022response\u0022, refresh the page, and repeat, however, this wouldn\u0027t work, because it would take a ridiculous amount of time and it would tailor for multiple responses. Any ideas on how one could do this, preferably with some sort of repetitive script in this case?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Souper","CreatedById":86003,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T22:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EType in \u0022What happened to Ben?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer will usually be the same every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YourEverydayWaffle","CreatedById":83957,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T00:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022super\u0022 data-cite=\u0022super\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EType in \u0022What happened to Ben?\u0022\u003Cp\u003EThe answer will usually be the same every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right!
