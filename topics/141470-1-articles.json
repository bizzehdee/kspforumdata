This would make for an awesome survival game because you have only one starting ship with some crew and you have to use mods like Extraplanetary-Launchpads and CivPop to survive and generate a space program. Basically the game would entirely bypass the KSC scene and go straight into the starter vessel which would function as a homebase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T08:27:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically you have an idea and want someone else to make it into a mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr do you want to make it yourself?
