This is why I think I\u0027m biased towards sandbox mode. Not sure if that makes sense, however I have never gotten into career mode because it feels too \u0022grindy\u0022. I like the idea, and with the addition of contracts I may give it another try some time. That said, I\u0027d much rather \u0022simulate\u0022 my own space program. What I mean is start off with small projects (unmanned probes, simple single-seated rockets, etc.) and then get more complex as time goes on.

The \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E issue for me, though, is the fact that there is too much repetition in early and mid-game missions. I feel like I\u0027m doing the same thing over and over again with the crew report, EVA report, etc. All of that just to get a piece of science hardware and go to the same locations, collect data, and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople have suggested unlocking the tech tree via one or two missions (which is completely possible), but is there really any fun in that?

Yes, we got some space plan parts, but IMHO, they were disappointing.

It is the restrictions. How far can you go with the limited resources you have? Unfortunately, one of the resources was named \u0022funds\u0022 - but it is not the money that makes it interesting, it\u0027s the restrictions. At least for me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my perspective it boils down to efficiency in an economic nature. One of the central aspect then becomes how to get the most ressources out of the least possible amount of spending. This gets obvious when people debate about most cost-effective ways to gather science and funds, doing as many contracts as possible in one flight, grind as many biomes as possible in one mission etc. This principle, historically rooted in business simulation games and action role playing games, is one fundamental principle of many games today and always risks to cause a loss of creative, experimental and refreshing interaction with virtual worlds. Instead many games that are based heavily on this mechanic are famous for repetitive actions done by players because certain interactions are more profitable for gathering in-game-ressources (wether money, experience, skills or something similar)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn consequence, aspects of exploration and creativity take a backseat. Thats why I don\u0027t think it makes sense to incorporate the economic game mode in KSP because this game became popular as a physical sandbox and space exploration simulator encouraging people to experiment and try different approaches. At least for me and the people I know who play KSP its these aspects that make ksp fun, to just build stuff, let it fly and look what happens. Or build stuff that doesn\u0027t even fly but is funny in its regard, like a techno club on the mun. Take a look at the most-viewed youtube videos. Things like this are only possibile without restrictions and punishment and streamlining the things ingame along economic/scientific/reputational productivity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily there is sandbox-mode, but how I said, I think squad should not waste time and effort in expanding career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T14:35:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by hansen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"johnnyhandsome","CreatedById":59580,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T15:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played Career twice.
