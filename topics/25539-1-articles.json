If flown right, it will have around 850m/s of dV on orbit after ascent. Even though I expected significant reduction in performance as a result of abiding harsh design guidelines, the ARX-3 is more than capable of most ordinary SSTO designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As it completely relies on auxiliary rocket engines (4x 24-77) and main rocket engine (1x LV-T30) for main orbital insertion burn, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll find its ascent profile more of a rocket then a space plane. This was essential as it permits rapid deployment time nearing that of rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It has one inline docking port for ordinary docking operation and two small docking ports intended to be used as refuel ports; they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll perfectly match with ASX series refuel trucks (included in download).

You can fill it up with liquid fuel after landing and use it as low altitude high maneuverability jet fighter. It will also glide gorgeously after reentry, making approach glide easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E On limited occasions, the ARX-3 can be used as a payload launcher with maximum payload around 3t, though it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not designed with payload delivery in mind. While attaching payload on top of fuselage is possible (as seen on top screenshot of thread showing sat launch version), I do not recommend it as it will result in gradual pitch-up tendency. Recommended payload attaching point is beneath the main wing symmetrically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EARX-3N \u0027Voyager\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RlCZYEx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RlCZYEx.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rshHy1k.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rshHy1k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ovfw8rS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ovfw8rS.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RVfQKvB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RVfQKvB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The ARX-3N \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Voyager\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 is a further development of ARX-3.

With optimal ascent, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have 1.5km/s to 1.7km/s of dV, enough for Munar / Minmus low orbit insertion and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To compensate for low TWR of LV-N, it adds additional 2 pair of 24-77s, relying initial ascent on those fuel-hungry engines. This is unavoidable as all of the ARX series does not accelerate into orbital speeds within upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When fully fueled up, it has dV exceeding 8km/s meaning it can be used as interplanetary transport, although I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t use it for that; let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s think of our poor kerbal caged for months and years within crampy cockpit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It maybe a little bit cheaty as I clipped one fuel tank inside of LV-N but overall fuel capacity is same.
