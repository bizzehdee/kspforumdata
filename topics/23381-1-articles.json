I\u0027ve repeatedly watched a couple docking tutorials on youtube (I use mechjeb), but I can\u0027t seem to apply this knowledge in the game. Clearly I must be doing something wrong, so maybe one of you guys can help me. Here is what I do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bring two ships into orbit. From ship one, I make an approach to the second ship by setting it as a target and burn towards it at a relatively slow velocity. As soon as there is a 500 meters distance, I kill the relative velocity to 1 m/s. Then I position the ship 1 docking port towards the second ship and turn on ASAS. From here, I switch to the second ship and select the first (aligned) ship as my target. I set the control mode to the docking port (control from here) and slowly I burn towards my target. When I get really close, I use docking controls and always make sure to keep the velocity under 2 m/s. This all works well, but for some reason the two docking ports aren\u0027t aligned any more and I always end up by doing a very close fly by (10 to 1 meters), or I even bump in to my target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my question is, how do I keep those ports aligned? When I switch from ship 1 to 2, my guess is that ship 1 (not under control by mechjeb anymore, but ASAS turned on) is slightly deviating, hence I miss my target.

I prefer east/west, but any point on the nav-ball works. Face the thing you want to dock with east and turn on ASAS, time accelerate for a second, decelerate to normal, switch to your first ship. Face that east as well. Choose and set your target docking port. While still facing east, make your approach speed 1 m/s. Using RCS, manipulate your velocity until your prograde marker is on top of your target marker. Hold this position, approach target, dock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: At all times, both craft must continue to face east. This becomes more difficult the larger the craft in question. Never point toward your target while doing this, as that destroys the methods dependent conditions. All things must face east(or any agreed direction) at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tophir","CreatedById":58841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T22:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen really close (within 10 meters or so) kill all relative velocity so that you are aproching your target at 0.0 mps.
