It\u0027ll have 2D thrust vectoring along with slightly higher thrust than the J-404 Panther. It\u0027ll be optimized for supercruise for all of those people out there who like to go places fast and still be able to pull a 180 degree turn in a half second.

I wish they wouldn\u0027t be so overkill, though. I\u0027d expect a 200 kN scramjet to be **way** bulkier. Because of the supersonic combustion chamber, scramjets have to be **very** long to give the fuel enough time to burn. And they\u0027re extremely weak. There doesn\u0027t seem to be a way to achieve a thrust-to-weight significantly better than 2:1 (with intakes). I think roughly the dimensions of a Mk-1 tank (without intakes) and a thrust of some 40 kN seem more realistic (and in fact, quite enough for the low atmospheric pressure at high altitudes). I know this game isn\u0027t about realism, but since this is an endgame engine, I\u0027d deem it quite appropriate if it made the engineers scratch their heads a little.\n\nI don\u0027t like the idea of \u0022scramjet only\u0022 intakes. There\u0027s no justification for that. In fact, you can build ramjets that still work as scramjets (increasing weight and reducing the efficiency at both stages). Supersonic intakes are very simple, they can just \u0022shove in\u0022 air, the trick is to make them produce as little drag as possible, and to still work at subsonic speeds where the air has enough time to literally evade them (which is why even plain turbojets need fans). In KSP, you already have all the intakes you need - fan intakes for turbofans/turbojets, shock cone intakes for ramjets, and pitot intakes for ramjets and scramjets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-14T14:07:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2016 02:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cami**"},{"CreatedByName":"8bitsblu","CreatedById":61636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T19:53:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/14/2016 at 10:05 AM, cami said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Very nice parts!
