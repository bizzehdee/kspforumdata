I loaded up a craft I made with 1.0.2 and noticed immediately that the framerate was at about 5, which I thought weird until I right clicked a part and saw that it says \u0022Rad Hardness: X.XX\u0022 about 80 times (too many to fit on the screen), which I think is the issue.. it was an AGI Computer Core that I right clicked on, which makes me believe that it\u0027s an incompatibility with Interstellar.\u003Cp\u003EAlso they seem to have added MORE memory leaks \u0026gt;\u0026lt; .. Start KSP, memory usage is at X. Get sidetracked and walk away leaving it at the main menu for about 20 min, come back, mem usage is at X\u002B100. Didn\u0027t do that in 1.0.2.
