For future components, I don\u0027t think this will be an issue as I\u0027ll just make a MM config adding in the wheels, but for the parts that are already in orbit, my understanding is that they will not include the new modules because of the way they are saved. Is there a way that I could edit the reaction control module into the save file without having to relaunch all of the parts I\u0027ve already go in space?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-11T05:45:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2014 05:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T05:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENevermind, I guess after a little experimentation that editing the parts with the new module actually does translate into the new module being on the craft already in space.

The easiest way to figure out what you need to copy/paste would be to make a simple craft with your part on it and launch it. Quicksave, edit the file, and look for your newly launched ship. You should be able to spot the new section of code that you need to copy and paste into the corresponding part on the station. Just make sure you don\u0027t try to copy the whole part. Just the module you\u0027re adding, or it might unlink your whole station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep a backup copy...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
