I don\u0027t know what KSP\u0027s drag model is actually like, but from practice, my planes go their fastest when I\u0027ve parked them up as high as I possibly can without burning out. This usually involves throttling back down to the last or second to last tick. Often increasing from something like 1800m/s to 2150\u002Bm/s (surface v, I believe my fastest is 2380m/s orbital v) with the latter velocity being when I\u0027m under 1/3rd throttle. I\u0027m sure it varies with each plane\u0027s design, but I wouldn\u0027t say that throttling back and loss of drag from gaining altitude are directly offsetting. Often the extra altitude offsets the slight loss of thrust. I\u0027ve heard that KSP\u0027s drag model is very harsh which might be accentuating this. Maybe using mods like FAR things would be more like you\u0027re describing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has just been my experience with designing quite a few SSTO\u0027s in KSP.
