While KSP is a great game, it most definitely is not very well polished and you don\u0027t have to look far at all to find issues, especially in career mode. I\u0027ve seen reviewers give games terrible scores for much smaller issues than what KSP still has, I\u0027m not saying that I\u0027m disappointed that KSP got great reviews, but the glowing reviews don\u0027t match up to my impression of the game at this point and I\u0027m a little worried that it will send the wrong message to Squad (i.e. it\u0027s okay to rush a release and give us a half finished product). There\u0027s too much of that in the industry already.\n\n@Travisfv\n\nI know you were asking klgraham1013, but I can list some of the flaws I\u0027ve seen as well.\n\nCareer mode is basically grind mode. There\u0027s a few moments of brilliance when you\u0027re able to pull off your first Mun/Minmus mission with limited parts, but then you suddenly have enough science to basically do whatever you want. Before that point, it\u0027s just a grind to get the science for the parts you need to really go anywhere (not to mention the funds required to get past the silly tier 1 building limitations). When running around the space center with a makeshift rover grabbing science from all the buildings gets you more science than getting into orbit, there\u0027s something wrong. Same goes for free funds for simply having a satellite with a solar panel and a thermometer.\n\nThe tech tree layout doesn\u0027t really help either, simple convenience items like ladders are way too far up, and the parts you need to build a 2.5m rocket are spread across 3 different nodes so you have to unlock all of them. Not to mention you don\u0027t start with simple experiments like a thermometer or a barometer. For the most part, parts seem to be placed more or less randomly around the tree.\n\nFunds are not particularly balanced. 3 stabilization fins cost more than the 1.25m engines, for example. A large mothership style mission to Jool with multiple launches costs less than upgrading the VAB to the max level.\n\nContracts are just ridiculous for the most part. There\u0027s a whole thread devoted to insane contracts people have had come up. Part tests under just plain ridiculous conditions, crazy orbits for satellite contracts, etc.\n\nOverall, career needs a major overhaul that it didn\u0027t get in 1.0 It\u0027s not particularly well balanced or fun outside of a narrow point around the early-mid game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T23:59:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:41:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And here we go again.\n\nwell, you aren\u0027t helping either."},{"CreatedByName":"Travisfv","CreatedById":63966,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:48:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can see it.
