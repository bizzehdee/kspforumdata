(I hope that can be a thing ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )\n\nThat was one of the cryptic clues (specifically day 8) in the [Kerbal Kountdown](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115759-Kerbal-Kountdown!!!!/page31?p=1845628#post1845628) (counting down the days to the release of 1.0)\n\nThe clues were originally posted on Twitter by **KasperVld**. It was 8 because we\u0027re currently in the 8th Saros Cycle of eclipses.\n\nThe reason the sky is dark during a lunar eclipse is because you can only see one if it\u0027s night-time. The Earth blocks out the sunlight which would otherwise hit the moon and reflect back. The red colour is due to light refracting through the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, hitting the moon and reflecting back.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T12:51:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover**\n  \nfixed typo \u002B more info"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:01:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Fast forward for a few days and you will.\n\u003E Squad should really introduce axial tilt but I guess that will come with a weather system of some sorts (or I hope so at least).
