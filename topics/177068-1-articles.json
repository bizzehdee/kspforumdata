That being said I have an idea for a mod but no way to implement it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you check out this review video of the Heisenberg mod by Angel-125, and pay close attention to the 8 minute and 14 minute marks you\u0027ll see probably the best cargo bay with a ramp and one with an elevator I have ever seen....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI asked Angel-125 if he/she would be willing to take the ramp and elevator and apply them to size tweakable mark 1 and 2 rocket and space plane form factor....Unfortunately he/she has no willingness to do so. However he/she said that they did not have issue with someone using those parts as a starting point to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically I\u0027m requesting someone with the knowhow to take the ramp and elevator mechanics of those parts and add them to typical rocket and space plane form factor as a stockalike version....and also hopefully make them work with tweakscale....so a bunch of separate sizes would not be necessary....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone is willing and able to do so, I guess the first step would be to discuss it with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022106975\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Angel-125\u003C/a\u003E, and then start a mod development thread here....and let me know!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoE Smash\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDL9QAzlr5Q?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-27T00:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#27ae60;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[MOD - Moved to Modelling and Texturing Discussion, as the proposal is to do with add-on authoring rather than the base game]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-30T14:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe should just make them since she already has the first one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoE Smash","CreatedById":189611,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-09T04:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223424588\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177068\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221532960244\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105588\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CobaltWolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/30/2018 at 10:17 AM, CobaltWolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe should just make them since she already has the first one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already made that request.....she doesn\u0027t feel like doing so unfortunately.

As for anyone else copying it and putting it in a smaller craft, again you\u0027d have to find a willing part mod maker,\u00A0 who also wanted such a part , but mod makers generally do things their own way,\u00A0 we don\u0027t like copying parts, i wouldn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
