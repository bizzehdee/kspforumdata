If so, what are they? Does it mean anything particularly special if one line is above or below another?\u003Cp\u003ECl is the coefficient of lift, and Cd is the coefficient of drag, unitless parameters that characterize the lift and drag properties of the aircraft at a specific AoA. Lift itself, at a specific AoA is a function of the coefficient of lift, the dynamic pressure, and either the chord length of the airfoil, for section lift, \u003Cem\u003El\u003C/em\u003E or the planform area of the lifting body for finite wing lift \u003Cem\u003EL\u003C/em\u003E. Realize that finite wing lift is also affected by Oswald\u0027s efficiency number which takes into account how efficient the lift profile of the lifting body is: finite wings produce less lift at the wingtips due to the effects of wingtip vortices. L/D is the lift to drag ratio, or how much more lift the body is producing relative to drag. Again, there are no units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming that the span efficiency number (oswald\u0027s efficiency number) is constant for all aircraft in FAR since it is usually experimentally derived (or derived via CFD). For that matter, I\u0027m not sure what lifting shape profile he is using for lift, drag, and moment curves or if he has integrated different curves for each wing surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know cM (yellow line) should be negative to be stable, but what does cM stand for? What is it beyond the fact it influences my stability? How to I raise or lower that line?\u003Cp\u003EcM is the static coefficient of longitudinal stability, also known as one of the static stability derivatives. It is the slope of the line defined by the aerodynamic moment about the aircraft center of gravity as a function of AoA at a trim airspeed. Since standard convention dictates that a nose-down moment is negative, cM must be negative for the aircraft to be statically stable, or, initially, want to return to its unperturbed state after some deviation from trim. It is also why you want your center of lift behind your center of gravity for longitudinal stability. All aerodynamic forces act through the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, while the motion of the aircraft is centered about the center of gravity. Imagine an aircraft flying straight and level (Lift = Weight, Thrust = Drag) at some trim AoA, \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E. Now imagine that the nose deviates up, briefly increasing the angle of attack. An increase in angle of attack with no decrease in speed will increase lift. Since the lift is acting behind the center of gravity the increased lift will initially create a nose down moment, pushing the aircraft back toward its trim \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E. Now imagine that same aircraft with the center of lift in front of the center of gravity. As the nose deviates upward, the aircraft generates more lift. The increased lift causes a nose UP moment which further exacerbates the deviation, generates more lift, and pushes the nose up further. This is why your airplane flips on its back. It is trying to establish a stable condition. Also, this is a grossly simplified explanation, since I didn\u0027t mention the balance in the inherent aerodynamic moment of the aircraft, but I think you get the gist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen I type into the textfield \u0022Mach/AoA:\u0022 what is that parameter setting up exactly?

One of the things you can customize is wing thickness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stock aerodynamics, lift seems to just be proportional to mass (the way drag is), so thicker Procedural Dynamics wings only generate more lift because of their higher mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in a realistic aerodynamics system like FAR, my expectations are a little higher, of course. In real life, thicker wings generate more lift because they part more air, and thus are able to move greater volumes of air above/below the wing in differing pressure-ratios (using the model of lift where lift is due to differences in pressure above/below the wing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is mainly of use in subsonic flight- since lift/drag ratio, rather than raw lift potential, becomes the dominant factor in supersonic flight. However in subsonic flight, thicker-winged aircraft tend to be able to lift much heavier payloads and fly at much slower speeds than those with thinner wings, due to their superior lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering how well this was simulated in FAR (if at all). This is because I would like to build some large-winged subsonic propeller-aircraft for exploration around Kerbin using Procedural Dynamics, and I should be able to attain a higher altitude ceiling and lower liftoff speed (due to lower wing-load) for the same craft (if FAR does this part of the aerodynamics right) if I build the same craft with thicker wings of otherwise the same dimensions...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, there\u0027s also some stuff that goes on with root-to-tip thickness ratio that I don\u0027t fully understand: basically, aircraft with wings that taper more towards the tip have superior performance to those with wings that are relatively flat in terms of thickness.
