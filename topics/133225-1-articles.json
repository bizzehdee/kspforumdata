However, there is a very slim chance that this may not always work as a situation could arise in which this could break a mod. (note, I have never had this happen to me in all my four years of playing KSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should be fine with just merging though,\u00A0but if that really breaks things, just delete and reinstall it. Unless a mod undergoes a major update, your craft files should remain intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-01T00:31:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2016 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Spica\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T01:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore updating, its always a good practice to take a minute or two, and check the OP and the last few posts in the mod release thread for info...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsually mod devs will add in the OP whether a new version will break saves, or exact details on how to do the update if there is anything out of the ordinary... Sometimes they will only add a post at the end of the release thread...
