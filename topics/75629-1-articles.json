Two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In SE, if you build a ship with 100 blocks, you still have only one physics object the engine has to worry about. In KSP, you\u0027ll have 100 physics parts, so even a small ship will destroy your CPU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can\u0027t have multi node connection points in KSP, so if you try to make a 5x5 grid of cubes, you\u0027ll really have a weird conga line of blocks. You could fix this by programmatically adding struts in the connection directions, but that will multiply your part count, which will destroy your CPU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re still keen on trying this, it probably would be possible. Check out KAS to see how they handle part addition via EVA. Then you just have to make your own PartModules to do the piece-by-piece constriction of the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
