IT would function on an EVA basis, with a few obstacles and the like, that could get kerbals less EXP than a flight but for less money, and could possibly lead to more specialization (EVA Specialist being like the Engineer but with more science out of observations and easier to control, or a geologist who could take better soil samples, or a better large ships pilot or small ships pilot, or an orbital mechanic, or anything else.
