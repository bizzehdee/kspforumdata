I don\u0027t think its a good idea to have weird shadows move around constantly on the ground in the background of you building your craft. It breaks the logical focal point of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, by having those huge sun lit areas just jump around in there. I think the overall light level should be boosted so that the rockets arent so dim in comparison to that sunbeam, perhaps add some overhead/flood lights to keep the shadows under the craft if thats the aesthetic you were going for. The sun light should also be more diffuse and cast softer shadows. I think those changes will actually unironically significantly improve the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0 usability, cause the current lighting literally leaves me feeling unwell every time i see it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
