If you\u0027ve already visited Tylo it might not generate the contract. I haven\u0027t actually visited everywhere in a 0.90 career though, so I can\u0027t confirm that.

I haven\u0027t lost a significant amount of rep, but I did use a gravity assist from Tylo to get into orbit around Jool, and I completed a Tylo science data contract during that swingby.

Go to contracts, add (or something like that), then look for \u0022exploreBody\u0022 and click H for hard (since explore contracts are always three stars). Then go to the actual debug section and see if it comes up with any sort of error. That\u0027s the only other thing I can think of, short of save file editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It may be a bug in the game. It may be because you already visited Tylo.
