When the plane flies at 1.2km/h for a while, the probe core explodes. Apparently heat conducts fast inside the cargo bay and causes the part with the lowest max temp, the probe core, to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/1.0#Heat_Simulation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/1.0#Heat_Simulation\u003C/a\u003E, it says (I know I can\u0027t totally trust that, but at least this isn\u0027t outdated information, or is it?): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EService modules, fairings and cargo bays can be used to protect parts inside from heat.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut seems a simple attach doesn\u0027t insulate heat well...

Service bay seems to insulate heat to some extent, but my probe doesn\u0027t fit in a service bay (to be more precise, the biggest RT antenna which basically just occupies a whole length of a short cargo bay). Seems ModuleConductionMultiplier is doing the job, but only service bays have this, not cargo bays, not fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr I need to try some mods?

My setup is like this (sorry no pics because I\u0027ve already changed it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ Antenna - Probe - some cubic struts - decoupler - Cargo bay back ]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere the whole [] is the cargo bay. When I flied near 1km/s, I press F11, opened the bay, and then everything except the antenna is moderately hot (still mostly red, not close to yellow), while the antenna is extremely hot. Can\u0027t say for sure about probes because I can\u0027t see it well, but I have RTGs radially attached to cubic struts and they have the same max temp and they\u0027re not hot at all - kind of proves to me that conduction is not the issue, since the heat cannot be conducted from the back of the cargo bay if RTGs don\u0027t get hot (they\u0027re even closer to cargo bay attachment point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried to use the solution from heat management between decoupler and cargo bay. Not better at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy initial testing of moving the payload to cargo bay front seems solves the problem - even without heat management.
