Games like Orbiter have the real-world physics angle covered admirably already.

I would roll with it just on the basis of having the tweakable parts, actually. I have so many mods on at this point that any de-clutter that can happen in my parts list is a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd guys lets be honest, KSPI was pretty OP before anyways. Before the contract system, when it did not cost you anything to launch things, KSPI reactors allowed you to build practically infinitely powered probes without much hassle (because especially once the VAB thermal helper came out, there is kinda no reason to ever overheat). Even with the contract system, I am currently sitting at almost 3 million funds AFTER I have already built up a pretty solid infrastructure of probe-driven harvesters and transfer stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what if in real life the values come out a little bit different. If it really bothers you that much, WaveFunction has not taken down the KSPI Experimental .11, which was almost a straight recompile of the original with some minor balance tweaks. You can freely download that. Or, as many have pointed out, make a fork and recompile things for yourself. No one is forcing you to use this version. No one is forcing you to use any mod for that matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T16:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be almost an even split between people who liked the \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/index.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAtomic Rockets\u003C/a\u003E: the Game\u0022 feel of 0.11 and people who prefer the gameplay-oriented stats in 0.12.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working on a pack (ModuleManager patches to parts in 0.12 and additional configs using models from 0.11 that don\u0027t appear in 0.12) to approximate the old stats while still taking advantage of Community Resource Pack, TweakScale, and the updated plugin in 0.12.
