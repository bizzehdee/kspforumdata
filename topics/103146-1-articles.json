Why did you decide to release 1.2 instead?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you may well know, 1.0 is a critical update that shows that our game is polished and ready for a wide release. Instead of releasing this update now, or merely staying in beta (more on that later), we have decided to craftily release 1.2, 1.3, etc. until our game is ready for 1.0. This was a difficult decision, but hopefully it is understandable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022What new features are being released for... \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eerm\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E... 1.2?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOne of our hallmarks of this new update is our increased respect for the advertising industry.\u003C/strong\u003E KSP will now implement pop-up ads after recovering or before launching a vessel. These will be tailored to each KSP player\u0027s individual wants and needs, based on their browser history, the documents on their computer, and by intermittently taking pictures of them through their webcams.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOur team has been working on adding unpredictability to 1.2.\u003C/strong\u003E We are introducing a \u0027random failure\u0027 and a \u0027Kraken\u0027 aspect to KSP. The former will cause various failures to intermittently occur on rockets and aircraft, just like in real life. The latter will introduce an exciting \u0022jumpscare\u0022 layer to the game. Occasionally the screen will go black, followed by the Kraken loudly appearing and violently \u0027eating the camera.\u0027 Both of these features will be toggleable for a small fee.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther features can also be purchased form the KSP store or the game itself, such as more than one savegame, tutorials, customizable flags, Mk2 and Mk3 parts, planets besides Kerbin, VAB upgrades, or access to the game\u0027s mods.\u003C/strong\u003E None of these are very expensive: it is possible to have a complete playing experience for less that $75.00 USD. Unfortunately, this payment must be renewed each update to maintain the features you have bought and the missions you have accomplished.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMicrotransactions will be encouraged.\u003C/strong\u003E Did you run out of fuel or electricity halfway to the Mun? We\u0027re now offering you more for just pennies on the dollar. Quicksaving and quickloading will also be available at low cost. For a slightly greater fee, the game can automatically land your craft wherever you choose, or return it back home safely.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP will now be programmed in Java.\u003C/strong\u003E While this may break many mods, it will nonetheless yield better integration among all platforms. While this was one of the most debated moves for 1.2, we have agreed that this change must be made sooner or later.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA rather aggressive DRM will be added to KSP.\u003C/strong\u003E It is important that we regularly check to make sure that KSP was legally purchased and not copied from other computers or altered by users. Because the game could be altered or copied at any time, DRM will always be on and connected to the Internet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can probably tell, this update will take time to complete. Thus, to make the update available sooner, we are taking less time to tweak the game and fix bugs than we otherwise would. We are also temporarily scrapping a stable 64-bit version, ISRU, the planned aerodynamics overhaul, and really every feature we planned to implement for 1.0. These features will likely be available on a future version of KSP for another small fee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022You seemed to be rushed in your release of 1.0 (now 1.2). Why?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re extremely proud to announce that we\u0027ve got a contract to merge with EA shortly after the release of our first non-early-access version.

For example, the Daily Kerbal, including Devnote Tuesdays, will not be continued. The number of moderators here on the Forum will also be reduced significantly.
