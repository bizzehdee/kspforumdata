I suppose ill try to get Debian installed and try with that, but i may just wait for the next update with 64bit windows support oh and Steamos is Debian based however it is so locked down after installing it i spent the rest of the day in terminal trying to get everything required to unpack and install mods for ksp so yea that\u0027s definitely out for me lol.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirmatthew","CreatedById":114876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T16:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eno tweaks, just try to stay low with the graphical setting. what problems do yoiu have with steamos?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xalos","CreatedById":114866,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T02:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirmatthew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sirmatthew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eno tweaks, just try to stay low with the graphical setting. what problems do yoiu have with steamos?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was just too locked down, to begin with i had to edit the software sources in terminal using nano to add in the Debian repos then mess with the priority\u0027s a bit and even then i was getting errors all over the place trying to aptget the required software to extract simple zip files because steamos dosent ship with any decompression software. I just gave up on it it would be a great install on a tv setup with no modding outside of maybe steam workshop, however im heavy into modding and almost every game i play i look for mods, heck even the ios game \u0022Game Dev Story\u0022 i took apart and made a Texture pack for. I have been hesitant to even try modding ksp because of the ram limit. Oh and ill be trying Debian Jessie in the morning as it took me all day today just to download the 3 DVDs, and thats the official release version, the weekly release version is 3 Bluerays!! I don\u0027t even have a BR drive in my computer, heck when i built this one i completely forgot to put a disk drive into it, no real need for it nowadays but i got an external DVD drive for the rare occasion that i need one. Still 3 DVDs for a Linux distro is a bit much even Ubuntu was only 1, but if its stabler then Ubuntu then its worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T07:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Debian you should just download the netinstall disc and then let the installer download the packages you actually need later.

I saved nearly 1GB, but then again with 16GB you won\u0027t be nearly as concerned! You\u0027ll still save a lot of unnecessary CPU/disk activity though by avoiding the full desktop environment installs.
