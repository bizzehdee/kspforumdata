I will also sometimes backup the 2 files mid-game after an important event, which is perfectly possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, backing up saves is very quick, very easy and takes very little space, so do it as often as possible!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea friend of mine also made a batch file to do all this automatically, I will upload that later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T11:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour persistence file is updated periodically as you play and also every time you change the scene (go to and from the space center, for instance.) The quicksave file is updated every time you launch a ship and whenever you press F5. If you want to return to an earlier save, all you need is the .sfs file from the desired time. Copy it into your game folder and change the name to persistent.sfs and you\u0027re good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways always always be sure to back up your current persistence file before you do anything like this though (or at least change the name until you\u0027ve had time to confirm that the backed up save is functioning as intended.) If for some reason the older file was corrupted, you can lose your entire save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T18:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for both your replies, it makes total sense now that i know how this works \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The old backed up save didn\u0027t have the station, so i guess i\u0027m bringing back the normal one)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-07T18:41:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2013 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mokmo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Estation status after restore\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T18:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne more trick: if you accidentally end a flight and realize it right away quickly alt\u002Bf4 out of the game.
