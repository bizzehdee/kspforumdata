Once you can do this in your sleep its becomes tedious, not fun, to continue to do over and over again. At this point the part of the game where you \u0022learn something new\u0022 is (for me) heavily based on designing ships that can do difficult tasks. \n\nTake launching from Eve for example: the challenging part isnt actually piloting the take off, but rather designing a ship that CAN take off from Eve and getting that ship to Eve\u0027s surface is what is challenging and fun.\n\nSo, without telling anyone how they should play the game, id recommend that you should learn how to do stuff without mechjeb, and once you completely understand it and dont get enjoyment from adjusting an orbit or taking off or landing for the 1000th time let mechjeb automate it and switch your focus to other aspects of the game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T15:14:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jkool702**"},{"CreatedByName":"winged","CreatedById":143617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:16:05Z","Content":"Mechjeb is very helpful when you\u0027re doing gravity assists.

I use it to eliminate the tedium of yet another launch from Kerbin with the same identical launching stack that carries the same payload into the same orbit. I use it to plot the most efficient course between point-A and point-B, because I can\u0027t call up the Kerbals in the tracking station and ask them, \u0022Hey, could you help me get to Eve?\u0022 I let it fly probes entirely because probes are supposed to be autonomous, no human (or Kerbal) intervention, flying with mechanical precision.\n\nI use the Current Biome readout when flying aircraft or driving rovers, so that I\u0027m not constantly wasting my time trying to check if I\u0027m in a new biome when gathering batches of science, rather than breaking my mouse checking the Crew Report until something finally says it\u0027s not Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands.\n\nI even admit to using Docking Autopilot. Why would a society that can go interplanetary still be bashing ships together under full manual control? Why not make the highly-tuned piece of precision equipment, the probe core, do the hard stuff? Sure, I can dock ships together, and until I\u0027ve done a few in Kerbin Orbit and a couple around the Mun, I don\u0027t use Docking Autopilot. After I\u0027ve done it a few times, then the autopilot turns on. And believe me, it\u0027s far from a cheaty \u0022press button and make space station\u0022 routine with that. You need to be so over-engineered in your monopropellant budget that it\u0027s barely funny. Why? Because Mechjeb, last time I used it, determines that the best way to not move is to spray monopropellant from all nozzles at once, depleting your supply of RCS fuel.\n\nAs for those who bash on Mechjeb being \u0027easy mode\u0027, well, yes, it does make things easier. Think of it this way, though: if we, as Humans, didn\u0027t have the equivalent of Mechjeb, we wouldn\u0027t have a space station in orbit nor a flag on the moon. Yes, some of it was flown manually, I\u0027m sure.\n\nAlso consider this: NASA has a huge ground-support crew communicating to our astronauts during each phase of their mission. KSP players have themselves and their trusty keyboards, the dead silence over the radio, and the whirr of fans in their computer case.\n\nMechjeb is my Ground Control. Mechjeb is the silent voice over my radio, telling my probe which way to go, telling my Kerbals where to point the ship, guiding my Kerbonauts across the infinite darkness. Mechjeb is the Kerbal Pilot\u0027s intuition saying, \u0022Maybe I should turn the engine on **right now** so that I don\u0027t crash and die horribly out here.\u0022\n\nAnd I don\u0027t mind seeing people fly solo. I have nothing against them, even when they have something against me. I have respect for those who wish to fly every launch on manual, to dock every ship on their own. To do their own landings with their own probes, or to plot their own course.\n\nThere are even moments when I\u0027m forced to fly manual because something happened and suddenly Mechjeb can\u0027t handle flying the ship, and it makes me respect the solo pilots even more. Making that decision whether to stage early, or try to make it, despite being down one engine and a fuel can. Whether to shut down the other side or to ride out the lean. Whether to jettison the remains of both the destroyed side and the companion engine across from it. Whether to abort the launch or continue anyway. Or whether I can make it, despite being 300 delta-V short of what I initially planned.\n\nMechjeb isn\u0027t just a \u0022push button for orbit\u0022 tool. Sure, it can be used as such, but all the computers in the world won\u0027t make a poorly-designed rocket make orbit. I enjoy KSP for the engineering challenge it presents, like playing with a box of virtual LEGO\u0027s without stepping on the pieces four hours later. Sure, I enjoy flying some of my missions, but flying the same design to orbit just gets dull after a while. And I know Squad made the decision to not have random failures for a reason. So that your mistakes are the only reason you don\u0027t make orbit. But there are times I really wish something, anything, would happen on launch number 37, or launch number 5 of the MK14 Super Shuttle. Things that aren\u0027t planned ahead of time. Things not related to \u0022oh, crap, I just opened my chute under full acceleration.\u0022 or \u0022I pulled up too hard and ripped the wings off.\u0022\n\nThe end result, though, is that I do use Mechjeb, and a good number of its features, because they add in my co-pilot, my Ground Control, my Navigator. It gives me probe cores that are more than just remote-controlled spacecraft with an infinite range. It gives me the remaining 50% of my space program, the parts that would be so much more difficult to add in game smoothly. And so it gives me an ability to go interplanetary with ease. After all, I still do many of my own landings, many of my own launches, and a good chunk of my own docking. But sometimes I let my co-pilot do it for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T00:57:01Z","Content":"I use mechjeb.
