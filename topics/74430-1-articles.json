I set the decoupler and the sepetrons all in the ABORT action group, and put them in the staging together. I do not place the parachute in the same stage I place it in the last stage so it is never accidentally opened. The force of the decoupler and the sepetrons is more then enough to push the cockpit and SAS unit away from the doomed craft. This means your pilot will be a free falling capsule which all you have to do then is deploy the parachute and drift safely down to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Fleet Master","CreatedById":78352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T23:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAir Superiority you say???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AnulSWE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AnulSWE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xMECKN8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xMECKN8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a7v5Tcf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022a7v5Tcf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are Arcadia Industries Fighters, the F-1 is by Comrade Jenkens =D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T23:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeli-carriers suit as a counter to most things.
