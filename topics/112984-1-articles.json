Unless there is some weird undiscovered quirk with windows 10 and unity."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T00:36:49Z","Content":"For the most part current drivers will work. The most susceptible would be your graphics card but I think Nvidia and ATI have already updated. Next up is your audio which should work with the drivers built into Windows 10, though some things may not work on more advanced audio devices. Flight sticks may not work without a driver update either, but if you have one that didn\u0027t need a driver in Window 7/8 place then it will probably be fine (my Thrustmaster HOTAS works just fine).\n\nWindows 10 is basically Windows 8 with a better GUI. Windows 8 was always a better performer than Windows 7 but the terrible GUI scared everyone off of it. So if it works in Windows 8, it should theoretically work in Windows 10."},{"CreatedByName":"ansaman","CreatedById":78227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T03:20:08Z","Content":"**Thanks for the information!**"}]}
