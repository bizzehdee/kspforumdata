If she wanted to, a kerbal could instantaneously access all of kerbalkind\u2019s collected knowledge and wisdom going back to the Great Purge, or she could spend hours trying in vain to get her mods to work together on Human Space Program.

He pulled up a news page from the Solar News Network.\u00A0\u0022A few kerbals have started to wonder if the United Kerbin is really doing the best they can in their favor.

How do we avoid them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, the IA figured that since Gilly was a refueling stop, it was essentially just a space station,\u0022 explained Bill.\u00A0\u0022And since it was privately funded, they thought that it would just be easier to let Gilly Control manage its own traffic. So the IA doesn\u0027t pay attention to incoming ships unless Gilly Control flags them for further investigation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, it could be risky,\u0022 said Jeb. \u0022What if the controller on duty decides that we\u0027re worth the bail?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It says here that nearly forty percent of the kerbals at Gilly are sympathetic to our cause,\u0022 said Bill. \u0022And that figure includes the four dozen IA troops stationed there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, let\u0027s put it to a vote,\u0022 the commander said. \u0022All for?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill and Bob raised their hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, then. I\u0027m calling Gilly and requesting permission to land.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb reached for the microphone. \u0022GC, MkII dropship requesting permission to land and transfer fuel onboard, over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGilly Control was unfazed. \u0022Negative. Please give name of spacecraft and affiliated company.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb took a deep breath. If the controller didn\u0027t like the answer then it was all over for them. \u0022Spacecraft is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKraken\u0027s Spit,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0part of the Jeb\u0027s Dropship Services fleet.

The IA doesn\u0027t need to know what they don\u0027t want to hear, if you get my drift. There\u0027s money in it for you- we have big fuel tanks, and they\u0027re almost empty.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what if some officer notices that, hey, the three most wanted kerbals in the solar system are sitting eating lunch across the table from him?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Then we\u0027ll let you turn us in and you can collect the bail. But if you go running to the cops before anyone finds out about us, then we\u0027ll open the first airlock we can find. We\u0027ll sabotage everything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was silence over the microphone for a while. When the controller called back, Jeb could almost hear the smile in his voice. \u0022Pleasure doing business with you. We\u0027ll have Pad 03 ready for your arrival in three hours.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKraken\u0027s Spit\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eabandoned its carefully planned trajectory the next day and settled into orbit around Gilly. Forty minutes later, Jeb gave the engines a five second burst at full thrust and they were falling straight down, so slowly, toward the captured asteroid. Two minutes before landing Bob said, \u0022Are we sure we want to go through with this? It might be riskier than we thought.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s too late to quit now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship fell with a dreamlike quality in the microgravities. Rather than use the normal accelerometer equipment to figure out when the legs touched the ground, Jeb just looked out the window. The engines were at two percent thrust, barely even glowing. The last meter to the ground was excruciatingly slow. At last, the landing legs thumped down on the first land they had touched in years.\u00A0\u0022Touchdown,\u0022 Jeb said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the two hours it would take to refuel the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKraken\u0027s Spit,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the crew loitered in the lounge. It was almost empty, so they didn\u0027t worry too much that they would be discovered. Still, they should have been more careful- at one point a kerbal came over and was within two meters before they even noticed her. \u0022My name is Valentina,\u0022 she said. \u0022And you look like you need a pilot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody knew who this Valentina was or where she came from, or why they could trust her, but she seemed persuasive. And you could tell just by looking at her that she was one damn fine pilot, something that could come in handy while running from the cops. \u0022Where are you fellows headed?\u0022 she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E-Duna, or maybe Laythe.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why don\u0027t you know for sure?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E-Uh... you see, there\u0027s some guys hanging around the inner solar system that we don\u0027t want to run into.

Really, I\u0027ll fly along with you for no charge- my ship was damaged by a runaway tanker, you see. And everyone can use another pilot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E-Sure. Our ship will be fueled up in two hours, five minutes.

On paper, it was a terrible, terrible decision, but sometimes you just have to meet someone to know that they are mysteriously loyal and trustworthy to complete strangers that will probably get them killed, or worse, just by association. Some people call them\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eadventurous.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb, Bill, and Bob started walking back to the ship.\u00A0They killed time during the fueling operations by checking the ship\u0027s systems and making sure everything was okay after the ridiculous battles with the IA. Ten minutes before liftoff, they heard a knocking at the hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll bet that\u0027s Valentina,\u0022 said Jeb. \u0022I\u0027ll let her in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey listened to Jeb climb down to the ingress hatch and almost immediately forgot he was gone. Five minutes later, Valentina entered the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKraken\u0027s Spit\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and sat down next to Bill and Bob. \u0022I thought there were three of you,\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill and Bob looked at each other. \u0022Uh-oh,\u0022 they said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two of them sprinted into the refinery\u0027s galley, where they saw Jeb fighting to get free of the clutches of two members of the Interplanetary Authority. \u0022Run!\u0022 yelled Jeb. \u0022Save yourselves! Get out of here!\u0022 Of course, before Bill and Bob could start running, the two IA officers noticed them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Forget this guy, there\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etwo\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eof them!\u0022 one shouted.

Start the engines!\u0022 They climbed into the ship just as it started rocking with the vibrations of the turbopumps coming online, and the hatch was closed in seconds. \u0022We can\u0027t stay here anymore. Liftoff!\u0022 shouted Bill. As the ship rose high into the black, Bob sighed. \u0022Poor Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was already on his third lap around the refinery. He needed to stop running soon, or else the IA suits would catch him.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EThere! An escape pod!\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EHe ran in and closed the door.

In fact, the only thing in his favor was that the escape pod was entirely self-sufficient, with compact recyclers for air, food, and water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen an idea entered Jeb\u0027s brain. A crazy, idiotic idea, one that any other kerbal would have dismissed as utterly insane. And Jeb started grinning like a madman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s moving,\u0022 said the captain of the first cruiser. They followed Jeb through a three-minute burn, slowly starting to wonder just where they were going. Finally, after nine minutes of this, the captain said, \u0022Where\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eis\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ehe- oh, kraken!

It did have parachutes and heat shielding, but they were intended for entry at Kerbin. To compensate, Jeb burned off all of the fuel slowing down at two hundred kilometers. After that was finished, he just held on to whatever he could find as the capsule shook and rumbled its way down. Whatever wasn\u0027t in the shadow of the heat shield was vaporized instantly.\u00A0After the shock heating was over, the pod ran out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E propellant and started gyrating wildly as it tore through the clouds at many times the speed of sound. Delicate equipment tore off the outside of the spacecraft, creating a debris clouds kilometers wide. Four parachutes deployed and were destroyed, and four more reserve chutes popped out of their cowling. One failed, but the rest survived, and the spinning stopped, only to be replaced by a bone-shattering thud moments later as the capsule slammed into the ground and the landing gear sheared off. The pod started rolling down a hill, and at this point virtually all equipment mounted outside the hull had been destroyed. Finally, the main fuel tank tore off, and the pod came to rest in a valley on the most deadly planet known to kerbalkind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb couldn\u0027t wait to step and see what it was like.

In the end, that is the great equalizer- and the Lazarus Proposal that Prime Minister Adwell\u00A0passed through the Governmental Chamber made it an act of treason to, directly or indirectly, take the life of a kerbal on purpose.

The entire fleet crashed into Minnmus due to a navigation error one week after launch. The first seventeen rockets to fly to the Mun had to be aborted due to twenty-ninth stage separation failures, and none of those crews survived (as it turns out, the rounded ends of the fuel tanks were perfect for deflecting flame up towards the capsule). The next twelve failed because someone forgot to fill the thirty-second stage tanks. Even the first test flight of the space program ended badly, as the one solid rocket booster and the one parachute fired at the same time. Despite never traveling more than ten meters during the flight, the intrepid pilot perished because he jumped out while the engine was still firing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now, Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Val are about to follow in the footsteps of these early explorers and arrive at Duna, a planet that was colonized over a course sixty-eight years and millions of deaths.

When he was in there, he saw Bill, Bob, and Val frantically ricocheting off the walls in a frantic effort to avoid the so-called space crab. It had a shiny green dodecehedron for a main body, with six\u00A0extremely long insect-like legs sticking out from various faces. It had three antennae at what must be the front and four tendrils hanging limp from its back end. Little gold balls adorned the tips of its extremities\u00A0and\u00A0the corners of its dodecehedron.\u00A0The space crab walked along a wall towards Bob\u00A0(\u003Cem\u003Eit must have microscopic hooks on its feet,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EJeb thought) and when the tendrils touched him he cried out in pain. \u0022I hate this darn thing!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb was able to sneak up from behind and trap the space crab in a sample container.

Its powerful jellyfish-like sting includes a truth serum.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But how did you get it?\u0022 asked Valentina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You see, when I was on Minnmus, I wasn\u0027t actually mining. I was a secret government\u00A0operative, sent to investigate a downed spacecraft that was carrying a top secret payload- the first antimatter bomb. Needless to say, the antimatter completely obliterated the thing on impact, but it also bored a hole two kilometers deep into one of Minnmus\u0027 flats. What we found under there was much more interesting than a rogue shipment of antimatter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Instead, we found the space crabs. They had a whole colony down there, just like insects on Kerbin. Some scientists thought that they were related to insects, but these guys were vacum-hardened, clearly evolved to live on Minnmus like that. At the time, we only knew about single-celled organisms on Laythe, so this was huge. And, naturally, the government wanted to keep it a secret while we collected specimens and studied them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This worked well for a while, but then the guys just... disappeared. And it was right after we captured this specimen. The others, they weren\u0027t this big and they didn\u0027t have the gold balls and they didn\u0027t have the truth serum in their sting, and this one also layed eggs- so we knew we had captured their queen, and without a queen they just spontaneously died.\u00A0We stayed on Minnmus a few weeks after that, but then our base sprung a leak and we had to evacuate to a civilian settlement. We couldn\u0027t bring the space-crabs, or else the best-kept secret in history would be out, and so the plan was we would leave them to die there. So instead, when no one was looking I put the queen in a sample container and put her in the one place I knew no one would look- a bulkhead in a rusted-out MkII dropship docked to a derelict Station One.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob looked at the space crab. \u0022What are we ever going to do with you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-05T02:50:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2019 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Confused Scientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-14T18:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRobocrabs in spaaaaaace!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd on a serious note that was another fun chapter with some really nice descriptive touches.

There was moderate heat shielding around the engines, but the bells themselves would be exposed directly to plasma during a reentry. This is negated somewhat by increasing the angle of attack during entry, but the main way that the dropship dealt with excess heat during entry was through a thermal exchange unit that emitted prevented overheating by increasing the temperature of the exhaust.
