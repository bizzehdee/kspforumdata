Chances are that there is some indication in there of what is going wrong...\n\nWhen you say \u0022but still OK with RAM\u0022, what do you mean? How much memory is KSP actually using? If you are using the official 1.0.4 release then this is a 32bit program and can not use more than ~3.5 gig of RAM before it will crash.\n\nThere is a memory leak in KSP when reverting to the VAB (as well as several others) which will cause problems if you start off too close to the memory limit."}]}
