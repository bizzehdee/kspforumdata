It is clear by now (to me, at least) that this is not a diversion like Kenlie\u0026#39;s slightly silly stories.

In the Star Trek episode \u0026#39;Mirror, Mirror\u0026#39; the characters enter the alternate universe and meet some of its inhabitants. This leads to certain expectation/anticipation on my part about the future of the story. Given that the Kerbulans are not just in Kenlie\u0026#39;s imagination, I would expect that they will have to have an effect on the story of our Kerbfleet crew members as it unfolds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt may be that since Kenlie has such an active imagination as a writer, he is more attuned to the thoughts of his alternate/Kerbulan self and thus it is him seeing the images.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut, knowing that Kuzzter wants to tell us a story, I will make a prediction. Evil Kenlie is not really about to die. If the only information the Kerbulans have about Kerbfleet and vice versa is from the mysterious link between the Kenlies, then Kuzzter won\u0026#39;t kill Kenlie Kermulan.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T22:22:11Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027smjjames\u0027]If you\u0026#39;re going to go the Star Trek sort of route, you should introduce the Kerlingons at some point. :) Just an idea.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhether the more ruthless TOS Klingons or the more honorable TNG/DS9 Klingons is up to you.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo me, the name \u0022Kerbulan\u0022 suggests honorable TOS romulans.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Trios\u0027]So all of Duna Ore Bust and Eve: Order Zero is actually just fiction written by Kenlie Kermulan. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL]http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL]http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrWasItADream[/URL] ???[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut wait!
