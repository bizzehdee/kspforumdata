Realistically speaking, in terms of how they carry information, sound and electromagnetic waves function identically. I\u0027ve drawn up some ideas to assist in the evolution of synthetic lifeforms, and one of the ideas I included was giving them the ability to communicate with each other over broadband frequencies. The simplest receiver is simply an antenna and a diode... this can pick up and filter amplitude modulation, the simplest transmitter is really just an antenna with an AC signal applied. EM, AM, and FM are all the same thing. AM and FM are specific types of modulation of EM carrier waves. Also, the voltage required for a 1km range isn\u0027t much at all (it can be done on 12 volts, possibly less)... the real requirement is power (which can come from higher voltage or higher current... usually a bit of both) many handheld radios have a range much further... and CB radios even further still. For example, the Motorola MR350R has a nominal range of 35miles in a handheld package. In terms of modulation, AM can achieve much greater range, while FM can be filtered for clarity. Considering that voice is basically an AM sound wave, and AM is the simplest to construct/filter, it is the most likely candidate... though I wouldn\u0027t rule out FM entirely. As for how this might come about, the biggest odds lie in a situation where the lifeforms in question generate RF signatures as a byproduct of their normal functions... predators would evolve a sense to pick up on this (much like heat sensing vipers, exceptional vision or hearing, echolocation, etc), and then prey would like develop sensitivity to this as well (so as to better self-regulate and/or sense predators, thus negating their advantage).
