This means that the oceans really are made of water, and that agriculture should be possible.\n\nThe other important ingame description of Laythe comes from the surface EVA-report, which reads: \u0022You take your helmet off, and after a few, very long seconds of gasping and haphazard flailing you manage to secure your helmet again. You erase the checkbox on your report for breathable atmosphere...\u0022 This is of course bad news, but since there is no cause given for why the athmosphere is not breathable, this is open to interpretation. Maybe there is not enough oxygen to breath comfortably, but since jet engines work, it hase to be present in relatively large quantities. \n\nAnother unknown factor is surface radiation, but since laythe has to be seismically active to support an athmosphere, I assume that all the heavy elements have migrated to the core, and excessive radiation is not mentioned. \n\nIt should therefore be possible to breath with a simple breathing mask, without the need for heavy suits (since there is no mention of acid or other harmful materials in the athmosphere in any report from Laythe), and to construct greenhouses with relative ease, since water, although it maybe salty, is readily available."}]}
