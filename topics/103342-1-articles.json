Because I have Extraplanetary Launchpads, I plan to build and launch ships from the base (eventually). My question: How should I manage logistics with how to launch my ships from minmus into interplanetary voyages to other planets (should I move to LKO or just go to an escape trajectory straight from minmus?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sisyphean","CreatedById":136131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T20:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eive not used extra-planetary launch pads myself so im no expert, however i would assume that transferring to LKO from minmus before transfer would be a waste, simple reason is that its only about 100m/s d/v to escape kerbins SOI from minmus yet it takes roughly 1km/s d/v to escape from LKO plus the 1km/s (at least) it would take to transfer from minmus to kirbin and circularize. (if your not circularizing then that means your apoapsis is in the right place for a transfer and thus so also is minmus)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe only disadvantage to launching from minmus is that it makes launch windows a bit tricky as minmus has to be in the right place around kerbin for you to transfer into interplanetary space to be a perfect transfer, however im pretty sure kerbal alarm clock can help you work that out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T21:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, minmus location in its orbit is irrelevant.

I think Duna and Eve don\u0027t benefit much if at all, but the rest do. Essentially, the further you go the better it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the savings is not - in my opinion - worth the extra work. If you just want to go, launch from Minmus like you would from Kerbin, ideally when Minmus is orbiting around Kerbin in the same direction. Here\u0027s a quick and ugly ms paint image for what I mean:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://pulpaudio.com/ksp/minmus_to_duna.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022minmus_to_duna.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe arrows show how Kerbin and Minmus are orbiting, so to eject to Duna you want to burn to your ship follows the yellow line at the top of the screen, not the red line at the bottom of the screen. You do this so your burn gets Minmus\u0027 orbital speed as a bonus to your thrust. If you burn for the red line, you actually have to overcome Minmus\u0027 orbital speed with MORE thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize for the crudeness of the image.

I would just add that the diagram is only accurate for going to planets further from the sun than Kerbin; for planets closer to the sun the situation is the opposite (you would want to eject at the bottom point of the diagram in the retrograde direction). I would gin up another diagram but am afraid it wouldn\u0027t be as awesome as that one. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T22:45:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 10:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo fixed.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T22:28:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha yes I specifically made that for Duna.
