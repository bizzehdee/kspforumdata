Doesn\u0027t stop them from talking to Squad.\n\nAs Dman points out, we\u0027re not going to publicly discuss how we analyze the behavior of bad actors.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nIt\u0027s worth emphasizing, though, that **you are responsible for securing your account**.  Cases of actual \u0022hacking\u0022 are pretty rare-- it\u0027s fairly hard to break into an account that has a well-chosen password.  Having a forum account is a *\u003Cu\u003Eresponsibility\u003C/u\u003E*-- it\u0027s **your job** to make sure that you pick a reasonable password, that you don\u0027t share it with anyone, and that you take reasonable steps to secure your account (e.g. don\u0027t leave yourself logged in at a public place, etc.)\n\nOf course we understand that accidents happen, and if something bad happens to a user\u0027s account, we do want to try to work with them to help secure matters.  But we also expect our users to take reasonable care and exercise basic responsibility.  So please do be careful with your account."},{"CreatedByName":"HansonKerman","CreatedById":185809,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-27T20:22:20Z","Content":"How do you do the things you do?

Different people categorize things differently, so coming up with the \u0022right\u0022 categories would be far from obvious.  Also, mods don\u0027t necessarily fit into neat little pigeonholes.  No matter what list of categories one comes up with, you can have mods that don\u0027t quite fit into any of them-- or might fit into multiple ones.\n\nSecond, because having multiple sub-forums like that would make life \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Emore difficult for everyone\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E:\n\n- Harder for users, because now if you want to search for something (or just see \u0022what\u0027s new\u0022), now you have to search in *\u003Cu\u003Emultiple\u003C/u\u003E* places instead of just one.\n- Harder for modders, because now they have to figure out how to categorize and place their mods.\n- Harder for moderators, because now we\u0027ll have to waste a lot of precious time moving things around from subcategory to subcategory when people get it \u0022wrong\u0022, and also need to step in to resolve things when people get into arguments over where a mod belongs.  Which they will, because \u0022categories are hard\u0022 (see above).\n\nThe current system is simple, it works, and \u0022don\u0027t fix it if it ain\u0027t broke.\u0022  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n(There\u0027s also the little practical matter, that if we were to introduce something like this, we\u0027d have to move literally *\u003Cu\u003Ethousands\u003C/u\u003E* of existing mods one at a time to get them sorted into the proper categories.  It would be mindbendingly tedious and take an *\u003Cu\u003Eenormous\u003C/u\u003E* number of hours of our time-- bearing in mind that there aren\u0027t all that many of us, we\u0027re unpaid volunteers doing this in our spare time, and we already have our hands full with actual, y\u0027know, *\u003Cu\u003Emoderating\u003C/u\u003E*.
