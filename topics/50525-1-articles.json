While I fully agree that some addons ought to remain user choice, there are certainly some awesome UI and usability tweaks out there that oughta come into the game. We\u0027ve seen Subassembly manager already do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, I\u0027d like some sorta rocket stats in game - delta-v, at least, and a way to see some information pinned on the screen during flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelectRoot would also be very cool.

Extraplanetary Launchpads (or some way to build things off Kerbin and set up bases that do what you expect bases to do) also seems important. I\u0027m also a fan of the navball docking indicator due to its simplicity and ease of use and understanding (over the also fantastic docking port alignment indicator and the equally nice Lazor docking cam). And though the devs will never do it (I think), SOMETHING that gives you an accurate and updated delta-v (like MechJeb and Kerbal Engineer do, at least most of the time) is important for any serious attempt at an interplanetary network of bases and ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to visuals, I\u0027m a bit invested in it but the City Lights and Clouds mod adds a whole lot of pretty to Kerbin and I don\u0027t like looking at Kerbin without it now.
