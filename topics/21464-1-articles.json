When you drop that stage, your craft is suddenly much lighter. At the exact same time, your nine engines ignite. This gives you a very sudden boost in thrust-to-weight ratio while your ASAS still thinks it\u0027s trying to wrestle an elephant.

That\u0027s not a flaw, but it is a cause. Try moving the side tank/engine combos further down, even overlapping the central engine, to give the stage more rotational inertia. Perhaps even replace those eight 400-capacity tanks with one 1600-capacity big one and eight of the little 200-capacity tanks as side engine moutning points. That will give the stage identical weight, fuel capacity, and engine mounts, while making it longer and therefore more resistant to unwanted rotations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, since the gimballed engines are its strongest form of attitude control, try firing them immediately upon decoupling. I was just having a similar problem earlier this evening, and getting the engines on the job of resisting unwanted rotations right away did a lot to overcome it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might as well save the RCS fuel and turn them off, by the way, since the current thrusters are not really scaled to be much use on the larger ship parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
