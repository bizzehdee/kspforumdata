She punched in her passcode, and swung open the hatch, climbing into the airlock and sealing the hatch. The oxygen was pumped into the chamber, and the pressure was equalised. Kalin removed her helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bill, that was a serious stunt you pulled there.

Debris from the exact same plane that she flew was found near the object, and, after further examination, she discovered a decaying corpse. What makes this discovery harrowing, is the fact that, when the corpse was carbon dated after Alnie transported it back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, it was discovered to be 8.5 million\u00A0years old. And, scarier\u00A0still, the body had the exact same DNA, genetic structure, bone structure, right down to the last millimeter, the last strand of DNA and RNA, as Alnie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe President raised his hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What exactly does this mean?\u0022 he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This means that Alnie Kerman, the same Alnie Kerman that is currently asleep in her dorm at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, visited the North Pole, crashed, died, and was born again 8.5 million\u00A0years later. Some of our more religious-inclined scientists suggest reincarnation. The more influential ones suggest parallel universes, time travel, and other physically impossible things.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But... life on Kerbin only started 4.5 million years ago.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s exactly the point, mister President. As of right now, we need to decide what to do with both the object and the information retrieved from the decaying corpse. I suggest transferring all resources and a sizable\u00A0chunk of the military budget to the KSA.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But what about defense?! We need to be prepared for any Ruskie attacks!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s why I also suggest merging the Military and the KSA. They would both have the same 600 million Kerbucks budget, and they would get work done quicker, as Wernher would now be working at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. In exchange for the much bigger budget, much better scientists, and better research equipment, the KSA would perform an array of military tasks, perhaps designing new ICBMs, or cannibalising old ones to make better rockets. Hell, maybe we could even expand on the \u0027Star Wars\u0027 concept.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene stood up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I will not stand for this.

We need the KSA\u0027s scientific and technical expertise to figure out what all of this means. Hopefully, we could uncover the bigger picture. Whoever or\u00A0whatever made these objects. What are they\u00A0for. How they work. We shall have a vote. The merge or not to merge!

The remains of the \u0027North Pole Object\u0027 were lying to his left. Interns and world-renowned scientists were picking at the interior, which was exposed, the exterior panels stashed away in a broom cupboard. An array of drills and scientific equipment were suspended above the object by a large rack. The President, along with his scientific advisor and more scientists, was seated on a bench 1 metre in front of Wernher. He doodled some pictures of a clock on the whiteboard with his pink marker before he began to speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ladies, gentlemen, Mister President, I have made a startling revelation.

Zis device, it measures approximately vun cubic metre in size, and it is capable of creating immense amounts of power. More zan current atomic fission reactors. Even more zan concepts for nuclear fusion reactors. If zis miniature reactor overheats, it vill create an atomic explosion, so ve must handle it vith immense care.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe people on the bench were scribbling down notes. The President raised his hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Get to the point, Wernher. It took me three hours to fly here from DC, and there are rumors that the KSSR have moved some ICBMs to Kuba.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ja, ja. Ze point is, that zis reactor... it is not just a reactor. Ve tried to activate it with a jolt from the Engine Ignition System. It sucked in an apple and a pencil from the desk beside it. They were spewed out from a glowing blue bulge twenty-four minutes later, which promptly disappeared. Observe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe flicked a switch on the circuit-breaker lying on the desk to right. A small cube, also on the desk, presumably the reactor, exploded in a shower of blue sparks and miniature bolts of lightning, as the desk itself imploded into the core of the explosion. The walls of the chamber creaked, and bent inwards, and the explosion dissipated into thin air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher emerged, his hair and overcoat singed, from the blue aurora that remained. He smiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ja, you see? Ze desk, along vith the reactor, disappears, but vait. It shall return.

And eventually the President left to find himself a snack. Exactly twenty-four minutes later --\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u0022Oh mein Gott!\u0022 The wall on which the whiteboard stood flew apart, the debris nearly impacting one of the interns. The blue aurora convulsed and pulsed, and blue sparks bounced off the remaining walls as people ran for cover. The other walls exploded one by one, and the aurora grew bigger, and bigger, and bigger. The leg of a table emerged from it. And slowly another. And a small cube was spat out of the centre. Wernher hid under the bench, and the President\u0027s scientific advisor, Keinlen, was making a run for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E as soon as the first wall blew up. The top of the table emerged next, before the aurora collapsed, and the blue sparks and bolts of tiny lightning settled down and ceased. The table was cut in half, a fine line of molten steel marking where the tabletop had been. The stuff dripped onto the floor, and melted holes into the plumbing system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe President casually swung\u00A0open the door and swaggered in. \u0022What\u0027ve I missed?\u0022 he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n04:51\u00A0PM GMT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome construction workers carefully patched up the wrecked walls and roof with some plywood panels as Wernher continued his presentation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ze reason that zis reactor seems to eat up anything near it and then spit it out twenty-four minutes afterwards is simple. It is a temporal rift jumper. It --\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What does that mean, Wernher? It sounds like\u00A0a high-tech form of clothing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nien, nien, that\u0027s not vat I mean. It is a temporal rift jumper, it opens a temporal rift, jumps through it. Ve don\u0027t know why it comes back, but I believe that it is some outside interference. You zee, zis object ve found at ze North Pole, it is... how do I put zis... in a state of multiple ages. It is, according to the tests we have taken on it, twenty year sold on vun\u00A0side, two years old on another, and on other parts of it, it is ninety years old! Bits\u00A0of it are older than the object itself is. How can things be older than zemselves, ja!? It is strange, is it not. But zen ve delved deeper into the problem. And ve discovered something even more startling.\u00A0Ze apple that ve received from the first test, after ve dated it, it appeared that it vas three weeks old. But it vas only gone for twenty-four minutes, ja!? And ve have finally figured it out. Temporal sync.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ve know that the beings that created zeese objects are far more advanced than us. They had on object on ze Mun for more years than we can even remember! Remember zat we could not figure out how zeese craft propelled themselves, as there vas no visible engines? It is because the objects have no engines. At least, not conventional ones. They propel\u00A0themselves using temporal fractures. Here, let me explain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The universe where they live, it\u0027s no different to ours. They even live in the same solar system! But they live one second out of sync with the rest of the universe. One second in the past. They co-exist with us, but we never see them, and they never see us. They live in a kind of... pocket universe, as I would imagine that keeping an entire civilisation one second in the past compared to the rest of the universe would require immense amounts of energy. So, let\u0027s say, their pocket universe is only our solar system, the Kerbol system, copied and pasted one second in the past for them alone to live in. It would be a tiny universe. They would dictate the boundaries of their own universe. They would be their own... Gods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And to transport themselves between our universe, the sort-of... main one, and their pocket universe, a temporal fracture needs to be opened. A temporal fracture is, in essence, a small hole in the fabric of space-time. A kind of wormhole, one that is also not naturally occurring, but is also easy to fly through. You see, with real wormholes, in theory, their gravitational pull would take you towards their centre... and you\u0027d stay there for all eternity.\u0022 He waved his hand around in the air dismissively. \u0022It\u0027s complicated. But a temporal fracture bypasses this gravitational anomaly, because it has a gravity, but it\u0027s very different than that of a wormhole\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You see, the gravity of the temporal fracture sucks everything in for a small amount of time, and then spews everything out again later. Zis is because the fracture is unstable. As soon as it forms, it becomes so unstable that it instantly implodes, and then explodes, slightly reminiscent of a supernova...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe president slowly dozed off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...

Wernher gave him an annoyed look, and continued speaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As I was saying, we are planning to send an unmanned probe through a temporal fracture, and into this pocket universe, in an attempt to communicate with the inhabitants of it. But, in order to send it through, we need to stabilise the fracture. The probe we have designed is the smallest we can make it; a tiny rover, but it still isn\u0027t small enough to make it through the fracture before it explodes. So ve have to stabilise it for at least ten seconds. The fracture only stays open for three. We need a certain mineral to sustain it. That mineral is lidium. Much like uranium, it is highly radioactive, and is capable of creating immense amounts of power when refined. But it is only found on Duna. Yet is has certain traits that can sustain the fracture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cobalt-thorium-G also has the same traits, but I would not suggest using it, as it is highly dangerous.

Most of the lights were off; Walt had invited the staff to come watch a new movie, \u0027The 6-hours Kerbin Moved Around.\u0027 Only Wernher and a couple of interns had stayed behind. She heard the pitter-patter of paws inside one of the buildings, but ignored it. It was probably one of Jebediah\u0027s cats. The lights in the windows of the astronaut complex went out one by one, and not one explosion was to be seen.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EShe slid her ID across the scanner on the front of the doors to the complex\u0027s hub of operations, unoriginally named \u0027the Hub.\u0027 The doors slid open, and\u00A0Leake entered the building. She briskly walked down the bare corridor; there was no one around. All the lights were out, except for the \u0027night lights.\u0027 Basically just the dim red lights that are normally on during a power outage. Wernher insisted that they were the only lights on at R\u0026amp;D at night, as he had told many of the days when he struggled to fall asleep in his comfortable\u00A0office chair. People had yet to question why he was sleeping on the job in the first place.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe approached Wernher\u0027s thinking room. Originally occupied by Ludwig Kerman, the head rocket scientist before Wernher, it had become his workplace. Inside he had all manner of things; three blackboards, one large computer and calculator, a diagram of a wormhole and a rocket engine pasted on the wall, along with a poster containing Keinstein\u0027s field equations, a nice desk, a model of the Splat!ern V, the rocket that took the first Kerbals to the Mun, with an overlay of where the fuel was located, and a similar model of his \u0027Ferry Rocket,\u0027 something he had designed years before as part of an agreement with Disney-Kerman Motion Pictures Ltd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter verifying that there was no one in the room by peeking through the keyhole, Leake swung open the door and entered the room, nearly tripping over a bin full of old blueprints. Some pencil-sketches of the Ares-1 lay on Wernher\u0027s desk. She closed the door, and flicked on the lights. She hoped nobody would notice them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe carefully slid a small matchbox out of her pocket. But this was no ordinary matchbox. Oh no, this one had a button in the top, and a camera hidden inside. She pointed the box at one of the blackboards, a mess of unintelligible sentences and sticky notes with things like \u00271 sec --\u0026gt; them \u00A0 we = 1 sec \u0026lt;--\u0027 and \u0027\u003Cfont color=\u0022#222222\u0022\u003Etime = too slow - they are slow, we are fast!!! middle?!\u0027 on them, and clicked the button.

Leake cursed, and switched off the lights, hiding under the desk. But the sound of footsteps receded\u00A0towards the snack room, in the opposite direction from the \u0027thinking room.\u0027 She sighed, and quietly exited the room. Her shoes barely made any sound at all - the latest in stealth technology, delivered to her only a few days ago by parachute drop.

Leake and Deswin sat behind him, strapped into padded seats behind various control consoles and instruments. Clauena sat at the very back, next to the hatch, with nothing but an old Commodore-64 computer to entertain her. Jeb himself sat behind his command console, which had an array of navballs, levers, big red\u00A0buttons, and secret compartments filled with pirated copies of Pac-man.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe two multiplex-glass windows in front of Jeb gave him a nice view of Kerbin as the Sun set and the Mun rose. The horizon of Kerbin was a thin blue line - Jeb thought he could see Nye Island peeking out from behind it. The limited thrust of the \u0027Poodle\u0027 engine on the Ares meant that the transfer burn would take five minutes, with a small course correction along the way, but it sure was better than the proposals that used the NERVAs! Those engines would\u0027ve required multiple burns, perhaps four or five passes!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe acceleration of the \u0027Poodle\u0027 was barely above one-fifth of a G, enough for things to fall awkwardly backwards given a couple of minutes, but nowhere near enough to produce a proper artificial gravity. There were proposals that utilized centrifuges, but they were eventually ditched due to weight problems. The worst side effect of this mission to Duna, as speculated by some of Kerbin\u0027s most world-renowned scientists, would be the entire trip, which would last slightly over a year. The best case scenario - their muscles might be weaker than when they departed - worst case scenario - they wouldn\u0027t be able to cope with the force of re-entry, and their bones would shrink slightly.

He was flanked by his Vice President, Bob Kerman, and his Press Secretary, Arie Kerman. \u0022Sir,\u0022 she said, \u0022I would not advise this conference. Though I have not been to all of the meetings in the Council Room, I know that this will be a startling revelation for the public, and that a lot of them will lose trust in the government when they discover how long we\u0027ve been keeping this secret from them. Hell, I didn\u0027t even know about this!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know,\u0022 replied the Vice President. \u0022It\u0027s above your pay grade.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Above my pay grade my ass! This is exactly the kind of problem you get if you don\u0027t tell your Press Secretary anything about a state secret that could endanger the public and have disastrous effects if revealed too late. And you\u0027re revealing it too late! If you wan\u0027t my advice, keep it a secret. You should\u0027ve revealed it earlier!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey passed the doors leading to Jaysef\u0027s office, the red room, and the green room. Senators and other VIPs milled around the corridor like bees in a hive as they approached the door to the stage. \u0022Honestly, Arie,\u0022 said Jaysef, \u0022I don\u0027t care what you think. Because we only discovered the truth a fortnight ago, and my military and scientific advisors suggested against a press conference revealing the secret!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And who are your military and scientific advisors?\u0022 asked Arie. Jaysef sighed. \u0022Fut and Kramp Kerman.\u0022 The flag of the UTPKA flanked the entrance door to the stage, a large, polished mahogany door with an ornate silver handle. It was a stark contrast to the rest of the building, which was made of bomb-proof concrete painted white to look like marble. It used to be white marble, but the Kold War had kicked things up a notch, and all the government was worrying about was the safety of its President and other VIPs. The civilians were the last to get attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good luck,\u0022 said Arie, opening the door for the President. He entered the room, along with Bob, and approached the podium. The State Department auditorium was a spacious room, with an intricate lighting system on the roof which gave the feeling like you were standing in some kind of Sci-fi UFO. The seats were packed full of enthusiastic reporters, who were eager to begin interrogating the President. The flag of the UTPKA hung behind him, and a large TV camera pointed at him from the other side of the stage. Other various camera crews were stationed at the back of the room, attempting to get any kind of angle that would allow them to see anything at all. Jaysef cleared his throat, glaced at his notes, and began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe State Department auditorium:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JFKWHP-AR7370-B.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://archive2.jfklibrary.org/JFKWHP/1962/Month%2007/Day%2023/JFKWHP-1962-07-23-C/JFKWHP-AR7370-B.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ladies and Gentlemen, you may have noticed the increased activity of our space program, the KSA, over the last couple of weeks. A rapid expansion of the facility at Bluerock Peninsula, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, has begun, and has allowed for the launch of Ares-1, the first mission ever attempted to travel into interplanetary space. You may have also noticed the decresed military activity at our other bases, such as Round Range Air Force Base, and the increased military activity at KSA facilities. This is because of an unannounced merger between the military and the KSA.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd erupted in a cacophony of roars and shouts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Settle down please, settle down.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe room fell silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This merger is the product of a discovery made by our space agency\u0027s lunar exploration division, the MEAP. That stands for Munar Exploration Application Program. They discovered an unidentified object on the surface of the Mun one week ago, and, believing that it was a KSSR spacecraft, sent a Munar lander to investigate.\u0022 Not the full truth, but saying it was discovered a month and a half ago would hardly benefit the government when subjected to the uproar that would most definitely ensue after the conference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The lander confirmed that the object was not a KSSR spacecraft, and that it was not natural. Yet it seemed to resemble a spacecraft, and there are no other nations capable of space travel other than the KSSR and the UTPKA. Then we discovered a similar object at Kerbin\u0027s North Pole. Long story short, these objects are alien spacecraft, and these aliens live out of\u00A0synchronization with our universe. They live one second in the past, just where we can\u0027t find them. Except we can find them, and we can contact them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But to do so we need a certain mineral, called lidium, which is found only on Duna. And so we launched the Ares-1, its sole purpose to retrieve the mineral lidium from Duna and return it safely to Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd of reporters screamed a million questions at him, except for one, who sat patiently at the back with his hand up, staring dreamily at the wall behind Jaysef. \u0022Yes,\u0022 Jaysef said, pointing to him. The room fell silent once again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, uh,\u0022 stuttered the Kerbal, who had awoken from his trance. \u0022Umm, why d-did you keep all this a s-secret until n-now?\u0022 he asked rather quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good question,\u0022 replied Jaysef. \u0022We had believed it was a KSSR spacecraft all up until yesterday, when we discovered the truth. Because of this, we kept it a secret, thinking it was some advanced Soviet space technology. When we discovered that it was actually alien, we rushed to hold a press conference as soon as possible.\u0022 Jaysef smiled. Though he was still deceiving\u00A0the public, at least they knew the important parts of the truth. Bending it around a little to deflect criticism wouldn\u0027t do any harm...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSSR Territory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 153, 07:39 AM GMT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerlan Kerman was jolted awake by the vibration of the Koncordea as it decelerated from supersonic speeds with a thunderous boom. He glanced through his window, only to see Kuba approaching in the distance. The Koncordea was a miniature version of the Koncorde, a supersonic passenger aircraft developed by some obscure French aerospace developer. The KSSR military had promptly manufactured a smaller version, not to be put out of business by some small-time aircraft enthusiasts. These \u0027small time aircraft enthusiasts\u0027 turned out to be the C7 Aerospace Division, who threatened to sue if the Russians\u00A0didn\u0027t stop production. So the KSSR stopped selling\u00A0the Koncordea commercially. But the aircraft was useful enough to warrant continuation under a secret military project...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the President of the UTPKA announced the existence of aliens and their plot to make first kontakt, the KSSR was outraged, especially Gerlan, the Soviet Ambassador. When he heard the news, he announced on international television that, \u0022First kontakt is not an endeavour to be completed by a single nation, on that nation\u0027s soil! It should be an international endeavour, performed on international soil, with representatives of each and every country on Kerbin there! These \u0027aliens\u0027 must not see the world how any single nation sees it, but how the entire world sees it! And I will not rest until I know that when kontakt is made, that it shall not be solely made by the UTPKA, that these \u0027aliens\u0027 shall not see the rest of the world as the UTPKA sees it, a filthy place filled with poverty, death, and socialism, everywhere except the UTPKA, but how everyone sees it, a prosperous and safe haven for all!\u0022 He promptly ran out of breath and almost collapsed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mister Ambassador,\u0022 radioed the pilot through the intercom. \u0022We\u0027re approaching Kuba, we\u0027ll arrive in T-minus 1 minute. Be sure to keep your seatbelt on.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerlan fetched a cocktail from the minibar at the back of the cabin, sat back down, finished his cocktail, and strapped in. The airbrakes on the Koncordea\u0027s winds deployed, giving a deceleration force of about 2 Gs. Not the smoothest ride ever, but better than those aircraft he had flown back during his time in the air force; back during the Great War.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he stared through the window, he could see the island of Kuba; a small dirt runway with a derelict old air-traffic control tower and some empty hangars. At first glance, it was hard to believe that this was an extremely important and heavily fortified KSSR military complex. But then you notice certain things. Small things, like the strangely high-tech looking door buried in the side of a small mountain face; or the tiny bay doors scattered around the hillside, hidden by clumps of foliage,\u00A0that concealed ICBM silos. The landing gear of the aircraft deployed, and it descended towards the runway. It flared up just before touchdown, and the front wheel set down on the dirt track five seconds later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow,\u0022 thought Gerlan. \u0022That was the smoothest landing I\u0027ve ever experienced.\u0022 He passed on his comment to the pilot, who, to his surprise, replied saying; \u0022All of these Konkordea landings are automated, with only a little bit of manual control needed to set the plane on the correct course. That\u0027s the beauty of MechJeb, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerlan engaged in a bit of small talk with the pilot, whose name turned out to be a \u0027Valentina\u0027 Kerman, before one of the ground crew came aboard, breaking up their conversation and leading Gerlan outside, down the airstairs, and towards a smaller passenger aircraft. It was a \u0027Tri-33,\u0027 a modified version of the Tu-22 spyplane, with extra passenger space and more engines added. The perfect business jet for short-range trips. And another secret military project!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two aircraft pulled up beside each other:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022L51WPDo.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L51WPDo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerlan climbed aboard the Tri-33, strapping himself into his seat and waiting for the flight to begin. He had been invited by the President of the UTPKA to come to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, shortly after his speech revealing the existence of aliens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello, my name is Tetina Kerman, I will be your pilot for the next three minute flight to the Kerbal Space Centre. Please enjoy your flight. Snacks are not provided.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerlan chuckled softly. He found it slightly funny that the pilot had to announce the fact that no snacks were provided. It was only a three minute trip, after all! The Koncordea reversed into a different hangar as the Tri-33 slowly taxied out onto the runway. The engines roared as they throttled up, and the plane gently took-off from the dirt track,\u00A0just before it hit some very inconveniently-placed elevated landing lights. The flight over the Kerblantic ocean was very simple and quick, and the plane arrived at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway a whole fifty seconds behind schedule!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airstair truck pulled up outside the exit hatch, and a convoy of one police car and two limousines pulled up beside the airstair, lights flashing and flags waving. The flags in question were mounted on two antennae at the front of the two limousine\u0027s bonnets. A group of security guards clambered out of one limousine, and the President of the UTPKA, along with his Vice President, Gene Kerman, and Wernher Von Kerman, climbed casually out of the other. Gerlan exited the hatch after saying goodbye to Tetina, and descended the airstairs. He greeted Jaysef and Bob Kerman first, shaking their hands, before doing the same with Wernher and Gene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello Gerlan,\u0022 said Gene, \u0022How\u0027s Dimitri?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, Dimitri,\u0022 replied Gerlan. \u0022He\u0027s about as grumpy as ever. You know\u00A0how he feels. You guys landed on the Mun and Minmus, and have launched an expedition to land on Duna, and we have yet to do a Munar flyby! And then the news that you were about to make first kontakt broke out, and he\u0027s even more depressed. He even asked me to do his speech for him!

The console was a mishmash of \u002760s-era flip-switches and modern LCD screens. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/FRX-114 was a large, black box, with an array of buttons on the front, along with a small screen, and a tiny printer embedded in the bottom right corner. Jim himself was seated in a comfy padded seat, and to his left, in an identical seat, sat Ornie Kerman. They were both adorned in their UTPKA Air Force uniforms. The small screen on the Discriminator flashed the letters POE in red, indicating that a message had been received which contained the POE code prefix, today\u0027s prefix.\u00A0The screen changed to display the message: \u0027ETD-135-00000001.\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJim grabbed a red notebook marked \u0027Communications Codes,\u0027 which was laying on a small ledge jutting out from the console. He jotted down the message on\u00A0a piece of scrap paper inside the notebook, then flipped through the pages to find the right codes. \u0022Let\u0027s see...\u0022 he said, searching each page delicately. \u0022Echo, Tango, Delta... 1,3... 5.

He typed in the launch codes, \u002700000001,\u0027 and each number appeared on his LCD screen. \u0022Keys ready?\u0022 asked Ornie, fishing two keys out of his pocket. Jim did the same, and nodded. They flipped open the safeties for the launch sequence, and flicked the switches that begun the countdown. \u002215, 14, 13, 12, 11...\u0022 They both flipped open strong metal covers, revealing four keyholes. They inserted their keys, and waited. \u00228, 7, 6, 5..\u0022 \u0022Turn in 4, 3, 2, 1...\u0022 said Ornie. They both turned their keys as the countdown hit zero, and the LCD screen changed to display the insides of the missile silos.The rockets were spewing clouds of smoke and trails of fire as the doors slid open and the launch clamps released. The missiles rocketed into the bright morning sky, like they were about to crash into the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Simulation complete,\u0022 called a woman over the PA system. \u0022That was tense,\u0022 laughed Jim as the huge, fourteen-inch thick steel door of the ICBM Launch Control Simulator swung open. \u0022You seemed to treat it like it was the real thing.\u0022 \u0022Well,\u0022 replied Ornie, \u0022You should always do. You never know when the Ruskies might attack...\u0022 But Jim could see the start of a smile at the edges of his mouth. The pair of friends strolled out of the hangar in which the simulator was situated, and out onto the vast expanse of Round Range Air Force Base. A large rocket stood on the base\u0027s solitary launchpad, with multiple umbilical pipes connected to the fuel tanks. A huge crew access tower connected to the crew capsule of the rocket, and an small bus approached it, carrying two astronauts towards the brand-new Altair VTOVL Rocket. \u0022Come on,\u0022 called Ornie, rushing towards one of the buildings. \u0022You\u0027re gonna miss the launch!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRound Range Air Force Base:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NqB73Rg.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NqB73Rg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n09:35 AM GMT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHerbal Kerman sat at his desk at the Flight Control Centre at the Round Range Air Force Base.

Their consoles blinked and flashed with array of different lights as the ignition sequence began. Doodbret had the throttle open to maximum, and Munfred kept his eyes trained on the navigational instruments on his side of the console. The multiplex windows at the front of the capsule gave a great view of the launch site, and the voice of Herbal boomed over the radio. \u0022...umbilical detach in 3, 2, 1, zero.\u0022 The two huge arms that pumped both liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen respectively into the rocket ceased pumping, disconnected from their slots in the rocket with a clang, and swung out of the way as zero approached. \u0022...T-minus 3, 2, 1...\u0022 chimed CAPCOM. \u0022Launch clamps released, \u0022 called FLIGHT. The four huge, red clamps swung backwards, away from the rocket, as a trail of flame and smoke billowed from its rear. \u0022Liftoff, we have a liftoff!\u0022 The force of the acceleration stretched Munfred to his very limit, the speed crushing him into his seat like a tin can. And Dootbret wasn\u0027t doing any better. The force of lift-off was almost tearing them limb-from-limb. This\u00A0was nothing like the simulators.

The timer was ticking down towards the time until maneuver node. Dootbret had his hand resting on the throttle, his other hand resting on the joystick that controlled pitch, yaw, and roll. Munfred\u0027s console had an array of flip-switches, which locked and unlocked things such a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and kOS. He also had a large screen in the middle, which displayed two different views of Kerbin; one was a view from the poles, and the other was an equatorial view. Each had an overlay of their current trajectory, what trajectory they\u0027d have after maneuver completion, and small tags displaying what the Altair\u0027s apoapsis and periapsis were.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T-minus 7 seconds and counting,\u0022 announced FLIGHT. \u00226, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1..\u0022 Dootbret rammed the throttle forward, and the acceleration, once again, forced them into their seats, crushing their lungs as they sank deeper and deeper into the padded material of their seats. \u0022Cutoff T-minus 30 seconds and counting.\u0022 The burn only took thirty seconds to complete, thanks to the extreme amounts of thrust provided by the four \u0027Vector\u0027 engines on the first,\u00A0and only stage, of the Altair VTOVL Rocket \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUTPKA Territory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11:39 AM GMT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJaysef lead Gerlan down the corridor, towards the UTPKA Military Council Room. Gene, Wernher, and Bob Kerman followed. \u0022So, this is where you hold your meetings,\u0022 inquired Gerlan, \u0022That you don\u0027t want to be public?\u0022 \u0022Well,\u0022 replied Jaysef, \u0022In a manner of speaking, yes. But we\u0027ve converted it into a kind of a... discussion room, where all the heads of various government organisations meet up, in the case of either an emergency or something else of national importance, and discuss it. But we\u0027ve invited the Presidents and/or Prime Ministers of the other countries on Kerbin to this meeting, to discuss the matter of first kontakt.\u0022 The doors to the council room swung open with a hiss, and all four of them entered the room. The seats were packed with the leaders of multiple countries, and only five were empty, conveniently situated directly next to each other. \u0022Please be seated,\u0022 said Jaysef, and all five of them sat down in their assorted seats. \u0022Welcome everyone,\u0022 said Jaysef, \u0022to the UTPKA Military Council Room. Today, we shall not use it as a Military Council Room, but as an impromptu conference room to discuss the conditions of first kontakt, such as where is shall be held, and who shall be there, etc. The council is now in session.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe room, filled to the brim with representatives from many different countries:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gettyimages-3168501-1457710919.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022466\u0022 src=\u0022https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/cropped/gettyimages-3168501-1457710919.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach representative had their own translator sitting to the left of them. \u0022I think that we can all agree,\u0022 started Jaysef, \u0022That first kontakt shall be held on international soil. So I suggest a large ship, such as an aircraft carrier, or an offshore platform, such as an oil rig - though I can safely assume that we shall not use an actual, operational oil rig, but rather a simple platform, with no drilling equipment. However, I\u0027m told that\u00A0some kind of fledgeling new private space agency uses offshore platforms to land reusable booster rockets - I think they were called SpandX, or something along the lines of that. But, back to the point, we need to decide which country supplies the ship, and what representatives shall be there --\u0022 It was then that Wernher Stood up and exclaimed: \u0022Nien, nien! Ve cannot conduct first kontakt on a ship! It must be conducted at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But Wernher,\u0022 said the President, \u0022We can\u0027t do that either. First kontakt is an international endeavour, and it cannot be conducted on sovereign soil.\u0022 \u0022Ja, ja, I know this, but it cannot happen. Ve have already prepared all the necessary facilities at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to handle the reactor and the mineral, \u0027lidium,\u0027 which are both extremely dangerous. I fear that ve vill not have the necessary facilities aboard this ship to handle an emergency with either of these items. If ze reactor overheats, for example, it shall cause an atomic explosion. On a ship, there is no escape - the explosion will engulf it in a mushroom cloud - but at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, we have vaults and bunkers that can filter radiation out of the air to have a clean air supply - \u00A0these bunkers also have five months worth of emergency rations and water for five-hundred people - the number of people working at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, with fifty more person\u0027s worth of supplies for the representatives of each county - and these bunkers have tunnels, that go right through the mountain ranges west of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and emerge almost halfway across the continent - far enough away that the radiation from the blast von\u0027t be harmful - and all the occupants of the bunker can be collected by emergency services or the military or air force.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I have to admit,\u0022 said the French ambassador, \u0022That your proposal is extremely logical. And though I do not like the fact that first kontakt shall be held at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, I believe it is an acceptable sacrifice for the safety your facility offers.\u0022 \u0022I agree,\u0022 said both the German and Italian ambassadors simultaneously. \u0022And so do I,\u0022 said Gerlan. \u0022Though I do have some conditions\u00A0that I think everyone here shall agree to. I believe that Bluerock Peninsula, the area in Kafrica Province that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is located at, should be made international soil. It shall become its own \u0027mini-country,\u0027 with its own police force and other emergency services. My belief, though, is that there shall be no discrimination among anyone entering or exiting this new \u0027mini-country\u0027 - than any Kerbal of any nationality, no matter what their religion is, whether they have a visa or not, they should be allowed to enter and exit. Only a passport would be required. It would be a neutral country, free from the reign of the UTPKA, with it\u0027s own government. Who agrees with me?\u0022 \u0022I believe that this is a good idea,\u0022 said the representative of Switzerland. \u0022So do I,\u0022 said the Kritish ambassador. One-by-one, each country fell in line, agreeing with each other. Finally, the President of the UTPKA, Jaysef Kerman, concluded by saying: \u0022The conversion of Bluerock Peninsula to become a neutral, free country is, I believe, the best way to handle this situation.\u0022 \u0022Can it even be done?\u0022 whispered Gene. \u0022It can be arranged,\u0022 replied Bob. The President cleared his throat. \u0022As for the people that are present when first kontakt is made, I believe that all of us have agreed upon one representative that shall be present, yes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sounds of \u0027Yes,\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 \u0027Certainly,\u0027 and \u0027Correct\u0027 filled the room. \u0022Good,\u0022 continued the President. \u0022Then an agreement has been made. The council is now over. Please leave the room in an orderly fashion, and make your way to the car park, where I presume your chauffeurs are waiting to take you to your private jets and back to your home countries. Thank you for your time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11:49 AM GMT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMunfred Kerman pulled on his suit gloves, secured his helmet in place, and hooked up the umbilical cord to is helmet. It pumped a fresh supply of oxygen into his mouth, and filtered out the carbon dioxide. He locked the umbilical in place, and punched in a code into the keypad embedded in the wall of the airlock. The atmosphere was sucked out of the chamber via small ventilators, and the pressure equalised with the open vacuum outside. He punched in a different code into a similar keypad on the hatch itself, and the door slowly swung open, making no sound at all. \u0022CAPCOM, this is Altair-1, hatch is opened, preparing for EVA, over.\u0022 \u0022Copy that Altair-1, EECOM reports all suit systems are functioning nominally, oxygen consumption is normal, over.\u0022 \u0022Copy that, FLIGHT.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMunfred stepped out into the black void of space. The KSA had a big enough budget to be able to afford such luxuries as a separate pack with all the life support supplies and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E built in; the \u0027Pegasus\u0027 was a UTPKA Air Force project, separate from the KSA - their EVA suits had to have umbilical cords and crude, hand held Kerbonaut Maneuvering Units. He pushed off the exterior hull of the airlock in the direction of solar array SA-D. His Kerbonaut Maneuvering Unit, the KMU, he held in his left hand, and in his right, he held a small screwdriver he had removed from the emergency tool box in the habitat module beforehand. He pressed some buttons on the KMU, and some small puffs of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E smoke filled the space around him as he drifted closer to the solar panels. He slowed down with a few more puffs, and stopped outside solar panel SA-D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022CAPCOM, I\u0027m at the solar array.

The casing was half-open, the solar panel attempting to extend into the case. Munfred wrenched the case open, and it popped out of its socket, the solar panel pushing it away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oops,\u0022 He said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Altair, this is EECOM, you\u0027ll have a tougher re-entry than usual, what with the broken casing, and the air rushing into the open gap, but, if all goes well, you should be okay. Just be more careful next time, over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMunfred giggled, and started back in the direction of the hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMunfred during his EVA:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Aj1JGAq.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Aj1JGAq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-11T18:42:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2017 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by NISSKEPCSIM\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kraden","CreatedById":165322,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-03T21:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLOL \u0022SpandX\u0022.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
