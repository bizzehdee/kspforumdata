Sorry guys, I didn\u0027t realize my thread had become active again! Thanks to everyone who has been working to keep these configurations alive. I\u0027ve been on a hiatus, Pokemon X \u0026amp; Y, Bayonetta, Hyrule Warriors, Sui Generis, Wasteland 2, Divinity: Original Sin, etc, etc, etc ... but the big reason why I haven\u0027t updated my configs is that honestly I just don\u0027t really like the new monitors. I\u0027m around, and I still play KSP at least weekly but I skipped the 0.24 release, contracts just didn\u0027t shake up the core game enough, so I\u0027m working back to IVA. I should clear up that I\u0027m not providing support for the old configurations because I don\u0027t know what it would take to get them working, and they need more than just a band-aid so they are provided as-is. I pretty much have to write new ones from scratch to get things working with the new monitors, and I\u0027m not sure when I\u0027ll be able to do that.\u003Cp\u003EIt does feel a bit like a kick in the ass though, I didn\u0027t mean to let the IVA crowd down!

Sorry guys, I didn\u0027t realize my thread had become active again! Thanks to everyone who has been working to keep these configurations alive. I\u0027ve been on a hiatus, Pokemon X \u0026amp; Y, Bayonetta, Hyrule Warriors, Sui Generis, Wasteland 2, Divinity: Original Sin, etc, etc, etc ... but the big reason why I haven\u0027t updated my configs is that honestly I just don\u0027t really like the new monitors. I\u0027m around, and I still play KSP at least weekly but I skipped the 0.24 release, contracts just didn\u0027t shake up the core game enough, so I\u0027m working back to IVA. I should clear up that I\u0027m not providing support for the old configurations because I don\u0027t know what it would take to get them working, and they need more than just a band-aid so they are provided as-is. I pretty much have to write new ones from scratch to get things working with the new monitors, and I\u0027m not sure when I\u0027ll be able to do that.\u003Cp\u003EIt does feel a bit like a kick in the ass though, I didn\u0027t mean to let the IVA crowd down! I\u0027ll see what I can get done for you guys though, IVA deserves a proper interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TaintedLion","CreatedById":137942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T23:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat are you going to do about the IVAs in your KSA series?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T06:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot sure what you mean, specifically.
