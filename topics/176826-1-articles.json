Turn in stability assist to stabilize the rocket. If using dummy payload didn\u0027t work, use structural beam as a frame and attach 2 rovers side by side by using symmetry mode. That way, 2 rovers on each side balances the rocket. The 2 side by side rocket/ payload is useful for asymmetrical payload\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, if the rover core is YOUR MAIN CORE, then that\u0027s the problem. My usual setup is, the rover core is the secondary core, while rocket core is the main core. Build the rocket first, with drone core as the first part, then attach the rover with the drone core as the payload. That way, your control reference is from the rocket, not the rover. As long as the rover has a drone core, it\u0027ll be controllable once it\u0027s separated from the rocket\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-18T11:23:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2018 11:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-18T13:30:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of reaction wheel, I\u0027d add two pairs of\u00A0steerable fins at the bottom of your boosters (45 degrees off the line of symmetry).
