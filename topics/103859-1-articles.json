New to the game and newer to the forum.\n\nSo I wanted to drop a rover in from high altitude near the north pole, and because of ships/debris disappearing after 2.5km it was hard at first, then I downloaded the Lazor System mod and increased it up to 22km. Things just got a lot easier, dropped the rover, got a perfect touch down, then landed the jet,recovered the jet. Everything was awesome, just untill the moment when I wanted to return to the rover, just to find out it was missing, with Bob Kerman inside it. He was listed Missing in Action, and I thought if I deleted him from the lost section in the building with all the kerbanauts he\u0027d respawn, so I clicked the RED X next to me(I know, I know). So now he\u0027s nowhere to be found. Waited for around a month of ingame time, 2 days of real time that maybe he\u0027d respawn, but nothing. Wanted to edit the persistent file today, just to find out he\u0027s not in it. Probably because of clicking the RED X, I know, but still, is there any way I can bring him back to my game?\n\nThanks for the replies in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T19:34:18Z","Content":"You could start a new save them open that persistent.sfs and copy paste Bob from the new one to the old."},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T19:36:11Z","Content":"Two options: 1) copy an existing hired kerbal and change their name to Bob Kerman.
