If you don\u0027t want to play with all of them, simply delete the components you don\u0027t want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since playing Better than Starting Manned, I\u0027ve been annoyed that barometers ceased to function entirely outside atmospheres, making them entirely useless for getting science from airless bodies. The thing is, reading 0 pressure is still a perfectly valid science point. How else would you know that a body is airless? Also, it seemed kind of silly that there is no equivalent to crew reports for probes, so I (likely along with many other players) ended up slapping a thermometer on a satellite just to be able to do the science from space contracts. Realistically, a lot of information can be gained simply from a spacecraft\u0027s telemetry, and I\u0027ve seen a few other mods implement a telemetry style experiment, but they either had other dependencies or added other things I didn\u0027t really want so I figured I would create a very simple one that only requires module manager. The latest update also includes a modified Communotron 16 to represent a drill that can take surface samples so you don\u0027t have to always send kerbals, I always thought it was silly that kerbals couldn\u0027t build probes that could see what the surface of a planet is made of when we have several rovers on Mars that are perfectly capable of doing that. Again, this type of experiment is represented in other mods but not in a simple, stock-friendly way (at least that I\u0027ve seen). I\u0027ve also integrated Capt Robau\u0027s microgravity experiment as suggested by Free Thinker to make the hitchhiker more useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of 1.0, the barometer file is obsolete but it still works if you happen to like my implementation better than stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECredits: FlowerChild for the initial concept for the barometer as seen in BTSM, CrowdSourcedScience for a MM template file that I completely rewrote, Squad for some of the science messages.
