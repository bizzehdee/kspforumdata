I would put my satellite in to roughly the same height orbit as the Mun is from Kerbin, but leaving it small enough on side that my satellite catches up to the Mun. Once it is at the distance I require, I would then fully circularise the orbit so that it is no longer catching up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T19:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you are proposing is impossible to sustain in the long term.

Just set up your burn up to rise up to an apex that just kisses the Mun\u0027s orbit ring such that when you target the Mun, your marker is behind the Mun\u0027s marker by the desired distance. Then when you reach that apex, use the \u0022TARGET\u0022 option on the navball and burn retrograde until you hit 0 m/s. That should round your orbit to match the Mun\u0027s rather closely, then use the map view to carefully nudge it a bit and correct it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
