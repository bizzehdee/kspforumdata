The Fairing is only one piece, so I don\u0027t need the Fairing module itself at all, I hope. So I have just copied the ModuleCargoBay Module from the Stock Size 2 Fairing and inserted it into my part cfg. However, it is, of course, as everytime if you just copy stuff from other configs, not working, or not correctly. And I have no idea what those things mean, so I just opened a thread here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = ModuleCargoBay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E DeployModuleIndex = 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E closedPosition = 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E lookupRadius = 2.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E // nodeOuterAftID = bottom\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E // nodeInnerAftID = top\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do I use DeployModuleIndex, closedPosition and lookupRadius for? I believe the lookupRadius is how big the area which should be phisically covered by the Fairing is, but if I turn it up, it should, at last if I think now correctly, also cover the tank under it, which is not what I want to happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould somebody help me there? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDeployModuleIndex is the index of the animation module that opens your cargo bay.
