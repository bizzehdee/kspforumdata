Well, kinda. I think it\u0027d be very cool to have a mobile app where you build rockets all 2d-like...or even basically just import the 3d VAB/SPH to mobile devices with only the ability to build and save crafts. Then import the craft files over to your KSP save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I think that type of thing should be considered when at least career mode is done, preferably after the game\u0027s fully released and not all super alpha time ;P\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"longbyte1","CreatedById":17521,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T16:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople want to play a game on an iPad, not just build a rocket on it. If you tell them that you have to play the game on PC, not many people will install the app, and making the app will have been a waste of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T17:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, but mobile devices can\u0027t possibly hope to run the game, unless either mobile devices see a sudden leap in performance and processing power or ksp suddenly becomes ultra zen when it comes to physics calculations and optimization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, people tend to like mobile apps that tie into an actual game they play on an actual gaming device(in this case, the PC). I bet even if they just made the kerbalizer a mobile app, it\u0027d probably get a lot of hits. Then again, you can already do the kerbalizer via mobile devices, can\u0027t you? I wouldn\u0027t really know \u0027cause I don\u0027t have one, but couldn\u0027t you just load the website and open up the kerbalizer? Still, seeing it in the app store might introduce a lot of people to the heap of silly madness that is KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut like I was sayin\u0027 originally, I feel that people would really appreciate an app where you could build or modify your .craft files by using a simplified VAB/SPH on a mobile device. I just also happen to feel that it shouldn\u0027t be any kind of focus for the dev team for a loooooong time, if they ever even want to bother with something frivolous like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shuttle099","CreatedById":10727,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T00:43:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible since someone could make a app that generates the craft file from what you make.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IvanTehFennec","CreatedById":26927,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T01:50:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shuttle099\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shuttle099\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt is possible since someone could make a app that generates the craft file from what you make.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then you\u0027d have to load the parts into RAM for usage on the app, along with any editor scenes, etc. That\u0027s at the bare minimum 500MB of RAM, and even the newest iPhone has only 1GB of RAM.
