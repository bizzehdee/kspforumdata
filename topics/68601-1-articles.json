The next day I came back and wanted to take a look at the ship again, so I opened the Tracking Center, clicked the ship\u0027s icon in orbit and resumed the flight. Not 3 seconds in, the ship proceeds spin violently and tear itself apart, sending bits and pieces of it flying outwards in all directions. The module that I had put up was one with a lot of solar panels on it, so everything was just absolutely shredded. I ended up having to exit the flight via the space station and terminate it because there was no way to reload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried sending up the same ship multiple times since that first occurrence, and every single time...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is structurally sound, and it made it into orbit without any problems whatsoever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also terminate all debris after every few flights, so there\u0027s no way it could have hit debris in its orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody else experienced this?
