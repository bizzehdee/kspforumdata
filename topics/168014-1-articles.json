Made in USA and overengineered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy criticality you mean pulse subcriticality, allow the material to approach the prompt critical limit for a few seconds every hour just enough to create isotopes for heat generation. Again if you use a layered thermocouple design you would never get more than 30% of the heat energy from the reactor, the rest is waste. So as the units power output drops so that 70% of output \u0026lt; Wattage of radiant energy release at the desired radiator temperature you would pulse the reactor briefly and then let it idle. You never want a dry reactor to approach criticality, most of the metals have very low heat retention capability and will rapidly heat to disintegration temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to know more about Uranium styled reactors you need to read up on the Russian designs, they are the leading experts on these types of reactors in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlutonium is very dangerous to work with, period, it can be rendered safe, but the biggest problem is that someone needs to work with really dangerous materials to get it into the safe state. I used to be a safety officer and we worked with more dangerous materials, suffice it to say whatever you can\u0027t imagine that might go wrong has the unfortunate problem of being the thing that happens.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the basic problem. We tend to think of cooling as something that has to be done to keep reactor cool. Cooling of a reactor is equivalent in function to turbocharging a rocket engine. The reason for this is that power is generated along the temperature potentials. If we removed steam from the equation then the best method of heat transfer and work generation is lost. So that cooling moves power from the reactor and to the surfaces that can generate power. If we remove all cooling you drop the output capacity of Uranium based reactors by magnitudes. The only thing that really limits the ability to produce more power in a fission electric steam generation system is that as you increase cooling capacity and thus power production your reactor coil inches closer and closer to prompt criticality and your margin of safety begins to disappear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs per chernobyl the single moment that caused everything to \u0027uncontrolled\u0027 was the building up of resident steam on the uranium pellets. IOW parts of the reactor could not get rid of steam fast enough. In water steam conversion steam always builds to a point and is released and so heat flow needs to stay below the point were steam becomes static.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
