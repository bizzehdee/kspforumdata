I\u0027ve always thought that it should be a feature and thought I\u0027d hunt for other people commenting before starting a new thread.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA real space agency simulates and models their craft extensively before sending them on missions. In KSP we often test our craft by rolling out our actual craft, then warping to an orbital position or a surface coordinate of our destination body. After we\u0027ve tested half a dozen times like this, somehow the mission actually feels anti-climactic. Plus it\u0027s an inefficient way of testing your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like a \u0022consequence-free\u0022 environment where you can submit bits of your craft for testing as if in a simulator. Access to the environment would be via the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. You would configure your \u0022launch assembly\u0022 as per normal and, instead of sending to a runway or a launch pad, you\u0027d send it to a simulator. The simulator would be a single-planet environment. The planet would be bare and featureless most likely, certainly monochrome with no surface scatter, and some cool graphics could suggest it\u0027s a simulation. Basically, it shouldn\u0027t feel like a destination in itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would configure its physical properties on entry.\u003Cstrong\u003E Perhaps, if you\u0027d been to and scanned a given planet with a probe, perhaps gone through the atmosphere and landed with scientific instruments, you could auto-configure to simulate a real planet\u0027s physical properties (atmosphere, gravity, axial tilt etc.). This would encourage exploration and science.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0You would then select your preferred situation - stable orbit or landed being the most two common options, to allow you to test entry to or ascent from an unexplored body. You could select various other \u0022cheat\u0022 options guilt-free too, perhaps infinite fuel/unbreakable joints/disable KerbNet etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf people like this option, Like the post at the top and comment to keep it at the top of the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stewcooker","CreatedById":229357,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-09T17:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is one of those ideas I didn\u0027t know I wanted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re very right with the fact that sometimes the actual mission can feel anti-climatic after simming it a half-dozen times.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also love the ideas about needing scans or science from different planets to make it work.
