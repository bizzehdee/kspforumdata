I am wondering, could it go to other planets such as Eve, given I still have 2 stages attached, one of which has 1/4 fuel left and the other is full. For thos of you that have used the N-1, Block G is 1/4 full and Block D is full.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T18:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes this thing have a docking port so you can add fuel or are you stuck with what you\u0027ve got?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing needed to get to any other planet is sufficient fuel to generate the necessary delta-V with whatever engine you\u0027re using. Then you\u0027ll need some more fuel to get captured there, and some more to get back home again if you want to. But anything with an engine and sufficient fuel can go anywhere. Check out the Delta-V Map on the Wiki to see how much delta-V you need for a given destination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T18:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure exactly what dV that is but I think Duna is doable.
