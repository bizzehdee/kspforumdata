So, since it uses old ASAS logic it is still wobbly and wastes RCS. Unless it was updated by author. The new ASAS logic would work great on space shuttle, since it works like fly-by-wire on spaceplane - it helps with stability instead of locking the attitude (or rather - it keeps attitude unless pilot changes it). It would allow aerodynamically unstable CoM position, which is necessary to allow maintaining attitude at reentry, without making it impossible to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETSAS is an outdated addon and old ASAS was useless, I never used it bc it tore my planes apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso SAS isn\u0027t system that deals with trust imbalance, it\u0027s the job of compensator plugin, which is AFAIK a bit broken in 0.20\u002B, that\u0027s why it doesn\u0027t respond fast enough.

No, not east, I\u0027m not suggesting eliminating roll program. Note that at liftoff shuttle drifts downward relative to the shuttle (in the direction of ET). That\u0027s because resultant thrust vector points there. If you set it ET-east on launchpad, you will get horizontal velocity pointing east right at the liftoff, so that after doing 180* roll you will fly in correct direction. If you leave the deffault VAB orientation, the shuttle will drift north before roll program, and you\u0027ll need to cancel that. If you turn it in VAB it will drift east instead - and that\u0027s when you want it to go. Besides IRL shuttle rolls much more than 90*, close to 180* IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also try starting gravity turn already at 0 km, right after liftoff and roll program (this would prevent drifting west after roll program) and ending it as soon as at 45-50km. If your vertical velocity starts to approach 0, do the roll-upright. If it does it to early, use OMS assist next time (after SRB seperation engage OMS engines and disengage them before roll-upright using action groups). IRL Shuttles used agressive gravity turn as well, they even had negeative vertical velocity at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso remember to disable TSAS before launching, that\u0027s why I suggest switching to new ASAS - MJ recognizes TSAS as regular SAS and it will try to kill you by enabling ASAS to prevent itself from performing the correct gravity turn \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-04T13:54:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2013 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by m4ti140\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MDBenson","CreatedById":65560,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T13:53:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s precisely because the new SAS logic doesn\u0027t lock the attitude of the craft that means it can\u0027t cope with ascent. Remember, the Shuttle is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E a plane on ascent (for the large part), it\u0027s a rocket. The new SAS might work on the way down real well (*makes a mental note to try that*) but it does not work on the way up the way the TSAS or MechJeb do (by doing aggressive attitude holding by using the engine gimbal). The ascent profile of the Shuttle stack is computer controlled and maintained, it\u0027s not flown by hand, thus it\u0027s subjected to attitude holding by the flight computer, only the Shuttle flight computer makes small changes gently to keep it on course, whereas TSAS and the old ASAS aggressively adjust it constantly. The biggest issue I can see with the TSAS/old ASAS is it tends to over-adjust and ends up flapping at the problem and building up resonance, rather than making micro-adjustments to maintain attitude steadily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4ti140","CreatedById":67296,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T14:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with TSAS/old ASAS is that it requires turning off and on to change attitude, which is annoying if you don\u0027t use MJ. And if you use MJ, there is a serious issue with TSAS that seems to have went unnoticed - Mechjeb doesn\u0027t recognize it as ASAS, and keeps it on all the time. If you don\u0027t disable TSAS using right click menu before launch, the shuttle will go straight up until SRB separation, messing up whole ascent, no matter how agressive gravity turn you set. IRL SRBs are separated when shuttle goes almost horizontal - otherwise gravity losses would be horrible because SSME has relatively low TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny thing is that MJ performs best without any ASAS unit installed, with its own input only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I\u0027m gonna try finding the most realistic launch sequence for this shuttle and post it here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: As of going way down - old asas kept constant attitude in global refference frame instead of LV/LH.

Whichever one you use though, if CoM isn\u0027t almost at CoL (or even behind), it won\u0027t keep attitude (actually attitude is on reentry is adjusted using CoM shift IRL), it will pitch back to 0 AoA, but it also won\u0027t be controllable on final - unless you drop fuel, which will turn you into a leaf if you drop more than 3/4 of tank (unless you use FAR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to suggest some change to the mod - besides a probe pointed at OMS thrust vector - is shifting the whole COM backwards and adding monopropelant tank to the nose - that\u0027s how it is done IRL. Before EI nose tank is emptied to shift COM to the position required for 40* AoA (which shuttle kept during entire reentry, using bank to change sink rate). Now with a bit more gentle fuel drop part and TAC fuel balancer one would be able to adjust CoM before reentry (and after reentry drop the rest of fuel to shift CoM back forwards, to get controll).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-04T14:40:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2013 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by m4ti140\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ssg","CreatedById":78195,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T00:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Budgie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Budgie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lRppHcZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lRppHcZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, gents, for a stunning mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know what would complete this mod?
