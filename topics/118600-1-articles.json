Theory is correct, but conclusion is flawed. Mounting the wings with a slight angle will provide additional stability, but the airflow is still predominantly moving from front to back of the airfoil (re-entry is normally pretty fast). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stability of the dihedral is derived from opposing forces. That is, they are providing a force (lift) against each other, cancelling each other out and providing stability at the cost of some lift overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you held a 1 kg bar in your open hands and stretched your arms straight out, you probably could keep it relatively stable. your arms are acting in opposition to gravity and can achieve equilibrium by providing a constant force against it. Now introduce some other elements such as doing this while walking down the sidewalk on a windy day. The static situation has turned dynamic, all sorts of other forces are working on that bar now and it may prove difficult to keep level. If you closed your hands around the bar now and added slight pressure inward, towards the other hand, you would find that it is easier to hold the bar level. Some of your strength is devoted horizontally, so you wouldn\u0027t be able to lift quite as much, but you would be able to exert more control over the object in question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo further this thought, would mounting the wings with an anhedral angle also give the same benefit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T13:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use both anhedral and dihedral in this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://sketchfab.com/models/4047b723101a422694f88642d7a7d73f\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emicro shuttle\u003C/a\u003E design to provide stability - such that it is possible to fly a batteries out, no SAS re-entry.

Put the wings at the top of the fuselage, such as with the Hawker Harrier and, to get the lower stability of a fighter aircraft, you need anhedral, the opposite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it doesn\u0027t do a lot for the early stages of reentry. You will see more drag from the SAS set to radial rather than prograde, and the more speed you can lose over 50km altitude the better, but you won\u0027t see much from the stability boost of dihedral. There\u0027s just not enough air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SAS system can cover up a lot of weaknesses in a design, and this roll stability is one of them. And it needs a lot of dihedral to get a significant loss of total lift. But it needs a lot less lift to roll the plane than to stop it falling out of the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit of a simplification but a 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 dihedral will lose less than 1% of total lift, and for small changes, drag is proportional to lift. But the control surfaces roll the plane by generating lift. So a small dihedral is going to make a very small difference. What can matter more is the pitch control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a conventional layout the centre of mass is in front of the centre of lift, and the pitch control, the tailplane is at the back. So, to keep the plane in balance, the tail has to be pushed down. Which means more total weight needing more lift and creating more drag. Canard foreplanes get the same effect by lifting the nose, which means less lift needed for the same weight, and so less drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes it matter? You can make more of a mess by flying the wrong ascent profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T14:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo to sum this up: Not worth messing with dihedral on conventional SSTOs like this one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HXRH7HC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HXRH7HC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T15:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eveeltch,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u0027s a little complicated...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding dihedral doesn\u0027t automatically add roll stability.
