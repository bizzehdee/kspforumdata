This allows the core stage to save propellants since Angara is not equipped with a propellant crossfeed (to be implemented as part of the evolution of the launcher family). At the point of booster separation at T\u002B214 seconds, the Core Stage throttles its RD-191 up to full thrust to continue to burn until five minutes and two seconds into the flight using the propellants saved during the booster stage of the mission.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI can\u0027t really do this through thrust tweaking because Realism Overhaul/Real Fuels doesn\u0027t allow you to change thrust percentage in flight.\u003Cp\u003ETIA\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T21:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38069\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDavon Throttle Control\u003C/a\u003E.
