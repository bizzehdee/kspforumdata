This allows the core stage to save propellants since Angara is not equipped with a propellant crossfeed (to be implemented as part of the evolution of the launcher family). At the point of booster separation at T\u002B214 seconds, the Core Stage throttles its RD-191 up to full thrust to continue to burn until five minutes and two seconds into the flight using the propellants saved during the booster stage of the mission.\n\nI can\u0027t really do this through thrust tweaking because Realism Overhaul/Real Fuels doesn\u0027t allow you to change thrust percentage in flight.\nTIA"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T21:23:46Z","Content":"[Davon Throttle Control](forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38069).
