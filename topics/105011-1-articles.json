Ore density is locked to the biome, and is randomly generated from a minimum and maximum values upon starting a new game. This means you can have an ore rich game or a more ore deprived game with no real indication until you try. The only thing you can influence is a slider that will determine how far one way or the other the ore will generate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T09:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh! Thanks for that. A connection would be cool, but I like the random distribution for each new game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
