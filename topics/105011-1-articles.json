Do the anomaly locations coincide with denser ore deposits?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dakota2063","CreatedById":127687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T09:16:36Z","Content":"No, but that would have been cool. Ore density is locked to the biome, and is randomly generated from a minimum and maximum values upon starting a new game. This means you can have an ore rich game or a more ore deprived game with no real indication until you try. The only thing you can influence is a slider that will determine how far one way or the other the ore will generate."},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T09:35:51Z","Content":"Ah! Thanks for that. A connection would be cool, but I like the random distribution for each new game."}]}
