You have unlocked everything...there is little compelling you to go get more and parts that generate it become...redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I am curious if a mod can update part values/attributes with out making a new CFG for the part? The thought is the creation of a mod that does not any any parts. Instead you use science to research upgrades to parts based on your discoveries. Nothing over the top, more like small incremental upgrades. Give the PB-Ion a small boost to thrust, make tanks fractionally lighter with better materials (The tank not the contents), upgrade the mk1 command pod with better batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the sort of thing that we do with science all the time. Look at what is happening with the F-1 engines used in the Saturn V Rockets. After all this time, a team has taken one of the engines apart, redesigned it, simplified it, and used modern rapid prototyping techniques (Selective Laser Melting Technology) to make an updated and more efficient version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...I ask...can it be done?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T22:47:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SyberSmoke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:03:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally don\u0027t like the idea of parts with upgradeable stats, since this makes craft sharing much more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, a veteran may have built a really nice stock SSTO craft that he claims can get to the Mun and back.

The idea was more to research the upgrade tier (to a limit) and it apply to all parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also understand the concerns concerning part sharing. The file could be locked of coarse, or the files could just use the stock values and the person sharing could say \u0022this is this tier\u0022. The potencial is there to get better then stoke values, but it should not be so much better as to make past craft completely obsolete. Say after four tiers the NERV would get an extra 10 ISP in space going from 80 to 90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a science sink, a reason to keep experimenting with out being over the top.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
