When I decided *ahead of time* that this was going to be a simulation, so I committed myself to the notion that I wouldn\u0027t be allowed to save this result even if it worked.\u00A0 I like the KRASH mod for this because it forces me to declare *before I know if it\u0027s going to work* that this one doesn\u0027t count.\u00A0 I don\u0027t like having the freedom to wait and see if it worked and when it does deciding \u0022okay that wasn\u0027t really a simulation this time, let\u0027s keep that one\u0022.\u00A0 Because that\u0027s not how simulations work.\u00A0 When simulating a thing in the real world people do eventually have to decide to do it for reals, and when they do that then they can\u0027t retroactively declare it was just a simulation after it crashes.\u00A0 And they can\u0027t do the opposite either - when something was a simulation and it worked, they can\u0027t go, \u0022Well, since that worked lets make a rift in time and space and move the vessel from the alternate universe of the simulator out here into the real world and that way we\u0027ve already done it\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - When I make the judgement that it\u0027s definitely caused by a bug I couldn\u0027t possibly have been expected to do anything about or react to.\u00A0 For example, I was playing GAP (giving aircraft a purpose mod) which has contracts with big penalties that fail the mission and cost enormous money any time a part of the vessel breaks.\u00A0 I built a plane and spawned it on the runway.\u00A0 The game spawned the plane *already* clipped through the ground on scene-load, causing it register that as a collision and get flung 10 meters up in the air as soon as physics started.\u00A0 When it came down and broke parts off, I considered that a bug, not my fault, and did a manual revert.\u00A0 (I subsequently learned that those landing gear I was using from a mod have this bug frequently, and stopped using them).\u00A0 Other examples of the kind of buggy thing I feel justified in using a revert for are bad scene switches where your vessel loads under the surface of the Mun and starts falling in (haven\u0027t seen that one in a while thankfully), or when a terrain polygon \u0022collider\u0022 was missing so as my rover drove over it, so it started diving under the terrain, clipping through the surface so only the top was showing when it rammed into the edge of the next terrain polygon and exploded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-29T18:45:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2019 06:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-30T13:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223571438\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183098\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221553884897\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002263481\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Steven Mading said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually have the difficulty option that disallows reverts turned on, but with the full knowledge that I can go into the saves/backup directory and find a few autosaves from over the last hour or so.\u00A0 Using those I know I could exit back to the main menu, manually copy down one of those backups on top of the persistent.sfs file, and then go back into the game.\u00A0 That is a way to manually \u0022revert\u0022 if I absolutely need to. \u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found out that you can press esc, go into options, turn on revert, and then revert.
