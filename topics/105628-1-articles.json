A lot of confusion!\n\nTo sum things up for those who haven\u0027t followed the story: third stage of new Soyuz rocket (2nd launch for a Progress) delivers Progress into orbit 8:48 minutes after launch, apparently with an overshot apogee. Progress telemetry immediately becomes sporadic, the few signals show that the 2 solar panels deployed correctly, 2-3 Kurs antennas didn\u0027t and propulsion system is still safed (not pressurized). Progress can only communicate with the ground when flying over Russian territory. At 4th pass, video data (which is transmitted separately from telemetry, hence why telemetry doesn\u0027t work but video does) shows Progress is flipping all over the place at 60 degrees per second."},{"CreatedByName":"jara_","CreatedById":141609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:13:31Z","Content":"Is there a decent chance of regaining control?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:17:14Z","Content":"The USSTRATCOM data is definitely erroneous.
