What the antimatter collectors do is harvest these particles and move them to a storage container for later use. Stronger magnetic fields will mean more anti-particles, hence Jool and the Sun being great places to harvest them. Magnetic fields themselves fall off with the inverse-square law, which means that if you double the distance you are from the center of the field, the strength of the field is reduced to one-quarter, so collecting from lower altitudes is more efficient. However, I\u0027m guessing that at lower altitudes the magnetic field itself pushes away the particles, so you want to find the sweet spot where the Antimatter Flux is highest; as ratzap pointed out, that\u0027s at around 900km on Kerbin and probably right where its own Van Allen radiation belts would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SeventhArchitect\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SeventhArchitect\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBtw, would having something orbit the sun at a low altitude be a good idea for antimatter production?
