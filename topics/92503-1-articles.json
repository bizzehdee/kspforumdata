Time from the perspective of a moving object constantly adjusts itself such that the speed of light relative to that moving object is constant. Though it is impossible, a hypothetical spacecraft (or bouncy ball \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E), moving at the speed of light, would perceive time to stop. This would mean that between the bouncy ball and a hypothetical photon near by it (or on the other side of the universe), there would be no increase or decrease in distance at all. But that would have to be taken with the understanding that no time has elapsed for the bouncy ball, so the distance (0m) divided by the time (0s) really does not go at all against that limit of velocity, as velocity\u0027s measurement mandates the passage of time. You could do the same evaluation for me sitting at my computer.
