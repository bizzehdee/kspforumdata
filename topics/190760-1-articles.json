The images themselves were actually a composite of raw points plotted and rendered on a mainframe, then overlaid\u00A0with\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ephysical slides\u003C/em\u003E containing the graphics that you\u0027re probably thinking as being similar to a GUI -\u00A0all having to be preformatted for the different types of data the mainframe could display of course, with the combined image filmed with a video camera and essentially broadcast through closed circuit television. There was actually a complicated mechanical system in place that would pick from a large bank of slides when a person on one of the consoles requested different information.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo yeah, if the displays looked decades more advanced then anything that was possible at the time, it\u0027s because in reality it was more of an electromechanical system that appears way more advanced then it actually was. It was also mostly passive - other then requesting new data, users at the consoles couldn\u0027t really interact with the system like you would a computer, not in the way that movies tend to suggest. Again, imagine the consoles as being more like TVs with a set of closed circuit television channels broadcasting various data.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSource:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/going-boldly-what-it-was-like-to-be-an-apollo-flight-controller/2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/going-boldly-what-it-was-like-to-be-an-apollo-flight-controller/2/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe computers downstairs in the RTCC [Real Time Computing Complex] were responsible for producing the actual data, which could be numbers, a series of plotted points, or a single projected moving point. The System/360 mainframes generated the requested data on a CRT screen using dedicated digital-to-television display generators; positioned over the CRT in turn was a video camera, watching the screen. For the oxygen status display example above, the mainframe would produce a series of numerical columns and print them on the CRT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe numbers were just that, though. No column headings, no labels, no descriptive text, no formatting, no cell outlines, no nothing\u2014bare, unadorned columns of numbers. In order to make them more understandable, an automated mechanical system would retrieve an actual physical slide containing printed column headings and other formatting reference information from a huge bank of such slides, and place the slide over a light source and project it through a series of lenses into the video camera positioned above the CRT. The mixed image, made up of the CRT\u0027s bare columns and the slide containing the formatting, was then transmitted to the controller\u0027s console screen as a single video stream.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis process was necessary to dress up and clarify the mainframes\u0027 sparse output, since the modern concept of a single unified graphical display consisting of mixed static and dynamic elements was impossible with the era\u0027s technology. The mainframe produced the naked numbers or the moving dot, the slide provided the formatting or the background image, and a video camera transmitted the two separate elements sandwiched together for display on the controllers\u0027 console screens or for projection up on the big front 10\u0027\u00D720\u0027 screen or one of its smaller flanking companions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf graphs were needed\u2014if, for example, a controller needed to see how a certain spacecraft parameter was varying over time\u2014controllers could call up snapshots of data using a panel called a SMEK\u2014a Summary Message Keyboard. A SMEK keypress would summon a column of data about a spacecraft subsystem onto the controller\u0027s display. Additional keypresses would add additional columns of data for the subsystem, building a set of successive subsystem measurements in order, so that the controller could get a picture of how a parameter was changing over time. Even with the SMEK, though, there was nothing even vaguely resembling Excel with which to construct a graph. Controllers would write down the information on the screen and then pull out the slide rules and graph paper. Or they could summon a hard copy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the large screens, since they were back projected there\u0027s actually a large, blacked out\u00A0projection room directly in front of the mission control room, apparently called the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacecenter.org/restoring-apollo-mission-control-center/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Bat Cave\u0022\u003C/a\u003E, which is weird to think about.
