After changing the engines FAR no longer wants me to fly engines-first. It seems that the problem is with how far computes drag, i.e. node = drag, no node = less drag and aerospikes have no nodes. If that is indeed so then shame on FAR, changing engines that shouldn\u0027t influence the airflow at all shouldn\u0027t change how the craft flies. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:21:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust like Radam says you are going to far from prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do not need more fins or reaction wheels, at least nor normally.
