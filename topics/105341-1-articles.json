After changing the engines FAR no longer wants me to fly engines-first. It seems that the problem is with how far computes drag, i.e. node = drag, no node = less drag and aerospikes have no nodes. If that is indeed so then shame on FAR, changing engines that shouldn\u0027t influence the airflow at all shouldn\u0027t change how the craft flies. ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:21:43Z","Content":"Just like Radam says you are going to far from prograde.\n\nYou do not need more fins or reaction wheels, at least nor normally. You have to stay inside the circle of your prograde vector until you get up to at least about 30 km high.\n\nWhere the torque comes from is the more you point away from the way you are going, the more the side of the rocket is hitting the airflow. If you go to far, the force on the side of the rocket is more than you can counter and you flip out.\n\nOld stock style of go to 10 km and then turn 45 is horribly horribly wrong and dangerous.

They include, an engine is thottle limited differently. A Rapier is in a different mode (Or is that an aerospike, I don\u0027t use either that much). An Engine isn\u0027t lined up properly.
