And more importantly, my transfer times are long (and ugly to be quite frank..)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d like to master this tool but damned if I can figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is the only mod I really use and I mostly use it for the orbit info, vessel info and \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv stats information panels -- very handy those.. Do I have enough to use the launch window planner?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some magic I\u0027m missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have read over other tutorials but damned if I can get it to work for me..

That is, instead of doing a plane-change burn mid-course, instead you incorporate the plane change into your transfer burn leaving Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, MJ has a Maneuver Node Editor that lets you type in exact values in all the different directions (prograde, retrograde, up, down, inwards, outwards). So, once you have a maneuver node for the burn, you can use this feature to type in the numbers you got from the website. But there\u0027s 1 problem: putting the node in the correct place (at the proper ejection angle in your orbit around Kerbin). There\u0027s nothing in the game or MJ that lets you do this manually, and eyeballing it isn\u0027t accurate enough for the website numbers to work. So, the whole process of using MJ to take advantage of the website\u0027s numbers goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERead the tutorial so you know what numbers on the website are important\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERun the website for your date, target, and ballistic trajectory, and write down the numbers you need. You\u0027ll need a calculator that does trig functions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFast-forward time until you\u0027re less than 1 orbit before your burn time (15 minutes is usually good)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you haven\u0027t stayed focused on this ship since you launched it, point prograde and give it 1 light tap on the Shift key to run the engines at their absolute minimum thrust. Let them run for 5 seconds and then stop them. If you don\u0027t do this, the burn time calculator won\u0027t know how long the transfer burn will last, so you won\u0027t know when to start it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGo to the map view and set your destination as your target.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOpen MJ\u0027s Maneuver Planet, cycle to \u0022Transfer to Another Planet\u0022, and hit \u0022Create Node\u0022. The reason for this step is to get the node created at the proper ejection angle on your Kerbin orbit. You\u0027re not going to use the burn values that this node starts with, but you ARE going to use this node exactly where it sits, so don\u0027t move it. See, MJ only knows Hohman, it don\u0027t know ballistic, but it does know ejection angles.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOpen MJ\u0027s Maneuver Node Editor and type in the values you got from the website in their appropriate boxes, then hit the update button. This sets the pre-existing node to burn for the ballistic transfer you wanted or you wouldn\u0027t be going to all this trouble anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECheck the map to see that you\u0027re at least getting close to the target. Dres is tiny so even doing everything perfect, you\u0027ll probably still need to tweak your course a bit en route to get a good encounter.
