As for lift profile, for the most part you want to build up as much speed within the lower atmosphere (below 20KM) as you can before you switch over to rockets. This means angling up at 45 degrees for the early part of the launch (try to keep your speed at or below 250m/s for this part), switching to about 20 degrees at 10KM, and pushing to full throttle at that point too.
