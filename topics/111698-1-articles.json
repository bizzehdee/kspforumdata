While you can feasibly get away with somewhat blocky design, the fact remains that you\u0027ll do far better if you buck up and build according to the new standard.\n\n![tourista1.jpg](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/tourista1.jpg)\n\n Here\u0027s a good baseline for the construction of a spaceplane under current aerodynamics. As for lift profile, for the most part you want to build up as much speed within the lower atmosphere (below 20KM) as you can before you switch over to rockets. This means angling up at 45 degrees for the early part of the launch (try to keep your speed at or below 250m/s for this part), switching to about 20 degrees at 10KM, and pushing to full throttle at that point too. (This is for Kerbin; Laythe will have a lower point, I haven\u0027t checked where it is just yet.)"},{"CreatedByName":"OgreMagi","CreatedById":103767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T04:20:54Z","Content":"ok I play around with it and see, \n\nI notice you test aircraft has quite a bit of air intake on it ? so the old Ram/shock cones do not work effectively? \n\nhave to build the wheel again..."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T05:49:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ok I play around with it and see, \n\u003E I notice you test aircraft has quite a bit of air intake on it ? so the old Ram/shock cones do not work effectively? \n\u003E \n\u003E have to build the wheel again...\n\nOn the contrary, \u0022Air Hogging\u0022 is gone and the RAM intakes and Shock Cones work quite well. That too is more realistic, the bigger the intake area the more effective they are, so the little under-wing intakes that came with the Mk2 parts don\u0027t work quite as well anymore. On the flip side, thanks to the new drag system in the aerodynamics... the bigger the intake area, the more drag you will have so don\u0027t overdo it. As for his screenshot, it\u0027s a bit overbuilt.\n\nAlso new, Intakes will not cause asymmetric flameout due to declining air (i.e. higher altitudes), they will however cause asymmetric flame out if you don\u0027t have enough intakes feed the number of engines you have though."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T06:08:17Z","Content":"Engines now lose thrust with altitude as well as airspeed, and it\u0027s much lower and slower than before.\n\n No more \u0022turbojets until apoapsis, then a little puff to circularize\u0022. And as stated above, airhogging doesn\u0027t work anymore.\n\n You also have transsonic drag, so you need to punch through Mach 1 at around 10km before continuing.\n\n This makes SSTO spaceplanes harder to do and lowers their payload fraction, which is a good thing. \n\n You might as well throw out your old spaceplanes and start over. There\u0027s lots of threads around regarding spaceplane design in the new system.\n\nGood luck!\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T06:22:07Z","Content":"You should first learn the new ascent profile for SSTOs because it has completely changed. Because of the way thrust decays with both altitude and speed, you can no longer linger to milk the air breathers for every last drop. Instead you have to get what you can get quickly and efficiently and then switch to rockets. I would recommend started out by piloting someone else\u0027s design so that you know it can make it to orbit if you just learn how. Also, GoSlash27 has a good tutorial in that section of the forums."},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T07:34:01Z","Content":"I have some ongoing research threads dedicated to optimizing SSTO designs with the help of the KSP community.

Im still trying to land it on the Mun, but I\u0027m convinced I\u0027ll succeed eventually. Touching that massive ship down gently with just that weeeak little engine is tricky! I dealt with my 4\u002B1\u002B1 symmetry problem by mounting the Nerva and the Turbo together in the middle on a bicoupler, with each engine canted outwards enough to (almost) offset it\u0027s off-center position. The thing flies poorly, but I\u0027m pretty sure I will make Mun and back, which means Minmus should be a breeze and Duna is not out of the question. This is still a fair bit less than SSTOs could do in the previous game, but it\u0027s not hopeless!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T00:05:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program**"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T16:01:50Z","Content":"Everyone had to relearn how to launch - well almost everything, once KSP released the full version (1.0).

You end up having to burn all your bipropellant just to make orbit.
