I will NEVER purchase another game which uses a micro-transaction dynamic. I learned my lesson with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E Online and Magick the Gathering Online: ingenious money pits in which the initially somewhat positive correlation between expenditure and enjoyment soon transforms into no correlation thence into a negative correlation. One must be suffering an actual addiction to continue on that path for very long, and while the IP owner/creator/producer/publisher may well reap sufficient rewards to justify the system even if 90% of users curtail their micro-transactional indulgences during the \u0022pre-negative correlation\u0022 phase, the ethics and long-term sustainability of the business model strike me as extremely questionable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no desire to promote such a business model, and in fact will speak against it when it seems prudent, but if a particular business wishes to do it, that is their business. They won\u0027t get any more of my consumer dollars that is for sure, but then they don\u0027t care about the anecdotes anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one version of this business model that I do find truly objectionable and probably bordering on illegal is when they \u0022update\u0022 an existing application which has been in post-Beta release form for quite some time (hell even if it was still in Alpha, I think the model is objectionable) and which was not previously a MT model but which is adapted to that model. Fallout 4 is the exemplar of this. Bethesda has breached by brand loyalty, quite possibly irrevocably and I may well never purchase another of their titles. Based on the response the Creation Club garnered, I think it is safe to say I am not alone. The actual proportions of lost revenue are anyone\u0027s guess, but given they could very simply allow users to Opt In or Opt Out of the Creation Club, and effectively avert estranging users like me speaks to the deep stupidity of the planners who implement these schemes. If your product is so fantastic that you have to dupe /extort/force your consumers into using it, then you really should ask yourself: is this a sustainable business model?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
