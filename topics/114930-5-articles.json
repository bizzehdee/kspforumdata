I get that we don\u0027t use it, but wanting the entire website to burn to the ground (including /r/kerbalspaceprogram)? People never seem to get that subreddits are a huge part of the website. Once you really look at it, there is no \u0022Reddit Hivemind\u0022, because each community is different. KSP has a great and welcoming group over there as well, so why are we all attacking them like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I don\u0027t know what to think about the whole \u0022protest\u0022. Big subreddits shutting down makes sense, because that clears the front page and kind of sends a message to the admins. KSP shutting down will probably only affect 1% of users anyways... so let\u0027s not do that. I don\u0027t completely understand what the protests are about, but it\u0027s clear that it wasn\u0027t about the firing of one admin. That was the catalyst - people have been angry for a long time over growing corruption and lack of communication. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorruption and lack of communication? Sounds like Reddit is turning into ROBLOX.
