It forces the management (in this case, the Reddit administration) to act.\n\nNot only that, but the strike was voted on and supported by the majority of users of the subreddit. \n\nThe Reddit admins will have been forced to increase communication with the moderators of large subreddits (which was the goal of the strike) and that will improve everything for everybody. If you read the front page of Reddit, you\u0027ll see that the admins are already responding and are struggling to bring everything back together. This strike *has* had an effect. \n\nIn short, stop complaining.

I get that we don\u0027t use it, but wanting the entire website to burn to the ground (including /r/kerbalspaceprogram)? People never seem to get that subreddits are a huge part of the website. Once you really look at it, there is no \u0022Reddit Hivemind\u0022, because each community is different. KSP has a great and welcoming group over there as well, so why are we all attacking them like this?\n\nPersonally, I don\u0027t know what to think about the whole \u0022protest\u0022. Big subreddits shutting down makes sense, because that clears the front page and kind of sends a message to the admins. KSP shutting down will probably only affect 1% of users anyways... so let\u0027s not do that. I don\u0027t completely understand what the protests are about, but it\u0027s clear that it wasn\u0027t about the firing of one admin. That was the catalyst - people have been angry for a long time over growing corruption and lack of communication. \n\nCorruption and lack of communication? Sounds like Reddit is turning into ROBLOX.
