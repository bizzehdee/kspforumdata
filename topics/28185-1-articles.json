However any ship I try and load, even \u0022stock\u0022 ships, don\u0027t load, and I don\u0027t see all the parts in the menu\u0027s. For instance, no mainsail engine is available under propulsion, and there are no aero or science parts at all. I did have mods running in .19, but .2 doesn\u0027t recognize even stock parts. Any help is appreciated. I have also posted this in the \u0022how to\u0022 thread, so we seem to have competing threads. My apologies for the double post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: another Post indicated problems with Damned Robotics and the .2 update. I deleted all the parts and the .dll file associated with that mod, and all the parts came back and where accesssible in the VAB. I added back the MuMechLib.dll, which is used by both Damned Robotics and MechJeb, and while the ships I had that had Damned Robotics became inaccessible, all other ships where accessible. NOTE, while mission ships that have a Mechjeb2 part are accessible, returning to the spaceport becomes inaccessible. For me, that is acceptable, as those ships are only on mapping missions, and I suspect the culprit is the MapSat mod and not MechJeb, for the time being, I have to refrain from selecting those ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps others, bottom line, delete all damned robotics parts until the mod author updates for .2, restore your save games files, insure MuMechLib.dll is still in your Plugins folder, don\u0027t access ships that have ISA_MapSat.dll parts, and your saves should work. Note that any ship with a damned robotics parts will be deleted when you access the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-23T00:44:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2013 12:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Torch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
