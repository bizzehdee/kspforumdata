I attach the large extendable radiator directly onto the smallest reactor and it still will not stop it from overheating. I have deleted the game and reinstalled it and its still happening.\u00A0\u00A0Any help will be greatly appreciated, I am using V1.3.1 and the reactors are from the near future electrical mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
