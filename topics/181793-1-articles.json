Hydraulic failures would bring extreme challenges and force us\u00A0to build in redundancy into our craft. Just a thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-29T06:03:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think while it can be fun, its just adding parts. And then you have to deal with another element to add to the already learning cliff that is the game as well as added complexity in line routing and what not if you do include that. And I know personally I don\u0027t particularly want to spend time on fiddling with more control lines and adding more parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-29T10:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReservoirs, pumps, lines, pressure...
