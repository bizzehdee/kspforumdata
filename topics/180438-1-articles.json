Fresh install, no mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI keep encountering what seems to be bugs and I would like to check if I am doing something wrong. Here is what I have experienced so far.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) \u0022Trouble in the void\u0022: both vessels landed but the mission did not complete. The SWM-94 did not show up as landed, for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) \u0022Meet me in zero G\u0022: I successfully put the first vessel in orbit. The game immediately switched to the launch pad where I proceeded to orbit the second vessel. However, once in space, the first vessel was nowhere to be found. This occurred again on another mission (see next point)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) \u0022Sally-Hut-1\u0022: again, first vessel in the correct orbit, the game switched to launch pad for second vessel. Launched second vessel, that you have to land immediately. I did that. Then the third vessel was put in orbit but the Sally-Hut-1 was nowhere to be seen. I am in the correct orbit, I even get the prompt with instructions to dock, but there is no other ship in space. I checked at the tracking station and the only available vessels are Soy-Ooze 10 (landed at kerbin) and Soy-Ooze 10 part 2 (in orbit).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre these bugs and I have been unlucky to find 3 bugs in 3 missions or am I missing something?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
