This creates illogical situations such as funds \u0022value\u0022 being much greater than their true worth compared to science and reputation, and penalties exceeding bonuses under all but the most specific situations. Sane Strategies uses a simple logical framework to establish balance between the currency conversion strategies, and significantly changes the cost/reward balance across all stock strategies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 alternative \u0022conversion\u0022 strategies are also included that exchange collection efficiency between currencies (instead of exchanging the currencies themselves). For example, you might get a 15% bonus on all funds earned from a mission, but your science returns are reduced by 20%.
