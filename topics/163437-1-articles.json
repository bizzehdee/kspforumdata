Looks like an issue of bays added in mods (as far as drag actually being applied to stowed parts).\u00A0 I don\u0027t know how to delete a post, but someone who can may want to knock this one out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI posted this on the modded forum and got no replies, so I\u0027m trying it here, as I\u0027ve had the same problem on a brand new install as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve searched and cannot find why my cargo bays won\u0027t shield anything from drag.\u00A0 I\u0027ve knocked out all the usual suspects I can find, and here\u0027s what I\u0027ve done:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 I\u0027ve used different types of cargo bays, mk 2, all the mk 3s (and some OPT ones before my clean install)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. NO clipping anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Internal parts attached to nodes inside cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Tried different parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. No external parts attached to cargo bays except inline by external nodes. For testing used fuel tanks of same type as cargo bay attached to either end with one random tester part inside bay attached to internal node, nothing else but landing legs attached to fuel tanks and maybe a drone core attached to a fuel tank to allow actuation of bay doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI load it up on the runway, look inside bay and parts (using debug menu) are showing NO for \u0022shielded.\u0022 Open and close bay doors, no difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t played the game in days because space planes are what I\u0027m doing at this point, and useless cargo bays ruin space planes IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-19T16:45:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2017 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Muttzor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Epartially solved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
