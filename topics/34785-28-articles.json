Whenever, one of us tries to rendezvous (using the rendezvous tool) with the others\u0027 ship it causes the ship we are controlling to zoom past the target at ridiculous speeds.

If yes, then it\u0027s obvious the problem is with hyperedit and I can probably fix it. If not, then we\u0027ve got a serious problem that I wouldn\u0027t know where to start on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice would to set \u0022lead time\u0022 on rendezvous to something large, so that you\u0027re farther than 5km or whatever the load distance is. Hopefully no zooming occurs (I\u0027m guessing the cause of the zooming is loading of vessels and wonkyness on DMP\u0027s side), and then move closer somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso how fast is \u0022ridiculous\u0022? It\u0027s actually a fairly important value - if it\u0027s \u0026lt;4km/s, then it might be due to orbital velocity changes not getting updated. If it\u0027s something insane (10Mm/s) then it might be due to calculating dV on a per-frame basis.
