The aircraft pulls back (nose up) to slow the decent rate. This way, the pilot controls how hard they come down on the landing gear while putting the nose at the right angle to avoid ripping the tail of the plane off. . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s basically just pulling up before you hit the runway so you touchdown softly. Analogous to slowing a Lander to under 5m/s before you hit the ground while making sure you touchdown flat to the slope of the hill you\u0027re coming down on. Except an aircraft, you want the nose up a little to contact the rear wheels but not too high and hit the rear of the aircraft on the ground. This is why a boresite or waterline indicator would be nice on the hud (one can wish). If you have the ADI open and in IVA, there\u0027s a static icon that looks like wings with a dot in the center (it\u0027s also the center icon on the NavBall).
