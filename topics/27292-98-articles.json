I may try to make it a habit to use only docking ports on upper stages, and boosters that aren\u0027t expected to fall back down of their own accord.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it\u0027s on my reddit save game so it\u0027s not entirely important but it does give good docking practice, not having rcs lol\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-25T21:08:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2013 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
