This is my opinion and only applies to me: I play games to get away from other people. To escape from reality for a while.

I don\u0027t want to come home and try to relax by inviting inconsiderate idiots into my gaming experience. That\u0027s the antithesis of why I play games in the first place. Fallout is one of my favorite game series. I\u0027ve loved every one I\u0027ve played. But F76 has me saying \u0022pass\u0022 for the first time ever for a Fallout game. I don\u0027t want multiplayer Fallout, and it seems like I\u0027m not alone based on the responses I\u0027ve seen elsewhere. I don\u0027t know what to make of it or what will become of it, but I really am not excited for a Fallout game for the first time ever.
