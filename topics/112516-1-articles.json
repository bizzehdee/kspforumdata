I waited a long time, and once discovered \u0022FinalFrontier\u0022, but there were not enough info for me. Also, I did not have any programming skill at that moment, but i decided to try to do something myself. Spent about three months for understanding the basic knowledge and got the result now (not without the help and assistance of respected people). To be honest, I still do not understand how some things work, code samples which were taken from different tutorials and mods, but \u0022if it works, do not touch anything.\u0022\n\nwell, here we have a simplified missions statistics, which divided to two pages, first - for unique flight data of each flight and second - the data for each pilot. In addition to formal statistics, it helps to plan you own space program and not to forget where you were and what you already done. This plugin is graphicsless, only tabular forms. All data is stored in a separate file in the JSON format.\n\n![YWW40SWh.png](http://i.imgur.com/YWW40SWh.png)\n\n**Left page.** Here we have a list of flights that contains the name, start date and the cost of the ship. By clicking on any record we get the window with the following information: vessel name, its mass at launch, cost, launch date, the weight in a stable orbit, the amount of dockings and EVAs, maximum speed, number of landings, end date, duration and final weight, also show the amount of points earned science. On right side of this window we have data about SOI changes and the initial and final crew. The duration of the flight is always calculated dynamically. Completed missions (recovered) are painted in green. Current flight or a dedicated flight - stands a bright white color. Crashed - are painted in red. Missions can be sorted by date (by default, the new above), by the title of the series, or by cost. At the bottom of the window we can see a summary of the number of starts, total costs and total duration. \n\n![LWLCSkHh.png](http://i.imgur.com/LWLCSkHh.png)\n\n![nOhCc7Zh.png](http://i.imgur.com/nOhCc7Zh.png)\n\n![rXjJSMrh.png](http://i.imgur.com/rXjJSMrh.png)\n\n**Right page**, with the telling name - Kerbals - used to store data about every kerbonauts. Initially, there is a list of the flyed pilots with the name, the number of flights and total duration of the raid. Clicking on the entry opens a window with more information, the number of flights, total time in flights, number of dockings, the number of EVA and total time in open space, the number of landings.\n\n![4rWEWHfh.png](http://i.imgur.com/4rWEWHfh.png)\n\n![7XySYwth.png](http://i.imgur.com/7XySYwth.png)\n\n**Note1:** personally i play on hard mode career only, and plugin has been tested in it. but \u0022Revert to VAB\u0022 must operate normally, details of the flight will be removed. In other modes plugin has not been tested.\n\n**Note2**: currently there are no own statistic for separated units, such as Landers. When spacecraft divided on the orbit to several vessels, data of both fall into one entry (eg Landings)\n\n**Installation:** The zip files are all structured so that you only have to extract them into your kerbal folder and overwrite the folder.\n\n**download**\n\n**REDACTED**\n\nLicense: [CC-NC-ND](https://tldrlegal.com/license/creative-commons-attribution-noncommercial-noderivs-%28cc-nc-nd%29)\n\nI hope that this plugin will be useful not only for me.\n\ncomments and suggestions are welcome\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T15:26:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sjwt**\n  \nNo source"},{"CreatedByName":"BrutalRIP","CreatedById":59065,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T01:32:17Z","Content":"Nice idea but the link gives me a 401 error?\n\nAlso any chance of getting a max G reading\n\nEDIT= NVM it works now.Thanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T02:43:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 02:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BrutalRIP**"},{"CreatedByName":"electroconvulsivo","CreatedById":143338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T11:08:33Z","Content":"Ausgezeichnet!\n\nThis, together with some other mods, helps to improve the sense of immersion of a hardcore carrer.

If you actually follow that link and read the terms, there is no mention of any special state of development.
