After struggling with a mission to activate a radial decoupler (more than once) and realizing that in order to activate it at will (that is, when mission conditions are met), activating it manually doesn\u0027t work, and adding it to a stage at the bottom doesn\u0027t work. In fact, putting it in any stage, and staging all the way to the end, does not activate it, not even after attaching an ant motor (I thought, perhaps it does not stage with nothing attached, but that wasn\u0027t the problem). The solution is to add it to a new stage at the bottom, then add a second, empty stage below that one, before I can finish the mission. It took a surprisingly long time to figure this out, despite being experienced with the staging system!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, I thought about the staging display for a while. It occurred to me, that for the system to work and display the way that it does, a displayed stage depicts the activation of both engines and decouplers (I know this is obvious, bear with me). When activated, previous stages disappear, the decouplers are extracted from the stage\u0027s graphic, and the engines turn on (but remain in the graphic). The next time the stage button is pressed, the stage *above* the bottom stage is activated, and the bottom graphic is dropped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine that the motivation for basing the system this way, is that the disappearance of a stage in the GUI represents physically dropping the corresponding stage. This sounds okay to me, in principle. But, it does not directly depict fuel tanks, or any other parts which are physically dropped except for engines and parachutes (for the most part). The decouplers are not \u0022dropped\u0022 per se, and in this paradigm they disappear prematurely anyway, as they are extracted from inside the bottom stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTruly, the only consistent paradigm is one where each stage represents activation. Pressing the staging button can never interact directly with the bottom stage. It only activates the second-to-bottom stage. Then, the current moment in time is a line between the bottom stage and the second-to-bottom stage. (There is a single exception, which further works against intuitive consistency, in that before launch, there is an invisible bottom stage which represents idling. This is the only time that the apparent bottom stage can truly be activated.) This becomes more intuitive the more you play the game, but only as a matter of learning and practice, causing us to forget that there\u0027s anything wrong, but there is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe suggestion and summary:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, the system is fine mechanically, but it\u0027s depiction is unintuitive, which is made especially apparent when you want to make quick changes after launch. It is lacking something. A simple improvement might be that, once the rocket is launched, the bottom stage changes it\u0027s border from orange to say, green. Or once launched, a literal line does in fact appear between the bottom and second-to-bottom stage. Anything to visually declare that activation of the bottom stage is now in the past, can never be activated again, and the second-to-bottom is the nearest stage in the future, and therefore the one which corresponds to the next press of the staging key. Anything to show that the bottom graphic is activated and cannot ever be activated again, unlike every stage in the group above it. It should be visually distinct, separate from the rest, one way or another (except before launch). And furthermore, it should be made impossible to add stages below the \u0022green-bordered\u0022 stage, because as far as I\u0027m aware it is literally impossible for the added stage to have any effect except to self-mislead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know it\u0027s a very simple suggestion and a subtle change, I apologize for being verbose but it\u0027s hard to explain that there\u0027s even a definite problem or to identify it because we learn to work around it quickly enough, for most purposes. I think, the staging interface (and it is a critical interface, not just a display) will make more sense this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-09T19:10:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2017 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aru\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-09T20:15:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first I thought you were just overthinking it, but when I got to the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0suggestion I couldn\u0027t help but empathize and agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR, this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223144228\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164238\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502303913\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022171422\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aru\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Aru said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nonce the rocket is launched, the bottom stage \u003Cem\u003E[note: on the staging bar, not the actual rocket]\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Echanges it\u0027s border from orange to say, green.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, about the problem that led you to the suggestion, I still think you\u0027re overthinking it: You can create a stage directly above the last one by clicking the \u0022\u002B\u0022 button on the stage above it (provided there is one, of course), and drag your decoupler to that.
