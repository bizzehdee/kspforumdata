I started a new career mode save yesterday and I\u0027ve gotten through the tech tree disturbingly fast (strategies might be badly balanced). Anyway, just finished my Mun mission and went to get my contracts for Minmus and Duna and Ike but--no dice. There are no new contracts available. I looked around to see if there was a fix and a couple of people said that, in general, mods that add contracts can screw with the game\u0027s contract system. I uninstalled the one mod I have that affects contracts--StationScience 1.3 (2.5 compatible) and reloaded my save. The contract for Ike appeared! But not Duna or Minmus. I uninstalled ALL my mods and loaded the game unmodded, but still no contract for Duna or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s past my bedtime and I won\u0027t be able to upload the log or the full list of mods until tomorrow. Throwing this out there now in case anyone has a fix off the top of their head. Also, it\u0027s kind of irritating me, and this was therapeutic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rallymonkee","CreatedById":125862,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T02:00:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the same issue - I\u0027ve been offered Eve and Ike not Minmus.
