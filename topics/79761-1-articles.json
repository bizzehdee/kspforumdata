KSP\u0027s engine seems to be poorly optimized, with the biggest issue being that physics are calculated on a per-frame basis, leading to extreme floating point errors with low FPS or high time warp (AKA Kraken attacks). Plus there is no way to accelerate multiple objects due to a limitation of the physics engine. Has Squad acknowledged this in the past? It seems to be the biggest issue holding KSP back from being so much better and limiting the capabilities of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T20:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUltimately we\u0027re dependent on Unity.

Performance wise this part is fairly trivial, even the slowest of PCs can easily keep up with it until you get absurd numbers of things in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is part interaction physics, where the various parts in a ship interact with each other, other bodies, and the forces of acceleration and such. This one doesn\u0027t suffer so much from floating point errors because the distances involved are usually quite small. Performance, however, is greatly affected by the number of parts interacting, and it is single-thread performance limited. Unity 5 is supposed to enable multithreaded physics, but I\u0027ve heard it suggested by the physics/computer science types that the type of physics in KSP\u0027s part interaction is not multithreadable even if the engine supports it (something about a chained rigid body problem, the details are a bit beyond me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has been stated by the devs that they\u0027ll be sticking with Unity through 1.0 at least as it would require reworking the entire project to change, so I wouldn\u0027t hold my breath for an engine change any time soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sparker","CreatedById":79522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T18:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry to post in this old thread, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis it possible to treat crafts as solid bodies by switching off calculations of interactions between parts?
