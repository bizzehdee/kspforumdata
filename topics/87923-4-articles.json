Between 1/4 and 1/3 of the girls chose the dinosaur sticker and a similar number of boys chose the stars, and yet one of my second graders was surprised I even asked. She said that of course she wanted the star because only boys like dinosaurs. Games like this need prominent male and female characters so that boys and girls don\u0027t assume that only boys should be interested in rocketry, space, and exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re interested in other ways culture influences preferences, take a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.livescience.com/22037-pink-girls-blue-boys.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe history color associations for boys and girls\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T17:56:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with your post but if \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FFA500;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EJeb, Bill and Bob\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E were the first \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ekerbals\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E in the game they are all \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FFFF;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Emale\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E then the\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E first\u003C/span\u003E three \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#EE82EE;\u0022\u003EFemale\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EKerbals\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E should get \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF8C00;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EOrange suits\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E because they were the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EFirst\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#EE82EE;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF8C00;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EFemale\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EKerbals.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T17:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efirst new female kerbonaut will be alice. everyone knows that\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-05T00:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah Im actually with Tao. Its just more important that the game represents women as equals than it is that it adheres to some silly in-game canon. Like it or not, most everyone who plays this game perceives all the kerbals we\u0027ve seen as male. It was actually the first thing that really, really bugged me about the game. Its a huge oversight and one I think the devs are wise in addressing. The main thing is this could be a great game for female players, the game should be giving them characters they can relate to, and even male players should be seeing perceptibly female kerbals looking like and doing all the things that the male kerbals are doing. Really this should mean providing an equal number of males and females for the default starting line up of orange-ranked kerbals for players to choose from on their first launches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nahim","CreatedById":78568,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T03:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to think that Kerbal space program tends to appeal as an Ol\u0027Gold age of space exploration.
