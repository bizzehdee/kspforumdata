Am I supposed to create a new mesh in Blender for it? Is it supposed to be textured? And in the tutorial, it tells you to make tags for Airlock and Ladder. What do I put for the Elements and Size of those Tags? And it\u0027s talking about 0.16 KSP part tools, and now there\u0027s 0.23, so chances are it\u0027s outdated. So, could someone please clearly explain what I\u0027m supposed to do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this is the part in question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XZX0qNX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XZX0qNX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T19:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECreate a cube in blender, you can duplicate this for the ladder/airlock. Once in unity, change both objects into mesh colliders(you don\u0027t need to use a box collider). Check the \u0022is trigger\u0022 for both objects. Set the layer for both to part triggers. Set tags for each one, \u0022Airlock\u0022 and \u0022Ladder\u0022.

I\u0027ll try that now. Also, at the beginning it says that it should be in the center of the object.
