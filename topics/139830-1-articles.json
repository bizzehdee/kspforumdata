However my actual position as shown in map view is far away from the target vehicle, as would be expected with the kind of thrust being applied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn almost 2 years of playing the game, this is the strangest behaviour that I\u0027ve seen and wondered if anyone has come across anything similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-15T16:09:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2016 04:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by purpleivan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T16:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, this happened to me in either 1.04 or 1.05, if I recall my IVA pic was really creepy tho\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: My post is around here somewhere...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-15T16:24:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2016 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Waxing_Kibbous\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T16:31:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using mods?
