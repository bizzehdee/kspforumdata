Even the way they are now it hesitates a bit before settling on the nose gear when it spawns.\n\nYes, I do have the standard control inputs all zeroed on all of the flaps parts. Also there are no speed brakes indeed. Should probably add them anyways. Every time I build something I hope the craft would be able to descend at least somehow if not that quickly without them. But it seems that all planes are just too aerodynamically perfect when it comes to subsonic drag in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nThe dihedral on the stabilizer is zero however its angle of incidence is different on some of the pictures. Regarding increasing the area of the stabilizer, would that not be helpful only if the stabilizer itself was movable in flight? I have tried both increasing and decreasing it but it seems that the effect is negligible even if it is twice the original size. Does \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E have a problem with tweakscaled parts? That would explain why it did not work then. I always thought that in real life the control authority is defined as sufficient if the maximum deflection corresponds to flying at the critical angle of attack when landing. I just feel that the sweep of the wing gives it way too much static stability to achieve this. For some reason with kerbal planes in general I often find that the wing has to go further forward than I would expect when comparing to the real life planes. Same with this one. Why would that be the case actually?"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-09T11:01:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, Kitspace said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For some reason with kerbal planes in general I often find that the wing has to go further forward than I would expect when comparing to the real life planes.

Drag-wise, don\u0027t forget Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere stops at 70km so it is all compressed vertically.

This result has left me confused.  \n\nIt also disagrees with thrust vectoring at low speeds, if I want to pull back on the stick I have to disabled it, otherwise it would start oscillating or worse, stall. Leaving it on would require care with the stick(not yanking it all the way to 100%, I have to simulate it by continuously tapping S, don\u0027t have my flight stick with me atm) or careful regulation of thrust. This made me even more confused as real life sustained turn rates are tested with full afterburner even at low speeds, while I have to put the throttle to 1/4 or less at Mach 0.4 when I have TVC.  \n\nSuch a big difference combined with the weird turning behavior has led me to believe there are some serious design flaws, but so far I haven\u0027t been able to identify any by asking Google.\n\nExperiments with different canard setups are also largely failures.

In KSP that\u0027s not a factor so peak is at higher speeds.\n\nThe ability to pull sustained Gs is all about lift vs weight.   The trick is to get more lift without making the plane draggy and have a low top speed.\n\nWhat your plane has - supermaneuverability - is more to do with control authority, and the ability to command extreme pitch angles and generate high roll rates - not the same thing !\n\nIn my last experiment with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E,  I was trying to develop a utility aircraft that could supercruise, fly to the polar biome and back, and also have a low landing speed.I managed to cram quite a bit of wing area in while keeping low wave drag.

My understanding is that it involves being able to point the nose well past stall angle.\n\nWith pure aerodynamic control in stock aero (where all surfaces stall at 30 degrees) this is impossible - an aerodynamically stable craft has more lifting surface behind \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E than in front of it.    The only way you can get the nose up is to give the surfaces ahead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E more angle of attack than those at the back.   In a canard you do that by pitching the canard up so it\u0027s got more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E than the main wing,  in a tailplane the elevator surface pitches down so the main wing has a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E than it.    When the angle of attack of the whole aircraft nears the stall, the surfaces at the front will stall first as they were  at the highest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E to begin with so the front end looses lift and the nose slams down no matter how hard you keep pulling.        In an aircraft with negative stability,  rather than the nose slamming down when a critical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E is reached, instead the aircraft will pitch up uncontrollably despite you correcting with full nose down and you\u0027ll end up going backwards/flat spinning.\n\nNow i think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E does allow things like drooping leading edge devices,  to modify the stall angle as does the shape of the lifting surface, but i can\u0027t see how that allows control past the stall.\n\nWhat does work is \n\na) having some non-aerodynamic means to point the nose (TVC, reaction wheels, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E)\n\nb) keeping \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E close together .reduces the forces your non-aerodynamic system needs to generate\n\nc) paying close attention to the layout of fuel and ordinance so that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E moves as little as possible between full and empty helps with b)\n\nEven then I think post-stall manuvers only happen at low dynamic pressure - ie.  fast and high or low and slow,  when the plane can only pull 2 or 3g aerodynamically without stalling anyway.    If you\u0027re going 450knots on the deck the aero forces are just too strong and you\u0027re not pointing the nose 60 degrees off prograde.\n\nReal airplanes use TVC but in KSP remember we also have magic reaction wheels and I imagine some Vernor thrusters right on the nose and wingtips will do good too - they\u0027ll be nice and far from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E so they\u0027ll have plenty leverage.

(It is assumed here that the mass *m* is constant)\n\nNow, what turning aircraft means ? It is acceleration that is perpendicular to velocity vector, or better said sum of all acceleration vectors and their perpendicular fractions to velocity vector and turn direction that we observe.\n\nFrom second Newton\u0027s law we know that accelerations formula is **a = F / m**\n\nBut, you where that force that turn aircraft comes from ? If we disregard gravity for a moment, that force might come from only two surces: aircraft engine or wings. In most cases, you only get fraction of available thrust force trough engine gimbals, it can help to turn aircraft nose faster in desired direction, can help in stabilization, but usually it does not provide enough force to change direction of velocity vector.\n\nOnly significant source of force that can rapidly change velocity vector comes from wings. And I\u0027m talking about main wings here, not control surfaces that just point craft nose in one direction or another. You need enough wing surface area (can be combined with fuselage body area) to be able for fast turn rate of aircraft. Large wing surface area also helps in flight stability at low subsonic speeds.\n\nIn conclusion, you were cuting off wing area to reduce mass as much as possible, but you were also cutting down main force source that have significant role in turning aircraft.

Less mass means it has less inertia, and easier for the same force to change it\u0027s direction.  \n\nAlso, instead of an all-moving small main wing(if it even exists), would I actually turn faster with a larger wing but with smaller control surfaces?"},{"CreatedByName":"Schwarz","CreatedById":181098,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-12T07:38:19Z","Content":"New airframe is ready to roll out, although I\u0027m afraid that even it went through a major 6 ton weight loss program while having about the same wing area, it only improved a little bit in terms of maneuverability.   \n\nCraft file:  \n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8bJl5w55aiQcUZNd3ZjZUV3TkU](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8bJl5w55aiQcUZNd3ZjZUV3TkU)  \n\nChanges:  \n\n1.Sabre engine under the cockpit has been removed; total weight is down by six tons.  \n\n2.main wings are about the same size but control surfaces are now much smaller.  \n\n3.Nose has been shortened and now pointing downwards at a shallower degree.  \n\n4.Highlighted part is now parallel with the main wing, instead of pointing downwards.  \n\n5.\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E moved backwards ever so slightly while \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E was moved forwards.  \n\n6.F119s have been upscaled from 1.25m to 1.375 meters, ***Tweakscale is now needed!***  \n\n7.numerous cosmetic changes, mainly new cockpit underslung and engine exhaust ports.  \n![tGSTsJS.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tGSTsJS.jpg)\n\n![0gjnbVE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0gjnbVE.jpg)  \n\nI found out the old nose produced quite a lot of negative lift; if there wasn\u0027t enough pitch authority on the canards, at supersonic speeds the nose would pitch down quickly until the plane flipped over.
