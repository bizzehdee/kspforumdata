The buttons are awkwardly placed and they aren\u0027t as ergonomic when compared to the MX-518/G400 style. However, A lot of that has to do with everyone\u0027s hands (which are of course all different) so there will be differences of opinion there. What works for me may not work for you and vice versa. The G700s is probably the best of the stuff they are pushing now though.

I cannot be sure of the technology behind my newly procured pointing mechanism. I can only surmise that there is some kind of exotic quantum anomaly being harnessed for the furtherment of Kerbalkind.

I think they\u0027ve had some ongoing quality issues for the last several years where someone high up decided that saving a few pennies on a quality switch was more important than selling a quality product. Needless to say when the second one died, all it took was a quick email to customer support and they sent me a brand new mouse, no questions asked, and said I could keep the one I had so at least they acknowledge that there was a problem with that model (G500).\n\nI still have an old MX-518 that works great though (was nice to have when the other mouse stopped working reliably and I was waiting for the replacement).\n\nSo anyways, the failure of mouse buttons is actually a relatively common issue, especially for cheaper (quality wise, not necessarily price) mice."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T22:58:48Z","Content":"I love my dads mouse.
