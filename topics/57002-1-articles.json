My first post after a while, it seems my old account was deleted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i suggested a couple of things, One of them being more sciency equipment when KSP was still in Alpha, ... Biodomes, and Fuel regeneration. Really glad the Developers included the Tech tree in career mode, and a purpose for space travel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to open this thread again, since the old one is long gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Suggestion: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, i understand that forum rules say that resource mining should not be posted as a suggestion, However, ... Being a Fact that the Moon ( Irl ) has an incredible amount of Helium 3, a source of possible fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis helium 3, when combined with deutrenium produces an incredible amount of energy, possibly powerful enough to produce electricity for a whole nation using only 30 Kilos of Helium 3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ofcourse happens when a Fusion process takes place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not a scientist, or havent done much Chemisty or physics, But reading this article made me think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.rocketcityspacepioneers.com/space/mining-the-moon-for-helium-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.rocketcityspacepioneers.com/space/mining-the-moon-for-helium-3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://news.discovery.com/space/project-icarus-helium-3-mining-uranus-110531.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://news.discovery.com/space/project-icarus-helium-3-mining-uranus-110531.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs i suggested earlier on Biodomes, and more extra vehicular activity in space and on planets, ... i browsed the Mod list in the KSP spaceport, and found one mod that had Biofuel Generator. - Apparently producing biofuels. However as people pointed out, you cant simply create mass out of nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i would like to suggest it again - I am well aware of the Mods for planetary and moon basing - It would be incredible Fun, if the Kerbals actually had to eat food, as a Required resource in space. This would probably make the gameplay more difficult, However, if Biodomes - or Glasshouses ( To produce food ) were introduced as part of a basing feature on planets or Moons, that could produce food to sustain the Kerbals, giving people more reason to stick around and do extraterrestrial activities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goo Science canister, and Soil sample features are excellent, though would be a shame if these features didnt have more detail in terms of game content. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i mean is, i would love to build a Moon station, that can actually mine Helium 3, and with that other minerals that could have precious use. I noticed since i spend lots of time landing on planets, and building bases, that once i landed and unpacked my bases, i still needed some sort of extending tube to connect to other ships. I also \u0022Imagined\u0022 Kerbals having a imaginary supply of food and Water which probably wouldn\u0027t last for long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for alternative Fuel sources, What about Hydrogen? ... Since rovers ( IRL ) actually discovered frozen crystals of Water. - Hydrogen can be used as a Fuel source in itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see more content in terms of Science and Utility from Squad. They have made a splendid job so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of Soil Samples, it would be crazy fun if the Devs added different Minerals, properties, and uses to these minerals other than just for Soil sampling this far. - Processing the Minerals, Experimenting its properties, etc would be fun, and dangerous to perform under different conditions on planets and moons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! - i love KSP and all the development and time invested in it, and hopefully more content will keep coming \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Money and Satellite income, ... would\u0027nt you just love to send a satellite in Orbit, and Know, it generates income as other Kerbals enjoy internet and Tv? Or to Build Facilities to communicate with the satelite? Or Kerbal ISP\u0027s actually paying you to use your comms? .. Unlocking another feature into the game. Money and Satellites! ..
