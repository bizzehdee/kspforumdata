I noticed a few days ago that the placement of the flag location \u0026lt;if enabled\u0026gt; on the hitchhiker module is not on center. I thought, ok, I am tired, I am seeing things, lets take a few days away from KSP,\u00A0 play something else, come back with fresh eyes. Ok. I did that. Nope, wasn\u0027t an artifact of me being tired or burned out on KSP. I kid you not, it is not centered on the module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022qbp3w8I.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qbp3w8I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have that module sitting on a 2.5m probe core \u0026lt;eventually this things going to the mun, but, for the moment, its a visual aid \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E \u0026gt; and I placed in 4x symmetry the cubic octagonal struts with that i \u0026lt;now that i managed to make the i show as a lowercase, how do i turn the correcting function back on for future posts???\u0026gt; beam is facing directly at the launch pad. Notice that it \u0026lt;the flag\u0026gt; is off by 2 panel lines to the left as we see it from being centered. I really wish I had not noticed this, its gonna itch at me now lol.
