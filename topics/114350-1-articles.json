If I remember correctly, I would place a node to go to Duna for instance, then I would effect the maneuver and would be able to view the tracking line from different angles and see exactly how it passes Duna. \n\nAnyone know which mod im referring to? Just need the name please.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T11:57:03Z","Content":"[Trajectory Optimization Tool](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476), maybe?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T12:10:08Z","Content":"Was it [PreciseNode](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-1-0-2-Precise-Node-1-1-3-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes) plus changing the focus or conics mode to view the trajectory?"},{"CreatedByName":"zipper0073","CreatedById":147070,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T16:32:15Z","Content":"That\u0027s it, Precise Node!
