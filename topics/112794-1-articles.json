Sure, they make solar panels useless for a few minutes, but there\u0027s no shadow. So Laythe can orbit right behind Jool and never go dark, and vice versa.\n\nAre there any mods that add eclipse shadows?\n\n![YKpGe6U.gif](http://i.imgur.com/YKpGe6U.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratzenblitz75","CreatedById":108287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T21:46:47Z","Content":"Agreed. I\u0027d really love to see eclipses in KSP. Especially in the Jool system where you\u0027d get to see Laythe/Vall/Tylo cast shadows onto Jool.\n\nI have no idea how hard it would be to implement though."},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T22:10:51Z","Content":"I believe that may be an eventual goal of [PlanetShine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96497-0-25-1-0-2-PlanetShine-v0-2-3-1).
