I\\\u0027m confident that you\\\u0027ve landed on the highest equatorial mountain on the Mun. Kerbalmanjero? The twin peaks of Kerbalmanjero?\n\nThe elevation in your first screenshot agrees within 14 metres of my measurement. I\\\u0027d say that this is pretty good considering that the measurement positions aren\\\u0027t identical (through no fault of your own). The position that I gave above for the highest measured point was rounded to the first decimal place. The precise position that I measured from orbit is located 154 metres away from your location on a heading of 105\u00C2\u00B0. This could easily account for the 14 metre difference.\n\nAnd for anyone who\\\u0027s interested, my radar altimeter works by emitting five \u0027rays\u0027, fanned out in a \u00C2\u00B140\u00C2\u00B0 arc under the orbiting spacecraft. I use the quaternion rotation identity to rotate the local \u0027down\u0027 vector about the spacecraft\\\u0027s velocity vector to orient the sensor rays. I sample at about 2 Hz, which corresponds to about 250 metres between sets of samples at typical orbital speeds. Unfortunately, the probe also has to orbit very close to the Munar surface for the radar to get valid returns, so the horizontal resolution is limited. Even using the fan technique, this means that the probe can only really measure directly below itself while passing over the highest peaks. Obviously the resolution can only be so good with this system, so I\\\u0027m not surprised that it didn\\\u0027t detect the higher point that you found located just west of my highest measured position. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E (Sorry for the mix-up on this morning\\\u0027s post.
