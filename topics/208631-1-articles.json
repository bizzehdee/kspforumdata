Better and/or more specifically tuned telescope readings gathered from a telescope in Kerbin orbit might reveal that the atmosphere isn\u0027t very thick after all. And if you send a probe with the right instruments to Duna to do science on its atmosphere, it\u0027ll give you a pretty good approximation that you could use to for example calculate what kind and how many parachutes you would need to safely land a given lander on the surface, as well as which kinds of rocket engines (Kerbin sea-level or vacuum or aerospike) would work best for using rocket engines to land on Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the only way to get \u0022the KSPedia entry\u0022 type stats (aka the game giving you exact numbers and not a range of values) would be to send in an atmospheric data-logging probe that characterizes the atmosphere as it descends thru it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the same would go for things like planetary gravity field, magnetic field (if we need to measure that to calculate radiation belt hazards for example around Jool), and other things about the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut for atmospheric composition, you might be able to get a pretty good idea from a distant space telescope observation (we\u0027ve been able to do that with the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars, so doing it for a planet within the same solar system shouldn\u0027t be hard at all in comparison).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m trying to say is that in gameplay terms, \u0022the player is responsible for gathering the data they will need to plan further exploration flights to that planet or moon\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you don\u0027t want to leave things to chance, you\u0027d have to fly several different missions to a planet in order to scout it out before having enough information to be able to design a lander that can land there (without it being overly heavy because it was over-designed to cope with the \u0022worst case scenario\u0022 of the space telescope observations (that approach would also be workable, but it would cost more in time and resources to build such a craft, obviously).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess my whole point is that such a system would lend itself quite easily to being integrated into the gameplay experience and not just limited to \u0022hey we got a bunch of neat scientific data that doesn\u0027t actually have an impact on the player\u0027s appreciation of science done for science\u0027s sake because it didn\u0027t answer any questions they were asking\u0022 like what happens when you give them for example a map of the gravity field of the body (matters if you\u0027re trying to map the inside of it without drilling into it, doesn\u0027t matter so much if you\u0027re just designing something to land on the surface).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess what I\u0027m trying to say is that the science data that is discovered (and presented as you describe) has to have a use to the player, or it won\u0027t stick in their mind that they\u0027re doing this for more reasons than just a means to an end (aka unlocking the next bunch of parts in the tech tree, if that\u0027s how it\u0027s even going to work).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Such a system would have the most impact if it were applied first to the new solar systems they are adding into the game, but adding it in to the existing Kerbol solar system would be a welcome addition as well, and if the game has the foundations for such a system in place in it\u0027s vanilla code, with the right hooks in it for mods to be able to use it as well, then that would be the ideal situation because every new planet pack you play with would have a whole lot more impact than just \u0022let\u0027s \u0027explore\u0027 cookie-cutter solar system #31 by using the standard-issue biome-hopper lander design and orbiting science lab\u0022 like you can sometimes run into with KSP 1 planet packs (at least the ones that are scaled closely to vanilla balance for the delta-V map).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-17T19:35:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2022 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcwaffles2003","CreatedById":180102,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-17T20:10:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed533275938\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192475-a-re-purposing-of-science/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy opinion on the matter is the same still.

Simple, NASA has to factor this into their calculations all the dang time, and it can \u003Cstrong\u003Ehelp\u003C/strong\u003E a space agency as often as it \u003Cstrong\u003Ehinders\u003C/strong\u003E them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, it would make designing the orbit for mapping probes (like SCANsat) a much more interesting problem to solve.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoth harder and easier at the same time, depending on which planet you intend to map the surface of.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor Kerbin, just like Earth, mapping would be relatively easy because all that is required is to launch into a Sun-Synchronous orbit (which would be provided to the player rather than them have to calculate it out on their own, after they have done a mission that gathers the appropriate scientific observations to the required accuracy, better quality readings reduces the margins on the calculated sun-synchronous orbit until you get a single value or as I called it in my last post \u0022the defining entry in the KSPedia\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe same would apply for Duna as well, however the numbers would (of course) be different.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIke might even have a sun-synchronous orbit, because despite being tidally locked (which usually precludes such things) it is indeed still rotating relative to the local star (Kerbol), just that the rate is nearly if not exactly the same as the rate of Duna\u0027s rotation relative to Kerbol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, where it hinders you is when you try to stay in a low orbit of a small moon that has a jumbled-up inside (didn\u0027t get a chance to fully settle into a mostly-spherical mass) leading to a mass distribution that is more \u0022lumps\u0022 than it is \u0022sphere\u0022. Like how the Moon is IRL. IRL the Moon only has 2 known low orbits which you can stay in for truly extended periods, called \u0022Magic orbits\u0022 because despite all the various Lunar mass concentrations pulling on the orbit in various ways, the orbit seems to be mostly stable where all other known low orbits around the Moon will eventually be perturbed into either an escape or impact trajectory\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a low orbit around the Mun (aside from some thoughtfully-placed \u0022magic orbits\u0022) would only be stable for I think a month of Kerbin days (long enough to do a mission, not quite long enough to put a space station in a low orbit of the Mun without spending a significant amount of propellant on maintaining the orbit), then it would either become an escape or an impact trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese magic orbits would be something that\u0027s not \u0022hidden until you do the science\u0022 per-se (so if you know about them from past experience playing KSP 2, you could just launch right to the magic orbit and it would work), but those magic orbits shouldn\u0027t be \u0022mostly equatorial\u0022 nor should they be \u0022mostly polar\u0022, that way you\u0027re less likely to \u0022stumble upon it\u0022 by accident and encounter an effect you can\u0027t explain at the time due to perhaps a lack of the appropriate sensor (if you even have to unlock any of the scientific data sensors, which IMO is something that should happen really early in the tech tree if they\u0027re not just all unlocked right when you have the opportunity to launch your first rocket).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically to discover a magic orbit would involve the same process used to discover special orbits around other bodies, namely sending up a probe with an instrument that measures the local gravity field and sends the data back to Kerbin to be worked on by scientists with computers who will analyze it to create a map of the gravity field, and then some more time number-crunching with a supercomputer to discover any special orbits that that body might have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, there\u0027s no firm requirement that such additions to the orbital physics of KSP 2 are even added while also adding this science data, but the \u0022special orbits\u0022 that could be discovered are significantly reduced without it. In fact, I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s any \u0022special orbits\u0022 other than just Geosynchronous orbit if you don\u0027t have non-spherical gravity sources, but even then with the right sensors you should be able to have the game spit out what the altitude of a circular geostationary orbit is, assuming the body isn\u0027t tidally locked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-20T18:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea posted in the other thread - a kind of Civilopedia (Kerbilopedia?) that \u0027fills itself out\u0027 or gets revealed over time as the player conducts science is an elegant concept.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think something like that would be a cool thing - where you can review the specifics of the target body and maybe that helps you with mission planning or ship construction.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EIt would also be a way to make doing the run make sense beyond \u0027oh look, I unlocked the gravity probe - quick let\u0027s run a few missions with that onboard so I can unlock radiators, next\u0027 thing\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-20T19:40:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that this is a game with simulation elements, not a simulation with game elements.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-20T21:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224147009\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208631\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221655754022\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that this is a game with simulation elements, not a simulation with game elements.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood point - but I\u0027m envisioning \u0027canned\u0027 reports that you can unlock along the way.\u00A0 I certainly don\u0027t want to have to actually analyze the science!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just think it would be fun and educational to have stuff about the planets revealed along the way as players progress - they can unlock and build their own Kerbilopedia in stages by skipping around doing science or deliberately doing something that will expand their knowledge of the target body.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike - if you run a temp check at Kerbin\u0027s Shores you get an entry about that added to your K-Pedia.\u00A0 When you repeat this while Flying Above Kerbin\u0027s Shores you ge an additional entry.\u00A0 Repeat in a different biome - more information about Kerbin.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore long, you know everything you can about the various biomes of Kerbin (=the page is almost full) - but then maybe you noticed that you forget to get a soil sample from Kerbin\u0027s Desert and can tell that from glancing through the K-Pedia.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-20T21:46:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all assuming that there are as many biomes in KSP 2 as there were in KSP 1.

Until Nate actually specifically says we\u0027re getting such a simulator, saying we\u0027re getting the kind of simulator you asked for is only bound to help cause the spread of misinformation. A like to a comment is not gospel - I am fairly confident that Nate did not pass your comment around his team before making the decision to like it. There\u0027s not enough putting emphasis on the fact that continuing to speculate and make assumptions without making it clear that you\u0027re just speculating is likely to cause misinformation to spread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
