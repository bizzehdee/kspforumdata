Please take some time to read them \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-October-27th-2013\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHERE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. We felt that it was important to flesh out the scope of the rules to match the needs of an ever-expanding community, as well as the needs of people who help shape the experience within it. In case you\u0027re wondering, the actual impact you\u0027ll feel from this revamp around the forum will be very little. The majority of you will be able to continue on as you always have. If you have any further questions or suggestions, feel free to use this thread in which to do so.
