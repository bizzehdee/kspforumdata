I want to start a general discussion on how to petition for space exploration, and ultimately colonization, but more importantly, how do we convince those people in our lives to do the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us address the elephant in the room, the first rebuttal. This is the notion that there are more important things in the world than sending people into space. We only need to employ some very simple logic, to show that nothing is farther than the truth. It is fairly easy to make a cursory survey of the items which will always be brought up, but we first need to talk about the most important core point. What is scarcity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScarcity is at the core of every argument, and discussion, about man kind and how we live. No matter what logical counterpoint you are given, it can always be brought back to this essential point. We will, in the beginning of this thesis, ignore emotional responses, and cover them later. If you think about it, the concept of finite resources is incredibly new to us as humans. Unfortunately, it really started setting in centuries before we ever could imagine that we actually could go anywhere else. It has now become ingrained, and must be eradicated from our social conciseness. This must be the central mission. The fact that we, as a community, are obsessed with the methods of exploration, must not overshadow the fact that exploration and colonization are essential for our survival, and freedom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us take counter arguments from inequality. Must we not ensure that our fellow man is given an equal opportunity, before we expend resources on flinging people into the solar system? Again, we come back to the idea of scarcity. While we will likely never devise a system that eliminates poverty, we can see that whenever humans are given the opportunity to go over the horizon, settle new lands, and use new resources, that inequality is reduced significantly. We have two options, we can attempt to remove people\u0027s freedom to profit from their labor, or we can give people the chance for everyone to profit. Both options are not easy, but only one option has negative societal consequences. When we have two options to help enrich our people, and one of them requires taking someones freedom, why should we be more inclined to choose this when there is an alternative? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us now consider the following response, \u0022we must keep the world we have clean, and devote all our resources to this venture\u0022. This ignores the fact that we will never control the world. Recycling every can will not stop the Chinese from demolishing our ozone, and continuing to upset the ecosystem. It will not prevent developing nations from using whatever dirty manufacturing methods are necessary to compete in the global market. If you are truly concerned about the future and wellbeing of our planet, and our species, then not having a backup plan on another world is unforgivable. You also ignore that the technology that we need to say, colonize Mars, is likely to help us develop better ways to clean up our own planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings us to one of the ultimate points, the phrase, \u0022This is the only world we\u0027ve got, so me might as well...\u0022. This state of being, a species with one world, is actually a fear that has been with us for a long time. However, historically, it pushed us to take action, unlike today. We have always sought future security for our offspring, and have ensured that there would be no way that we could all be wiped out, as far as we know. The fact that all of human life could be wiped out tomorrow, though nuclear war, or a super volcano, or an undetected asteroid, should scare you beyond belief. It sure scares me, more than anything I can imagine. I know it scares other people, why do we have disaster movies, which are so successful? This fear drives people like Elon Musk, and Robert Zubrin, possibly even people like Christopher Nolan. It must scare all of us, and we must make our leaders fear this fate as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where we must craft our arguments. Everyone I imagine I am speaking to must at least have some interest in the subject, but more importantly, an understanding of just how important it is to not just be a one planet species. I do ask, that we try and think of something that is more important, because this could be an incorrect thesis. I do not believe that it is, but if we discover that anything is more important, we should pursue that with all of our passion. If nothing else, we must generate a list of as many counter arguments as possible, and defeat them with logic, emotion, but preferably a combination of both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe must take these arguments to our friends, our family, everyone we know. If you really understand this, then you will realize that this is worth losing friendships over. if your friends do not want to hear about it, then they are ready to let humanity be wiped out. It really is that simple. We must make anyone who will listen understand this, and the urgency with which we must correct this oversight of our species. As much as I like superlatives, I want to eliminate the possibility that I could personally be the last living human. You could be too, unless we do something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with the following things in mind, I would ask to the help of anyone who would hear me.

The data is absolutely flawless. He lays out fantastically the events and trends which must occur for his model to continue to be correct. These being:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Children survive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Many children are not needed for work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Women get education and join the labor force\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Family planning is accessible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint one may or may not remain true. We will leave this as is, and assume trends will continue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint two is more of a point of divergence, with outcomes being completely dependent on the demographic area which you are surveying, and your optimism about future trends. The positive outcome assumes positively trending economic outcomes for the majority of people in a given nation. It is possible that the following will be an oversimplification, but I will make the point anyway. If we are witnessing developing nations tracking to the same trends which developed nations experienced in the past, then how do we reconcile the data which shows that many of these developed nations have reached Peak Economic Equality. As more people are given to producing things locally, and independently of industry (Industry making the use of children for labor unnecessary), is there not a reasonable possibility of seeing an increase in children being integrated into the family to produce their own goods and food? As Hans Rosling has suggested, this would be something which would contribute to an increase in births.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint three, may be a cause for concern in much the same fashion as point number two. Again, I stress that we undergoing a period of change, and that these trends may not be able to be predicted with accuracy, the new trends have not been given time to be known, however it is still an important factor to consider. If we are seeing college enrollment fall, regardless of gender, due to the same economic factors which are driving the local production of goods, then how will this affect the trend of continued education of women? Hans\u0027s assessment of this factor is, of course, accurate. However, we are only seeing data from when these populations have been recently afforded these opportunities. We do not yet have data which shows how education is affected in nations which have long had this access, and it is no longer a novel thing they have had to fight for. Complacency, and negative education trends, have had impacts on other historic cultures, in a variety of ways. Again, we do not yet have data to see where these trends will go, but that does not mean that we should blindly assume that, at the very least developed nations, will forever choose to become more educated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint four. This assumption only holds true assuming that we will never see an increase in the number of governments being influenced by fundamentalist religious principles. This again, is difficult to predict with accuracy. Religion has such a great emotional component, that we can not say with certainty that any particular industrialized, or developing nation, will never see a return to religious governance, in one form or another. Emotion of course, having the power to defy logic, and even the basic principle of self preservation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this correlates with with United Nations reporting on the topic, seen: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf\u003C/a\u003E . This data they are using is simply expository, not explanatory. It is not sufficient to state, \u0022these are the underlaying trends which drive the future of our growth\u0022, without also being able to say, \u0022and these are the underlying factors of these trends, which we can also say, with confidence, will remain constant\u0022. I am not disagreeing with their predictions, based on current data. I am simply trying to assess which other factors, which are more malleable, and subject to sometimes very rapid change, may cause the current model to become invalid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to diverge too greatly from the original topic, I just wanted to point out our potential for destructive societal change. Human progress has not been without setbacks. It is depressing to think about, but it is not untrue that we have, at times, done so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EComets, if we survive long enough to see the next big one coming, will have to be dealt with by interception and diversion. This actually isn\u0027t that hard; the tricky bit is seeing them in time, particularly the long-period comets from the Oort cloud, because they can come in from all sorts of weird angles and are unexpected by definition. This is yet another reason not to waste our resources on manned space flight. We desperately need 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 coverage by dedicated comet-hunting orbital telescopes.\u003Cp\u003EBut comets, mega-volcanoes and such are black swan events that are a relatively low risk in the near future. The biggest threat facing humanity today is climate change, by a very large margin. If you aren\u0027t terrified by the climate situation, then you don\u0027t understand it. As with famine, poverty and ignorance, we have the technological ability to solve this problem [4]; what we lack is the political will to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely agree with the development of a full NEO, and far field, detection system. This is, of course, incredibly important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the point of climate change, this is of course a grave concern. What is most concerning is what you are most correct about, that it is not an engineering problem, but a problem of human cooperation. It is not enough for every member of this nation to cry out to prevent catastrophe. The easy portion of solving this, would be to inform the global citizenry to the point where they will act upon this. The difficulty, is then convincing these same citizens to dismantle the structures of political power and industry, which will fight with every fiber of their being to prevent such action. If we could, tomorrow, pass sweeping regulations which curb carbon output, responsibly dispose of our edible live stock population, and drastically reduce our energy usage, such that it could be sustained with nuclear and renewable power alone, it would do nothing to stop, say, China.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether or not arguing, that since we have never had a unified global will to do something, we will never do so, is a fallacy of tradition, or a set of data, is debatable. Even if we consider the previous remarks as invalid, we can still extrapolate three primary outcomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. We will, as a species, do the right thing, and deploy the regulations and technology to save our planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. We will continue at our current level of cooperation, and rate of progress towards curbing climate change, and likely still have our planet affected in a negative way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. An unexpected social event, or series of events will occur, we will cooperate less towards this goal, and our environment will be damaged severely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo simplify:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Action: Positive change. Outcome: Positive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Action: No change. Outcome: Negative\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Action. Negative change. Outcome: Negative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo eliminate the bias of pessimism versus optimism, let us consider an equally likely chance of these actions coming to pass. We see that this matrix leads to a greater likelihood of a negative outcome. I do not ask you to take this to heart, as any given reader will have an opinion as to whether we can overcome the human cooperation factor, I simply ask you to read this argument, at least once, from a point of optimistic neutrality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[2] \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[3] There are genuine problems linked to GM, but they\u0027re all to do with intellectual property and profiteering bastardry by some large biotech corporations.

The best thing we can hope for now is to try and minimise the damage and hope that the worst-case scenarios don\u0027t come true. This is not a good bet; so far, the trend has been that the nasty side of the error bars is the situation that comes to pass. For the last thirty years, if you want to find out what the future held, what you should\u0027ve done was listened to the climate researchers who were being dismissed as hyperbolic scaremongers at the time. They\u0027ve been right almost every time. There\u0027s been a lake at the north pole during summer for ten years, and the Siberian methane clathrates are bubbling to the surface as we speak. In a sane world, we would have shut down the coal industry twenty years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour third annotation is fantastic.

This is also a wonderful example of a negative educational outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo your fourth annotation, this fact is why I had proposed the original argument I did, in the way I did. We are seeing data which shows that we will choose not to cooperate towards the positive outcome. Our short term self interest will ultimately outweigh our long term self interest. This is why I have chosen the path of supporting a mission to simply go elsewhere. If we are going to save ourselves, from ourselves, any solution proposed must, by its nature, not disrupt our personal comfort in the near term if it is to succeed. The right thing to do is to take care of the planet we have. If we can not have successful outcomes with this approach, we must find an alternative one, to at least have as a backup, while we continue to try to have a positive influence on our planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, it would be nice if we had some other planet available that could support human life. If we had the option of establishing a viable self-sufficient colony on some other planet or in orbit, it would probably be a sensible thing to do, if only as insurance against an unexpected comet.\u003Cp\u003EBut there isn\u0027t. It sucks, but that\u0027s just the way it is, and wishful thinking won\u0027t change that. The universe is unforgiving like that; it doesn\u0027t care what humans want or believe. This world is the only human-friendly planet that we have for the foreseeable future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not the sort of problem that you can solve by throwing money at it, either. Yeah, if we committed an insane amount of resources, we could probably keep a handful of humans alive on Mars. But they wouldn\u0027t be self-sufficient, and that makes them useless as an insurance policy: shortly after Earth dies, so do they.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus you\u0027d probably lose the entire settlement several times over while we worked out the bugs. Resupply missions won\u0027t prevent that; the nature of survival in space is such that you usually can\u0027t wait around six months for the supply ship to show up with the parts you need. When stuff goes wrong in space, you\u0027ve often only got minutes or seconds to deal with it before you\u0027re all dead. The problems of the Plymouth colony (almost wiped out) or the Viking settlements in Greenland (were wiped out) are trivial compared to the hazards of Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are correct, that this is not simply something we can throw money at, that is the wrong approach. We must throw engineers at it. We are just as good at solving technical problems, as we are poor at solving social ones. That is all the colonization of Mars is, a technical problem. If the base elements needed to support life exist in a place, however unlikely, then it is simply a matter of using our ingenuity to create the most efficient and sustainable methods of utilizing them. You are correct, we have the methods of correcting our global environmental crisis, the remaining issues are socio-political ones. So if it is not engineers which we need to help solve this crisis, then why not get them working on finding better ways to survive, in ever more hostile places. Think about the benefit, if we are going to have to learn to live in a world which have made less habitable for ourselves, then why not gain some experience in one of the least habitable (but not uninhabitable), places we know of?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-19T02:32:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2014 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by saabstory88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Airlock","CreatedById":101601,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T06:12:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI share many of my views on human spaceflight with acclaimed visionaries like Clarke, Dyson, and O\u0027Neill.
