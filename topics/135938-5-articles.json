distances of a few hundred meters, or at best, a few kilometers. \u00A0In the books, battles take place at ranges of 500,000km for energy range, and millions of kilometers for missile combat, with several minutes of flight time before contact.*** \u00A0Of course, that sort of battle would be unfilmable, and most accepted that we would get scenes where both sides\u0027 ships would be onscreen at the same time, but again, it would be inconsistent with the internal tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy involvement with this is that I work with a fan group (BuNine) that answers only to David Weber (and sometimes we tell him he\u0027s wrong, and he makes changes accordingly)****, and we do background on the politics, tech, organization, and other stuff based on the series. \u00A0This is considered canon by David,\u00A0after his overall approval. \u00A0We\u0027ve even published the first of three \u0022companions\u0022 (House of Steel) to flesh out the Manticoran and Grayson factions in the series. \u00A0Lots of stuff not included in the main books, but everything is canon as far as internal consistency. \u00A0My job for BuNine is being a 3D modeler for the warships in the series. \u00A0This is where I butted heads (indirectly, as I never talked to them personally) with the movie people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, it was a mess, but Evergreen went under and the movie isn\u0027t being made now. \u00A0Maybe when the movie rights revert back to David, he can get someone else to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr -

This is SF that\u0027s fully in the \u0022fantasy\u0022 side of SF, but harder than SW, for example.

distances of a few hundred meters, or at best, a few kilometers. \u00A0In the books, battles take place at ranges of 500,000km for energy range, and millions of kilometers for missile combat, with several minutes of flight time before contact.*** \u00A0Of course, that sort of battle would be unfilmable, and most accepted that we would get scenes where both sides\u0027 ships would be onscreen at the same time, but again, it would be inconsistent with the internal tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy involvement with this is that I work with a fan group (BuNine) that answers only to David Weber (and sometimes we tell him he\u0027s wrong, and he makes changes accordingly)****, and we do background on the politics, tech, organization, and other stuff based on the series. \u00A0This is considered canon by David,\u00A0after his overall approval. \u00A0We\u0027ve even published the first of three \u0022companions\u0022 (House of Steel) to flesh out the Manticoran and Grayson factions in the series. \u00A0Lots of stuff not included in the main books, but everything is canon as far as internal consistency. \u00A0My job for BuNine is being a 3D modeler for the warships in the series. \u00A0This is where I butted heads (indirectly, as I never talked to them personally) with the movie people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, it was a mess, but Evergreen went under and the movie isn\u0027t being made now. \u00A0Maybe when the movie rights revert back to David, he can get someone else to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr -
