I did not want to install and learn some 3d program just for modding some tanks and so looked for an easier way to do it. Eventually I discovered that you can use Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files to render the skin. You can create these in MS Paint and other programs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this has not been covered already and enough people want more info on how to do this, I will do a write-up on this thread.

Create a new .cfg, use a new name for the part, select the relevant model(.mu), change whatever resources as you like, then add a line that gives it a new texture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also suggest making a copy of the ksp before messing around with the .cfgs.
