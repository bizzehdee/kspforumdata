It was a great series i personally enjoyed it a lot, So in the season of Easter and the day of this discussion/poll, I\u0027d like to see what you guys would like to see in a portal 3?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally would like to see a new character introduced as Chell as been beating GLaDOS for a while now and portal 2 ended in the final battle i guess (Wasn\u0027t able to finish portal 2). So i\u0027d like to see a new person being tested by GLaDOS or some other AI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing i\u0027d like to see in a portal 3 is when you shoot all cameras in a chamber in a certain chamber you unlock a secret door to an Easter egg or a portal gun before you get one in the story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy last few things i\u0027d love to see in a portal 3 is an inventory, Like you can keep cubes and stuff so when you walk through the emancipation grids they don\u0027t get destroyed, Another thing is random test malfunctions like the AI would be talking and it would speed the sentence then the lights would flash and a portal would open either helping or not helping you, Always being a secondary route if it was to happen. In the pole i\u0027ll have some different suggestions, You vote on what one you\u0027d like to see best!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy launching!
