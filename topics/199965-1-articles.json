hope you like it or at least some parts of it, sorry for the occasional mistakes, English is not my native language.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA long time ago a planet-scale event happened, forcing all Kerbals to go underground to survive.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey tried to resurface many times but with no avail.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere was evidence of a new type of radiation destroying and killing almost everything.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome brave souls always ventured outside to figure out the source of this deadly menace.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven the strongest Kerbal materials were literally melting over a period of time and fauna was completely extinct after only few decades.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome flora somehow survived, maybe mutating and withstanding at some base level this new type of radiation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTime passed on and scientists were clueless with no idea why this was happening.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTheir models showed that there is a planet wide event, a re occurring radiation burst every few hundred years, covering all the planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThankfully the soil absorbed enough to make living underground barely viable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter the bursts ended the radiation was usually quickly dispersed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe surface could sustain some life but barely and everytime conditions got worse and worse.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSlowly but reluctantly the Kerbals decided to dedicate in a full underground life\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey realized they couldn\u0027t afford to split their resources above and underground.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFew years ago, mystery transmitions of some kind of data were detected from some research outposts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey were coming from various places around the Kerbin and even some extremely feint signals from the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt looked like they contained data of incomplete blueprints and technologies beyond any wild imagination.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs studies on them continued, the source of this re occurring planet-wide event was finally unveiled.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow named \u0027\u0027Artifacts\u0027\u0027 or \u0027\u0027Obelisks\u0027\u0027 they seemed to be devices to store information of a civilization long past gone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey were likely pre-programmed to transmit their data at a certain time period.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately their power source started leaking, causing this deadly radiation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis technology was beyond of anything Kerbals have ever seen.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTempering with it and trying to fix it or even destroy it was too risky and could make things worse very easily and very fast.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThankfully these devices seemed to have an automated system to contain these leaks.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem was it could only operate continuously for a few hundred years before it needed to do some type of cooldown.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbals finally had a breakthrough.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey could study these monuments and their data that contained technologies and blueprints that they didn\u0027t even seem possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLuck was finally on the horizon, these Artifacts could offer a way to traverse the galaxy and maybe even colonize it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe even leave it entirely...\u003Cbr\u003E\nA plan, a dream was materialized, there was a chance that they would live no more underground.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe scientists and the engineers decided it was worth to fully commit in this endeavor.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe statistics showed that there was\u00A0enough time to study and acquire the knowledge to create a space program that hopefully would lead the first attempt to colonize other planets.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbals accepted long time ago that their planet was lost.Even if the radiation bursts stopped,\u003Cbr\u003E\nlife could never be the same.Now there was hope, now there was\u00A0a goal.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nInside the mountain cities and underground bunkers Kerbals were bursting with\u00A0excitement.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey designed and build whatever they could within the tight space and materials in hand.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen it would be safe enough, they would venture out and start\u00A0 building and launching the first crazy contraptions to go beyond anyone has ever dreamed for.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe feint signals , that now is known as a certainty\u00A0that\u00A0they come throughout the whole galaxy,\u003Cbr\u003E\nindicate even more insane contraptions and technologies waiting to be conquered.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe data is incomplete and\u00A0it almost seems\u00A0 like a galaxy-wide sized puzzle waiting to be solved.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey have some time and they are not gonna miss the chance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbals want to live above the ground, if its not on Kerbin it will be on the surface of a different planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbin is lost...but hope is not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
