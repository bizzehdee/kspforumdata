The theoretical reason for this difference is that in stock, terminal velocity (which is optimal ascent velocity) is low and easily reachable with low TWR. Thus, there is no benefit of high TWR since it will not be used. In FAR, terminal velocity is essentially unreachable, and thus, there are petential benefits of high TWR craft. Furthermore, the potential for a pilot-induced sub-optimal gravity turn, which could easily bleed off a few hundred m/s deltaV if you raise apoapsis too high upon liftoff or stay too low for too long. Thus, vertical ascent could match gravity turn under the right conditions.\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, Kerbin isn\u0027t the only planet. My question is if you are on the Mun such that Kerbin is perpetually setting (since the Mun is tidally locked) i.e. on the rear-side of the planet w.r.t.

I think it\u0027s allowed us to see what\u0027s going on and give analysis and suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about your craft is that it has a really high TWR, and as such you\u0027re not really performing a gravity turn since the TWR is so high. If you look at some FAR ascent videos with TWR of about 1.4-1.5, you\u0027ll see what happens is that at 50 m/s, you pitch over about 5 degrees (depending on your TWR and other factors), and then turn off SAS and basically let the rocket fly itself. This works well for small and large rockets, and makes the likelihood of breaking apart due to aerodynamic stress very low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity turns actually require very little control input, because you need to pitch over so little. 4 of the controllable winglets is sufficient (and as far as I can tell, in FAR with large crafts, drag is extremely high if you don\u0027t have fins of some sort, so you need them no matter what). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend that you try to build the same rocket except with just a skipper engine instead of a mainsail (it will have a TWR of 1.47). Do a gravity turn like I described above. if you do it right, you shouldn\u0027t have to give any input after the initial turn, and your trajectory will be about 45 degrees at 10km, and flatten out fairly close to horizontal when your AP reaches 80km or so. Circularize at 80km, and transfer to the Mun. I bet you\u0027ll wind up with more delta-V than either of your two existing tests, even though this rocket is cheaper, and has less thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might have to try a few times to get things just right, but like any skill it takes practice, and once you get it, you\u0027ll be able to reliably do it in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-15T01:32:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2014 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T01:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rkman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rkman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor all i know this is an issue of basic rocketry: the more time you spent \u0027fighting gravity\u0027 - that is to say moving more or less opposite to the direction of gravity instead of more or less perpendicular - the higher the gravity loss (speed loss due to gravity), and the more dV you need to get where you want to go.\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why getting to LKO is more efficient with a gravity turn (and even something that looks like a gravity turn but isn\u0027t really a gravity turn) than by going straight up until you clear the atmosphere and then burning sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing vertical up to the Mun means spending even more time moving right against the direction of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou basically ignored the concrete mathematical numbers i gave in favor of vertical ascent for this case....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T01:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EArkie,\u003Cp\u003E You missed the \u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E reason why your vertical profile showed smaller losses as compared to prograde, and I had specifically told you in that thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You had accelerated at a wastefully- high rate, and your drag losses were exorbitant.

I think it\u0027s allowed us to see what\u0027s going on and give analysis and suggestions.\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about your craft is that it has a really high TWR, and as such you\u0027re not really performing a gravity turn since the TWR is so high. If you look at some FAR ascent videos with TWR of about 1.4-1.5, you\u0027ll see what happens is that at 50 m/s, you pitch over about 5 degrees (depending on your TWR and other factors), and then turn off SAS and basically let the rocket fly itself. This works well for small and large rockets, and makes the likelihood of breaking apart due to aerodynamic stress very low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity turns actually require very little control input, because you need to pitch over so little. 4 of the controllable winglets is sufficient (and as far as I can tell, in FAR with large crafts, drag is extremely high if you don\u0027t have fins of some sort, so you need them no matter what). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend that you try to build the same rocket except with just a skipper engine instead of a mainsail (it will have a TWR of 1.47). Do a gravity turn like I described above. if you do it right, you shouldn\u0027t have to give any input after the initial turn, and your trajectory will be about 45 degrees at 10km, and flatten out fairly close to horizontal when your AP reaches 80km or so. Circularize at 80km, and transfer to the Mun. I bet you\u0027ll wind up with more delta-V than either of your two existing tests, even though this rocket is cheaper, and has less thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might have to try a few times to get things just right, but like any skill it takes practice, and once you get it, you\u0027ll be able to reliably do it in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try with lower TWR.
