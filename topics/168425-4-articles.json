The marginal cost of selling a copy of a videogame is very low - it was pretty low even before digital distribution, and now it\u0027s almost nothing. Even if it turns out a game is a flop and the expenses will never be recouped, it\u0027s worth selling copies at a price that doesn\u0027t amortise the production costs because they are already spent; it still reduces the losses. The only minimum price point they \u003Cu\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E go lower than is the marginal cost of distribution, which is tiny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat they could charge less than they spent to make it hardly means that it\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Ereasonable\u003C/strong\u003E to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-23T18:39:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have 4000hrs of game play...\u003Cbr\u003E\nworth every penny... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-24T01:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust fine to me.
