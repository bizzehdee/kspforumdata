So I recently started making mods for KSP nothing special I am trying to learn how to do it. After a lengthy time getting my first part I ever made into KSP and finally with some help to get it to work I have been able to make parts. Now I want to try to do a planet. I am very confused. There seems to be no good documentation on it and what I have found even confuses me more. I see there are a bunch of planet makers out there and I am unsure which one to use between Kopernicus, Kopernicustech I am unsure which of these 2 to use neither of them have any documentation on them and any tutorial I find sets me back like 50 steps. If I am to use Kopernicus is there a Kopernicus overlay in KSP cause if so I can not find it. I found that if I press CTRL\u002BP in Kopernicustech it brings up a menu but nothing happens when I try to play with it. If anyone can point me to the right direction of some kind of documentation for either or explain the difference of these two mods I would greatly appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T01:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should only ever use Kopernicus, seeing as it\u0027s the one that basically \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E planet pack uses, including OPM, New Horizons, Arkas, Asclepius, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also the example configs, which are probably the most helpful source for Kopernicus (besides other people): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.github.com/Kopernicus/KopernicusExamples/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.github.com/Kopernicus/KopernicusExamples/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome basic steps to get started:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1. copy over one of the examples (cfg, textures, everything) from the Creating New Bodies folder, and make sure all of the files have the same folder path relative to your gamedata as it is in the github repository.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. tweak a few settings in the config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3. run KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should get you started, but there are many different ways to go about making your planets, including generating them procedurally, using height and color maps, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a million and one settings you can tweak, and coupled with all of the nuances of Kopernicus, and the very minimal documentation, It\u0027s sure to be a bit of a headache to start.
