Yes its low but without part clipping thats where I do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClaims to fame - It can deliver 3-4 tonne payloads landed at my Minmas base and then return to the kerbin base easy.

Works way better than I had expected. Before entering the atmosphere I usually transfer all the remaining fuel as far forward as possible to get my center of mass nice and even again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent attempts: Duna and return should be doable but so far the thin atmosphere and rocky terrain of Duna have made landing quite tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I am thinking it should be able to make the run to my new Laythe base but my return will probably be by that electic motor only and I haven\u0027t had the time to try it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy SSTO rules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. At take-off if you can\u0027t pitch up and accelerate vertically it probably won\u0027t make it to space. I find this a good rule as while at low heights you have a lot of atmosphere to work with but when you get higher your machine has to be able to pitch up and down in much thinner air and you need a decent TWR to push your aircraft as fast as possible before switching to rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Ensure your thrust is centered vertically on your mass. This seems simple but it wasn\u0027t for me. You will know something is wrong if as you climb higher your nose gets harder and harder to hold either up or down. What is occuring is that as the air thins your control surfaces aren\u0027t able to overcome the imbalance of your design. At a quick look this might be an issue for you. Remember you are not only designing a airplane for surface conditions but also for the much thinner air way up high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Your Grampa flew in a bi-plane and so should you. I find 2-3 levels of wings can greatly enhance my ability to have lots of lift without requiring the strength to have a super wide airplane (again I am also almost at runway width so this is pretty much necessary to do it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Bigger is better. Its nice that people build little space planes that get to orbit but they can\u0027t probably move more than 1 tonne up at a time and without part clipping / mods its very difficult to build them. I\u0027m guessing you are like me and looking for something more useful that is able to deliver meaningful payloads into space. If so go big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also lose speed in the change-over to rocket power but its mostly because if I snap on all the rockets at once my wings tend to snap off so I have to feather the throttle in over 3-4 seconds from 0 - 100%. It doesn\u0027t seem to cause me much issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly Personally I have never had much luck just using a nuke engine to push me into space. I would recommend some 24-77s. They aren\u0027t very efficient but they can give you that 30 second boost you need to clear the atmosphere much better than the nuke can and they don\u0027t up your mass much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T19:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be an issue of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy are you throttled back in the first picture?

This will require getting high into the atmosphere (\u0026gt;28k) where there is less air resistance. This will require many ram air intakes, and a single engine to prevent loss of control from engine sputtering due to lack of oxygen. A single engine will require a light vehicle, which is no problem for an ion ssto, coupled with the jet engine and one fuel tank. Practice getting into that sweet spot of having barely enough oxygen and still be at full throttle, at the right altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this altitude, the solar panels can be opened without fear of them breaking off (due to less air resistance).

You can place them without part-clipping using cubic octagonal struts and spacing them out along wings and fuselage (must face forward to be effective), but I find it more aesthetically appealing to clip them one-behind-the-other, in a column to each side of the main fuselage (if you do it right you don\u0027t need the debug panel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Minimize your oxidizer to what you absolutely need, as rocket-style fuel tanks are heavy, and draw fuel from airplane fuselages (be aware the mk1 is less efficient than the mk2 in regards to fuel/weight). I\u0027m going to put this into caps as it is all-important: WEIGHT IS NOT YOUR FRIEND! Trim everything you don\u0027t need. I once designed a plane that jettisoned the landing gear (with parachutes attached of course so they could be \u0022recovered\u0022), and relied on parachutes to \u0022land\u0022 with, because each of the landing gear costs half a ton and the parachutes weighed so much less (that, and I wasn\u0027t \u0022good\u0022 at landing on runways yet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E - more about that below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) This suggestion is all mine, based on what works for me (thus, YMMV) - wings generate lift, and you need enough lift to take off. However lift come from increasing drag. Having too much lift thus generates extra drag, which impedes your thrust potential. How much lift do you need? My rule of thumb, is that if you can\u0027t take off at less than 100 m/s, you need more lift, and if you can take off at less than 50 m/s, you may have too much lift. Some of my failed spaceplanes turned into successes just by removing some of the lifting surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Center of Mass must always stay in front of Center of Lift, but should still be as close as possible (you need it close so the plane stays responsive). This isn\u0027t as easy as just clicking the buttons and looking at the spots. As you use fuel and oxidizer, the center of mass changes. You have to figure out where the Center of Mass will end up at, as well as how it will shift in flight. Determine what percentage weight of fuel (meaning, total weight minus dry weight) is on each side of your initial CoM. You can add extra parts temporarily to the opposing side to simulate the mass balance with dry tanks. Once you know the final CoM position, work out how the CoM moves during flight. 99% of all spaceplanes drain fuel front-to-back, sending your CoM to the back of your plane before it eventually moves forward. I, however, represent the 1% (actually, I\u0027ve never seen this recommendation online, anywhere, so this is another one from me) that disconnects the engines from the fuel columns (using that nice cubic octagonal strut) and runs fuel lines to the front of the fuel columns. In my planes, the fuel drains back-to-front, sending my CoM forward first; thus as long as my CoL is behind both my initial CoM and final CoM, I know I won\u0027t encounter stability issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Center of Thrust should be behind both CoM and CoL at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Horizontal symmetry is vital. You can get away with a telescoping ladder on one side of the nose, but you will be able to see the difference in how the plane tries to yaw to the right. Anything more off-symmetry is asking for trouble. Vertical symmetry is almost as vital - your plane may flip over, in flight or in space, if you don\u0027t have this, but you can get away with some violations by using reaction wheels to compensate (but only up to a point, after which badness happens).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Odd numbers of jet engines are preferable, with the center jet engine placed last (more on this below). If you have an even number of jet engines, your spaceplane is automatically rated as \u0022expert pilots only\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Start small. Get a spaceplane that has no cargo/docking/whatever capacity into orbit, before thinking about larger spaceplanes that can deliver cargo. When you go bigger, do it incrementally. So many more things can go wrong with spaceplane designs when compared to rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) Put your excess intakes into an action group, deactivate them on the runway, and reactivate them only when they are needed (at about 0.08 IntakeAir per engine) - this cuts down on drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Figure out how high you can go, yet still be able to pitch down into level flight at the slow horizontal velocity you have (you may need to revert several times while doing this \u0022flight testing\u0022). The question is basically, how much of the thick draggy air can you get out of, coming right off the runway? From there you can build up horizontal velocity and increase altitude further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12) As IntakeAir drops under 0.08 per engine, you can throttle down proportionately. If you don\u0027t do it quite right, one engine will \u0022flame out\u0022 - simply reduce your throttle until the engine reactivates, then increase again, but not to the previous level. It is the experience of other posters that the last engine to be placed, is the one that flames out first. Having your center engine placed last, thus helps it flame out first, eliminating any spinning issues resulting from this (provided you adjust before a second engine flames out, that is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13) Before thinking of going into space, you should be able to hit 30km altitude and 2000m/s horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14) It is my experience that my apoapsis is exceeding 125km altitude, and my periapsis is above 25km, before I worry about rockets at all (that\u0027s right, my \u0022orbit\u0022 is almost entirely in place before I leave atmo). I don\u0027t tend to \u0022pitch up\u0022 to get to space, so much as I \u0022fly straight out of atmo\u0022. It is also my experience that its best to wait until I\u0027m close to apogee before doing any rocket burns (even if not quite in space yet) - that oxidizer, being so heavy, is too precious to waste on increasing atmospheric drag through its use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Use small rockets as most of your dV comes from your jets. I\u0027d be overjoyed to see a 400\u002B Isp rocket with a thrust rating of 1-2 and a mass of less than 0.1 tons, but since I play 99% stock, I take what I can get (2xRockomax 24-77). I find I don\u0027t need the thrust ability of this rocket, but its weight is good, and I typically need more than an equivalent weight of LV-1Rs would produce (and the 24-77 has slightly better Isp).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Pointer for re-entry: if you aim to de-orbit your periapsis to about 35km, and do this on the opposite side of Kerbin to KSC, you will find yourself close to KSC when you\u0027re ready to land. You may need to tweak the altitude and burn-position based on your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) Pointer #1 for landing: construct a rover and place them directly east and west of the runway, at a distance of \u0026gt;500m. On your approach, you can target the nearest with your navball so as to line up early, and you can see them highlighted on your HUD, so you can keep them lined up vertically, and thus keep lined up with the runway (think of it as an \u0022instrument landing system\u0022). Be careful though - if you park the rovers too close, the game may want to clear them out before letting you take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) Pointer #2 for landing: once you have your distance to the closest rover, add the distance to the runway, and divide the total by 10. That number should be your altitude. You should descend 100m per kilometer on your approach. This instantly tells you if you are too high or too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12) Pointer #3 for landing: use a flight-stick. Seriously. Keyboard airstrip landings are a nightmare, and a big reason I did parachute landings for awhile. Flight-sticks aren\u0027t exactly a dream (proper landings are difficult, even with the quasi-instrument-landing-system set up with #10 and #11), but waking up from a nightmare is still a major improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13) This is one of my suggestions, as a private pilot: build and fly a small airplane first - not a spaceplane. Give it lots of fuel. Then, practice your landings. Land, take back off without stopping, circle around, and try it again. This is known as \u0022touch and go\u0022. Get good at landings; the most stressful part of flying a spaceplane is landing at the very end, when you\u0027ve done everything you set out to do, but that one last thing can screw everything up. You can\u0027t quicksave while moving in atmo; you\u0027d have to reload from when you\u0027re in space (which probably means having to do your deorbit burn again too); and it takes time to get back to your landing attempt from space as you\u0027re limited to x4 physics warp (if your plane can handle even that). If you get impatient to do spaceplane launches, ditch the landing gear and descend on parachutes like I talked about earlier. It\u0027ll save you the headache.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all I can think of at the moment, but I probably forgot something somewhere. Time will tell.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starglider","CreatedById":82321,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T05:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, Kerbil Engineer Redux is your friend.

I would recommend you use landing legs and point your plane vertically for takeoff, since the landing legs are much lighter than wheels. The wheels are 0.5 kg each while the heavy-duty landing gear are only 0.1 kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy take off vertically? Although this requires a thrust-to-weight ratio of above 1, I think that\u0027s great because it means you\u0027ll be able to get to higher speeds at higher altitudes using just your jet engines, which in turn means you\u0027ll have less delta V left for your rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI take off, fly my plane to 25 km, then level off and start gaining speed. I basically just go as fast and as I as I can go, re-igniting my engine whenever I flame out.

Once I get to above 50 km, I shut off the ant engines and the ion engines are enough to get me into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, make sure to take off just before dawn so the ion engines work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-06T01:39:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2013 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Andrew Hansen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WafflesToo","CreatedById":71736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T16:33:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not THAT experienced of a spaceplane designer but I\u0027m confident in my ion-fu.
