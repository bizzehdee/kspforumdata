I have been playing ksp for almost two years now and i wanted to tell\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou how it all began. Two years ago one of my friends told me about a game in wich you build rockets and you fly them to other planets. The game as i found out later was called Kerbal space program. So i looked at the website (the old one)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand found that the game was quiet expensive. So i downloaded the demo version, it was 0.14 it had only kerbin and the mun! I was surprised to find that it wasn\u0027t the earth or the mun!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout six months later i bought the full version it was 0.25 and 0.90 was in the making. When 0.90 was realesed i was very happy! I don\u0027t know if you guys remember 0.90 but there were many new parts! A big realese.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen they realesed 1.0 and i don\u0027t know if they realesed the next versions very fast or that i missed them but i didn\u0027t get\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.0.2 1.0.3 but i re-joined the website in 1.0.4 and then i joined the forum by the name of Planet Missions. But i didn\u0027t go far on that profile i soon lost intrest in the forum and whent back to playing the game. 1.0.5 was a big realese and a lot of new parts. And after that we waited a long time for 1.1 when the\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nexperimental version was realesed i re-joined the forum by the name of Jeb-head-mug kerman. \u00A0A few months later i made my first mod.\u00A0And then 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo whats your ksp story?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-31T22:34:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2016 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jeb-head-mug kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BT Industries","CreatedById":156823,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T23:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery similar to yours\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T23:50:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started way back in 0.8.5 when a friend pointed it out to me.\u00A0 It was simple fun, making big monstrosities, trying to make orbit by trial and error, trying out a few basic mods.\u00A0 There was no mun yet, and I fell out of it for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI returned when they added the mun, and managed to hit it several times with basic orbital mapping but no patched conics.\u00A0 Note the word \u0027hit\u0027, not \u0027land\u0027.\u00A0 That was quite entertaining for a while, and eventually I managed to actually land, and keep all my engines and at least half of the eight landing legs.\u00A0 I was impressed, and when preorders came out I jumped in line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my first time seriously tackling career mode.\u00A0 I gave it an offhand try before but worked myself into a corner, this time I\u0027m making real progress, I think.\u00A0 We\u0027ll see.\u00A0 If I unlock the whole tech tree I\u0027ll call that a win.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T00:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I chanced upon it while browsing the Steam store.
