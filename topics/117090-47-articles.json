Here\u0027s why:\n\n\\*BEGIN LONG WINDED TECHNICAL DISCUSSION\\*\n\nHydrolox engines have much higher Isp than kerolox engines, but in real life that comes at a price - you need much larger tank volume and you have to deal with boiloff.  In KSP, neither of those things exist, so using raw, real world I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E numbers for the comparison is going to make hydrolox engines look very good and kerolox engines look bad.  So I think it might make sense to scale the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E based on the mixture before doing the comparison.  KSP engines have I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E values pretty close to real world kerolox engines (well, actually a bit closer to hypergolics but the difference is only about 5%.  The conversion factor that RealFuels uses to compare I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E between hydrolox and kerlolox engines is 1.27 (vacuum) / 1.3 (sea level).  Applying a scale of 1.27 would give the RL10 a vacuum Isp of 364s, which is high for stock engines, but not way outside the range (particularly considering how low the thrust is).  If you apply the hypergolic scaling too, you get 346s ... at this point it might be more reasonable to apply the scaling you did to begin with."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T22:08:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Whats under that fairing must be realy heavy!\n\u003E \n\nThat was just a test without a payload, but I use the final one to lift an entire space station into orbit.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7rXsdUbLpU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7rXsdUbLpU) for the current version with a very light load, just because it looks cool ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) Sorry for the choppy editing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-21T22:13:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2015 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T02:22:46Z","Content":"AJ10-190 semi-final geometry (Shuttle OMS, Orion-SM Main-Engine) -- This one is about 1/2 the diameter of the AJ10-137 (0.7m vs 1.6m)\n\nAlso uses a unique (so far that I\u0027ve seen) three-ring gimbal assembly, where the thrust is actually transmitted through the ring structure.\n\n![i2LCYqJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/i2LCYqJ.png)\n\nNot sure if I like the current cage structure; but there needs to be some sort of truss-setup, as this engine traditionally mounts at the gimbal rings, and I need it to have an upper-mounting plane.

I\u0027ll have to play around with the patch stuff a bit more.  Seems like there -should- be a way to do it.\n\nFrom the MM wiki:  \n\n\u0022The BEFORE and AFTER (and FOR?) keywords can be used to control in what order your patch is applied. The value passed to BEFORE or AFTER is the name of the mod, defined as the name of the directory directly under GameData? This lets you patch patches or patch patches of patches, as deep as you\u0027d like to go.\u0022  \n\nSo... if I\u0027m gathering the details of the problem correctly -- what is happening is that\n\n1.) the single-engine cluster parts get created from their .cfg file  \n\n2.) my patches get ran to create the clusters from the single-engine .cfg files  \n\n3.) RO would try and patch the original \u0027single-engine\u0027 cluster, and thus the changes would not be applied to the patch-created multi-engine clusters.\n\nAnd what we need to happen is:\n\n1.) Single engines parts created from .cfg  \n\n2.) RO/RealPlumes/etc apply patches to single-engine cluster parts  \n\n3.) Multi-engine cluster patches are ran, cloning the single-engine setup.  \n\nSo, perhaps something like this would work:  \n\n1.) Single engine parts created from .cfg files  \n\n2.) RO patches are ran in a :BEFORE[SSTU] block -- this ensure they get ran before the FOR[SSTU] patches are ran (which create the clusters) (can still have a :FOR[RO] or whatever I believe)  \n\n3.) Multi-engine cluster patches are ran in either a FOR[SSTU] or an AFTER[SSTU] block; as the RO/real-plumes patches have already been applied to the single-engine parts, the newly cloned clusters should have all of the updated/patched values.\n\nWill see about playing around with this stuff when I have a chance (perhaps this weekend).  I don\u0027t really feel like setting up all of RO to test things, but could certainly try setting up RealPlume for testing (as I believe the problem is the same in both cases)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T18:08:13Z","Content":"Cool that you are looking into this Mage!!!!

As to the Buffalo, I just tend to make a skycrane to drop them on the surface, as I suck at assembling on the ground; usually takes 3-4 refill flights because of all the parts I mess up. Thank god for Hyperedit in those moments.\n\u003E \n\nLOL and I tend to suck at skycraning everything. I did use the Buffalo mod when the Mage had the cargo lander in it and drop it with the attachment, which worked nicely. So, I\u0027d normally shove parts into KIS containers and drop them as landers, along with my hab systems. Usually takes about 4 of them, but I did manage to modify the smaller inline kis container to hold everything at one shot. A little easier that way, but it\u0027s a little cheaty, but it\u0027s better than flying 14 pods to one place to land 500 meters apart from each other. That\u0027s the first thing I learned how to do was assemble stuff on the ground. I haven\u0027t tried the Karibou, because I\u0027m skittish about the life support that I\u0027d might have to implement to use it. Same for KSPI-E. If I want complication, I\u0027d try to understand women first. and after 41 years, I still haven\u0027t figured those creatures out."}]}
