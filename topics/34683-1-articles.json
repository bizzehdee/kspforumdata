The way jet aircraft control cabin pressure is via a controlled leak. There\u0027s a very fast, accurate valve called the outflow valve, usually mounted on the right side of the airplane, lowish and behind the cockpit (sometimes multiple, plus an extra emergency relief valve in case the main one stops working). The environmental control system uses pressurized bleed air from the engines (taken after the compressor stage but before the burner), runs it through an air-cycle cooling system (like a fancy turbocharger with some heat exchangers around it) and into the cabin. The outflow valve regulates how much airflow is allowed to vent the cabin to keep the cabin pressure at the desired value. There are also leaks around windows and door seals and such, that are typically much smaller than the effective area of the outflow valve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 787 is slightly different since it uses ram air intakes and electric compressors instead of engine bleed air, but the cabin pressure is controlled the same way with an outflow valve. The main determining factor in how high cabin pressure can be is structural - the 787 and new business jets like the Gulfstream G650 can use lower, more comfortable pressure-altitudes in the cabin because their fuselages can stand a few more psi of sustained differential pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: damn, ninja\u0027d.
