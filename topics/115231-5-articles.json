Brilliant!\n\nIf I drop a few 011s into the gravity well, then follow them with an equal amount of Veterons, in theory, the gravitational pull of the singularity should collapse them both under their own energy, causing the 011s to destabilize. The Verterons will act as a spatial isolation grid, and the reaction will not damage normal space. Instead, the Verterons will collapse under the intense energy, and compress the space around them until each string is removed from existence.\n\nThe other possible outcome is that they will react outside the gravity well, and destroy everything BUT the black hole.
