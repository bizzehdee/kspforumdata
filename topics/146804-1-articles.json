Depending on which timestamp you arrive at, how fast you arrive, the shape of the orbit you arrive in, which moon you chose as your first destination, the order in which you plan to visit the other moons, whether or not you are set up to aerobrake at Jool and/or Laythe, whether capturing into any orbit will do or a low orbit is required, and how long you\u0027re willing to wait between each of the legs of your tour, you\u0027re going to get significantly different numbers for the question \u0022how much does it cost to visit all of Jool\u0027s moons\u0022. For example, you could pay as little as 150 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get gravity-assisted flybys (not orbit captures) of four of the five moons in sequence... or you could pay a thousand for the same if you were unlucky and/or set things up poorly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis kind of thing is called \u0022sensitive dependence on initial conditions\u0022, and it makes it impossible for anyone to tell you what you will experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could put an upper bound on how much you need by pre-planning the sequence of your moon visits and then using an \u0022intra-system\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E map for Jool to assume pure unassisted Hohmann transfers from one moon to the next. Unfortunately, while such a thing can easily be found for Jupiter\u0027s four Galilean moons IRL (see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WGOy3qT.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere in the lower right corner\u003C/a\u003E), I\u0027ve never seen it done for Jool in KSP. It\u0027s no surprise either, since it\u0027s complicated, and few people use straight Hohmann transfers to go between the Joolian moons anyway. Though I suppose it may have academic value, so I\u0027ll just go and suggest it in the Community \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E map thread...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause I don\u0027t know enough about what you want to do exactly, I can suggest only one thing: make Bop or Pol your first destination, and carry an ISRU module (or lander) to refuel your Jool cruiser. A Jool transfer stage needs to carry around 3 km/s to complete the transfer burn and insert into orbit around one of Jool\u0027s moons without cutting it too close; if you refueled that stage, those 3 km/s will allow you to get a huge amount of work done and get quite familiar with the gravity assisted moon hopping procedures around Jool. And should it turn out to not be enough, you can always go back and refuel again. Same goes for heading back to Kerbin - refuel before you leave, and you won\u0027t have to lug the return fuel with you all the way. That should easily make up the mass penalty for the ISRU equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-30T11:32:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2016 11:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed the second link to actually link where it\u0026#039;s supposed to link.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T11:21:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI absolutely second Streetwind\u0027s advice: ISRU on Bop or Pol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d add that you should enter Jool with a gravity assist from Tylo so that it sends you down into the system. If you get it right, for 0m/s cost at Tylo, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E will be somewhere near Laythe/Vall and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E will have you crossing Pol or Bop\u0027s orbit. The only expensive part of this process is circularising at Bop or Pol: I think Bop is more expensive at about 650 m/s or so doing it with this method (the only downside of Poll is you absolutely must avoid any visibly \u0022creased\u0022 valleys when less than 2km from the \u003Cem\u003Eterrain\u003C/em\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could do a similar thing with a gravity assist from Laythe, but your resulting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E will be very close to Jool itself and it\u0027ll be more expensive to circularise at the outer moons, unless you get more gravity assists from other moons like Vall or Tylo on the way there (and in this case, planning will be difficult).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, if you have about 800-900m/s still in your tanks when you arrive in the Jool system, you can refuel and do it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you don\u0027t want to land at all, you can bop around from moon to moon with very little effort - as long as you don\u0027t want to get into orbit. \u003Cs\u003EThe standard delta-v maps give the amount needed to orbit each moon - less than double that total is all you need to get all of the moons done\u003C/s\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: oops, sorry, the standard delta-v maps don\u0027t.\u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/skAIz90.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis one \u003C/a\u003Edoes, and gives lots of transfer options too. Since a highly elliptical orbit is basically just escape minus 1m/s, you just need the numbers to and from \u0022escape\u0022 for each moon. Add in a couple of gravity assists and you really don\u0027t need much to do all that if you capture to Tylo or Laythe first.
