It will enable blue lines on all faces, which show which \u0027side\u0027 of each polygon will be visible (since it reflects light) with the other side being transparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Typically, you\\\u0027d want the outside faces to be visible and the interior ones can be inviisble since you can\\\u0027t see them, but in fringe cases like an engine bell, you need both sides to be invisible - for that case you need to highlight the engine bell or whatever and Duplicate it, and then reverse their normals so their inside face is visible (and then scale it down slightly so it fits \u0027inside\u0027 the other object a bit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case, only some of your normals are wrong, so if Recalculate doesn\\\u0027t work you may need to do it manually.

If Recalc doesn\\\u0027t make the troubled lines point right, highlight them and hit flip, and you\\\u0027ll see the line swap to the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA trick is to highlight all (hit A) and then flip ALL normals - then only the bad ones will be left pointing \u0027out\u0027 - fix those and then re-highlight them all and flip them again to set them back correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen once you do that you can add a 2nd surface inside your bell or shields if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pelf","CreatedById":9390,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-15T20:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
