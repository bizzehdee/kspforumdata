While this is less then 1/100th of earths surface pressure of ~1000mbar, it still is very significant. At surface, this would be like kerbin at 20km altitude.

What a quote mining, dishonest, lying moron you have proven yourself to be...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, yes, I am highly skeptical of China\\\u0027s space walk and I have not seen enough of the 2003 footage to know if China showed videos of their taekonauts floating for more than 30 seconds. If they did not, it stands to reason they could have been on the vomit comet. Second of all, I am also highly skeptical of the Russian early spaceflight. While there is technical data all over the place that documents American early spaceflight, the secretive nature of Russia makes it impossible to tell, and there is evidence to suggest that Leonov\\\u0027s spacewalk was a fake. I do believe Americans have flown in space... Why? Because we were not secretive with every little thing we did. We didn\\\u0027t lie and coverup if one of our astronauts died. We admitted it, solved the problems and moved on. (Apollo 1). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Russians had troubles launching all of their rockets, could not land on the moon and provided NO evidence that their men even flew in space.

Why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the Russians were putting people into space in the 60\\\u0027s, they failed and probably realized they needed to fake Gagarin\\\u0027s flight. At least that\\\u0027s what I believe. IF the Russians were putting people into space, I believe they all turned out as \u0027phantom cosmonauts\u0027 and the Soviet Union covered that up.
