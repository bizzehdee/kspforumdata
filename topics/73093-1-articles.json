What I\u0027m worried is if there\u0027s something that the pack makers need to do in order to ensure that the transfer takes place. And if they don\u0027t do this, will the packs be abandoned? I know sometimes a pack gets really popular, even when the creator sort of abandons it. Just to name an example off the top of my head is CardBoardBoxProcessor\u0027s stuff. He\u0027s admitted that he\u0027s going to be continuing his stuff only very sporadically due to real life business, and he\u0027s shown no indication that he\u0027ll be moving his stuff to Curse. It\u0027s packs like his that I worry for, good packs even if they\u0027re rarely updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T19:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat exactly is your question?

The databases are also incompatible, so there won\u0027t be any form of automatic transfer - and there appears to be no plan to maintain a read-only archive of Spaceport.
