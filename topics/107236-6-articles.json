In the three versions of stock aero that we\u0027ve had so far (pre 1.0, 1.0, and 1.0.1/2) there have been three very different \u0022optimal\u0022 TWR\u0027s and ascent profiles. It would be strange to say these three actually implemented, stock versions of aero counted as \u0022extremities\u0022.

They do/will. As you\u0027ve hinted at, the question is whether that\u0027s a good thing or a bad thing, but... well, I\u0027m not sure whether that discussion can be had here."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:45:10Z","Content":"Off-topic posts have been removed."},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T23:56:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Its the physics framework which needs to be consistent and believable.\n\nThe game\u0027s simulation of physics cannot be both consistent and improving at the same time. with so many deviations from realism (by necessity, both technical and practical) there is a lot of room for improvements to the physics engine, allowing for a lot more interesting engineering to happen, which is why most of us play this game instead of a game realistically simulating real spacecraft.\n\nLike any simple simulation, it stops being believable when you reach its limits and all players that explore deeper will find those limits. With such a simple implementation, necessary to keep it real-time and playable, small changes **will** result in large effects on craft and physics, it\u0027s inevitable.\n\nIn the end, everyone has to bite the bullet and accept that the game will never be \u0022realistic enough\u0022 to satisfy every case or even most, and it neither will stop changing since most any improvement to the core physics will alter how craft behave. Personally, I feel a good balance is getting as good a physical simulation as possible without requiring much more cpu/gpu/memory/hdd than the average modern game while keeping the *initial* difficulty curve accessible (endgame can be as hard as you want really).\n\nIf you believe that the core physics should **never** be changed and that it\u0027s a bad thing, ask yourself this: would you now revert to .23.5 physics, given the option? do you believe that would improve the game for the average player or even hardcore players?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E isn\u0027t this going to be a problem for challenges?\n\nThe whole argument that these changes indirectly force players to customize their physics settings, thus making sharing craft a labyrinth, is pointless. The solution is trivial - each posted craft comes with the relevant .cfg files, in a nice zip archive. Even simpler would be to include just the .craft file with a diff of the default .cfg and the player\u0027s .cfg, to make it easier for humans to parse. In competitions and challenges, there should be surrogates that test the .craft/.cfg combination for validity - this isn\u0027t as difficult as it may seem, since most players experienced enough will know what to look for. In the end, it\u0027s not like this is some kind of ksp progaming scene where we need a high-accuracy anti-cheat. It\u0027s sharing for the fun of it or at most for challenges - the most spectacular accomplishments will be scrutinized the most and remember: **people can already cheat a lot as it is**.\n\nPlayers can already cheat in challenges in a way that is nearly impossible to determine. Since KSP has no anti-cheat, there is nothing preventing a player from making small invasive adjustments, just enough to get an edge and then claim it\u0027s just that other players don\u0027t know how to fly the craft well enough or something. They can use a hacked client, custom mod (super easy), memory editing, video and image editing, glitches, the debug menu and any combination of these to get the desired result.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E even from a set of pictures it\u0027s not hard to tell when someone has infinite fuel on\n\nNothing personal, but you are very wrong on this. It\u0027s only easy if they\u0027re doing it wrong. I can guarantee you that if someone has enough of an interest in the game to be on these forums, chances are they know about delta-v maps, delta-v calculations, mechjeb and ker, common community wisdom etc. - all they need to do is build a craft with the required delta-v for a trip or challenge, hyperedit themselves into position and change their fuel with enough random variance to be believable, take snapshots of each position at the expected delta-v and add some random trivia (\u0022I lost my right fin during re-entry\u0022) to make it even more believable. Unless someone is cheating blatantly, it won\u0027t be obvious even to the experienced player unless someone scrutinizes it closely. In essence, most players can leverage community knowledge, mods and tools to cheat in near or entirely undetectable ways. And this has been true since at least .22.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So what I propose is that if you do make a change to any of the physics related settings and anything else that effects game-play, but not things like toggling aero-forces markers, entry heat bars etc, then a little icon should appear in the corner of the screen. The icon will be an indicator to challenge judges that the physics settings are not stock and (as a useful feature for the user) clicking the icon will restore settings to default. Do you think that\u0027s a good idea?\n\nYou\u0027re proposing an anti-cheat. Unless we have one that operates at the level of VAC, nothing will suffice. Even then, players would be able to win challenges and would get banned days, weeks or months later. Custom cheats would never get detected.\n\nThe problem of detecting cheating in KSP is the same as detecting whether a player deliberately disconnects from a competitive game to prevent a loss or their computer just fails - there is no way to do it with enough certainty without violating laws and rights much more important than the certainty of legitimate play. Thus, you are only left with 2 options: treat any suspicious action as penalty-worthy (this is how disconnects are treated) or use third-party validation (or just assume no one is cheating unless it\u0027s blatant). The latter is the solution here I think: each challenge entry must be evaluated by surrogate, non-competing players using challenge-compliant installations of the game. When sharing craft just to share, include both the .craft file and a diff of the player\u0027s .cfg files and the default, easy peasy. If lazy, just include the entire .cfg.\n\nThe only extra improvement I can think of is adding replay functionality to KSP - essentially, demo recording, either through a mod or the vanilla game itself. This way, the player in a challenge includes their .craft and the recorded mission and a trusted third-party runs it on their own installation to see if it checks out. KSP\u0027s engine AFAIK is deterministic and even if it wasn\u0027t, it would be easy to resolve by just including the seed for the RNG in the demo file. Problem solved. It can even record when the player accelerates time and adjust the simulation accuracy to match, thus allowing variable time acceleration for the viewer of the replay without affecting the accuracy of the replay itself.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It should be obvious that they who want unified stock experience do not touch default values. There are always some defaults by SQUAD which could be considered as \u0022stock physics\u0022.\n\nThis. Is saying \u0022Stock, 1.02, normal\u0022 so complicated, with the simple assumption that no physics have been messed with and asking for or posting changes (a diff?) of physics changes if pertinent?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Think about the craft sharing part of the community... Today all crafts works, Squad changes atmosphere, All crafts get unbalanced and needs rework...\n\nThe \u0022consistent physics framework\u0022 argument is essentially a \u0022backwards compatibility\u0022 argument, since it would never be an issue if we had this model from the start. And we know that, in practice, those that ditch backwards compatibility early win, those that don\u0027t are stuck with being dependent on it forever \\*cough\\* windows \\*cough\\*. In the end, it\u0027s extremely easy to fix when it comes to crafts and when it isn\u0027t, consider whether it\u0027s worth holding the game back so that some old crafts work.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have about 2000 hours of stock to unlearn.\n\nYou have a knack for exaggeration. Remember you\u0027re not talking to 8-year-olds here, you\u0027re talking to adults who actually play the same game, don\u0027t be a smartass.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Atm those turboramjets are the only supersonic engine in the game and they get barely anywhere because of the high fuel consumption.\n\nWhat do you mean \u0022barely anywhere\u0022? I just tried it with a mk1 spaceplane, 1 trj and 450 units of liquid fuel and at an altitude of about 16.5km you can get your fuel consumption to around .15-.10 - that lets you do about 60%-95% of kerbin\u0027s circumference at ~800m/s. How much more do you need?\n\nHere is the craft:\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438074530](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438074530)\n\nMind you, this is just 2 minutes of building - I haven\u0027t optimized anything. Pretty sure that with some gliding and finetuning for TWR and speed you can exceed a circumference of land distance traveled.\n\nMost every spaceplane I\u0027ve tried post 1.0 has either had too much speed or failed due to aerodynamic instability. I usually don\u0027t even get to spend all my fuel going up, especially with the trjs - my problems are usually that I\u0027m not good enough to add some rocket engines and rapiers are too middle-ground to be really good at anything.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T00:01:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MechaLynx**"}]}
