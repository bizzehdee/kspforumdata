The actual transfer of collision models, thermodynamics and all those things were done with the 1.0.5 patch. I only gathered bits and pieces of info on the gap between these two updates and as I stated before, there maybe more to it than just releasing it for 1.0.5 and having to go back and doing it again with 1.1. But, I also look at it like this: It\u0027s your mod, you can do what you want with it. If you feel comfortable waiting and working on 1.1, by all means, wait for the next update. If you feel you can roll a few systems out that\u0027s compatible with 1.0.5, that would be great, too. I for one would love to put this mod back into action again, but I also understand that making mods compatible and re doing all your work is a pain. As I stated before, I\u0027m no expert mod maker, I just mod it till it crashes. In any case, do what you feel is right for you. If too many people complain about you not working on your mod and it\u0027s dead, you can always ignore them, but I am happy to hear that you are interested in our thoughts on this.[/QUOTE]  \n\nThe biggest change for 1.1 will be with the shader. Unity 5 uses a PBR shader, which allows for significantly greater control over textures. Currently, KSP is using a flat diffuse shader, which means that things like reflective surfaces (metal, glass, gloss plastics, ceramics) either have to left dull or have the reflection faked in the texture. The PBR shader allows for real time reflections with a great degree of control. Which means, you\u0027ll be able to tell the difference between chrome and brushed stainless steel by nothing more than the reflective properties. In other words, it\u0027ll be much more realistic.  \n\nSo as far as the parts go, there should be no change. As far as the textures go, the changes can be and probably will be significant.  \n\nHere is an example someone made to demonstrate the difference potential.  \n\n[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/b8fzpHm.jpg[/IMG]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-26T06:49:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2015 06:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by noonespecial**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T07:43:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E YANFRET said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is intentional.
