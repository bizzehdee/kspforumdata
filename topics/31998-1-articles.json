But, with several successful landings under their belts, they have started to wonder if Eve is really grape flavored and they have begun to dream about beach vacations on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut before they make the next leap, it was important to put a rover on Duna. Why? Because there is still lots to see more than a few feet away from the landing site, and more importantly, the people of Kerbin need to know if the polar ice caps would make good ski resorts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003ESkystrider\u003C/em\u003E lander has been very successful on Duna. However, because of it\u0027s three engine configuration, there was uncertainty about how to use it to get a rover to Duna. \u003Cem\u003ESkystrider II\u003C/em\u003E was designed as a Moon/Minmus lander that delivered the \u003Cem\u003ESkyroller\u003C/em\u003E rover to both moons. The center Poodle engine was removed and the rover attached with a decoupler. Shortly before touchdown, the rover was decoupled and dropped like a small bomb onto the moon, much to the delight of the kerbals. The two engine configuration may have worked on Duna to put the kerbalnauts back in orbit, but it was uncertain. Why try with two engines when three worked? Then, in true kerbal fashion, the answer became obvious. Why three engines when you can use FOUR! Thus \u003Cem\u003ESkystrider IIA\u003C/em\u003E was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a long duration mission, so I\u0027ll probably post a few pictures when the kerbals make it to icecap. After a 93 day journey, an unexpected encounter with Ike and some quick recalculations of aerobraking (due to the Ike-altered velocity) I was just happy to get the kerbals into an (almost) equatorial orbit, a quick landing, and 22.7km in the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs is typical of my journeys so far, I use only stock parts, and no mechjeb or any other mods at all. Just manual maneuvers and keyboard bashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Rover/1_zpscdcb8cb7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221_zpscdcb8cb7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESkycrosser/Skystrider\u003C/em\u003E making a close pass with Ike\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Rover/2_zpsd7247b6a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222_zpsd7247b6a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELander and Rover preparing to enter Duna\u0027s atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Rover/3_zpsa6f178b7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223_zpsa6f178b7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a safe touchdown, the parachutes were repacked (Thanks DMagic for that little gem of an idea for the return to Kerbin) and the kerbals are ready to deploy the \u003Cem\u003ESkyroller\u003C/em\u003E rover\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Rover/4_zps56a25807.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224_zps56a25807.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flag is planted and the site named \u0022The Sanguine Fields\u0022 A quick spin ensures the rover is functional and it\u0027s time to roll\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/Duna%20Rover/5_zps5de0f4eb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225_zps5de0f4eb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter making an impressive start of 22.7km shortly after touchdown, the kerbalnauts pose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post more once the boys make it to the ice cap.
