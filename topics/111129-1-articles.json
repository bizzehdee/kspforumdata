Yes, I know that KSP can\u0027t use more than 4 gigs, but the rest of the computer can, if it\u0027s 64 bit, and so KSP has all of these 4 gigs available, with the OS and stuff not grabbing RAM from it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T11:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClearly if you have only 8GB on your PC you all have a hard time.
