EE, yours or Dtobi\u0027s?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo I\u0027m not saying any specific plugin because I don\u0027t know much about how other gimbal plugins are implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it is possible to write such a gimbal plugin that will separately adjust each thrust transform according to its relative location to the engine\u0027s COM location/vessel\u0027s COM location. When using engine\u0027s COM location, it will work out the rotation so that each nozzle will turn along the tangent of the side (suppose the side is circular), this will allow most engines to generate a net roll torque without other torques and side-forces, the overall thrust will be reduced a bit by 1-cos(gimbal angle) proportion though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK, Dtobi\u0027s plugin *might* support that by calculating the transform\u0027s location related to the vessel\u0027s COM (not sure about it though) *IF* the plugin does the calculation separately for each transform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plugin can support it, but it needs one additional condition to meet: engine\u0027s thrust transforms around the longitudinal axis of the engine should have different roll angles. i.e. each thrust transform\u0027s local x axis should be pointing towards the center of the engine. But most engines in different mods currently just share the same rotation among these transforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-11T05:33:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2014 05:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HoneyFox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brooklyn666","CreatedById":88321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T05:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECurrently, single parts cant have roll control. A single part with Built in RCS wont give you roll authority, and because of the way KSP handles engines, a single engine part wont allow roll either. KSP treats a single part cluster of engines as a single engine with multiple transforms, not a the cluster that it is. So it won\u0027t think to use the roll, even when you tell it to, because it thinks it will flip you over or screw with you in some similar way.
