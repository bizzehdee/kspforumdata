Great.\n\nJust want some clarification... are these fairing parts handled as nuclear engine fairings?\n\nBecause then, WE HAVE ISSUES. I had to completely redesign, mess with and spent a couple hours on a design of fuel tanks hanging radially from a central tank with nuclear engine, to get landing gear on the radial tanks, for a lander of 10000\u002B delta V. The latest in planetary exploration. Only, it exploded because of the fairing. And there is no option to simply turn it off. Most annoying bloody thing so far honestly. Workarounds are possible, yes, but something that would have worked with a normal/no fairing as is had to be completely scrapped because of the lack of option. And as they say, if something can go wrong, it will.\n\nPlus, a confetti design now, on bigger fairings, it friggin EXPLODES. Hitting the button for fairing detachment is equal to losing all visual for a few seconds as the massive debris cloud disperses. Slowly.
