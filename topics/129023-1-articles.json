The Saturn V was launched 13 times from the\u00A0Kennedy Space Center\u00A0in\u00A0Florida\u00A0with no loss of crew or payload. The Saturn V remains the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful rocket ever brought to operational status and still holds records for the heaviest payload launched and largest payload capacity to\u00A0low Earth orbit(LEO) of 310,000 pounds (140,000\u00A0kg).[4][5] - Wikipedia\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:26px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz8Cg6FNj53ET19BV2c1eGFjS1k/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDOWNLOAD\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EOk, I will start this off saying Happy New Year! This is a rocket that I have been working on for quite a while now, and have finally completed. It is a fully functional super realistic model of the Saturn V rocket, and the Apollo Mission. The craft is actual sized, at 10m in diameter, and has over 1,100 parts. This rocket has been quite the experience to build as I seemed to encounter EVERY glitch in the game. It was most of the time a case of one step forward, two back, but somehow I got it into a working condition. From it I learned how fairings are the glitchyest ***************s in the world, that my new computer is way way way better than my old one, and that heat shields make great decals.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EOn to the flight plan, and it is luckily a simple one for you. Just fly it like any rocket, but keep RCS on during the ascent. I highly suggest that you do not turn while the first stage is firing, and also be prepared for low FPS, again over 1k parts.. Due to fairing bugs, i had to implement an explosive staging system, so just don\u0027t activate the engines until you see the fairing on the previous stage blow up. Toggle 0 for the antenna in orbit, and abort is for activating the abort tower (will come off on its own if not used)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EJust to give you an idea of the scale of this thing, (if the pics were not enough), the first stage is powered by 35 Rhino engines, the second is powered by 10, and even the third requires two. The main large hull is a 3m fuel tank surrounded by 12 Mk3 space plane fuel tanks, and also the capsule is actually a 3m fairing around the 3 man capsule.
