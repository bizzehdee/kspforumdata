My plan is to detach them one at a time, and bring them to orbit each of the moons. They are rather small, with a single ion engine. My question is, how do I most effectively carry out this plan? I suppose the best approach is to start with the outer moons and work my way in? I need to make sure that the ion engine can brake the probe sufficiently to enter orbit around the destination. Then perhaps gradually over time adjust the orbit with multiple maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne concern is that I might end up having to perform multiple burns at once, if two burn events coincide. However, it will cost fuel for my main ship if I have to park it in orbit, place the probe, then intercept the next moon. Would prefer if the main ship could just drop the probe at speed and then just adjust course to the next moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other concern is that the main ship will become unstable if the probes are detached in a asymmetrical pattern. Unless I always detach two at a time that cant be helped. I guess reduced thrust could help me compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice? Anyone else done something similar with tips to share? :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T16:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas the main ship made it into a Jool parking orbit yet? Otherwise, I have a crazy idea. Detatch all of the probes in transit and tweak their approach so that they enter the system with enough time inbetween each probe, then aerobreak them at Jool for apoapsis matching the orbits of the moons you want to get to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith time between arrival for each probe you can aerobreak and adjust the orbit before moving onto the next probe. And you don\u0027t even have to do perfect orbits straight off, just aerobreak and then raise your periapsis out of Jool\u0027s atmosphere.
