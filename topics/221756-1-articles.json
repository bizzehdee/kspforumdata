Easily the best science experiment. Encouragement to slam heavy things into a planet, or a nice bonus for disposing of transit stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe instead of making it a deployable ground test, it could just be another science part to be left on landers.

It cuts out the repetition, but still presents growth and development, and allows for widely different playstyles.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I was worried seeing how the new system was streamlined that it wouldn\u0027t allow widely different playthrough styles. But I\u0027m glad to see multiple ways are possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far I\u0027ve played through my preferred way, going heavily into probes, gathering up enough science so that when I do go to land kerbals on the Mun or Duna it is in style with big realistic looking craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume the more standard way of playing through directly with a more ramshackle kerbal crewed craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tried to play through only using spaceplanes yet, but I\u0027m not sure that will be possible unfortunately.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAnd no more need to do 12 identical Mun landings to get all the science from every biome. Love the new balance where you can move through without having to repeat stuff you\u0027ve already done several times. Love the new balance of biomes. KSP1 had way too many. Love the new style of grouping them based on what looks different rather than having different ones for several similar regions.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELove the light story of the main missions. - One thing maybe could use a tweak though. As I was using probes, I was able to hammer them all out without any kerbal involvement.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ENot to say I want that removed. As I generally like leading the way with probes.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cfont\u003EBut maybe after the main quest objectives of getting to the places, there could be an additional secondary quest to return a sample from the places, or send a kerbal to the places. Then the getting to the place main \u003C/font\u003Equest\u003Cfont\u003E\u00A0could be accomplished by a probe, and could even finish the whole main chain. But maybe the main quest part only gives half the science reward. The other half of the reward given with the secondary quest of returning sample or bringing a kerbal.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cfont\u003ESomething good I noticed. I\u0027ve gotten a couple bugs like a docking port refusing to undock, or a landing leg that thinks its deployed when it isn\u0027t and so the button is unresponsive. But unlike KSP1 where that would be permanent, all of these in KSP2 seem to resolve themselves after a save and restart. So still some bugs to work on, but only a minor annoyance where in KSP1 it would be devastating to some long missions.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStuff that wasn\u0027t good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorst bug currently in my explore save, is the one where parts suddenly shift, either left or right or up or down. So a huge improvement over worse bugs. But still annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe part pairs that run the same experiment. On the whole, I like there being a choice. I like the Sci Jr vs Jr Jr, where later down the tree you unlock the smaller version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut some need balance. Why are both atmosphere sensors on the same science node, where one is significantly heavier to the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething that would be useful. - like the Grand Slam, I\u0027d love to see the return of satellite mapping. A nice variant for an experiment, requiring a polar orbit. And it could display biome maps, and points of interest for investigating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
