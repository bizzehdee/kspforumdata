I\u0027m all Mac (Final Cut Pro/iMoves and Adobe) and on a console (PS4) so I can help there if your ever wanting more info or some quick feedback?, gotta go \u2022 Good Luck \u2022 Blue Skies......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Comic Sans MS\u0027, cursive;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EToki\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Piatzin","CreatedById":166940,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-26T17:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/219852-tokiglassblower/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022219852\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/219852-tokiglassblower/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@TokiGlassBlower\u003C/a\u003E I used DaVinci Resolve for the editing and OBS for the capture.
