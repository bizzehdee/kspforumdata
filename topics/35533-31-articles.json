It\u0027s a bloody nightmare trying to find update links buried inside 77 pages and 765 posts!!!! I know only the OA of the thread can update to first post but there really needs to be a way to redirect people to community updates and such. In this thread alone I have found at least 4 links to various and supposed updates to get this mod working in versions .23 and .23.5 and it\u0027s frustrating not knowing if you have missed a link or grabbed one that is going to corrupt your entire career game and make you restart!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite pet peeve is you grab a lnik, install it, corrupt your entire game to the point you have to restart, then come back and find that there was a little hidden post 5 pages away saying \u0022don\u0027t use xxx because it will explode your computer!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uberubert","CreatedById":10856,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T16:21:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m checking this thread daily to see if there are any news on a working 0.23.5 version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found more than one post claiming it works, but when I finally found a link to a version that was supposed to work for 23.5, I ran into the \u0022welded item tries to attach itself from the middle instead of the attach-points, and is flipped 90 degrees in two directions\u0022-problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there really a version that works with 23.5, or is this just a modding myth at this point?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DauntingFlyer","CreatedById":66471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T20:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Uberubert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Uberubert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m checking this thread daily to see if there are any news on a working 0.23.5 version.\u003Cp\u003EI found more than one post claiming it works, but when I finally found a link to a version that was supposed to work for 23.5, I ran into the \u0022welded item tries to attach itself from the middle instead of the attach-points, and is flipped 90 degrees in two directions\u0022-problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there really a version that works with 23.5, or is this just a modding myth at this point?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat happens to all of us, I think.
