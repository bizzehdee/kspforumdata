You might try \u0027faster\u0027 encoding settings, that use less CPU time, but higher bitrates to maintain quality. Though honestly.. in KSP, you can generally get away with using fairly bad encoding settings, from a quality standpoint, and the result still be watchable, since, unlike most other games, usually in KSP.. the majority of the time, your not dealing with \u0027every pixel on the screen changing every frame\u0027 scenarios.
