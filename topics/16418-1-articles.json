I joined the KSP forums back in March, and I think I\u0027ve lurked long enough. I\u0027ve thoroughly enjoyed building and launching different designs to the mun, to minmus, and beyond. It\u0027s been a fun learning process, and I can\u0027t wait for more! My current project is designing a stable ship large enough for interplanetary travel using stock parts for when 0.17 hits. I think I\u0027m getting close, but I\u0027d love some input or tips on staging with the new engine balances in 0.16. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T03:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
