I\u0027m following the altimter to get an idea of what my decent speed should be at different hights, but I\u0027m always crashing into the surface with the alimeter anywhere between 1100m and 4000m. It will be a pain to slow my decent to only 5m/s when the altimeter reads 6000 just because I don\u0027t know when I\u0027m going to hit the surface.

I\u0027m not sure if I extracted them incorrectly or what because I\u0027m not getting all those GUI windows that the screenshots show. All I\u0027m seeing are the ship parts, the lazors and autopilot stuff. I haven\u0027t toyed with the autopilot because I\u0027m thinking that may remove some of my fun, but the only additional UI I\u0027m seeing is the lazor targeting box in the very top right corner that drops down and gives you the 4 direction buttons. I\u0027m not seeing the subsystems, config, target cam, parameters, tractor beam, and my lazor system box is much more simple than the one in their screenshot. This is after I\u0027ve placed tons of lazors all over my ship in the manner recommended if it matters at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: toyed around with mechjeb and its ui seems to work.
