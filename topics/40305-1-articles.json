You\u0027d need to know the initial spherical coordinates of both the source and target crafts (i.e. latitude, longitude, altitude) as well as their initial velocity. I suppose once you had that you could then determine at what point you\u0027d need to make your rendezvous burns; how much delta-V and when. There\u0027s some pretty nasty rotational kinematics involved in all that, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I usually perform the actual docking visually. That starts at 500 meters, I close to 100, zero out relative velocity, re-aim at the target, thrust ahead and do the same thing again at 50, 20 and 10 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m not understanding the question...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T19:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this question about docking or rather about setting up a rendezvous course?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"air805ronin","CreatedById":40948,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T20:54:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blizzy78\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blizzy78\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs this question about docking or rather about setting up a rendezvous course?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince he said manuever nodes I think he\u0027s including the rendezvous in with the docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo which I say, it certainly is possible, but it isn\u0027t easy.
