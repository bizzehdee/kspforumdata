I only found out what it means after some searching. Could you change the description into something more understandable ? For example, \u002280% efficiency\u0022 or \u0022recycles \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; into 80% \u0026lt;output\u0026gt; and 20% waste\u0022. Since you can calculate one from the other, it makes sense to list the more comprehensible number, which is efficiency I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when I was looking up the meaning of that efficiency multiplier, I found your \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aioc9ek3XAvwdGNsRlh3OVhlbTFBR3M4RW0zLUNTRFE\u0026amp;usp=sharing#gid=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Espreadsheet\u003C/a\u003E. It is very well researched, but I found some inconsistencies with the recyclers (starting at row 312 in the spreadsheet). I\u0027ll go through them in order :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater splitter - is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarbon extractor (CO2-\u0026gt;O2) - this took me a while. I didn\u0027t know where its efficiency came from. It is 100% efficient in the sense that it converts 1 mole of CO2 into 1 mole of O2. Its inefficiency comes from Kerbals, whose breathing converts 1 mole of O2 into 0.869 moles of CO2, thus making the overall oxygen cycle 86.9% efficient. Could you maybe add this to the wiki ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESabatier recycler - it doesn\u0027t make sense to speak of its efficiency, because it\u0027s not a closed cycle like the previous one. This one uses water in each cycle, so it\u0027s like the combination of water splitter and carbon extractor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater purifier - I think there is a miscalculation in the spreadsheet, which comes from cell C362. It says : C362=C360*(D210/D213)*J360, but I think it should be C362=C360*(C210/C213)*J360. Currently, there is actually more water produced than spent.
