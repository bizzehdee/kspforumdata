Is there no reason they couldn\u0027t be made into parts? That way you could stick one in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105904-Anti-gravity-room\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eanti-gravity room\u003C/a\u003E and have pics of your kerbals floating around inside. The model would probably need to be broken into several parts so it can be assembled with some sides missing for kerbals to enter, much like a complete movie/TV set that can be re-arranged depending on where the cameras need to be. Or it can just not include any bounding boxes so kerbals can float in and out, it\u0027ll be up to the user to make sure there\u0027s no clipping going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I fear there is some major issue I\u0027m not seeing here because surely this has been thought of already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIVA=inter vehicular activities.

As a result:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - When building in the VAB/SPH, once you grab one of the internal models/props, you won\u0027t be able to grab it again in the build area (the colliders determine which bits a user\u0027s mouse is able to touch and grab)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - In the flight scene, objects will simply pass through the models/props\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne (slightly cumbersome) workaround that allows you to re-use the existing internal models/props is to use MODEL{} nodes (aka CFG welding) to also include a custom collider model file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Aside from having additional tags to ensure that they are rendered properly in the IVA portrait camera.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T01:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eexcellent, mostly as I suspected. I\u0027ll see about looking into this more when I have some time. Really, the lack of colliders isn\u0027t an issue if you keep it all as one model. Having the part pass-through makes it easy to just maneuver kerbals where ever and also place the camera where ever. The fact you can only place it once isn\u0027t a big deal if you can just drag it out and plop it down in the AG room there\u0027s no real precise placement that is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*bump*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust putting this back out there in case anyone has the time to try it out.
