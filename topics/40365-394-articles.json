Help me out here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent Tech has fission reactors (un-upgraded), the generators (un-upgraded) and the microwave transceivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put up 3 relay sats in synchronous orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put together a power platform in the SPH that consists of a pod, 9 of the 3.75m Akula reactors, 9 of the 3.75m generators, 3 of the big flat radiators and as little else as I could get away with (less than 50 parts). This platform can transmit 17.1GW I parked 4 of these (68.4GW transmitted) a few km from the launchpad to keep them out of load range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the microwave receivers, I\u0027m getting 36GW at the launchpad and 50\u002B nearly anywhere in Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I put relays in moria orbits about Mun and Minmus and it really is anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not gone anywhere else yet so I don\u0027t know how fast this attenuates with distance. I\u0027m trying to put a solar sat up in low Kerbol orbit but I\u0027m wondering if I really need to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I upgrade the reactors to gas-cores, that 68.4GW transmitted is going to jump to over 200GW. More if the generator efficiency goes up above 42%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 1.25m plasma thruster using argon caps out at 34GW. Just one of those can push 60 tons into orbit using only 15 tons of argon. On 200GW, I can cap out 6 of those. That would be 360 tons to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I break something? Is this working as intended? I mean, with this kind of power, why would I need anti-matter. I certainly don\u0027t need regular rockets at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, the only downside I\u0027m seeing so far is heat management on the microwave receivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor balance purposes, should attenuation through atmosphere be higher? What kind of attenuation are you guys seeing from Kerbol Solar Satellites?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, should plasma thrusters cap out lower?

The receivers (which are extraordinarily light) can pull it all in without burning to a crisp plus the thruster can take it with out melting on the spot.

At the launchpad I can get 36GW (out of 68 transmitted). That doesn\u0027t seem out of sorts. Where it gets weird is as I go up and connect to relays, the power goes up. Technically, it should never get any better because the initial transmitter is on the ground. So it had to come through the atmosphere no matter where I go. If I were to try to land said craft elsewhere on Kerbin it should attenuate again because the power had to go up to the relays and then back down to me. Once I\u0027m on the relay network, I don\u0027t think the plugin pays attention to where the power comes from. It\u0027s only paying attention to where I am relative to where the connected relay is (in orbit). Is that intended or is it just a case of Fractal hasn\u0027t figured out how to account for it? Perhaps if sources had flags (landed body?). If it were null it\u0027s in space. If it\u0027s on a planet with an atmosphere, it could attenuate it accordingly. Dunno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA thought for receivers. You have 3 types. The flimsy fold up, the sturdier looking one, and the great big fold up. None of these look like they should be deployed in flight. Perhaps they should be breakable like solar panels (may not as breakable though, damn solar panels are downright fragile). This would limit there use to space or airless moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you choke on that though, there are the thermal receivers that look more than sturdy enough for atmospheric use but take a bit more science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s intended that the receivers have limits since they have a collection area defined. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s been implemented yet. The smallest receiver can pull in just as much as the biggest one can. Plus, they all weigh in at 25kg which given their respective sizes, seems a bit off. So if this is ever implemented, this would likely balance a lot. With tweakscale, each type could come is several sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the thrusters, I don\u0027t know. I was trying to find some specs on what a near future VASMIR might be and couldn\u0027t find any so I couldn\u0027t say how realistic it is or not. I\u0027m sure Fractal\u0027s math is correct. You put x amount of power to y amount of propellant, you\u0027ll get z amount of thrust. So all I can say about these is that the power caps seems high. Of course I could play with these via MM configs to see how lower caps pan out. Maybe the larger versions with larger caps should be in more advanced tech nodes. Perhaps the caps could start out at a lower base with upgrades in higher tech nodes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T19:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving read the links for both of those, it seems like they are still too theoretical.

You can try this yourself. Copy a stock engine. Add the appropriate weight to account for the duct work. Add intake air to the engines requirements (liquid fuel should be .9, oxidizer is 1.1. Start with intake air at 4 or so). Slap an intake on it and see how it goes. I\u0027m not sure the isp should change though. However, the fuel consumption would go down by virtue of the fact that intake air may take up to half of the total ratio. This would (should?) double your fuel economy by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T19:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigD145\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigD145\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECollecting mirrors would work fine if you\u0027re only thrusting near the sun.
