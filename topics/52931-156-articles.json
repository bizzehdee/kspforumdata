For your second question, yes, it\u0027s exactly what this option does. Important to note that stack chutes have *two* parachutes on them. This is why this field does not say parts, it\u0027s the number of individual chutes that is important. Though the triple chute canopy is simply a visual effect, and acts as a single physical parachute. If you apply and it says the mass is too high, chances you forgot something, because that means you have *huge*parachutes. Make sure that your current craft is ONLY what will be landing. Temporarily detach any lancher, boosters, or extra weight that will be discarded before applying. If it still says that, then no, you can\u0027t figure out the actual landing speed. I\u0027ll see if I can slip that into RealChute 2. Though that probably means your payload is huge. Adding extra chutes or making used of a rocket assisted landing should fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222474282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002252931\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458991889\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154672\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Oromis\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Oromis said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!

Basically, the *fixed* maximum diameter for a single parachute for the RealChute part library is 70m wide. This is *large* to give you a sense of scale, I believe the Orion capsule\u0027s parachute are 60m wide each. 70m is a stretch, and larger than that is simply not realistic. So for a single chute, the maximum diameter is 70m. For triple chutes, it\u0027s around 121m if I recall correctly. This seems weird, but we have to take into account that since it\u0027s one physical object, it is being simulated as one big chute, and not three separate, and to simulate a cluster of three chutes as one, you need to merge their area, not their diameters. The area of a chute is pi*r^2, so A=pi*(70/2)\u00B2, and then to get the diameter of the resulting chute, we want to do the inverse on 3*A, so we have d=2*sqrt(3*A/pi). And if my memory is correct, this is approximately equal to 121m. So using a triple chute allows you to compact the volume of three chutes into one part, which can be useful.

For example, the Mk2-R radial chute and the RealChute radial chute basically seem identical, with very trivial differences.

The whole system relies entirely on the stock drag. It\u0027s much better now that stock drag is no longer mass dependant, but it\u0027s still a system that is not suited at all for parachutes. Parachutes are far better off handled manually by the actual viscous drag equation, and by manually inputting a force, which also means that the crafts realistically hang from the parachute\u0027s connecting rope. This allows you to have total control on exactly how much drag you want your parachute to apply, and at what speed you will land. The stock parachutes now offer an\u00A0\u0022approximate area\u0022 but, well, simply put I created the formula that calculates this approximate area for FARs implementation of RealChuteLite, then passed it up to NathanKell who added it in the game\u0027s code. Having written and tested it, I know that while it does the job, it\u0027s rather inaccurate and not very good at predicting landing speed. Area alone, is not a good mean to tell you just what happens with your chute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only that, but stock deployment is very, VERY hard on your craft. This is a lot less of an issue now that part joints are much sturdier, and that the aero system has been overhauled, but during my recent testing with the stock chute while updating RealChute, I\u0027ve still had deployment shocks of up to 34Gs. If you have any notion of what 10Gs can do to someone, it\u0027s easy to see that 34 is insane. The most I\u0027ve ever had with RealChute is 6G, which is actually a number that makes sense on paper and in real life. The Soyuz capsule usually caps at 4-5G when deploying its\u00A0main chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealChute also provides the whole in game parachute editor, which lets you completely configure procedurally your parachutes for your very specific job.

Basically, the more parachutes there are, the smaller each one of them can be, and the less load each one carries. This is far too complex to figure out automatically with staging and would be prone to crazy errors, so you have to just input this manually.For example, if you had four radial chutes working all at the same time to make your pod touch down, you\u0027d want to input four. For stack chutes (not the grey combo chutes), the number is two by default, because as mentioned up there, this specific part has two distinct parachutes that act at the same time. So again, if you had three radial chutes and one stack chute on your craft, this number becomes five: two for the stack, one per radial. If you had one cone chute with a triple canopy model, however this is *one* chutes, because the triple canopy is simply a visual effect, it is treated as one big canopy, as mentioned earlier in this post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s simple when put in perspective, but weird to explain in a few words/a UI label.
