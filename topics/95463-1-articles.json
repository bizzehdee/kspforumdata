I had it attached to a command pod for testing at it works until I release the pod at which point it stops. I tried connecting it to other various devices and without a command core from a probe or pod, it simply does not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pulled out several mods and it came back to life, working to figure out which one it is now and hopefully why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Never mind, it seems to be antenna range. I can only wager a guess as to why, but it\u0027s clear that whatever code it uses to deny control to probes that are not connected via relays is causing the seat to not function under the same circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-03T03:06:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2015 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esolved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
