It adds a lot of complexity, which isn\u0027t necessarily bad. But for me, I can see no reason I need these features. And you can\u0027t just ignore them - every time you chute (and with SR that\u0027s a lot!) you have to configure the chutes. Being unfamiliar with RC, that means a lot of trial and error testing - and there\u0027s no reward in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have a problem with the g-force on chute deployment - KJR takes care of that. And I imagine that Jeb is especially fond of the ride. So that leaves SR and 30 chutes on a lower stage. Which I would rather deal with then add in the complexity of RealChute. This is all just my opinion of course, I can see RealChute is a well though out mod and well implemented and it\u0027s obvious why there\u0027s a fan base. I took time to explain this just to rationalize why anyone would rather tweakscale up the stock chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to SR - thanks for a great mod! It has added a lot of enjoyment to my game. It\u0027s the kind of added complexity to KSP I love - I can chose to ignore it, but there\u0027s $$$ down the drain if I do.

The conditions for that are roughly: \u0026gt;22.5km away from the active vessel, \u0026lt;23km altitude on Kerbin, not landed. Once the vessel is destroyed, StageRecovery checks if it has enough parachutes to land slowly and/or an engine with fuel and some sort of pilot to try to land with engines. If it can be recovered, SR \u0022recovers\u0022 it. The recovery is a custom written one, so it sometimes has problems with things such as contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the thing you drop doesn\u0027t leave physics range or you focus on it, StageRecovery won\u0027t do anything with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is compatible with Kerbal Konstructs, but will only allow recovery on Kerbin or Earth (if using RSS).

Here\u0027s a rough guide for how it works: if FMRS is disabled, StageRecovery will try to recover it (overrides all the things I\u0027m about to mention); if it has a probe core or a kerbal, FMRS gets to recover it; if it has a RealChutes parachute then FMRS gets to recover it; if it has a Stock parachute then StageRecovery gets to recover it; if it has no parachutes or kerbals or probe cores then StageRecovery will politely tell you that it was destroyed because nothing could recover that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently powered recover just assumes the fuel is used to stop safely (and inefficiently, a manual landing is more efficient) and doesn\u0027t adjust the distance. I have been thinking about using any extra fuel to try to reduce the distance as well, but haven\u0027t come up with any solid plans for how to do that. Part of the issue is that SR just uses the position at destruction and doesn\u0027t calculate the final landing position (the atmosphere makes things tricky), which would be a prerequisite for trying to adjust that final position. Gliding recovery would be not too hard if I knew the coefficient of drag and the coefficient of lift for the vessel, since then you can compute the glide slope and plug in the altitude and get a rough estimate for how far you can go, but I don\u0027t know how to access those variables for a particular vessel and they\u0027re dependent on the orientation. It boils down to \u0022these additions are a lot of work for only marginal gameplay gains\u0022, so they\u0027re low priority. I have other projects that have better gameplay returns for the same amount of work, so those get prioritized first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the link though.
