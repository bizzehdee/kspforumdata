In most popular sci-fi settings when a ship thrusts in a certain direction it\u0027s as if its previous inertia is negated or redirected, allowing the ship to gracefully weave between objects by simply maintaining a heading towards the point in space it wishes to pass through. As we all know from experience it works nothing like this in reality (or KSP, at least). The best way to illustrate it I could come up with was this lovely little mspaint number here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2uTgZ11.png\u0022 alt=\u00222uTgZ11.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like to see is a mod that enables sci-fi style spaceflight to go along with the various sci-fi style parts that have been added by numerous mods. One of the main concepts I think would be necessary for this to not be completely absurd would be specifically managing a relative vector; putting it in KSP terms, this would keep your velocity relative to a target aligned with your current heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more realistic option I can think of would be to just have a toggled flight control plugin that automatically uses RCS thrust to correct your relative velocity while maintaining your heading. This correction would almost certainly not be instantaneous, but could allow for some fun \u0022drifting\u0022 maneuvers. It would probably be impractical for larger vessels unless you coated the body of the craft in vernor engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more sci-fi option, which could potentially be made to work for a vessel of any size, would be an actual \u0022inertial redirection module\u0022 of some sort. I would imagine this to be something that consumes large amounts of electricity, with consumption scaled to vessel mass or applied force if possible, to automatically and near-instantaneously apply the necessary thrust to redirect your current relative velocity into line with your heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn both cases it would probably need some protection mechanism that only enables use of the system when dealing with another craft, asteroid, or similar object. Trying to change your velocity relative to a planet would probably be futile with the RCS option, and should likely tear apart your ship with the sci-fi option. I suppose an absolute behemoth of a spacecraft (I\u0027m looking at you, B9 builders) would potentially turn so slowly that the forces entailed in keeping its orbital inertia in line with its heading wouldn\u0027t necessarily snap it in half though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, a last bonus feature would be something like \u0022space brakes\u0022, which would just be an option built into the system to automatically apply thrust as necessary to slow or even stop your craft (again, relative to a designated target) when the throttle is set to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exerminator2000","CreatedById":60784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T20:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eseems like a good idea\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-21T21:57:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaking this would be fairly simple, but I fail to see what purpose it would have.
