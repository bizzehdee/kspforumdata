A 40m diameter Interplanetary Orion could have delivered 1200 tons of payload to the Lunar surface \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC about 10 times more mass than the third stage of the Saturn V. A human presence in space can only do so much actual research before the costs of keeping lots of people and equipment alive and running up there start to outweigh the benefits, at a time when space habitation technology was still largely in its infancy (and it remains so today). Launching robotic payloads might be a little better, but would still require building an order of magnitude more new equipment than has ever been launched beyond Earth orbit to date, setting aside the R\u0026amp;D that would be necessary to build Orion\u0027s spaceframe to the capability of withstanding over 1000 hammer-blow accelerations once a second for extended periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn topic, that engine really is sexy, but I feel that Nova\u0027s parts aesthetic clashes a bit with the textures of the 1m fuel tanks.
