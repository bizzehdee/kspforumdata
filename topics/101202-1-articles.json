Let\u0027s say I create a ship by docking two small ships. I only need a single capsule or probe core to control the thing, but I\u0027m stuck with that extra power draw because there\u0027s no way I can throw the \u0022off\u0022 switch on the ones I don\u0027t need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I\u0027m not suggesting some way to get around expending power for probe cores that are actually controlling the ship - I just want a way to shut off the power draw from the ones I\u0027m not using.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T06:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean like in BTSM?

It\u0027s really fun to schedule a whole reentry schedule with the delayed Remote Tech commands. Defining action group commands twenty minutes in advance before I do an aerobraking/capture/whichever with Jool is satisfying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Squad ever decide to make probes require more than a connection with the simplest of antenna or otherwise decide to implement something like RemoteTech, getting a hibernate function would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T16:09:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you can already do this by disabling the fuel cross feed for the probe\u0027s electric charge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fsYpG5M.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fsYpG5M.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you click on the green arrow it will not allow any electric charge in or out of the probe core.
