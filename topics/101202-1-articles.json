Let\u0027s say I create a ship by docking two small ships. I only need a single capsule or probe core to control the thing, but I\u0027m stuck with that extra power draw because there\u0027s no way I can throw the \u0022off\u0022 switch on the ones I don\u0027t need.\n\nNote that I\u0027m not suggesting some way to get around expending power for probe cores that are actually controlling the ship - I just want a way to shut off the power draw from the ones I\u0027m not using."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T06:07:11Z","Content":"You mean like in BTSM?

Lowering the power requirement drastically.\n\nI\u0027d love to see probe cores get this as a toggle option. It would not be much useful in stock but it would really be nice to work with Remote Tech where you can schedule timed action group commands.\n\nCurrently, just cutting the power manually on all the batteries is the closest I can come up with to store power during long solar eclipses. It\u0027s really fun to schedule a whole reentry schedule with the delayed Remote Tech commands. Defining action group commands twenty minutes in advance before I do an aerobraking/capture/whichever with Jool is satisfying.\n\nIf Squad ever decide to make probes require more than a connection with the simplest of antenna or otherwise decide to implement something like RemoteTech, getting a hibernate function would be great."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T16:09:47Z","Content":"I think you can already do this by disabling the fuel cross feed for the probe\u0027s electric charge:\n\n![fsYpG5M.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fsYpG5M.jpg)\n\nIf you click on the green arrow it will not allow any electric charge in or out of the probe core.
