Is this partTopY that needs adjustment?\n\u003E \n\npartTopY = determines the height of the top attach node compared to the center-of-mass of the model; it can be set arbitrarily to whatever you want, and only determines where the attach nodes are relative to the COM.  If your attach nodes are not positioned correctly relative to the model, see below.  This can safely be set to zero on all engines, though the center-of-mass may be off a bit (would be towards the top of the engine), which is why I default it to ~0.5m for most engines.\n\nengineYOffset determines where the model is positioned in the model file relative to its origin.  The engine plugin expects model origin (0,0,0) to be at the top-center of the engine.  So, for most engines you need to \u0027move the model\u0027 downward using this value (as the origin is generally at the part center-of-mass, somewhere in the middle of the engine).  For most engines this value will be the negative value of whatever their top-attach-node y-value was set to (e.g. node\\_stack\\_top= 0, 1.35, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2 would have a engineYOffset of -1.35 ).\n\nSo, your problem with the attach nodes will require setting the engineYOffset properly.\n\nThe shrouds -- see Jose\u0027s example;  basically you need to fill in the \u0027transformsToRemove\u0027 line properly, and remove the PartModules (generally ModuleJettison) from the part that manage the stock shrouds.

Would love to expand on engine options without having to do yet-more-modeling.\n\nI also verified that (at least the latest) module manager -does- properly detect and use NEEDS blocks on root-level configs (e.g. using a NEEDS block on a base part definition appears to work properly now); so \u0027patches\u0027 like the one for the cryo-engines can be setup to not bork things when the mod is not present (makes it so that they can be included in the base SSTU install and not require manual installation, etc).  This means I can actually include the NearFuture/Cryo-Tanks based MFT tank and radial tank additions with the next update (after a bit more cleanup).\n\nIn general news, I managed to get the cargo bay animation handling all setup and working.  Learned quite a bit more about Unity animations in the process, mostly while trying to figure out how to clamp an animation to a specific max range (for deploy-limiters for the different door animations), and the use of the Sample() method.  The nose, body, and tail can all be animated independently; the animations are defined in the model definition and pulled in dynamically depending upon the current part setup; not all models need to have animations, so the system will still work with non-animated parts just fine (with proper UI handling, disabling animation controls if not present).  Sorry, no pics; the models I was working with for testing this stuff were very crude.\n\nNow I just need to get all the various models/textures done ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  (might take a few weeks for this, as I\u0027m still trying to devote most of my time to wheel stuff).  But the plugin end of things is ready.  Which is now two modules that are ready for use but lacking models;  the \u0027welding docking port\u0027 module has also been done for a few months now but I\u0027ve been unable to find time to figure out and make the models for it.  Ohwell... perhaps I\u0027ll start getting caught up sometime this summer (would be much sooner if I can ever get the wheel stuff figured out).\n\nMay or may not have any MCB prototype parts available with this weekends\u0027 release; if I do it will likely just be the saddle-truss variant; the other variants have not yet been started on the modeling end (aside from the crude prototypes for testing of animation functionality).
