While not too far into the X territory, the X-ray flux remained in the X-class territory for about half an hour, and still is only slowly descending through the M class territory. The NOAA Space Weather warnings event has put out an alert for a Type IV radio event, \u0027typically associated with strong coronal mass ejections and solar radiation storms.\u0027 The current flux level is M6.1, and while not as strong as the peak, it is still a formidable flare. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESunspot 1520 has not made much noise in the recent days despite holding a Beta-Gamma-Delta class magnetic field, the most complex and energetic of the classes. It is also quite large, and very close to other sunspot groups such as 1519 and 1521, further contributing to the magnetic complexity of the group. Whether this is a let-off of much pent up energy and as a result an isolated event is not certain. It could signal an increase in activity. If this is the case, we are very far from being out of the woods - Sunspot 1520 is situated only a bit south of the center of the solar disc, and it will take a few days before it rotates out of view. For now, it is aiming directly at us. Furthermore, sunspot 1521 has shown fairly rapid growth and magnetic development, now a beta-gamma class sunspot. This is the second most complex and energetic level, the one right before BGD (beta-gamma-delta). It is very, very close to 1520, though a bit further along the disc. If it reaches BGD, it and 1520 would make a very dangerous pair. They certainly have time to make this occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe on the lookout for more flares, I have a feeling that 1520 is not done yet. They will surely be geoeffective if more occur, just like this one will be. Be on the lookout for auroras as well if you are in high latitudes and maybe even lower. The Bz component of the magnetic field at the moment is 2.2 nT north, making it a fairly routine situation, but if it does turn south then the magnetosphere would essentially open up a hole for the CME, allowing much greater auroras as well as power issues to be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX-Ray flux, 6 hour graph, updated every minute:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/rt_plots/xray_1m.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.swpc.noaa.gov/rt_plots/xray_1m.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Weather Warnings Center:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/alerts/warnings_timeline.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.swpc.noaa.gov/alerts/warnings_timeline.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flare (Just below the center, the bright spot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6EfT8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226EfT8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESunspots 1520 and 1521:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z5tnK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022z5tnK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Wasteland","CreatedById":14093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-12T17:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo estimated latitude?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rascal Nag","CreatedById":9451,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-12T17:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have not seen any data yet for the latitudes of the auroras.

You can also see the trend in the blue lines before the X flare. Now look at the time after the flare: We experienced a long decline, and then when we got into the background flux again, it started diving as well. Now it\\\u0027s slowly picking itself back up again. If this is like last time, it could pick itself right back up into a large flare. If it\\\u0027s not, well, that\\\u0027s it then. Nothing to worry about. But for now, it might be a good idea to monitor the flux to see if it moves into a more steady rise - when the previous X flare began, the rapid fluctuation came to a quick stop, and the lines became smooth. If we see that again, it could be a signal that we\\\u0027re starting round 2. In fact, right now there is a steady riser with little fluctuation beginning right as I\\\u0027m typing.
