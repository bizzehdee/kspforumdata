When i start KSP they all start up spinning, which (due to their age) takes a while, and not only prolongs the starting process of KSP unneccessarily (as it waits until all hdds are spun up) but it also puts strain on those drives i don\u0027t want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my questions are: is that call from KSP to the operating system, that causes the spin up of all hard drives, really necessary for the way the startup process is currently coded or can you change it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T00:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHard to say... where\u0027s KSP installed to, exactly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T00:55:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot heard of this one before, it may be a Unity3D thing but even so, it seems very strange, as Vxx says it\u0027d help to know where you have KSP installed and it\u0027d also help to see your logs, the sticky threads have info on where to find these and how to post the contents \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"perk","CreatedById":137780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T01:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is not really installed, it came as a zip package from the site, i unzipped it to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ksp0.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso the executable resides in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ksp0.9\\KSP_win\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe output_log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/frayixg13qjhoh2/output_log.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/frayixg13qjhoh2/output_log.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas you can see nothing in that log happens on any other partition let alone harddrive than C:\\, still it always starts them all :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T21:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot heard of this one before, it may be a Unity3D thing but even so, it seems very strange, as Vxx says it\u0027d help to know where you have KSP installed and it\u0027d also help to see your logs, the sticky threads have info on where to find these and how to post the contents \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get it with all sorts of things.
