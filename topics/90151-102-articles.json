I\u0027ve built a probe with the heat shield (1m from basic survivability) wider than the tank and core above it. Just something that would complete the first reentry contract. My starting altitude was higher at 200-250km. The heat shield was showing an overheat bar when hitting around 110km that started at around 40% and may have gone to 60% or higher before the critical failures occurred. It also lost little ablator over this time. The critical failures happened with the tank and core above. The tank would start to overheat after the heat shield and then the core would heat up suggesting the heat was radiating from the heat shield (yeah, a problem). One time after losing the tank at around 80km the core managed to stay behind the heat shield a last a little while longer, but heat continued to conduct through until it too exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving watched an old NASA video I\u0027m wondering do I need to offset for lift even with a tiny probe from low orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what\u0027s with things getting hot just sitting on the pad?
