Well, we could put a little research into possible techniques and examine the information we already have about the society... nah... let\u0027s just say aliens did it. They\u0027d probably have advanced tech so we don\u0027t really have to think too much about how it was done. Besides, I saw something earlier that looked kinda spacelike.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T10:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re a mixed bag of total nitwits, conspiracy theorists, hardcore atheists, and old fashioned believers in the idea that without technology of at least the current level nothing can be achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we have people who think \u0022the government\u0022 is hiding \u0022the truth about aliens\u0022 which logically leads to aliens being here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombine that with being atheists so needing an explanation for people being religious, and as we all know people tend to think things they don\u0027t understand are caused by the gods, so ancient people must have (because they were stupid and ignorant) have seen aliens and think they were gods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen of course they built large temples to those gods, but without modern technology that would have been impossible (according to the ancient astronauts nutters) so it must have been those same aliens building those temples and pyramids (there\u0027s a small subset that believes the ancient aliens aren\u0027t aliens at all but time travelers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the most ridiculous theory was aired as fact by the history channel around easter this year, claiming the resurrection of Christ was actually an alien feigning death being pulled out of Christ\u0027s (who was an alien, as is god they claimed) grave by a teleporter device, and later teleported back down (hence the glow around him, obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T14:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I love is all the theories about various things being used as methods of alien communication and as things like bases and landing pads and all that.
