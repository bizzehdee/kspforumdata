I suspect that plasma engines may need a buff. Which should resolve the power network issue. To be clear, it is not intended for you to be able to beam power across the solar system without very substantial investment. Vanilla kspi made this trivial because of reactor scaling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAM costs have not been balanced, they are basicly placeholder values.

It should have a better balance in the next major version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA MM config can change both the resource cost definition or the reactor starting amount. or, you know, you could just not fill up your reactor/tanks with AM in the VAB.
