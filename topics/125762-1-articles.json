These branches have seen separate development for the past six months, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re serious when we say that has led to the mother of all merges.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately Git allows us to easily merge different branches, but this merge was something different that your standard run-of-the-mill merge. Felipe (HarvesteR) bit the bullet and attempted to merge the branches, an operation that resulted in 390 conflicts on a total of over eleven thousand changed files. A larger problem was that due to optimization concerns many files had been moved on the Unity 5 branch, and these files weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t properly identified as having been modified but instead were set as added and deleted files. This wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t normally be a problem but given that many of them had received code changes in either Git branch it became one: these changes were not compared and therefore would be lost in the progress.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was a larger problem that the code change conflicts themselves, because hunting down the changes in both versions (and then determining which version of the code should prevail) manually is nearly impossible. Fortunately Git provided us with an alternative method: rebasing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nInstead of grabbing all the accumulated modifications from both sides and trying to crash them together straight away, rebasing works by treating one side as if it had happened first, then replaying the changes from the other side on top of that, as if it had happened afterwards. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a brilliant tool, which meant that by rebasing the Unity 5 branch on top of the Unity 4 branch, we could have the changes from our Unity 5 overhauls done after all of the Unity 4 work as if it had been completed before any work on Unity 5 had even started. Not quite time travel, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the close.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rebasing tool took us from 390 conflicts and a lot of added/deleted files to 398 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153both modified\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 conflicts, which was a good place for Felipe to start. This was a task that had to be completed by one developer because if the changes are \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153pushed\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 then the files lose their conflicted tags which makes them much harder to find and resolve. At this point an overlooked line of code would mean that a bugfix or new feature would simply disappear. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe next job was making the game compile and work properly: compile problems galore, from syntax problems from problematic merges, to the much expected integration problems of trying to make two six-month long trains of changes crash together and keep on going in a single rail. Fixing these issues meant Felipe and other developers worked through the weekend and yesterday\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Mexican national holiday. The good news is that it worked as the two branches are now merged into, which (hopefully) contains all the changes done on both sides.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nStraight after this mother of all merges we moved back to finishing the user interface overhaul. Many tweaks are still left to be done but with the Flight scene done and the Editors a good part of the way there progress is definitely felt and made. The tracking station also received some attention, and a very old bug was fixed in the process: small orbits on distant planets would be visible if you were zoomed in on any planet which wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t particularly hard on the eyes, but did affect performance. Orbits you could never see were wasting CPU time to render as tiny blips. That should be fixed now. If you zoom in to Kerbin, you should only see orbits belonging to the Kerbin system. If you zoom out, planets will fade in, but not their moons, until you zoom into them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile on his coding spree over the weekend Felipe also fixed the rendering of the new map nodes and put quite a lot of work in on fixing depth sorting issues which were occurring because when transforming the node positions to screen space coordinates, they were losing all depth information. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe fix for that seemed straightforward: the nodes needed to have their Z coordinates back, but that presented a problem. In map view, even though the nodes live in a scaled down layer, the distances are still quite huge. This is a problem because the interface canvas depth space is quite finite, so we needed a way to transform these potentially boundless distances down to a finite space.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsually this is done by defining a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153far\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 plane. A distance considered to be at infinity (but which very much isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t), so you can get a depth scalar value by dividing against that. That approach always bothered me, because it requires a fair amount of guessing, and mapping depth linearly like that would mean wasting most of the canvas depth space with\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 well, empty space.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFelipe worked out a curve using a graph plotter which is based on the really nice asymptotes produced by taking reciprocals of things. Starting from a reciprocal (1/x) function which approaches zero as x approaches infinity, he worked out a neat little function that transforms the camera-relative distance of objects in the world to the finite canvas space, in such a way that they never quite reach 100% depth. They slowly taper out as they approach infinity, and thus the depth space is filled out as optimally as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile Mike (Mu) continued work on the 1.1 version of part tools. It now supports package dependency loading, DLL loading and a fair few other bits. The KSPedia tools were also folded into the package so you can create entire plugin packages and package them as a single asset bundle. The KSP-side of part tools, to load and unload assets dynamically, is almost complete. Dynamic loading and unloading of assets in the game will probably not be in 1.1 yet as it requires a fair bit of work to get this fully functional however it will be coming.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSPedia is well under development, and Dave (TriggerAu) has been working hard to improve the efficiency of the development process in this area, setting up scripts that convert vector files (images) into component pieces that will allow the Unity Engine to display them ingame. A basic web display is also being made to allow the QA team to review the content independently of the game, making sure that no typos or inconsistencies slip through.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile on the subject of update 1.1. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re currently at a fork in the road: do we continue with the features we set out to add and delay the release or do we perhaps cut a few features to meet our internal deadlines. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a few things dependent on this decision, and that not only makes it a very important decision but also one that is rather \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153opaque\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 for people not involved in the process. There are many things to consider and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll keep you up-to-date in the future devnotes. Jim (Romfarer) quoted Felipe in this regard: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthere is no amount of pre-planning that can avoid having to revise the layout entirely\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a hard landing for our new producer, Joe \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDr Turkey\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D, who will introduce himself below and will try to give you some insight into the current state of how we look at the near future:[INDENT]\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, hi! So this is me, some of you already chatted with me over EJ\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s stream last Friday. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically I have been working behind the curtain for the past month to hit the ground running. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been crazy busy getting to know the (truly fantastic) team, the community, and the more \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153technical\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 state of things as well as the business and overall planning overview as a whole. There is so much to do that a list would probably take the space of the whole of this week\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s devnotes to write. I was there for the birth of 1.0.5 to take notes and analyze how the team performed as a whole. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn a VERY general summary, right now the plan is to consolidate current projects, consoles and the 1.1 update as smoothly as possible. Hopefully as soon as the transition period ends, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have the time and energy to start laying the groundwork for some secret hush-hush thingies for the far- far away future. On the lighter side, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m trying to get things all good and set up for the Squadcast, which will have me as host and some surprise co-host. I got some fun plans for my tenure as Squadcaster, but their implementation depends on the status of other projects, job timing, some extra planning and organizing beyond my current capacity as a human-poultry hybrid. No worries though, soon I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have power over spacetime and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be able to extend all of Squad\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s days from 24 to 42 hours per day, and then the true TAKE OVER will begin. I mean, *gobble. gobble!!*\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking forward to more sleepless nights in the name of KSP!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/INDENT]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s it for this week\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s devnotes.
