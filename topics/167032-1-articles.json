It wasn\u0027t your inclination that made the difference, but your trajectory. At Kerbin, I\u0027ve survived reentry at just over 8km/s; and been instantly turned into a puff of smoke at less than 4km/s. The difference is in how steeply you hit the atmosphere. Sort of the difference between wading out into a pool and just doing a belly flop from 30 feet up. If Eve were a normal planet, you could aerocapture from Kerbin easily. You\u0027ve seen how easy it is at Duna. You don\u0027t even need a heatshield to free-capture from Kerbin. Eve, however, is unforgiving. I tried to aerocapture there in my earliest tries to conquer the planet. They were spectacular failures.

heatshield at Eve.\u00A0 And it helps if it\u0027s wider than whatever\u0027s landing.\u00A0 IOW, use a 2.5m shield on a 1.25m stack, etc.\u00A0 However, you can skimp on the ablator.\u00A0 Most heatshields have enough for 2 or 3 Eve re-entries (for the unlikely event the same ship will do that many).\u00A0 So if you\u0027re worried about weight, reduce the ablator by 1/2 and see if you still survive.\u00A0 You probably will.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCapturing into a low Eve orbit by thrust alone typically costs about 1200-1500m/s IIRC.\u00A0 Not really a big deal if you\u0027ve

is there anything about not being in an equatorial orbit with Eve which increases the chances of the mission going sour?\u00A0 What I intend to do is basically the same as what I did at Duna, a small lander parachutes down to the surface of the planet, while an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E powered lander lands on its

separate ships, however.\u00A0 This greatly simplifies everything:\u00A0 \u00A0mission planning, ship design, and ship size/cost.\u00A0 If you send them both out on the same ship, you not only need a bigger lifter but you need a bigger transfer/OMS stage because either the Eve lander has to be dragged around to line up with Gilly, so you\u0027re maneuvering more mass.\u00A0 Plus the ship design is all complicated with various separate modules that have to separate.\u00A0 So I find it better to make each a specialized ship and have them go their own ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot being in an equatorial orbit at Eve has no real effect on anything, UNLESS you\u0027re trying to hit a specific point when you land there.\u00A0 Then you have to wait until that point passes under your inclined orbit.\u00A0 Also, if the ship in Eve orbit is coming home, it\u0027ll likely need a small amount more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for the Kerbin

radio, and batteries/solar panels.\u00A0 Plus its heat shield and chute.\u00A0 If you keep it as light as possible, it will slow down quickly without getting very hot or using much ablator.\u00A0 You can deorbit it with the transfer stage, then drop the transfer stage and watch it explode on the way down \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

Now that I think about it, I twice accepted \u0022mine ore from Gilly and deliver it to Eve\u0022 contracts. The money was good, and I have a mining operation on Gilly, so I couldn\u0027t resist. It was about 3,000 ore for each (which is extremely heavy), but I used the inflatable heatshield (which is extremely draggy), so getting it to the surface was a bit easier than I thought it would be. I\u0027d have to check when I get home tonight to see how many chutes I used for that one. Probably a lot. I\u0027ve learned hard lessons on Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, it sounds like your mission\u0027s ready to rock. For what you have available, it looks like a pretty solid design and overall plan. This should also give you some idea of what you\u0027re going to need for your manned forays in the future. The science you gain will keep your space program moving forward, so hopefully all goes well.
