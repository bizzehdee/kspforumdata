I\u0027ve got virtually no fuel left and am just entering a parking orbit of about 100k. \u00A0Starting to get familiar with dV values at various stages as well as the effect TWR has on my velocity at a given altitute - really helping my design efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdded 2 new pilots to the mix... Doodyer (as soon as I saw a pilot named \u0027Dood\u0027 I immediately hired him with no interview required :P) and some other dude. \u00A0Using texture replacer and I gotta say the differentiation in hair style adds sooo much to the Kerbal thing. \u00A0Ima relegate both of them to maintenance missions while Jeb takes care of the more high profile stuff. \u00A0That is, assuming I don\u0027t esplode one of them gloriously ... which is bound to happen at any moment. \u00A0(Already lost \u0026amp; resurrected Jeb once. \u00A0He\u00A0bailed out of his pod after landing on the side of a mountain. \u00A0At the time I thought it was my only option vs. exploding in the pod as it rolled 5k down the side of a mountain. \u00A0Funny thing is, Jeb bailed and disintegrated and the pod pretty much stopped just after I bailed.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTired. \u00A0Rambling. \u00A0 \u00A0This is amazing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\no7 B\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-04T05:31:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2016 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Buckley\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T13:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222493423\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135962\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459747697\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161384\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Buckley\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Buckley said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlready lost \u0026amp; resurrected Jeb once. \u00A0He\u00A0bailed out of his pod after landing on the side of a mountain. \u00A0At the time I thought it was my only option vs. exploding in the pod as it rolled 5k down the side of a mountain. \u00A0Funny thing is, Jeb bailed and disintegrated and the pod pretty much stopped just after I bailed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh god, \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E.
