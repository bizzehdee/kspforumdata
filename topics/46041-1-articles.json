You must buy high power amplifier and speaker system which can produce more sound pressure. Cheap PA-equipment with subwoofer on the 1 kW power class should be enough and quite affordable (maybe cost about the same than computer which can play KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaturn V was one of most loud devices which man has ever build. Sound level was about 190 dB. It is absolutely impossible to produce such a extreme sound level with any existing electrical audio equipment. It would need a small powerplant to make that energy (tens of MW acoustic power and typical efficiency of speakers is (far) less that 10 %). And be happy that it is impossible, because such a noise would kill you immediately and make everyone deaf in range of kilometers, break windows from half city, produce structural damage to nearby buildings etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T20:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I don\u0027t think he meant literally as loud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds are fairly easy to replace on any engine, the difficulty is mixing a new WAV file with the rocket sound you want, it has to be formatted to loop in the proper way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find the default sounds in YourKSPFolder\\GameData\\Squad\\Sounds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re all in the format sound_something_something\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom one of the NP engine configs you\u0027ll see the sound FX entries:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E// --- Sound FX definition ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esound_vent_medium = engage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esound_rocket_spurts = running\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esound_vent_soft = deactivate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esound_explosion_low = flameout\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see it calls 4 different sounds, the first one when the engine is \u0022staged\u0022 and activated, the 2nd one loops while its throttled up, the 3rd when it runs out of fuel or is deactivated, and the 4th is the special \u0022flameout\u0022 case which is mostly used for jet engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you listen to sound_rocket_spurts.wav in that folder, you\u0027ll hear what sort of format its expecting; Then you need to find a recording of the Saturn in a similar format, convert it to .wav and add it to the sounds folder (or put it in NovaPunch2/Sounds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you don\u0027t name it the same as one of the stock files.
