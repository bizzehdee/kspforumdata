It\u0027s been designed by the developers to take away most, if not all of the files. It\u0027ll be in the folder that the file\u0027s installed in, usually with a name like \u0022Uninstall \u0026lt;PROGRAM NAME\u0026gt;\u0022, \u0022Uninstall\u0022, or \u0022Unins000\u0022. If there are files left, just delete them using the standard delete function; The program that used the files doesn\u0027t exist on your HDD anymore so there won\u0027t be any dependency issues. I never got a definite answer as to why programs do this, but I think that because it\u0027s in documents the uninstall program can\u0027t delete them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T14:51:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI Need a Copyeditor anymore...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is knowing \u003Cem\u003Ewhere to look.\u003C/em\u003E Do you know off-hand which C:\\Program Files\\whatever\\ folder a program installed into a couple of years ago (especially if you manually set the install folder)?
