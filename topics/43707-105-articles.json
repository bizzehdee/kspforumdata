I didn\u0027t finish the Duna mission because these problems were making it hard to continue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis one is Critical\u003C/strong\u003E: The DELTAV component of maneuver nodes is now returning an unusable, unidentified object type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPrevious behavior in 0.9.2\u003C/em\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA maneuver node\u0027s DELTAV component is an object of type Vector. It\u0027s expressed in KSP\u0027s native XYZ coordinate system. This means it can be used directly with \u0022LOCK STEERING TO ...\u0022, and you can use a further suffix like :MAG on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBehavior in this new 0.10\u003C/em\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA maneuver node\u0027s DELTAV component is now an object of type ????dunno. When printed it looks something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[0 , 0 , 9]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect those 3 numbers are the radial-out, normal, and prograde components of the node\u0027s delta-V. (It used to be a vector in the native XYZ coordinate system.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are effectively 2 things this changes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - The rotation of the coordiante system of the 3 \u0027legs\u0027 of the vector is different - now it\u0027s rotated to the node\u0027s orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - The type of the object isn\u0027t of type Vector anymore, and whatever this tuple\u0027s type is, its not one that kOS allows script writers to make use of. We can\u0027t really use this object - can\u0027t get at its 3 component parts for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 is a little annoying, but I could work with it if I had to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s #2 that makes this a critical problem. I don\u0027t know what the C# type of this object is, but whatever it is, it\u0027s not one that has support for kOS script writers to use it, and therefore DELTAV isn\u0027t usable in this form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas this change of type for DELTAV intentional or was it a mistake?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnnoying but could be workable\u003C/strong\u003E: The execution speed dropped a LOT. I don\u0027t know if this is KSP 0.23\u0027s fault or not. As an example of this, in kOS 0.9.2, my brute force guessing algorithm that creates and deletes maneuver nodes created about 2 guesses per second. Now it makes about 1 guess every 4-5 seconds using the same code. I haven\u0027t traced down whether it\u0027s just one specific line of code that is now slower or if it\u0027s just in general all lines are slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA bit of new functionality not working\u003C/strong\u003E: The new command \u0022unset ALL\u0022 still left behind some variables in memory that stayed in the persistence file, and prevented reloading the craft. It\u0027s not unsetting all the variables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe ZIP package is \u0027rooted\u0027 in the wrong spot\u003C/strong\u003E: The standard method of unpacking a ZIP for a spaceport mod is that the user unpacks it into the GameData directory. Your ZIP file contains GameData inside it at the start of the paths, meaning you\u0027d have to unpack it into the root of KSP rather than into GameData. If you unpack it the way you\u0027d expect to (CD into GameData first and unpack it there) then you end up with a GameData inside your GameData, which in turn means the GFX textures aren\u0027t where the mod expects them to be and the terminal window doesn\u0027t show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I found so far.

(See the similarity? On one side, the external view of larger blocks, on the other an internal view of many many small blocks ...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo by that reasoning an OS could only be multithreaded if it was able to interrupt any single \u003Cem\u003Einternal\u003C/em\u003E CPU instruction (in RISC) in any place of the RISC code the CISC instruction expands to.

It\u0027s a quirky, kerbally language and a quirky, kerbally CPU. One, where --- as far as I can benchmark it --- every single instruction seems to take the same amount of time, no matter if it\u0027s simple or complex. A \u0022set x to VERY_COMPLEX_FORMULA.\u0022 takes as long as \u0022set x to 1.\u0022.
