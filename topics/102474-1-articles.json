FAR does add difficulty since you can\u0027t make sharp easy turns. The reason for its addition is the emphasis on efficiency for Tier 1 and Tier 3 and to a lesser extent Tier 2. FAR is much more efficient than stock aerodynamics so I wanted to give them the best chance they had. If I let people enter without FAR it might be concidered cheap since its there is much larger margins for error in stock than FAR. Which also makes it easier to write scripts... However the players without would suffer from efficiency so it might be counteracted by this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aphobius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aphobius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe rocket/script should be able to complete the challenge starting from any date or all of the 3 tests are going to take place on a new save file?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EYou are welcome to run things at a precalculated date.

Since you can accelerate time to whatever date you wish at the launch pad you can move to the launch date that would best help you. After all, all launch windows come up every day/month with respect to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this answers your questions! Let me know if you would still like to participate.

The timing of the burn can be calculated by seeing if Mun is closer or further away, when it changes from getting closer to getting further away then it is exactly above you and you are at a fixed point. Can\u0027t remember the exact amount of seconds to wait but you then wait for a precise time (around 3/4 of an orbit) and burn prograde for 872Dv. I was able to get a Pe around Mun of between 10 and 15km by timing my burn accurately. burn retrograde 100 seconds before Pe (at least on my craft) for 120 seconds and you are in orbit. Tidy your orbit and circularise and you are in orbit around mun from any point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good mix between checking and pre-calc and hardly any maths either...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK it\u0027s how the Apollo people did it.

For example, if you \u0022print MUN:LONGITUDE.\u0022 it will give you the longitude that Mun is currently at on Kerbin. This is kind of important since you can use this data to then get a phase angle between you and Mun. Using this you can then figure out when to launch, based on what altitude your parking orbit is. That part you will need to Google and find out yourself but I hope this helps others!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
