This helps. So you are still looking at recordings because as soon as other players warp the positions of everything they own move with them, but you don\u0027t see that. You see those vessels locked to your timeline, which is now different. When you dock your vessel is teleported to whatever position their vessel is along its orbit according to them, is that right? If they were to look at your vessel after a timewarp they would see nonsense because your vessel isn\u0027t where it really is and its and approaching a version of their station they can\u0027t see, but why do they care? At this point my only issue is that you\u0027re not seeing a coherent picture of reality or how things are progressing in transit if you\u0027re working in coop, but thats probably a player to player communication issue. Im not sure the best UI method, whether you\u0027d want to see nonsense trajectories or just hide them? But in the end it just comes down to a personal preference of what you would like to see--to look out in Map mode and see a consistent, shared timeline of where things are in your own time, or to see first where things have moved to in other players\u0027 near-present. In one case you have to communicate with players on any changes that have happened in your future, and in the other case you have to communicate on where everything is that\u0027s in transit. I would say the issues in Leapfrog are more manageable because players can work together to keep up, whereas those issues are fundamental and permanent in local bubbles, but if a player fears they are just always going to be left behind they may not see it that way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-10-17T17:40:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2022 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"t_v","CreatedById":213541,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-17T18:49:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224187007\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666028041\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in the end it just comes down to a personal preference of what you would like to see--to look out in Map mode and see a consistent, shared timeline of where things are in your own time, or to see first where things have moved to in other players\u0027 near-present.

When I say communication I mean communication about where vessels are in space and how long it will take them to arrive at their destinations.

And you need to guess and tell other players these things verbally because vessels in transit are not visible in a coherent way, and some strange things happen if we both have vessels in orbit and are both warping different amounts and changing course. You can still dock, which is good, but the sense of what the \u0022real\u0022 position of everything in orbit is becomes a bit wonky. Like if you have a station in orbit, I come in with a tanker and set up an elliptical orbit that intercepts it, then you warp ahead a few days, you will then see my vessel at some random point along the elliptical orbit. Then I make a burn to intercept your station where I see it, but from your perspective I make that burn at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E rather than close to the intercept point, and then where am I? Can you tell without asking how close I actually am to your station or how long it will be before I intercept? It\u0027s probably not a problem right away, but if someone has a tug that they\u0027re using to move things around for a couple different players change after change viewed from different perspectives could result in some strange behavior. You\u0027re kind of in this odd position where if you switch focus you see the vessel in its current configuration, which is good, but much of the information about where things actually are and where they are going is not coherent most of the time. Of course you\u0027re not seeing exactly the same things and need to communicate in the leapfrog model too, but at least the things you are seeing are part of a linearly consistent timeline shared by all.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224186987\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666025609\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only do they start at their present, but they stay in their present the whole time, and simultaneously are synchronized with everyone else.

So if for instance a player sends a vessel to Jool and then does another mission while its in transit (as many of us do) its still interactable en-route. If you were able to launch from Duna or Dres and catch it before it got to Jool you\u0027d have no trouble. Likewise if you were doing a fly-by maneuver like the Martian, resupplying a vessel or dropping off passengers as it buzzed by on a gravity assist you\u0027d have no trouble doing that either.

If you coordinate the same way in local-bubble (or whatever we call it, idk), then the planets line up in the same position and you can intercept things at the same time with no problem. Nowhere is there a situation where you can interact in leapfrog and not interact in the other system (if you find one, that\u0027d be an interesting discussion). On top of being able to intercept when you are at the same time (which is basically what leapfrog requires), you can also intercept when the two planets are in the same position relative to each other, even if you are thousands of years apart. I think that players being very far apart will be common which is why this system helps especially there, but if players are close together, my system functions very similarly to leapfrog except you just don\u0027t have any situation where you are a few hours, days, months behind a station that you need to access.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: What I\u0027m really getting from this latest page is that the biggest benefit that the leapfrog model has beyond free time warp is consistency. Things behave exactly as you would expect them to always, and there will never be a situation where someone is at Kerbin one hour and at Duna the next, unless you time warp that hour into a year or two. The price being not always seeing or being able to interact with with what other players are doing is something that is mitigable with coordination. That answers the question that I was having: instead of mitigating de-synced positions using coordination, you can mitigate de-synced time using coordination, and that is a better thing overall, combined with the consistency of stuff being in the right positions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-10-17T23:10:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2022 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by t_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-18T00:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224180074\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221664401680\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/28/2022 at 5:48 PM, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think theres a small but crucial flaw here.

Racing rovers seems like something I\u0027d do once or twice, and I don\u0027t really care about dogfighting or anything like that. What does sound fun is doing big coop collaborations on bases and stations, and being able to use MP as a teaching tool.
