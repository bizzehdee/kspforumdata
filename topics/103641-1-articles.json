In recent Internet adventures, I stumbled upon a few comments like \u0022where have all the space missions gone\u0022, or \u0022have we abandoned space\u0022, and so on. While it\u0027s true that space exploration is suffering from the financial crisis (as almost everything else is), there are many, many missions **physically under construction right now** (not just cool CGI renderings or animations!). In this thread, my goal is to post pictures you don\u0027t often see of spacecraft currently being built, so you can know the highlights of future space exploration in advance, if you didn\u0027t already. The purpose is to let everyone realize that space is exciting and cool, and that it will keep being so in the (near) future!\n\nSo, here they are, in order of expected launch date:\n\n- **NASA\u0027s InSight lander to Mars!**\n\nStatus: Launched postponed to 2018 to due instrument leak; spacecraft at launch site ([see this topic](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128436-insight-launching-in-2018/))\n\nDescription: The InSight lander, based on the Mars Phoenix design, will be the first interplanetary launch from Vandenberg, California. InSight will land in Elysium Planitia on September 28th, 2016, to study the interior of the planet, and hopefully yield clues as to how the rocky planets, Earth included, formed in the first place. It will carry the two MarCo cubesats, the first interplanetary cubesats.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![pia19664-MAIN_InSight%20Solar%20Arrays%2](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/insight/gallery/images/pia19664-MAIN_InSight%20Solar%20Arrays%20Open%204-30-15_001.jpg)\n\n- **NASA\u0027s OSIRIS-REx mission to asteroid Bennu!**\n\nStatus: Undergoing final testing at launch site (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E)\n\nExpected launch: 8 September 2016\n\nDescription: OSIRIS-REx will launch in September 2016 and reach asteroid 1999 RQ36 \u0027Bennu\u0027 in 2019. After having collected at least 60 grams (\u003E2 ounces) of samples, it will return and land in Utah in 2023. It will be America\u0027s first asteroid sample return mission, similarly to Japan\u0027s successful Hayabusa and its follow-up Hayabusa 2.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![OSIRIS%20HGA%20SolarArray%2010-12-15_005.jpg](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/space/photo/pressrelease/2015/OSIRIS%20HGA%20SolarArray%2010-12-15_005.jpg)\n\n- **ESA and JAXA\u0027s BepiColombo Mission to Mercury!**\n\nStatus: about to complete final acceptance tests ahead of shipping to launch site\n\nExpected launch: January 2017 (April 2018 according to latest update)\n\nDescription: The European/Japanese BepiColombo mission will launch on Jan 27th, 2017, and will arrive at Mercury in 2024, after an Earth flyby, two Venus flybys and 5 Mercury flybys. The two mission components - the Japanese Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) and the European Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO), plus the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM) - will study Mercury with unprecedented detail!\n\nSpoiler\n\nThe MMO with the adapter on the right\n\n![BepiColombo_MMO_unpacking_at_ESTEC_20150420_7.jpg](http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/7c/BepiColombo_MMO_unpacking_at_ESTEC_20150420_7.jpg)\n\nand the MPO\n\n![BepiColombo_MPO-PFM_payload-integration-at-TAS-Turin.jpg](http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/61/BepiColombo_MPO-PFM_payload-integration-at-TAS-Turin.jpg)\n\n- **NASA\u0027s Solar Probe Plus to study the Sun!**\n\nStatus: Integration, Assembly, Test and Launch Phase\n\nLaunch: 30 July 2018\n\nDescription: After 7 Venus flybys, starting from 2024 it will encounter the Sun at least three times at a distance of 3.7 million miles, or within 8.5 solar radii. That is about seven times closer than any spacecraft has ever been. At closest approach to the Sun, while the front of Solar Probe Plus\u0027 solar shield will face temperatures approaching 2,500\u00B0 Fahrenheit (or about 1,400\u00B0 Celsius), the spacecraft\u0027s payload will be near room temperature.\n\nSpoiler\n\nAn engineering model of SPP\n\n![140318_1_lg.jpg](http://www.jhuapl.edu/newscenter/pressreleases/2014/images/140318_1_lg.jpg)\n\n- **ESA\u0027s Solar Orbiter to study the Sun!**\n\nStatus: Critical Design Review\n\nLaunch: October 2018\n\nDescription: The spacecraft carries a suite of 10 state-of-the art instruments to observe the turbulent, sometimes violent, surface of the Sun and study the changes that take place in the solar wind that flows outward at high speed from our nearest star. Solar Orbiter will take just under three-and-a-half years to reach its operational orbit around the Sun, modifying its path by making close flybys of Earth and Venus. The highly elliptical operational orbit will take it to within 43 million km of the Sun - closer than Mercury, the innermost planet.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![SolarOrbiter_P1070119_625x833.JPG](http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/e8/SolarOrbiter_P1070119_625x833.JPG)\n\n- **ESA\u0027s Euclid dark matter telescope!**\n\nStatus: Under construction since 2013, but no info/photos\n\nLaunch: 2020\n\nDescription: Euclid is an ESA mission to map the geometry of the dark Universe. The mission will investigate the distance-redshift relationship and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to redshifts ~2, or equivalently to a look-back time of 10 billion years. In this way, Euclid will cover the entire period over which dark energy played a significant role in accelerating the expansion.\n\nI think this covers most of the main missions (except things like JWST, but that\u0027s more of a telescope than an actual space mission), but please do tell me if I\u0027ve missed something. A lot of famous missions, such as Europe\u0027s JUICE or AIDA missions, are still in the early concept phases, so no actual photos of construction and things.\n\nSo... what is your favorite soon-to-be-spacecraft? What other missions (actually being studied or just your own ideas) would you like to see in the future?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-22T17:48:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2016 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Frida Space**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T21:25:52Z","Content":"ESA\u0027s Solar Orbiter mission is due for launch in 2017, and should be well into construction by now, but I haven\u0027t been able to find any photos."},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T21:48:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ESA\u0027s Solar Orbiter mission is due for launch in 2017, and should be well into construction by now, but I haven\u0027t been able to find any photos.\n\nSame with Chang\u0027e 5 (2017).\n\nSo here are some photo\u0027s of other missions with the same hardware.\n\n**CNSA\u0027s Chang\u0027e 5 Lunar Sample Return**\n\n![change5.jpg](http://www.tiedetuubi.fi/sites/default/files/change5.jpg)\n\n![index.php?action=dlattach;topic=26848.0;attach=709216;image](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=26848.0;attach=709216;image)\n\nChang\u0027e 5 is a 8 tonne multi-craft \u0022stack\u0022 that will launch in late 2017 on a LM-5 rocket.

It\u0027s mission will be prove that India can land a craft on the moon as well as use the probe to conduct science on the lunar surface.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s a great explanation, thanks.

A sample from the south polar basin would probably be most useful scientifically (and both the US and Russia are working towards that), but it\u0027s unclear if it\u0027s on the cards-mostly because the moon program so far has been run by engineers under the PLA (like the crewed program) rather than scientists. There has been talk of putting it under control of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but as far as I know there\u0027s no timeframe for that."}]}
