I don\u0027t see a use-case for an OR-logic here, but maybe someone comes up with one) and a part that goes with it. Heck, you could even just add a version of each trigger that doesn\u0027t fire any action, just broadcasts it\u0027s trigger status on a channel. Anyways, let\u0027s say you have 3 symmetric engines with seperate fuel supply. You want staging to occur when all 3 are empty, not when the first one is empty. If they for some reason don\u0027t empty at the same time, even if the difference is in the microseconds, bad things happen. So you place a fuel trigger on all 3, set them to do nothing, yet assign them to channel 1. You place a single channel receiver, set it\u0027s action to stage and it\u0027s channel to 1. When all triggers broadcasting on channel 1 (I guess you\u0027d iterate the vessel parts at launch and put them in a vector. If a part gets detached from the spacecraft it is ignored.) have switched to true (condition met at some point) it executes the action, in this case it detaches the stage with the 3 symmetric engines once all 3 are empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d even get some nice combo effects. Say you have a trigger that fires pretty much at start and a trigger that doesn\u0027t really fire at all (say under 4km while disabled during launch and the use case is relevant much before re-entry). You\u0027ll get a true and a false on that channel so a channel receiver wouldn\u0027t fire.... Until the trigger that evaluates as false gets detached from the ship thanks to staging. The use case for this is, of course, activating an action group with parts that aren\u0027t on the staging queue, or else there wouldn\u0027t be any point \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the altitude trigger and your response: I see, that\u0027s unfortunate.

I see the use for this in, for example, having a single altimeter that can extend or retract a RemoteTech antenna at a set altitude, or control landing gear for both takeoff and landing. Both of which would be useful for either reusable landers or spaceplanes. It\u0027s sort of possible to achieve this effect with 2 altimeters, but even then they don\u0027t really reset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first version I came up with when creating an altimeter that could handle high altitudes actually had that ability, and would deploy within a set distance of the target altitude. Overall it worked reasonably well, but it did have a problem in that at extremely high vertical velocities (~500 meters per second) it could blow past the defined target window (~3.5 meters) faster than the game could recognize it, thus missing the trigger point. I have some ideas on how to fix this, such as scaling the size of the window based on velocity and switching over to OnFixedUpdate(), but at this point it\u0027s too soon to promise that I\u0027ll be able to get that working.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T21:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECame here to make suggestions, i see one (action group to activate/deactivate detection on altimeter part) and as another user had suggested, something to act in case the electric charge gets over/under a certain level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dtobi","CreatedById":90882,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T21:38:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the scope.

For now, I think the separate parts are OK. Should the number of parts keep growing (maybe with Firov\u0027s help) we might consider switching to something else.
