The reason is because engines cost money, and propellant is cheap. It\u0027s *far* cheaper to load down a rocket with twenty extra tons of propellant (necessary for, say, 150m/s extra gravity losses) than to increase engine power to avoid those gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also worth noting that, absent Falcon 9, most modern launchers are optimized for GTO missions, which means the upper stage needs very little thrust at all (consider the abysmal TWR of the Single-Engine Centaur).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three linked, but nonetheless separate, variables here, when talking about taking a payload to a specific orbit (all three change greatly when orbit changes):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Finally, optimizing for (3) will throw (1) and (2) out the window--it\u0027s far cheaper to make a 9.5-9.7km/sec ascent with high gravity losses than to have more engine and lower gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: the optimum delta V to orbit can be achieved by a rocket that is perfectly aerodynamic and has infinite (and infinitely variable) thrust. That obviously will not carry much payload, and be very expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as for how to play the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re shooting for LEO (and not MEO, let alone GTO/GEO), then you will need a high-thrust upper stage, or accept a shedload of gravity and steering losses from lobbing high and then lowering your apogee once in orbit (to have the time to get into orbit on low thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat can be done by something that starts at 1.15 and reaches 9.0 with a small second stage; that can be done by starting at 1.5, ending at 3, then going 1.0 to 3.0 on the second stage; that can be done by many 1.8-2.4 asparagus stages; whatever floats your boat (or lifts your payload).

Is the total burn time short enough to allow you to circularize before falling back into the atmosphere?

The 100% level does not mean the maximum physical power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthe expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir reference is a PDF which I won\u0027t link here, but you can retrieve it if you like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologise for misleading you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T11:42:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, looks like I wasn\u0027t quite right either.
