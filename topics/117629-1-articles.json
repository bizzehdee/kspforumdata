As the one video portrays dXdP\u003Csub\u003Ex \u003C/sub\u003E= h/4\u003Cem\u003Epi, \u003C/em\u003Ebasically defines that particles can behave like waves until they arrive, in which then the become like particles, even the largest particles have a frequency. Simple math becomes immensely more complicated when using probabilities. As the quantum computer denotes Nbits = 2\u003Csup\u003EN \u003C/sup\u003E. Which of course if you are familiar with the binomial probability distribution, the basis for doing things like Fisher Exact Test, the test becomes more math intensive as N increases, the quantum computer would greatly speed up the calculation. People don\u0027t realize that most statistics are not perfect, Chi2 for instance is an approximation. Fisher Exact Test works well for comparing groups, but the problem is how do you compare an expected value to an observed distribution. In that case Group 2 in FET is infinity, and cannot be done with FET, but with a quantum computer, you can do it. Even when you have a perfect thing, like a binomial probability distribution, applying it to complicated real world circumstances can be quite computer intensive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example is the Student\u0027s T test, doing this test again is an approximate probability, it assumes in the standard form that there is no variation in the distribution, and in the Welsh form it may overcompensate the effect of variation (I do normalization to fix problems), but we often don\u0027t know if there is differential variation and the Fisher test for variation is even more unreliable than the Student\u0027s T-test. But there is a way to calculate p-value exactly, its an infinite repetitions of Monte-Carlo (the limit as number the number of times the Monte carlo analysis is performed that any possible outcome will reflect its exact probability of being greater or less than other outcomes) series and the end result is a concatentated. The problem is that with large groups of numbers then number of possible outcomes is also equal to 2\u003Csup\u003Ef(n) \u003C/sup\u003E(where f(n) depends on the type of analysis being done). A quantum computer would not need to do that, it could exactly calculate the probability of all possible outcomes at once and all you would have to do is select the accumulated probability from a series that corresponds to a given observation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the thing is that a \u0022state\u0022, for example the state of glucose in a solution we see in the lab as the consequence of the laws of mass action, but that is only true when N is so great that the relative deviation becomes tiny. But as the volume of a solution decreases at some point that stops being true (and this is true for just about any system where there are 2 or more alternative states, an example would be Floridian ballots in the 2000 presidential election). And it is in these circumstance the quantum computing can define the probability that something is true or false (credible, or not credible) much more precisely than the typical computer. The answer is not yes or no, 1, 2 or 3, the answer becomes a credible range of outcomes, outside of which we would say that glucose is not behaving as expected in this solution, but not necessarily knowing why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with quantum mechanics is the above, in a system where there are possibilities of more than one event (or type of event) occurring in a given timeframe (lets say for simplicities sake a time greater than Planck\u0027s time, and in some otherwise empty unit of space) then the quantum system needs to calculate all the probabilities at once (and where in the Universe is this not true?) and yet we are still discovering fields that can be added to the complexity of the system, this is the reason the full characterization of quantum mechanics cannot be done at present, IMO, they may be 99.9% correct, but not precisely 100%. Even if they cannot find an clear example of something that contradicts quantum mechanics, because we need to know what feeds we might not be certain of what comes out. Certainly as we accumulate things over time, the results settle into the expected (exhibit the discussion of EM drive and momentum), but when you get down to widely spread quantum events, things may still remain unclear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part and for the great share of scientific history we have been measuring only the effect of accumulated events, even when we have the ability to measure singular events such as in the LHC, we accumulate the results of those events and come up with a statistic. If we had perfect understanding of quantum mechanics we could have perfect observations, and one atomic collision might suffice to say a given Higgs particle was detected (albeit this is an self-contradictory argument given Heisenberg uncertainty). Evolution itself, a product of quantum effects visible on the macroscale, has basically evolved to a state to optimize the benefit it gets from quantum fluctuations, as a consequence living-things control their DNA damage and repair to an extent that they allow mutations to occur at a certain managable level that allows creation of raw materials for future evolution and tolerating the more abundant negative effects. The point is there is a considerable amount of possibilities with potent quantum effects that we really don\u0027t understand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E These videos make it sound like - we know. Remember one thing, the universe to us ends at CMBR, that\u0027s it, that is the finite end, we cannot see before it or beyond it to other parts of the Universe that expanded away from us in time. The quantum entanglement issue is another, it makes it seem like the quantum state can be pushed to a certain outcome, but is that true or are they simply sorting outcomes that present one direction and ignoring (or allowing to pass-by) other outcomes that don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T14:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust be careful not to infect your mind with quantum mysticism.
