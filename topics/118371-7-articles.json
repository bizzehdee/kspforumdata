I\u0027m going to be taking over the maintenance of kerbal Foundries soon (I think lo-fi got burnt out on KSP development, he\u0027s actually throwing the proverbial towel out the window) which is where DustFX finally came to rest. Still, collision sound effects have been my greatest adversary (at least, when not struggling with the crud that\u0027s involved in making custom GUI windows. That was a nightmare.) We squashed some of the most persistent nullrefs when we stripped out the collision sound effects from my adaptation of CollisionFX.\u003Cp\u003EThinking about a random sound effect selector for a moment, I imagine the randomization part would be pretty simple to set up. We already have random number generators with definable ranges, so I would think setting up an enumerator for all the sound clips you have, and then have a random number drawn with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of the enumeration\u0027s length, you could then take that output and match it to the index in the enumeration and bingo, all ready to emit the sound effect. For configurable sound effects, you can simply set up a few config fields. One for the sound clip path, and a second for a comma-delimited list of clip file names (using two fields reduces the need to have the entire path for very clip) which is then parsed out at startup and enumerated with a prefix of the path for the clips. Alternatively you could simply require all sound clips to be in a specific folder and simply reference them by name. A third alternative is available, though I\u0027m unsure how to make it happen, but I know there are mods that can reference images by name on the global level, without requiring a path to be declared. You might be able to adapt that for sound clips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there I go again, derailing the thread.
