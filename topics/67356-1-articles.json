If all the parts are in the parts list then all goes as normal but if any parts are missing then a window pops up and a list of craft that will be deleted is shown to the user (along with exactly which parts are missing) who can then choose whether to load or cancel. This could be done quite quickly as part of the load menu before the space center is loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other way is fine as long as the user gets a choice before any deleting goes on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T08:31:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not also switch the missing part(s) by a dummy one ?
