In 2m, 5m length or both. I would love this for small space planes to deliver small payloads to orbit. I had a cargo bay from d12 expansion of b9 but the mesh is only on the bottom half of the cargo bay so i fall through when walking on it and it does NOT shield parts in FAR. I was most disappointed. Please someone out there. I dont even care if it\u0027s textured as long as its functional. THANK YOU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS. If it already exists please link me i have been unable to locate one as of yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T07:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust tell FAR that the d12 part ( or any part ) is a cargo bay and the shielding will work - obviously that won\u0027t help with there being no door colliders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeckuvaTester","CreatedById":138862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMKS has 1.25m cargo bays.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T16:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan I revive this thread by asking again?
