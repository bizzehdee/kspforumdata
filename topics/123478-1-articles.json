Then I thought, what the heck, and decided that my new test base would be placed on Duna, and that I\u2019d create a mission report for the effort. I\u2019ll fill out the mission report as I have time, this is more of a test base than a storyline, and I still have a lot of work to do on my mods, but I have the first four parts of the mission report done.

First up was the Colony Drop containing elements of the base. Next came the Cargo Buffalo with resources needed for the base, and finally, the Crew Buffalo lofted into orbit. Both trucks could be remotely driven and had enough room for the crew should their landing craft arrive off course.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022line-height:normal;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027, serif;\u0022\u003ESeveral months later, the flotilla arrived in Duna orbit. Each delivery vessel took its turn aerobraking in Duna\u2019s atmosphere. While the Colony Drop had a heat shield, neither truck\u2019s transfer stage had one, and ultimately heat shields proved unnecessary. With each craft safely in low Duna orbit, one by one they began their descent. The Colony Drop found what looked like a good spot and landed safely. The trucks had a more difficult time; both suffered damage upon landing but they were still mobile. Some careful driving later, they parked themselves next to the Colony Drop and went dormant, silently waiting for their explorers.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022line-height:normal;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027, serif;\u0022\u003EThe second Duna transfer window was fast approaching, so KSC began launching the second half of the Duna I mission. The Duna Tug went up first, followed by the Duna Flyer (landing craft), and finally the TERRAIN satellite. Mule went next. The robot cargo truck- really just a self-propelled trailer- had a supply of rocketParts needed for base assembly. Finally, Pegasus, the crew transport, took to the sky on autopilot. It flew straight up until its Supernova fusion engine- the world\u2019s first- had enough thrust to reach orbit.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022line-height:normal;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027, serif;\u0022\u003EWith just a couple of days to go before the launch window opened, Space Shuttle Sparrow blasted into the sky with Mitch and Isaxy at the controls.

It\u2019s a balancing act between getting there faster versus getting there in one piece. Even if we could get there faster, we have to wait for the rest of the fleet. And they won\u2019t have enough fuel to reach Duna, or they\u2019d have to dig so deep into the atmosphere that they\u2019d be forced to land, and who knows where they\u2019d end up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSwell,\u201D Jeb responded. \u201CAny other good news?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CActually, we have a problem with the fusion reactor and Supernova,\u201D Bill chimed in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re burning through our fusion pellets pretty rapidly, Jeb.

Ok, Val, what do you want us to do?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe\u2019s your ship, Jeb, so this is just a suggestion. I\u2019d shut down the reactor and engine, then lock the reactor\u2019s battery- we don\u2019t want to run into the problems we had trying to charge the batteries to start the reactor and then the engine like we did when we came aboard. Then we rely on the solar arrays for the rest of the trip. We can\u2019t do much science without the extra power, but at least we won\u2019t freeze.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COk, so there\u2019s nothing we can do about the snacks *sniff* because we don\u2019t have the fuel,\u201D Jeb lamented. \u201CBill, let\u2019s get the reactors offline.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COn it,\u201D Bill responded. \u201CMandarin is offline, and I\u2019m locking its battery. Ok, Supernova is\u201D\u00A6 not responding.\u201D (author\u2019s note: I have another bug in DSEV to fix). \u201CI sent the shutdown command but the engine won\u2019t respond. Oh, now it\u2019s in some weird state.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne sec, Jeb, I\u2019m gonna try something.\u201D Bill hacked into the Supernova\u2019s operating system and issued a diagnostic reboot. A few seconds later, the fusion engine rebooted and shut itself off. \u201CGot it,\u201D Bill said, smiling. \u201COnly downside is that we can\u2019t restart the engine or shut it off remotely. Once we leave the Pegasus, we\u2019ll have to come back to get things going again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COk, I can live with that. Val, you want to inform Mission Control?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, no problem. Hm... Gerbles, can you do a diagnostics check on the high gain?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYup! Let\u2019s see\u201D Uh, my panel says \u0027you must install a high gain antenna to continue.\u2019 I think that\u2019s bad.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh you\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201D Val said, astonished. \u201CFirst we are supposed to make the whole trip in freefall because we have no centrifuge, by design. Next the contractor left off the RCS thrusters, then we find out that we\u2019ll run out of snacks before we even \u003Cem\u003Eget\u003C/em\u003E to Duna, and now this! What was Mission Control thinking! You know what? I\u2019ll ask them. Switching to low-gain. This is going to take awhile.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBetter do it before we\u2019re out of range of the Minmus Relay,\u201D Gerbles warned. \u201COnce we leave Kerbin\u2019s SOI, we\u2019re on our own until we can build an antenna.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EVal said nothing as she fumed and tapped out her message.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zQBAQmN.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zQBAQmN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany months later, Duna Flotilla 2 reached their target, with Pegasus arriving first. Aerocapture simulations showed that the solar panels, which could not be retracted due to budget reasons- would sheer off at altitudes below 17km, so Jeb performed the braking maneuver at approximately 20km. The crew struggled with the fusion engine\u0027s troubles, periodically running diagnostics and rebooting its operating system, but they still managed to bring the craft safely into Duna orbit, albeit in a retrograde orbit. The crew would have to wait a few more days for the rest of the fleet- and their beloved snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IDjmFjL.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IDjmFjL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Duna Tug arrived ten days later- also in a retrograde orbit- but it took another two and a half days to aerobrake and stabilize its orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oynaciZ.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oynaciZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWasting no time, Jeb maneuvered Pegasus into the vicinity of the Duna Tug, undocked the Flyer, and remotely piloted it to Pegasus\u0027 nadir docking port.

It had plenty of fuel to do the job after ditching the Flyer, and might have enough left over to return to an equatorial orbit after dropping off the TERRAIN should it be needed again.

Anyway-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright folks,\u201D Gene interrupted, \u201Clet\u2019s get this mission briefing started. As you all know by now, the sun\u2019s recent increase in solar activity has been wreaking havoc with long-range communications and has increased the radiation danger all the way out to Kerbin\u2019s orbit- and a bit beyond, actually. Unlike typical solar events, which usually pass in a few days, this one is sustained for some reason that we can\u2019t yet determine. In short, our star is grumpy and throwing a temper tantrum. What\u2019s odd is that it just suddenly started happening. The science team is working on it. I\u2019ll have answers for you when I get them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo far, Kerbin is mostly safe from the geomagnetic storms- plural- due to our powerful magnetic core, but our astronauts aboard Skylab pass through the radiation belts once per orbit. They\u2019re ok for now, but cumulative exposure will be lethal. We need to launch a rescue mission to bring them home since \u003Cem\u003Esomebody \u003C/em\u003Edecided not to include lifeboats aboard Skylab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGiven Skylab\u2019s age and current condition, the new Administrator has elected to de-orbit it in favor of a newer, radiation-hardened facility. Space Shuttle Sparrow\u2019s mission is to rendezvous with Skylab, retrieve the crew, and attach the de-orbit module. Once Sparrow returns home, Mission Control will fire the de-orbit module. Questions?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsaxy was the first to speak up. \u201CHow will the increased radiation affect Duna I?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBy now,\u201D Gene responded, anticipating the question, \u201Cthe Duna I crew should be setting up their base and likely have been trying to contact us. Given their distance from the Sun and their built-in radiation shielding, they should be ok as far as their health is concerned. The contractor\u2019s omission of a high-gain antenna on any craft in the flotilla really set us back, but even if they built one, the disruption of long-range transmissions makes it impossible for them to communicate with us, or vice-versa, for the foreseeable future. They\u2019re on their own for now but-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow are we going to contact them,\u201D Isaxy pressed. She really wanted to know that Gerbles was ok.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot missing a beat, Gene continued. \u201CThe Administrator has a plan for that. It will take some time to put in place, however. For now, we have to abandon low orbit until we develop the technology to overcome the radiation hazard. But we\u2019re getting off topic, let\u2019s discuss the mission at hand...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nnOTpgz.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nnOTpgz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace Shuttle Sparrow lifted off the pad early in the morning, her engines roaring against the pull of gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022h163dMy.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h163dMy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs expected, the lower-stage guidance fins began heating up soon after breaking the sound barrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qoOPLEn.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qoOPLEn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few minutes later, Sparrow dropped the outer boosters.

We\u2019ll boost for as long as we can, then glide the rest of the way.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nKomet arced over at nearly 20 kilometers up, then headed downward. Despite Jeb\u2019s piloting, the plane wasn\u2019t going to reach their destination. Not wanting to give up, the veteran pilot waited until the last possible moment to deploy the chutes, but fourteen chutes proved inadequate for their load.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb gripped the controls like a vice, this was going to be a hard landing. \u201CBrace for impact!\u201D Komet\u2019s wings flexed as the craft slammed into the ground, but she held together. The only thing screeching louder than bending metal were Bill and Bob. They landed 31 klicks east of their desired landing zone, well short of their target.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd without fuel, they were stuck.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt least it didn\u0027t take long to setup the camp.

Bill took some time to modify the Komet\u2019s wings so that it could hold a variety of different resources, while Bob set up a Watney lab to create water as well as a Sunburn lab to make fusion pellets- Bill and Bob needed them for a project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb didn\u2019t have much to do as usual, so he played fizzbin over the communications link with Val whenever it was available. \u201CI want to fly like a bird,\u201D he said after one frustrating hand. \u201CJust strap on a pair of wings and go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat pilot wouldn\u2019t,\u201D Val responded. \u201CMaybe when we\u2019re finally settled we can build one.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite having an army of Gold Diggers working whenever there was daylight, resource extraction proved to be slow.

The small, portable fusion reactor was every bit as good as the Solar Flare, but available in a much more compact form. With the Gold Diggers now running continuously, Komet Outpost became a proper supply depot. All they had to do is wait for their resources to accumulate. To pass the time, Bill refitted the Komet with some additional components.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JoTXpiz.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022JoTXpiz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThirteen days after they left, Bill, Bob and Jeb left the newly renamed Supply Depot on automatic and launched into the sky with a hold full of minerals, rocket fuel, and even fusion pellets for their new micro-fusion reactor. They landed 1.3km from Lowlands Base and got stuck on a hill- the M1A1 wheels couldn\u2019t handle the weight. Gerbles drove out with a tank of LFO, and Komet shot up the hill and parked next to the base without issues.

Jeb and Bill set out to the Supply Depot again with their new Claw Marks strip miners and a Smoke Pipe cooling tower. All they had to do is produce enough organics before their snacks ran out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IQGpMeg.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022IQGpMeg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the additional chutes they still landed hard, and Jeb realized that they need a better way to slow down. Bill pointed out that the VTOL jets just need some action group reprogramming to make it easier to use them for landing, but he added some retro rockets to the ship\u2019s nose to help it slow down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill also restructured the base to make it more stable and installed two Claw Marks and the Smoke Pipe. With the increased drilling rate and continual power, it didn\u2019t take long to process the raw materials into the organics that they needed. A short hop later, Komet returned with a load of organics and more minerals just as a sandstorm arrived.

Anyway-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright folks,\u201D Gene interrupted, \u201Clet\u2019s get this mission briefing started. As you all know by now, the sun\u2019s recent increase in solar activity has been wreaking havoc with long-range communications and has increased the radiation danger all the way out to Kerbin\u2019s orbit- and a bit beyond, actually. Unlike typical solar events, which usually pass in a few days, this one is sustained for some reason that we can\u2019t yet determine. In short, our star is grumpy and throwing a temper tantrum. What\u2019s odd is that it just suddenly started happening. The science team is working on it. I\u2019ll have answers for you when I get them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo far, Kerbin is mostly safe from the geomagnetic storms- plural- due to our powerful magnetic core, but our astronauts aboard Skylab pass through the radiation belts once per orbit. They\u2019re ok for now, but cumulative exposure will be lethal. We need to launch a rescue mission to bring them home since \u003Cem\u003Esomebody \u003C/em\u003Edecided not to include lifeboats aboard Skylab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGiven Skylab\u2019s age and current condition, the new Administrator has elected to de-orbit it in favor of a newer, radiation-hardened facility. Space Shuttle Sparrow\u2019s mission is to rendezvous with Skylab, retrieve the crew, and attach the de-orbit module. Once Sparrow returns home, Mission Control will fire the de-orbit module. Questions?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsaxy was the first to speak up. \u201CHow will the increased radiation affect Duna I?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBy now,\u201D Gene responded, anticipating the question, \u201Cthe Duna I crew should be setting up their base and likely have been trying to contact us. Given their distance from the Sun and their built-in radiation shielding, they should be ok as far as their health is concerned. The contractor\u2019s omission of a high-gain antenna on any craft in the flotilla really set us back, but even if they built one, the disruption of long-range transmissions makes it impossible for them to communicate with us, or vice-versa, for the foreseeable future. They\u2019re on their own for now but-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow are we going to contact them,\u201D Isaxy pressed. She really wanted to know that Gerbles was ok.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot missing a beat, Gene continued. \u201CThe Administrator has a plan for that. It will take some time to put in place, however. For now, we have to abandon low orbit until we develop the technology to overcome the radiation hazard. But we\u2019re getting off topic, let\u2019s discuss the mission at hand...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nnOTpgz.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nnOTpgz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace Shuttle Sparrow lifted off the pad early in the morning, her engines roaring against the pull of gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022h163dMy.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h163dMy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs expected, the lower-stage guidance fins began heating up soon after breaking the sound barrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qoOPLEn.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qoOPLEn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few minutes later, Sparrow dropped the outer boosters.
