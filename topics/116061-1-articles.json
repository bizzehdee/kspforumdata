That mission... is to be the first probe... to land on the lunar farside!\n\nThe mission will be launched in 2 parts, a relay satellite to L2 (halo orbit) for communication, and then the probe itself. Both will be launched on LM-3B\u0027s in late 2018.\n\nThe probe will carry the equipment as before as well as some new equipment. It will carry the Yutu 2.0 (not actual name).\n\nEngineering objectives;\n\nTo realize the first soft landing on the lunar farside and perform exploration in human history.\n\nTo demonstrate technologies of lunar data relay, landing and roving on complicated terrains of the lunar farside, and lunar night power generation;\n\nTo perform further detailed survey on lunar environment in order to lay a foundation for subsequent lunar exploration mission.\n\nScientific objectives;\n\nTo study lunar surface dust features and its formation mechanism;\n\nTo perform in-situ measurement of lunar surface residual magnetism\n\nand study its interaction with solar wind;\n\nTo study lunar surface temperature and particle radiation environment;\n\nTo perform lunar surface topology and material composition analysis,\n\nshallow-layer structure survey and study;\n\nTo explore and study lunar interior structure of spheres;\n\nTo perform lunar based VLF astronomical observation and study\n\nFinally I should note that this will be an international cooperation mission with ESA and possibly others involved such as Russia or India, no US though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T15:16:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xenomorph555**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T11:18:09Z","Content":"Huh, and I thought we had enough of the moon already.
