Isn\u0027t that better?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: to truly see the effects of wing drag on an airframe, I decided to slightly modify one of my standard atmospheric (non-spaceplane) aircraft and compare the new version against the old one with respect to sea level speed. The two aircraft can be seen below, the differences between the (new) FA-2B on the left and the original FA-2 on the right being a reduced wing piece count on the former (16 smaller wing pieces were used, above and below, on the FA-2 to hide the cleavage between the two engine and fuel sections, whereas these were removed on the B version) and that the two engine-fuel fuselage sections were moved closer to the centerline on the FA-2B (with only cosmetic effects, this did not impact sea level speed). In both images, the aircraft have payload, but this was dropped immediately after takeoff for the speed test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result? The FA-2B, with its 16 fewer small wing pieces (which overall do not cover a very large area and have been put in such a way that they are not hit by the airflow) has a sea level top speed at least 550 m/s higher than the FA-2. Why do I say \u0027at least\u0027? The reason is that the B version eventually burns up as it accelerates beyond 950 m/s. The FA-2 struggles to hit a speed above 400 m/s. So, that is the difference that 16 small wing pieces can make - now imagine if we try to build with larger wing pieces... to achieve larger wings...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mHnJAkz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mHnJAkz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T00:22:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aanker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:16:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo we\u0027ve successfully drilled down to the heart of the matter; planes actually work fine and its still pretty trivial to make a plane that will get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat HAS been eliminated is the ability to freeform construct things out of piles of wings without giving any thought to how it would fly.
