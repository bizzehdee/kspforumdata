I was wondering if there was anything slated to add reliability as a factor when designing/building a rocket or spaceplane. I would like to see something added to where maybe you can unlock something from the skill tree, but those items unlocked start ot maybe 40% reliability, meaning that they would have more chances to fail on your next mission, unless you research that part further. The reliability could also be increased significantly by succesfully completeling a mission with said parts that were unlocked. Knowing that this idea isnt for everyone, possibly make it optional, this way more experienced players can start from scratch with a harder difficulty. It would also set up nice for when currency is added to the gameplay, meaning you could invest x amount of your budged into R\u0026amp;D to make things more reliable for future missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T20:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I believe this idea falls under the \u0022Random failures / malfunctions\u0022 category of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not To Suggest list\u003C/a\u003E.
