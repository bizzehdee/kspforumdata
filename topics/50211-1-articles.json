I wanted to orbit Dres while doing the science experiments high/low Orbit and then science until I crash. When I got to Dres, I was going about 3.4km/s. I had to do an inclination burn to meet up closer to Dres as my initial burn put me below Dres. I was able to get my PA down to about 32k after a few reloads. I am just going too damn fast to get into even a highly eccentric orbit. My craft has about 1.7k Dv after correction burns. It isn\u0027t enough to slow me down so I either crashed or skipped out of Dres\u0027s SoI. Is there a way to cut down on my Dv requirement or am I just stuck with a crater? Obviously can\u0027t aerobrake. Regardless of the answer, that mission is done as I get enough science. I will send a new mission there at some point. My craft weighs about 10T and I am using a single nuclear engine. Did I screw up my transfer, coming in too hot or is that high speed normal for a Dres transfer/encounter.

MechJeb doesn\u0027t appear to understand aerobraking however. Either that or it does and I\u0027m not entirely sure what the term implies which is the most likely answer. It\u0027s not bad at it though, I had a Dres encounter last night and I burnt around 200 Delta V correcting and the standard amount on arrival. The correction did put me on course for a 90 degree inclination which needed to be corrected after reaching the SOI though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way I also had a failed attempt using MJ prior to that which left me with Delta V calculations that were about 5k over the expected quantity so you may have hit the same issue I did.
