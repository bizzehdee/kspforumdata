My 27t craft was level and landed at 7m/s on 8 of the large landing struts. No part of the ship hit the pad except for the landing struts and the result was the pad exploded and then blew up my ship killing all on board. Really?\n\nThankfully I had a quicksave from orbit that I could load up and try again, this time adding a little horizontal RCS push to ensure I land a few more meters north of the pad and hit the ground. It worked perfectly with a nice soft landing at 7m/s again - safe and sound, no explosions.\n\nAnyone else had this experience with the launch pad acting like a Pinto\u0027s gas tank?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T22:28:35Z","Content":"Yes.

After the destructible buildings patch came out I watched streamers fire barrages of Solid Fuel missiles at the runway for 30 minutes and it never exploded. It isn\u0027t cumulative damage.

It doesn\u0027t seem right when you drive a rover onto the launchpad at 2 m/s and then have it explode but smash a missile into it at Mach 3 and have it remain intact. I would definitely like it to see this annoying bug get fixed by making building destruction dependent on speed as well as weight."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T22:49:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I bumped into a *lamppost* outside of level 2 Mission Control at about 3 m/s and the whole thing went kaboom.

That might make sense if small hits accumulated over time, then one small hit might be enough to finish it off. But when I reverted to a quicksave prior to the landing the KSC pad displayed as needing no repair (I checked), so I don\u0027t see how there could have been any previously accumulated damage unless it counts as some form of un-repairable wear and tear."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T12:28:01Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had it explode just by coming out of warp while having a really heavy rocket on it, and that\u0027s even with launch clamps.
