I loaded into a station I was aerobraking on Kerbin to circularize its orbit. This proceeded without incident (PE was about 45km). I then detached a Mk1-2 pod and reentered way to steep. However I impacted the ground at over 2.4 km/s. The pod was accelerating right up to impact with the ground, though it displayed full aerodynamic visual effects (heating included). I also noticed the heat shield never lost any ablator resource (despite passing through the lower atmosphere at 2000 m/s\u002B).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then loaded a new Mk1 pod and 1.25m heat shield and launched it (thinking the problem may have been due to the original craft being in space during the upgrade). It had exactly the same problems. These two attempts both had several mods installed (KW Rocketry, E.V.E., MechJeb, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Protractor, and a few part packs for science parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then removed all of the mods and tried again in a new sandbox save. Again with a Mk1 pod, no heat shield this time, and again no atmospheric drag whatsoever, pod accelerated all the way to impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody else seen something like this? Any suggestions of things to try would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think hardware is an issue, but I\u0027ve attached DXDIAG output in case.
