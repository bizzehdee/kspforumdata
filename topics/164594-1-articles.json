The smallest one\u00A0is 3 tonnes empty (yeah, heavy I know), a lot of lift area,\u00A0and has a Juno engine with 30 fuel to get it up to altitude (I don\u0027t detach it as it only saves 282kg). I\u0027ve tuned all surfaces so the aircraft will climb, level off at around 12,500m without using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E or manual control. When the 30 fuel I have runs out, I can turn back and pass KSP with 5,000m\u002B to go, as my glider glides at about 30-40m/s IAS\u00A0with a vertical speed of -10m/s initially, slowing down to -2.5m/s in denser air. Even with this incredible performance (for KSP), 2.5m/s sink rate is 500ft/m, and I only get a L/D ratio of between 8 to 10 (less than the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_Glider\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGimli Glider!\u003C/a\u003E). Real sailplanes get ratios between 30 to 60 and descend at about 0.5-1.0m/s. Because my glider descends at a stable speed, it has lead me to believe that KSP\u0027s drag is too high, and if I reduced the drag by a certain factor, my L/D ratio would climb and my descent rate would slow down while maintaining speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs well as this, I\u0027ve noticed that turbofan aircraft often \u0027hit a wall\u0027. I am aware that their thrust diminishes with speed and altitude, but they seem to accelerate very fast on take off, then find it difficult to creep up to speed. This seems to be why if I create an aircraft with a similar T/W ratio as an airliner, it won\u0027t get anywhere near cruising speed and will often not be able to accelerate to take-off speed.\u00A0Thus, KSP aircraft tend to have crazy T/W ratios to get up to a somewhat realistic speed, but are\u00A0able to take-off and climb extremely fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is, is KSP\u0027s drag too high, or is there another underlying issue? If drag is the issue, I would be happy to develop a simple plugin to correct this. I am aware of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, but is rather complicated and currently not updated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boris-Barboris","CreatedById":133181,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-19T17:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223152411\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221503162772\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002266344\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shaun\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, Shaun said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is, is KSP\u0027s drag too high\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223152411\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221503162772\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002266344\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shaun\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, Shaun said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would be happy to develop a simple plugin to correct this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a global drag magnitude modifier somewhere in physics.cfg or smth, I used it along with some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches to scale up parachute drag cubes accordingly in order to tune the stock aerosoup up to my taste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shaun","CreatedById":66344,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-19T18:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have found them!

As in, if I take off and let things go, the Afterburner Jet you get (the 3rd one with wet/dry mode you get I believe) will often break neck speed up and get to 750-900 m/s easily within a minute of take off, and given T/W ratios, I can go vertical for example, and it will burn the skin off no problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther times, I notice if I don\u0027t do certain things (I can\u0027t remember what it is, sorry) or do certain things, I can roll out, take off, climb at 15-25* and the jet will surpass the \u0027speed wall\u0027 and get up to the usual mach 2-3 (750-900 m/s), with almost no effort on my part, no shallow dives for speed as far as I recall. OTHER times, no matter what I do, no matter how many shallow dives I take for speeding up, regardless of flying at 1000m or 6000 or 1000m, the jet will not \u0027turbocharge\u0027 itself with the increased speeds it gets to, usually 300-350m/s sometimes less, and will simply refuse to accelerate as I would expect, short of nose diving into the ground to get beyond 350-400 m/s. And even if it does say, get to 400 m/s, in those \u0027off\u0027 cases I\u0027m talking about, the same jet that went supersonic and beyond in an earlier flight, this time might quickly lose thrust/speed if I nose up even a tad.

I do understand to a degree that the aerodynamics in KSP are game-i-fied due to many reasons like many of the space related physics (N body etc.). With that said I have been long aware of the F12 aero drag display. To my surprise I didnt pay attention to it before but after reading another post I looked again, and the troubled aircrafts I test all seemed to have at least 1 piece of fuselage (usually the Mk2 lifting body components) that have a 20-30 yard long drag line, usually just the one bad one at around 300\u002B m/s. These are the same craft that have trouble gaining any kind of speed above 0.9xx Mach. So, I oberved another craft that was more a simplistic joke build, with mk1 cylinder shaped components. Sure enough, the worst drag lines were barely a couple odd yards long at hypersonic (super? as in well above 500\u002B m/s) so it was able to pierce through the air. Keep in mind I\u0027m a minimalist in most of my builds so I\u0027m using 1 or 2 Panther jets in Wet mode (that one I described again) that have PLENTY of t/w on paper. The ones that seem to speed up without issue are dissappointingly NOT the lifting body Mk2 (they look sooo much better/scale to me) but the mk1 builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, I\u0027ve used the slanted scoop as well as this beginner circular intake. No diff as far as any change in success rate....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd no, I\u0027m not going to use the EZ mode Rapiers because, 1. I dont have them unlocked yet, 2. Why not use Panthers if they work for others and me on occasion?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo long story longer, are Mk2 fuselage just gimped in the game at the moment and just need a hideous amount of power behind them to work (i.e. ugly big quad jets etc) and push through their disgusting drag. OR, am I making a mistake somewhere? I\u0027ll try to update this post with some pictures of the afflicted aircraft for reference so you might point out some errors on my part (hopefully?). I try to go for somewhat realistic looks and only now and then clip parts to make something look better.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLOL ok as soon as I fired a \u0022bad\u0022 design up and took to the air, it again, defied the norm and kept speeding up.
