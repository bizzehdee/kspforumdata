Eve is really hard on the bigtrak - I was crawling up a 6km mountain at a painstaking 14m/s from my landing site, and my thrusters had been decimated by a hard landing. It was night, and everything was a deep purple. Very atmospheric.

This allows them to be carts but to also have the torque/sas options of a command pod which can help you roll them back on their wheels if they happen to flip over. Another thing that may not work if the Bigtrak is just a Cart would be the puddle jumper, but its still having collision issues with the Bigtraks airlock that still need to be resolved. I have yet to reproduce the lag issues that people have been reporting with the plugin, which is a modifed version of Cart 1.33. I\u0027m not saying that there isn\u0027t a problem with it, but just that I have piled up 25 diffrent types of Carts around the the space center with no lag or issues encountered. I was using my old Vostro laptop for this which is not a high end machine with its aging 8600GT video card, so if there was any problems they should have shown.

Both the bigtrak and cart plugins define the same class structure however the classes in the cart plugin have context menu\u0027s whereas the ones in the bigtrak plugin do not. That in itself isn\u0027t the problem though. KSP loads the plugins alphabetically. The bigtrak plugin being CartCommand.dll under the mono string sorting would come after Cart.dll. Once again not a problem, the issue is that cart.dll goes off and defines a set of classes making up the plugin (including context menu\u0027s). CartCommand then comes along and over-rides the same classes with versions excluding the context menu\u0027s.
