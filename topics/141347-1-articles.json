Anyway, I play this iOS game called Extreme Road Trip 2, and they have a leaderboard. At first I thought the game was boring but then I saw my neighbor got a higher score than me. We had a 2 month long competition. I this has been requested before but all we really need is Steam achievements and a leaderboard UI. It\u0027s a temporary replacement for multiplayer, and it can spark space races and competitions from people that you may have not known to even have the game.
