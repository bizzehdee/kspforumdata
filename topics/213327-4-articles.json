I don\u0027t see any reason to assume a significant deviation in purchasing trends between different outlets beyond minor personal concerns driving people to different choices. The spikes in purchasing/refund behaviour will probably begin to flatten as people either hold off, purchase then refund to hold off, purchase with a view to development updates or purchase to transition fully to ksp 2. With that, short-term assessments are probably unhelpful as the dynamics will evolve along with the update cycle. Mid to long term is worth more in assessing the viability, and one hopes the bean counters share that view. There\u0027s no denying that the pressure must be on, and increasing that pressure through angry emotional outbursts hasn\u0027t got a great track record in success.

We can see number of players on GMG, roughly 470 or so. (Hence why we tend to ignore GMG as any sort of analytical tool, way to low user adoption rates.) So, I\u0027d just advise caution on using steam as the only metric even though it\u0027s\u00A0 the only platform we have concrete data on. I know that sounds, off, but just keep in mind that while we can see steam, that epic sales and store/website based sales might be even higher. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts pretty obvious that Steam is the biggest store for games - epic is mostly used if there is no other choice or if its cheaper so steam probably is a very good indicator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is beyond me why anyone would buy games on the EPIC store if there is any other choice - because EPIC - in my opinion - is probably the most anti-consumer store i can think of with lots of missing features to silence consumers.
