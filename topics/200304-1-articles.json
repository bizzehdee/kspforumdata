It may still be possible to reach high elevations of flight even with the ramp exploding as I am jumping it. We will see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the ramp constructions may prove to never work. As an alternative plan, I am seeking natural features on Kerbin that can be jumped.

It was GREAT!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the best way to jump is using an external command seat. This is because sometimes Kerbals are knocked out of the seats. They are projected way in front of the vehicle. Sometimes they explode on impact. Exploding Kerbals will register on my seismometers I have placed to collect science in different biomes.\u00A0 That\u0027s fun, too. I think external command seats are the way to go because it is spectacular to watch the crashes happen.

I will also think of finding a way to lay struts on the ground for the entire length in the runway. In theory, running over the struts will break them and cause an explosion that doesn\u0027t affect the accelerating vehicle. I want to try to use those as trip wires that are evenly spaced for audio effect that pronounce the acceleration of the vehicle from the fully rested full stop to the end of travel where the vehicle hits the ramp at top speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd my dumbest question.
