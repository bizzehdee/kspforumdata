So, as the creator of this thread, I will put in my story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I played KSP, I was a huge Minecraft fan. I did not really have many interests, and floated around music and programming and Minecraft and warships, paying a blind eye to what was going on in space. One day, as I was watching a Minecraft video made by ChickenKeeper, I spotted a video about KSP, and I watched it. I thought it was an rather amusing concept, but did not think of it to be much, so I moved on with my life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlash forward three months. Then, I have developed a fledging interest in space. I am introduced to KSP at a party by one of my friends. I play it, and think \u0022Not bad\u0022. So, I went on the internet, and found the torrent for 0.15. I get hooked, and play it day after day, night after night. My entire winter break was spent playing KSP, and I soon began to grasp the basics of orbiting and Kerbin-Moon transfers. I download the torrents of 0.16 and 0.17, before downloading the torrent for 0.18. My gameplay begins to show blossoming. Inter-plantery travel is realized, probes are sent to Eve, and Spacetstations are orbited while bases are put on the mun. So, I decide to buy it. After purchasing the game, most of my guilt for pirating it went away, and I began to devote myself to the game, and space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learned through trial and error, and soon had greatly increased my general knowledge of spaceflight to the point I began could easily hold in a conversation with my science teachers on the subject. Soon, I began to memorize terms such as apogee, and perigee, memorizing charts of a plasma engine, while holding long discussions with my science teachers on space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I find this game, I wanted to be a programmer. Now, I want to be a Aerospace Engineer, and am a member of the Plantery and Mars Societies, and volunteer for many pro-space orginizations in my state. I have just recently sent a application for a internship to NASA and SpaceX, hope I get accepted. KSP has gotten me hooked to space, and might as well have gotten me a career. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Squad. I still feel guilt about pirating the early stages, despite the fact they were outdated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is your story? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stealth2668","CreatedById":57377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T21:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty much have lower grades\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T21:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPretty much have lower grades\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8FKCsCb.png\u0022 alt=\u00228FKCsCb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BobTheYoungFish","CreatedById":58031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T21:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI discovered it from one of kurtjmac\u0027s videos.

Gene Kranz was my childhood hero, and thinking of Astronaut Mike Collins alone on the far side of the moon during Apollo 11 got me through a hard summer experience. It was a goal I was dead-set on from kindergarten all the way through eleventh grade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, the year before I graduated high school, I took physics. Not only was it the most dispassionate thing I\u0027d ever done in my academic career, it marked the worst grades that I\u0027d ever gotten in a science class. In an awful moment that spring, I realized that I\u0027d spent the past ten years of my life confusing the concept of space travel with the reality of space travel, and that I was not, in fact, ever going to go into astrophysics. I think I spent the next week a crumpled and depressed mess, and managed to pass physics with a low B. From there I spent two years confused and adrift before I settled on a combination of English and Information Tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, I ran across a mention of KSP on a NASA news site that I follow. I thought it cute at first, but having tried and failed at Orbiter, and being a mediocre Cessna pilot on MS Flight Simulator \u002703, I was hesitant to mess with another simulator game. A few weeks after that, the first video for it showed up on Kurt\u0027s channel (I was following Kurt for his astronomy commentary) and after watching him get into Munar orbit for the first time, and the fact that trying and failing with quick results was a fundamental part of KSP, I began to consider buying it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the news got to me that they were adding lander legs to the next update, and in an instant, that childhood dream of being part of the team that landed something on the moon flashed before my eyes again. I bought KSP full-price the same night and attacked the game in every spare minute I had, determined that not only would I manage it, but that I would manage it so quickly, that I would beat Kurt in getting there. I spent the better part of a few weeks forcing larger and more powerful rockets into Munar orbit and, eventually, I pulled off that first landing. I\u0027ve never had a video game move me to tears before that point; a few got close, but that moment of seeing an old, discarded dream realized in some way hit me deep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still invested in KSP, perhaps not as much as I was before, but I\u0027m still managing good things, and still getting to satisfy my inner kid with historic moments, risky business, and creative problem solving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I\u0027m still ahead of Kurt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flyin_ruski","CreatedById":60421,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T00:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have gotten a real understanding of orbital mechanics and newton\u0027s laws.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame here.
