I worked out how to add nodes but I cant work out the exact diameter. I am using the Rockomax 1600 tank and have narrowed it down to \u002B/- 1.2 but I have to reload KSP every edit to test and I know its going to be a number like pi or something so I thought Id come to the people who know to find out. So what is the diameter of the Rockomax tanks and also how do I make it so i can activate symmetry in the VAB? Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
