I.e. The contract may ask for a 100km orbit, MJ and KER will tell you what your orbit is, from there you can plan what adjustments you need to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T21:04:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a mod that\u0027ll tell you your position relative to the universal reference direction, it\u0027ll let you work out when you\u0027re under the Ascending Node of the orbit. The Longitude of the Ascending Node is given in the contract description, but in stock there\u0027s no indication what this is relative to. When your universal Longitude is similar to the LAN of the contract, launch and turn Northwards the appropriate amount for the target inclination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been writing a kOS launch script that will calculate this (and launch in the right direction at the right time) but I\u0027ve not tested it yet and this is probably more complicated than what you\u0027re after. It does show that the information you need is available to mods, though. I don\u0027t know what other mods expose this information but hopefully it\u0027s given you a target to search for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T21:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t target a contract orbit directly.\u00A0 I\u0027ve wished for this feature myself \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ... but alas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to try to launch directly into the correct inclination, here\u0027s one way (not sure how practical it is for you, given that you mentioned vision problems):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLaunch your ship but don\u0027t take off yet, so you\u0027re just sitting on the pad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSwitch to map view.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s centered on your \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eship\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, by default.\u00A0 Double-click on Kerbin so that the map view centers on the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eplanet\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdjust the map zoom so you can see the contract orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRotate the camera so that you\u0027re looking at the contract orbit perfectly \u0022edge-on\u0022, so that it looks like a thin straight line passing through Kerbin\u0027s center, instead of like an ellipse.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThen, without moving the camera, turn up timewarp.\u00A0 You\u0027ll see your ship start to move as Kerbin rotates.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKeep timewarping until your ship is directly under the target orbit (i.e. when the ship icon is right smack dab on the thin-straight-line which is the target orbit seen edge-on).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStop warping.\u00A0 Your ship is now directly under the orbit you want.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLaunch in the appropriate direction.\u00A0 You\u0027ll have an approximate inclination match with the orbit, you can fine-tune with maneuver nodes after getting to orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T22:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222363684\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129974\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452893388\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9.
