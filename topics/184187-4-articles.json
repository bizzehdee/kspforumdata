I am using procedural fairing for the first time and I loved using the procedural fairings instead of building manual fairings with the stock fairings. Now, I want to build a rocket with a small diameter engine for its upper stage, which feels like a good idea with the cryogenic engine mod\u0027s less dense fuels. Previously I would use the stock engine plates introduced by the Making History expansion. With my shiny new PF mod, now I want to use an interstage adapter for the same purpose. I have made a few experiments in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E but honestly I came over to the forums before actually launching anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found that I might be able to use an interstage adapter as an engine plate in one of two ways: (both descriptions are from the perspective of building a rocket from the top towards the bottom)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Place an inverted interstage adapter before the engine, stick the engine to the interstage\u0027s node, and build the rest of the rocket from the interstage\u0027s decoupling node. You need to enable fuel crossfeed on the interstege for this to work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Stick the engine to the bottom of your tank as usual, then place an interstage underneath it by connecting the interstage\u0027s decoupling node to the engine\u0027s bottom node. You need to lower the height parameter\u00A0and increase the extra height parameter of the interstage to make this work. You need to fiddle with the extra height parameter to make the fairings connect nicely with the tank above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first alternative feels wrong because I have to invert the interstage, enable crossfeed and most importantly you have to carry the interstage node around after decoupling it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second alternative feels a bit more natural, but I don\u0027t look forward to fiddling with the extra height paramater to get a nice seal on the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does everyone else do? Is this a common use case of an interstage adapter? Does anyone have any advice or tips to share?\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr am I completely off the mark and need to be using the procedural engine plate for this purpose? Or both even? I don\u0027t think that the procedural engine plate has a connection node like the stock one does.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks in advance for any responses!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-03T20:14:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2021 08:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by canisin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman.Spiff","CreatedById":209133,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-03T21:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223983760\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221622751066\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022144481\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022canisin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, canisin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does everyone else do?
