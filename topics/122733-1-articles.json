But maybe something that lets you Exactly specify the order that tanks are drained from. The game has its own fancy set of rules, and attaching a fuel line from one thing to the next in a \u003Cem\u003Ecomplicated\u003C/em\u003E fuel setup does not necessarily mean fuel will draw in that order. I\u0027m thinking of something that lets you click on one tank and then click on the next and so on to determine fuel draw order I guess, maybe even with its own new HUD interface, but like I said action group activation seems like a clear and simple way to accomplish expanded fuel-flow mgmt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I would like to see is an upgrade that carves out a part of the mountain range leading up to Runway 90; this would make returning spacecraft (primarily using Wheezley engines that need to stay low) to not have to go around them during approach.

Progression by unlocking new parts, Seeing your space program expanding and by exploring space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, 1. Is just a tool of how to experience 2. My goal is to actualy build a space program and overcome some of the same obstacles that real spaceprograms are, and will in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo of those obstacles are actualy not possible in stock as it is now. (Pre 1.0.5)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first obstacle is communication with probes. My solution until now has been remotetech2. We all now this will arrive in v1.1 so I am very happy about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second obstacle has to do with science. Venus has an atmosphere which we can\u0027t see through with our naked eye. It has clouds! Atmospheres is already included, but not clouds, and I think it is just reasonable to implement clouds to give another layer of exploration. Landing on EvE when you can\u0027t se the ground should feel like gambling and be very dangerous. Also, Kerbin just look naked without them. For me the game isn\u0027t complete without them. Many no-gamers that I have showed KSP to askes me where the clouds are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI applaud The devs for bringing communication to a new level in KSP.
