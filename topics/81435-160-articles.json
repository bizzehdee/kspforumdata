It has better armor, is lighter (compared to the SK-CRV-IIg2) and has an extra engine giving it great TWR, good maneuverability, and it also has full RCS, docking abilities, and 2 claws (which are moreso intended for appearance, but do actually work as claws too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i just made a shocking discovery after extensive testing (of something ive been suspicious of for a while now). Adding wings makes you WAY WAY WAY MORE VULNURABLE! I am serious, i had placed wings on one of my ships before, and it had so-so armor. Took those wings off, and the bloody ship refuses to die!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough we all know how pretty wings are, for anything competitive i strongly encourate removing them entirely (better resilience from my experiences (and less parts). And a tip for those that insist on using them, be ABSOLUTELY sure there is a cubic strut between the wings and whatever part they are attached to (assuming its an actual hull segment and not something disposeable), and NEVER strut wings to the hull or they seem to carry shockwaves through those struts into actual stuff you want to keep alive!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps im just using wings incorrectly, but for 4 of my ships, ive found removing the (decorative) wings resulted in an exponential increase in armor protection!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(i actually figured this out when i was making a budget version of my new wedge ship with no wings. Aside from still loosing internal bits like engines ect, its near IMMUNE to anything that isnt either excessively heavy (any missile above 3-4 tons makes armor irrelevant anyway), or has tires (which are guaranteed to destroy anything). Overall im annoyed that making stuff pretty kills survivability, but hey, might as well use what ive learned to make me ships better (this is also one reason dreks are so powerful, place wings on a drek\u0027s hull, and armor protections drops so much!).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T04:31:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 04:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"burnoutforzai","CreatedById":93344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T09:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo...

As for escape-pods, i generally dont use them since well, odds are if the ship is heavily damaged the cockpit gets either separated or destroyed, making such pods redundant when standard (non-command versions) are usually crewed by a single meat-bag. Ive always liked mostly droid ships, but i do add the option for that meat-bag pilot since the IVA targeting is great and lets me stop relying on the stupid autoaim (which is not very fun or immersive) when using unguided weapons at ranges in excess of 1km (with manual IVA view i can reliably hit something at 1-1.5km with a railgun). While navball targeting is possible, its very hard to line that up perfect (only mod that lets you do it reliably is navhud (but that kinda ruins immersion). Another reason i really like the MK1 cockpit, its perfect, centered view, and zoom that lets you shoot a rail right in a weakspot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the whole large bay that can be replaced based on mission was the whole idea from the start with the ship design, make it multi-role with modular builds (well not modular as in decoupler constructed ship but you can mix and match the entire front hull to the mission). There is currently a anti-fighter version (standard config, 7 forward facing railguns and room for 16 drones in the drone bay behind that), anti-capital ship version (has 1.25m weapons instead of drones, although there is still 4 drones in the rear actually and shifted some fuel tanks to allow fitting 4 1.25m hardpoints inside the drone bay along the usual forward facing 1.25m hardpoint), a command version (drone bay replaced with command seats and some shifted armor to give the meat-bags a view from inside), and a carrier version (extra fuel and fighter hangar where the drones usually are). While its still being redone its a ship that im defenetely happy with when it comes to part count, maneuverability, range, and armor. Its firepower could use a improvement (i kinda like 0.6m weapons these days since its less fun to 1 shot everything with updated Tripedo-Ms that will obliterate anything in front of them with good reliability). Really starting to use alot of experimental 0.6m weapons such as the TriBeams which are a very old warhead that i kinda gave up on back when, redesigned them and they work better, harder to use as the warhead is small and requires precision, but 2 tons of ibeam propelled by 1 tons of engines and fuel is gonna ruin your day if i aim it at something important. 0.6m weapons dont split ships into a million pieces as reliably (still happens here and there), but they sure can destroy an entire engine cluster nicely especially if you use the shrapnel versions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-08T17:34:46Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2015 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T17:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool, that gave me an idea, would a 1x1 plate atop 5 pocket I beams atop a 1x1 plate work well?
