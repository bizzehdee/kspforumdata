I think you would have to define a new resource, a reward resource if you will, for each planetary body that you wish to mine. For example, say you wish to mine Ike. You could make a new resource definition called \u0022Ike Diamonds\u0022. You could then tweak this resources settings, like distribution densities and recovery value, to make it challenging but rewarding. It would provide a means to keep score through the stock recovery system, allowing the player to judge the total effectiveness of the mission. Things like mission planning and the efficiency with which the plan is executed would influence the total reward. Which would result in the most profit? Direct transfer to Ike? Gravity assist from the Mun? Which parts and ship setups are the most cost efficient? All these things could be compared from one mission to the next with one simple score : the profit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure it\u0027s going to take a little work to get the settings balanced out.

Each contains a resources folder. This is where you add the new resource definitions. Then, you have to add the resource to the respective parts. Lets take the KA_Drill_125_01 from Karbonite for example. Here is the relevant code from the .cfg : \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODULE \u003Cbr\u003E\t{ \u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = ORSX_ModuleResourceExtraction \u003Cbr\u003E\t\tpowerConsumptionLand = 2.5 \u003Cbr\u003E\t\textractionRateLandPerTon = 10 \u003Cbr\u003E\t\tresourceName = Karbonite \u003Cbr\u003E\t\tunitName = Karbonite Extractor \u003Cbr\u003E\t\textractActionName = Extract Karbonite \u003Cbr\u003E\t\tstopActionName = Stop Karbonite Extraction \u003Cbr\u003E\t\tresourceToUse = ElectricCharge \u003Cbr\u003E} \u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after adding IkeDiamopnds to the resource definitions, all you have to do is add a new module to the drill .cfg. You could simply copy this module and paste the copy beneath it. Replace every mention of Karbonite with IkeDiamonds and your drill will extract IkeDiamonds. You would also need to configure some storage tanks, and your good to go. You wouldn\u0027t necessarily need to mess with converters unless you wanted to add complexity. Anyway, I ramble.

If you mess up on a config edit on one of your parts(ie: forget a bracket), then ksp will not load any of the parts. When you get in the game it will throw out \u0022could not load ship\u0022 errors because none of your parts were loaded and your save is screwed. Test all changes on a new save. Backup your current gamesave before trying anything new. I don\u0027t remember KSP having this kind of behavior in earlier versions. It wouldn\u0027t load a part with .cfg errors, but it would still load other parts. Luckily, I didn\u0027t lose anything important because I backup often with alt-f5. But I did screw up several times on the .cfg syntax and was surprised to find an empty VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
