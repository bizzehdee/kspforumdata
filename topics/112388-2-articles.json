You find a spot on Mun, based on the colonists\u0027 requirements. It needs ground water and a view of Kerbin. It can\u0027t be more than 2 degree slope, or has to be higher than 75% of the ground within 2km of it. You build a seed base for them, carry it all up there, and get it all set. Then you bring X colonists to live on that base. Then, it becomes a separate entity in the game that slowly grows. Perhaps it asks you to bring up new modules. Perhaps it builds its own procedurally. Eventually, it starts producing ore. Or water. Or some other resource, and offers it for sale. Then they ask you to build them a space station, and now for a bit more money you can buy stuff from that instead.
