All would be difficult to impossible to implement which is why I never actually suggest them.\n\n**Colonies**. You find a spot on Mun, based on the colonists\u0027 requirements. It needs ground water and a view of Kerbin. It can\u0027t be more than 2 degree slope, or has to be higher than 75% of the ground within 2km of it. You build a seed base for them, carry it all up there, and get it all set. Then you bring X colonists to live on that base. Then, it becomes a separate entity in the game that slowly grows. Perhaps it asks you to bring up new modules. Perhaps it builds its own procedurally. Eventually, it starts producing ore. Or water. Or some other resource, and offers it for sale. Then they ask you to build them a space station, and now for a bit more money you can buy stuff from that instead. All the while, the base (that you can\u0027t otherwise interact with) grows.\n\n**Kerbaforming** After doing multiple readings on Duna, in and around the poles and the canyon, the scientists figure out a plan for Kerbaforming it. It will take centuries, but eventually we can live there. You perform several deliveries of whatever machines to the places and they start their work. 100 years later you can live in the bottom of the canyon, with only respirators. 100 years later, you can walk around. 1000 years after you start, Duna is \u0022Kerbin 2.\u0022\n\n**Offworld bases** Like your \u0022Move KSC around\u0022 mod. The aibility to set up full-service bases on other worlds. Possibly in tandem with the above 2 things.\n\nIn all these, you won\u0027t just take stuff to Duna and be done, or take stuff to Minmus and be done. The requirements will be environmental and vague enough to require hunting. And once you set up the things, they become easter-egg style structures but with a landing pad for your deliveries. Or orbital stations on rails but with a docking port that doesn\u0027t function like a docking port in the game, but makes you be \u0022landed\u0022 at the station.\n\nI would also like life support in the game that utilizes this kind of stuff. Grow crops on Duna a la \u0022The Martian.\u0022 But guess what? The canyon isn\u0027t very good for that. Find a nice flat midlands area and maybe we\u0027re talking.\n\nBut like I said, these are all useless to suggest or even think about. The game as-is won\u0027t support them.\n\nBut it will support Yellow Jool and its 4 moons that look just like the other moons in the game, so I suppose that\u0027s a thing too."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T01:02:15Z","Content":"I\u0027m with 5th: adding GP2 and a couple moons is not enough to satisfy, for more than a few game sessions.
