I build an automated craft with the missing parts, got it up, and got it docked. Both the new and old craft have at least one free docking port (beyond what\u0027s holding them together), both have antennae, and both have solar panels (the new one has lots, as it also has a refinery just in case I want one in Kerbin orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the mission checkboxes are checked *except* \u0022have a docking port, and antenna, and can generate power\u0022.
