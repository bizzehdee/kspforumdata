I used a bypass app to download steam and then ksp, first thing i did was go straight to downloading a few mods that i remembered off the top of my head. A few of the mods work without a problem whilst some work partially and others not at all, Ive tried some suggested fixes but none of them have solved my problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is my game data folder with my mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Screenshot-2024-02-11-122532.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.17\u0022 height=\u0022736\u0022 width=\u00221147\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/NjM4KPG1/Screenshot-2024-02-11-122532.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy second issue is PD\u0027s launcher doesn\u0027t do anything when I press play, i was told to go into steam go under ksp\u0027s properties and change the launch location but that was useless I found it didnt match the route to my ksp from program files 86 and updated it to the correct way and still no luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
