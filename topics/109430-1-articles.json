I just deployed my first one, and it didn\u0027t work the way I expected. Not at all. Here are a couple of specific questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How much science will be generated over time? The wiki seems clear on the rate, but not the amount. At one point, it states \u0022the lab may be used to perform research, which will consume a small percentage of the processed data every day to produce 5 times its value in science\u0022. This suggests that an experiment worth 30 science points would eventually be worth 30\u002B5x30=180 science points if processed fully in a lab. Later, however, the wiki says \u0022An experimental result produces an amount of data based on its own relative value and the location of the lab at the time the data is generated\u0022. So, which is it? Does the lab produce 5 times the science value of the processed data, or does it produce an amount somehow dependent on the location of the lab?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If I have already extracted science from an observation, how do I get the lab to process an equivalent observation? For instance, suppose I take a surface sample and recover it for 30 science points. If the 5x factor is correct, that means there are still 150 points worth of science to be learned from that same surface sample or an equivalent one. But I can\u0027t figure out how to get the lab working on it. Experiments I\u0027ve already explored without the lab don\u0027t seem to give me the \u0022Process Data\u0022 option required to run them through the lab. Am I misunderstanding something fundamental here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T01:48:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, it\u0027s like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You put data from experiments into the lab, then hit the button to process the data. This loads \u0022data\u0022 into the lab, which is a separate thing from the \u0022data\u0022 shown on the right-click menu when an EVA kerbal is pilfering experiment parts, and also separeate from the science value of the experiment. Thus, you can now transmit or return the original experiment and collect that science up front. You get more \u0022data\u0022 into the lab for the same experiment if the lab is landed instead of in orbit, and the amount of \u0022data\u0022 loaded per experiment is proportional to the science value of the original experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once you get rid of the original experiment, the \u0022data\u0022 gained from processing it stays in the lab. Over time, the scientists in the lab will analyze this data, converting it into more science points that you can transmit or return later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I could be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T03:54:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the last week this has been asked and answered atleast in 20 threads. Im not trying to say you shouldn\u0027t ask but you could do a bit more research before you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience experiment taken from a body can only be used once in a single lab. But you can use the experiment again and again in different labs if you do not send it to kerbin to get the science. You will get more science out of the lab if you have scientists sitting inside the lab or inside a connected crew compartment to the lab. So you could have 10 scientists giving bonusses to the lab or you could have 10 seperate labs with 1 scientist in each of them and can use the same experiment in every one of them before you send it back to kerbin. The science experiment you get from a planet will give the most ammount of data when its used in a lab sitting on the ground of that same planet. The second best would be at the orbit of that planet. (This excludes Kerbin. Best data gain for Kerbin is at the orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an example; I collected all the experiments from KSC and that accounted to about 600 science with maybe 100 experiments. I got them up to orbit and put them in my lab processing their data. After all the data was used i gained about 2500 science and returned the science experiments to KSC and got the 600 science from them totaling 3100 science. If i had 2 labs up there i could have used each science experiment twice and gain 5000 science tho labs needs to be seperate from each other. Returning the experiments would still give me 600 totaling 5600.

I haven\u0027t seen it clearly stated so I was wondering if I\u0027d have to take a sample, drop it off, then go and get a sample again. n0xiety\u0027s post sounds like you keep the experiment so can then return it to kerbin, which sounds much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, can you take a Kerbal and pull all the data from a capsule and pass that across for processing? I.e.
