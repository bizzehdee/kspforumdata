Go into your KSP directory (if you got the game from steam its under steam, steam aps, common). Then the folder Saves, then Craft (I believe) and then either \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and just manually delete the files you dont want anymore.
