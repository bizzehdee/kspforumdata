My name is Flobbert, my microphone\u0027s name is Sam, and today... well, today, I\u0027m bringing my KSP adventures to the Forum* for good*.\u0022*\n\nBagel Rabbit\n\n*The Future of KSP Insanity*\n\n~~~\n\n**So, What Do I Do?**\n\n- I make Kerbal Space Program videos that are generally short and sweet (almost all of my videos are less than four minutes in length).\n- These videos consistently feature unscripted, live dialogue and a heck of a lot of fun! I enjoy making these things far too much.\n- *I try to make a video twice or three times per week, so be sure to check back regularly!* You won\u0027t regret it.\n- I play only stock KSP, and I\u0027ll often provide .craft files for my creations, so you can test them yourself!\n\n**I generally:**\n\n- **Build Awesome Crafts!** VTOLs, Dropships, Jetpacks, Automobiles, Boats, SSTOs, Animal-Shaped Craft, and even some rockets! (I\u0027m a big fan of unconventional designs.)\n- **Break KSP!** Have you ever wanted to meet the Kraken? Launch a Stability Enhancer? Create five-sided symmetry in stock KSP? Well, I\u0027ve done that and more, and you can too!\n- **Make Music!** I\u0027m working on \u0022theme songs\u0022 for planets in KSP, and some of my songs have even been featured by SQUAD! (More on this later...)\n- **Launch Model Rockets!** I\u0027ve taken a model of Jeb up to over 1,500 feet and brought him back safely. With an onboard GoPro. Several times. The footage is cool.\n- **Work on the occasional cinematic!** I don\u0027t do these often, but every once in a while, why not? I look forward to (possibly) collaborating on a video with Avera9eJoe over the summer.\n- *[COMING SOON!]* **Make KSP Tutorials!** Because KSP is awesome, and you can too! Everything from basic rocket science to advanced aircraft construction will be covered.\n\nI also do non-KSP stuff, but that won\u0027t be appearing on this page.\n\n~~~\n\nOver the years, my YouTube channel has become rather popular. I\u0027ve been featured in the Daily Kerbal four times, and I now have over 2,000 subscribers. I\u0027ve had videos liked by Danny2462 and Heretic391, among other famous YouTubers.\n\n**However: My videos will remain ad-free forever.** I don\u0027t want to profit from YouTube: I already have a job. I just want to make people happy.\n\n~~~\n\n**Okay, enough talking. Here\u0027s the five most recent KSP videos on Bagel Rabbit, from newest to oldest.**\n\n**(I should provide a channel link, if you want to see more. There\u0027s lots of good stuff on there...**\n\n[**Here you go.**](https://www.youtube.com/user/BagelRabbit)\n\n**...anyways, here are my most recent videos.)**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_pn352Cgp4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***Drops of Jool: Original KSP Music*** **(2:18)**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/uOw17ff3CLY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***KSP: My \u0022Junkyard\u0022 Designs!*** **(5:27)**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRCeGJ_wcCs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***KSP: Cute Wittle Dinosaur!*** **(2:13)**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WII1N6ddrxs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***KSP: Cute VTOL-Plane!*** **(2:38)**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cBp9kjU3BM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***KSP: Fairing Floating Bug!*** **(2:15)**\n\n**I\u0027ll update this each time a new video comes out, as well as adding a new post.**\n\n~~~\n\n*If you enjoyed these videos, don\u0027t forget to leave a like, or maybe even subscribe!

My main computer is dead, and I\u0027ve been out of the video-making business for over a month now. I am still alive though, and when a computer is delivered to me, new KSP content will blossom like flowers!\n\nIn the meantime though, here\u0027s my five most recent videos, from newest to oldest:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_pn352Cgp4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***Drops of Jool: Original KSP Music*** **(2:18)**\n\n(I will just note here that this is the first piece of music that I\u0027ve posted on my channel in a good long while. I make my own KSP music, as some of you may know ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/uOw17ff3CLY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***KSP: My \u0022Junkyard\u0022 Designs!*** **(5:27)**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRCeGJ_wcCs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***KSP: Cute Wittle Dinosaur!*** **(2:13)**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WII1N6ddrxs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***KSP: Cute VTOL-Plane!*** **(2:38)**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cBp9kjU3BM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n***KSP: Fairing Floating Bug!*** **(2:15)**\n\nSo anyways, expect new videos in a couple of weeks. And as always, if you liked the videos, don\u0027t forget to leave a like or maybe even subscribe! That would be tremendously appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Upsilon"}]}
