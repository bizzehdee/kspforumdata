You will need to hit key G for landing gear to deploy all three. I\u0027m not aware of there being a defect in the STS-3 gear design, but just in case your copy has it bugged, you might need to zoom into the cockpit, and enable the nose landing gear for the Landing Gear action group. STS-4 is right around the corner and it is perfect. I mean it. Over three weeks of testing it and putting it through its paces while shooting 100s of video takes (for a 9 min movie), it will probably stay STS-4 until 1.0 comes out. I hope to release it this week along with the subs, and my all-new amazing awesome epic STS Space Shuttle showcase movie. Stay tuned.
