Since you\u0027re going to be operating where the atmosphere is thickest you have that to overcome. Then, since this is supposed to be stock parts you\u0027re going to have to pile on the SRBs, which means you\u0027re going to need more SRBs to compensate for the weight and more to make it go faster and so on and so forth. You can only build out so far, so eventually you\u0027re going to have to build \u0022up\u0022 and that means having to compensate for the weight drop as you discard SRBs. Then flying it, because once you get going that fast at such a low altitude...
