Often getting 1 Kerbal second of flight for every 10-20 seconds sitting in front of the screen for all but the relatively simple stuff. \n\nNow I\u0027m fortunate to have a new desktop with a fine cpu, lots of ram, SSD, a GTX 980 connected to a 27\u0022 - 1ms - 144Hz monitor. I expected great things! I saved long enough for them lol. \n\nHere\u0027s the thing. Since I loaded Kerbal Space Program - 1.0.2.842 (WindowsPlayer) I cannot get KPS out of 3D! After I turned off 3D in the graphics card (active), passive appeared to have kicked in (red \u0026 green). Searched everywhere I could think of in the card\u0027s Control Panel, nothing more than I already switched. I hunted in the game as well and nothing \u00223D\u0022 was mentioned.\n\nSo that it. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know. Thanks!\n\np.s. If this is in the wrong place to post this, let me know and it\u0027ll be moved.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI was able to fix this issue. Thanks for any time put into it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T23:31:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Glasher**"},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T23:43:11Z","Content":"Maybe you might add how you fixed it, if someone has a similar problem?"}]}
