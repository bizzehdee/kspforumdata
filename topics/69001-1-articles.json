I have B9 aerospace to bulk up the mart count, Enviromental Enhancements for some visuals bonuses, KAS so I can try new and interesting things with my Kerbals in space and on planets. I also use fuel balancer to keep me from having to constantly rebalance fuel in my planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not entirely sure what I\u0027m looking for either unfortunately. I guess visual boosts are always cool but I would be more interested in things that add to the gameplay. I recently tried interstellar and hated it, it seemed to break the balance and also made little sense without spending a long time reading up on what parts do what. I\u0027m also open to ideas that impose certain levels of restrictions such as life support but I can\u0027t seem to find any with a habitat module for creating Munar Bases etc. I\u0027ve considered remote tech but I feel it might make the game too hard for me as my knowledge of orbital mechanics and satellite positioning is reasonably slim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if anyone can suggest some interesting add ons to pile on before I start my next space program would be really appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T16:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have just installed the raster prop monitors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603-0-23-RasterPropMonitor-make-your-IVA-a-glass-cockpit-%28v0-12%29-25-Dec\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603-0-23-RasterPropMonitor-make-your-IVA-a-glass-cockpit-%28v0-12%29-25-Dec\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, this added a whole lot of new challenges to the game.
