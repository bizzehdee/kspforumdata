I\u0027m feeling like trying out Kerbalism but don\u0027t want to use it on my main career save. Do I just have to go into the settings in that save and turn everything off or add/remove some code to the save file. Or maybe it\u0027s not possible, in which case I\u0027ll wait a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help/suggestions would be much appreciated. And I look forward to joining these forums properly\u00A0:)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nguitarman15\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-28T21:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not know if you can.
