Many games I\u0027ve enjoyed I\u0027ve stopped playing because they\u0027ve become poor substitute outlets for people\u0027s passive aggression in life outside the game, where all their angst over things they cannot control gets vetted in an anonymous atmosphere under fabricated positions of power and knowledge. It makes the games more exhausting to play than just dealing with regular life, and games are about exploring and diverting away from the regular. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo thanks, community here, for being wonderfully accepting and creative, open and encouraging, helpful and engaging.
