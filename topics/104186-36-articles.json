This one reminds me of a student of hers from fall semester last year.\n\nFor a little background, my wife has a policy where she withdraws students from her classes if they haven\u0027t shown up for class by the withdrawal deadline. She does this to help them out, because a withdrawal doesn\u0027t count against their record like an F does. There are a few no-shows every semester.\n\nWell, last year a guy she didn\u0027t recognize showed up for the final exam of a lower-level college algebra class. She looked up his name on the class roster and he wasn\u0027t there, so no, you\u0027re not in this class. He insisted, so she went online and checked her records and sure enough, he was one of the no-shows she withdrew.\n\nTurns out he thought he knew it all already and could just show up for the final, ace it, and be done. His excuse was that he learned it all in high school, so he didn\u0027t need to go to class. No attendance, homework, tests, nothing. The final counted (IIRC) a third of the final grade, so even if he got 100% on it, it wasn\u0027t possible to pass the class. The department has a minimum attendance policy, and that alone meant he would\u0027ve got an automatic F anyway. He was furious he was withdrawn and ended up going to the department head, who backed up my wife and told him she did him a favor by withdrawing him.\n\n(BTW, this was a low-level remedial algebra class that could\u0027ve been skipped had his HS math grades been high enough, or if he tested out of it when he enrolled in the college. So no, he didn\u0027t learn it all in HS or he wouldn\u0027t even be there.)"}]}
