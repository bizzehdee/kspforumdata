This one was done from 2200m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is not the atmosphere anymore. A rocket with adequate thrust (i.e \u0026gt;1.6 TWR on Eve) can do it in about 6-7km/s rather than the 11km/s needed previously. The issue is that thrust now scales with Isp, which is insanely low at 5atm of pressure. Hence that TWR I talked about cannot be achieved at sea level with \u003Cstrong\u003Eany\u003C/strong\u003E stock engine. The result is the rocket needs insanely more dV, not because of drag, but because of gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ee4xYHKQch4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T01:25:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by quietghost\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
