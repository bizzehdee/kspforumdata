First thing that caught my eye: MET for Mares is the same as absolute time: 200d 06h 06m 00s. Does this mean something?\n\u003E Edit: If I\u0027m not mistaken, a Kerbin day is 6 hours, so it must be real life days, right?\n\nSo 200d 06h 06m 00 divided by 6 is exactly 34 Earth days, which would be, counted from today, May the 22nd. That is at most 1(.5) clue.\n\nThe Envision shuttle landed at Eve 53 min after separation from Mares. According to myth, Eve is the original mother to everyone. A mare is a female horse and the latin word for sea, but you can\u0027t feed a female horse that is expecting to become a mother stuff from the sea including seaweed because of iodine concentrations. Iodine is element number 53, which corresponds to the exact number of minutes Envision separated from Mares. The craft would have to communicate by radio after separation and radioiodine has a half-life of 8 days (also, 53=5\u002B3 is 8). \n\nEve is part of genesis and KSP 1.0 genesis begins with Envision\u0027s touchdown at Eve, 34 days from now (Friday 22nd of May). Envision separates from Mares 8 days earlier (Thursday 14th of May) as KSP 1.0 separates from Squad headquarters and is distributed to news/youtube channels.\n\nWow this was easy, I\u0027m sure it adds up to 8.5 clues.
