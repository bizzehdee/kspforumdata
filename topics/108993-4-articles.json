That will get rid of the ugly clipping we have right now. The stats definitely need tweaking, I agree with you there.\n\nI want to make separate docking and non docking versons of the chute, so that you aren\u0027t getting docking technology earlier in the tree than you are meant to. I can add an extra .cfg to make a copy of the Non docking version be probe controlled, but it will get added to the extras DL. I want to make sure to keep the main mod fairly small, this helps avoids part bloat and still gives everyone what they want. For example, while it\u0027s a cool idea, how often will people use this pod without crew? Even in a campaign that is RP focused it won\u0027t be too many flights. So that\u0027s just one of the things I have to weigh in when I decide what goes into the primary DL."},{"CreatedByName":"autumnalequinox","CreatedById":114782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T02:30:22Z","Content":"[![screenshot0.png](http://s17.postimg.org/szacpyapb/screenshot0.png)](http://postimage.org/)\n\n[Corvus-Kemini eXtended With Extra Life Support, Science Bay, aerodynamic nosecone.
