I saw perhaps a 2-minute clip of the footage on CNN, I believe. One of my sources, anyway. It had music and stuff though, but this version is awesome! I always wondered what it would sound like in space (and I mean actually hearing it, I know that sound can\u0027t travel without a medium and stuff)."},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

Would it be like feeling like you are flying really high or actually you feel like you are just outside the planet?\n\nCool footage nonetheless."},{"CreatedByName":"ghostbuzzer7","CreatedById":138096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T16:56:20Z","Content":"Well technically, the ISS is within a very thin layer of atmosphere, hence them using over 100 tons of fuel annually because they need to stay in orbit. But why you may say, eventually enough atoms of atmosphere will gradually slow the ISS down. That being said, the sound you may be hearing is either from the GoPro due to its case. The astronaut probably added the protective case while inside the ISS and oxygen is trapped inside there. Another possible explanation, is that the thin layer of atmosphere has a very rare tendency to transfer sound waves, hence us hearing it. Anyways amazing video, the beauty of Earth cannot match my Kerbal Space Station even with the Environmental Enhancements Mod. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T18:26:00Z","Content":"There is no sound propagation at ISS orbital height. Absolute silence.\n\nThe thumping sound is made by jerking the microphone and the buzz is the ventilation vibration of the suit on which the camera is mounted.\n\nAir/oxygen was never needed for sound generation."},{"CreatedByName":"Hydrazine_Soup","CreatedById":91100,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T21:56:42Z","Content":"![OmjSlwT.gif](http://i.imgur.com/OmjSlwT.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-05T02:41:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2020 02:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Hydrazine\\_Soup**"}]}
