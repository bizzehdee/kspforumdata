I saw perhaps a 2-minute clip of the footage on CNN, I believe. One of my sources, anyway. It had music and stuff though, but this version is awesome! I always wondered what it would sound like in space (and I mean actually hearing it, I know that sound can\u0027t travel without a medium and stuff).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

But why you may say, eventually enough atoms of atmosphere will gradually slow the ISS down. That being said, the sound you may be hearing is either from the GoPro due to its case. The astronaut probably added the protective case while inside the ISS and oxygen is trapped inside there. Another possible explanation, is that the thin layer of atmosphere has a very rare tendency to transfer sound waves, hence us hearing it.
