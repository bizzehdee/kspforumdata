It is a consequence of kinetic energy being proportional to the square of speed in Newtonian physics. You cannot have Newtonian physics without also having the Oberth effect. So the Oberth effect must be in KSP, since its physics model is Newtonian.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the rocket equation it can be seen that the only factors that affect dV are starting mass, ending mass, and Isp. If none of those factors change, then dV cannot change. So it should be obvious that speed has no effect on the amount of delta-V for a given craft, i.e. the Oberth effect cannot add or subtract any delta-V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, delta-V is a measurement of potential acceleration. If a craft increases its speed by 10m/s at a given point in its orbit, it necessarily has spent exactly 10m/s of dV to gain that speed. It doesn\u0027t matter at what altitude or speed this occurs, a 10m/s dV burn will always add 10m/s of speed. So the Oberth effect cannot increase the amount of speed gained by spending a given amount of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if the Oberth effect doesn\u0027t increase the amount of dV or get more acceleration from dV what is its advantage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnergy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital energy of a craft is the sum of its potential energy (from altitude) and its kinetic energy (speed). If no dV is spent, this sum is constant at all points in the orbit. Kinetic energy is converted into potential energy and back again as the craft moves through its orbit. To change orbits, energy must be added (or subtracted) to the orbital energy. This is done by spending delta-V. But remember, delta-V is not a measure of energy, but of potential acceleration. It is this distinction that makes the Oberth effect possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 m/s of dV always results in 1 m/s change in velocity, but not all m/s are equal in terms of energy. Because kinetic energy is proportional to the square of speed, the faster you are going the more energy is added by each m/s of speed gained. The speed gained is the same but the energy gained is greater. So, if we look at the kinetic energy change for a 1-ton craft spending 1m/s of dV to accelerate by 1 m/s at different initial speeds using the formula Ek = 1/2mv\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E we get the following (I have assumed no mass change from the burn to keep the math simple):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0m/s -\u0026gt; 1 m/s = 0.5KJ energy added\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10m/s -\u0026gt; 11m/s = 10.5KJ energy added\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100m/s -\u0026gt; 101m/s = 100.5KJ energy added\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach of these burns consumes exactly the same amount of dV, but the amount of kinetic energy added to the orbital energy is vastly different.
