For example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gUbqp59.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gUbqp59.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn that Rocker Bogie rover, I have to create \u0022chain\u0022 (those smaller IR exendraton parts attached between fromt leg and structural fuselage).

Would be possible to create \u0022dead\u0022 zone for suspension, meaning, spring and damper forces from suspension strut would not be applied at all until certain force does not exceed \u0022dead zone force\u0022 or length of extended/retracted strut does not exceed length limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t know would be better to have force or length for \u0022dead zone\u0022. Can that help with kraken oscilation due to game engine physics ? Meaning, unless certain force is not exceed, suspension strut would not try to compensate and hopefuly it would not add more to unwanted \u0022phantom\u0022 oscilation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-13T21:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223119337\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155056\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221499908969\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022148313\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FungusForge\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/12/2017 at 6:22 PM, FungusForge said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wouldn\u0027t be too much of a stretch to request it then? There\u0027s a lot of ways I could use a wheel like this that I\u0027ve not done simply because it looks atrocious with the current selection of wheels (and I really don\u0027t like the stock wheels, or wheels that work like them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA really good example is the surface track.\u00A0 That\u0027s basically a track, but with the mount on top.\u00A0 So, Yes... I think it would be reasonable to request a wheel where the suspension system is packed inside the wheel space.\u00A0 However, it would probably help any world-be-modeler if they had an example that you could provide for what you\u0027re looking for.... something either in another game or the real world that would fit what you\u0027re thinking about, before a solid assessment can be made as to what can and cannot be accomplished.\u00A0 I will say this though: I don\u0027t think new parts are really a priority at this time.\u00A0 I could be wrong, but this is what I\u0027ve gathered from the activity lately.\u00A0 lo-fi had a special talent for making wheels, which work well within his original code, at record speeds.\u00A0 This is not a common trait... and his absence is a blow to this project.\u00A0 That being said, I\u0027ve been wrong before so... yeah...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe do-ability of a wheel that has mounting nodes on both sides is something we could actually accomplish now, but it wouldn\u0027t have quite the appearance you\u0027re aiming for without the source unity projects for lo-fi\u0027s models.\u00A0 The nodes themselves I could accomplish with some config tweaks if appearance wasn\u0027t an issue.\u00A0 The difficulty here is in the modelling of the part itself.\u00A0 Other problems that could crop up are related to part hierarchy and whether or not attaching more of the ship on the other side of the wheel is going to be stable.\u00A0 With the mod called \u0022Recoupler\u0022 it might be alright, since it can attaching parts that would not normally attach in the editor if they have attachment nodes in the same location upon loading into the flight scene, but without it there might be some unforeseen issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind, I\u0027m just theorizing and hypothesizing.here from a purely logical standpoint.\u00A0 I\u0027m really jsut a coder, and not an amazing one at that.\u00A0 Yes, i did create all the original part\u0027s stack nodes back in the day, but I got lucky with those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the note of suspension-only parts, I\u0027ve been asking for those since I first started working with lo-fi a really long time ago.\u00A0 It has it\u0027s own set of issues though, since you\u0027re not just working with colliders, but rather IR-style movement of everything attached via that suspension node in the hierarchy.\u00A0 I didn\u0027t understand that way back in the day, of course, but I know now why lo-fi shot me down when I would talk about it.\u00A0 It\u0027s more in the realm of an IR plugin than a KF plugin.\u00A0 I always did think that IR and KF (or KSPWheel nowadays) would be capable of doing great things if coded for interaction between their modules and sharing of data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally... I\u0027ve done some poking around in the current KSPWheel code, the old KF_plugin code, and some of my own code in an attempt to get lo-fi\u0027s deceptively simple auto-configuration code to work with it.\u00A0 I\u0027m really close to a possible way to allow a user to select if they want the steering constraints to be auto-generated, but I\u0027ve run into the block with how KSPWheel is currently coded.\u00A0 Specifically, it\u0027s not coded to be easily extended by an outside plugin.\u00A0 I really need some way to hook into it, or I\u0027d need to simply integrate the old code directly into the current project.\u00A0 I\u0027m cool with that, since it\u0027s not really my code anyway, I\u0027m just making it function again... but it\u0027s requiring me to make some changes to the steering module in just about every method contained in that class.\u00A0 I ain\u0027t done working on this baby though... so who knows what I\u0027ll finally come up with.\u00A0 I still have a few tricks up my sleeve for overriding values in the main modules without having to alter the original code... long as the information I need to alter are exposed to the configs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way... progress is starting to be made.\u00A0 The goal is for the end user to be able to click a button on a single wheel\u0027s context menu and have it auto-calculate steering limits based on its position on the craft, within the wheel\u0027s group number or on all of the wheels on the craft.\u00A0 I\u0027m also trying to find a way for the original values to be saved and for it to be a toggle where, while on, manual changes will be disabled and, when turned off, the original settings will be restored.\u00A0 I\u0027ll keep y\u0027all posted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-14T16:00:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2017 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emy typing stinks... badly.... so badly...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-15T20:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdated release is available:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/KerbalFoundries2/releases/tag/2.0.2.7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/shadowmage45/KerbalFoundries2/releases/tag/2.0.2.7\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChange Log:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUpdate KSPWheel to latest, includes a few bug-fixes and feature enhancements.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUpdated included ModuleManager to latest (2.8.1)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNEW PART - Large Deployable Landing Leg - Has optional angled deployment using stock animation module, with adjustable deploy-angle limit.

certainly doable, though with C# there are a few other options available that allow for even cleaner integration of derived code (delegates vs. sublcasses).\u00A0 Generally I\u0027ve found type based polymorphism (base classes-\u0026gt;subclasses) to be... very limiting.... and have been moving to using C# delegates instead.\u00A0 Delegates allow for defining of a method at the place where the method is called (or really anywhere), rather than in a concrete class that must be setup before hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyhow, yes, I am quite familiar with virtual methods (and abstract methods by extension), and they are already in use in KSPWheel to allow for the kind of functionality you are looking for:\u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/KSPWheel/blob/master/VSProject/KSPWheel/PartModules/KSPWheelSubmodule.cs#L69-L77\u0022 rel=\u0022external

method, that is defined and implemented by whatever the subclass needs.\u00A0 If you look in the steering/motor/etc \u0027submodules\u0027, they all override these methods to do their lifecycle code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I believe I already have the functionality in place that you are looking for with the current multi-module setup.\u00A0 You could make a KSPWheelAutoConfigure module, extending from the KSPWheelSubmodule class.\u00A0 From there you would get automatic hooks/callbacks from the base module at specific lifetime events (part initialized, wheel created, physics started, pre- and post- physics and rendering frame updates).\u00A0 The real trick would be hooking into the existing steering/motor modules (of course, custom steering/motor modules could be created with the built-in auto-configure functionality, possibly even using the existing steering/motor modules as base classes and only overriding the setup functionality).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-17T04:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI

simply modifying public variables in other stand alone modules.\u00A0 I\u0027ll have to mess around with that.\u00A0 One thing that may be a bit problematic is that you have a low and high limit setting for steering while, in the old code, we simply had a single variable for max steering angle.\u00A0 It turns out lo-fi\u0027s code is deceptively simply.\u00A0 It really just counts out all the wheels of a compatible type are on the craft and gives them a position in an array of sorts, then uses a curve to set their optimal angle.\u00A0 That\u0027s simplifying it, but that\u0027s it in a nutshell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the current plan is to simply make it a toggle option in the wheel\u0027s configuration.\u00A0 If any single wheel has the option set, it will take the other wheels into consideration when setting up the angles for that one wheel, but will only update and disable the manual configuration for wheels that also have that setting applied.\u00A0 Thus you could have steering that only uses the front wheels, but they\u0027ll take the rear wheel positions into account when setting the angles.\u00A0 That\u0027s the idea anyway.\u00A0 It would be a lot more efficient, of course, if the detection and settings could be run from a vessel module instead, keeping it form being repeated for every wheel with that setting applied, but I\u0027m unsure as of yet how that might be achieved while still allowing for per-part toggling of the option.\u00A0 I\u0027m still playing with it though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for delegates...

they do.\u00A0 I did take a look at hooking into the submodules class, but I can\u0027t just add my module in there and do things, I need to override things that are happening in other modules.\u00A0 This is all getting really complicated and I wonder if I should just make some modifications to the original steering class in your project and submit them to you directly for
