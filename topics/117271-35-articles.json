So far, the only things I\u0027ve had to do are: \n\n1. Install some beautification mods, which are completely unnecessary. \n\n2. Download and inspect craft files, and reply to posters informing them that their submissions had been received. \n\n3. Occasionally, I had to clarify the rules or make a minor rules adjustment. \n\n4. Reply to a few people explaining to them what rules they broke and informing them on how to fix it. \n\nThe most strenuous thing I\u0027ve had to do thus far is work out how to fix my recording software. It\u0027s not picking up audio. \n\n**Also, reader, please, criticize me to your heart\u0027s content. Your criticisms are what allow me to improve as a KSP player, tournament host, and as an individual. Without criticisms, I would not be able to improve as a person. I care less than the mods do about how offensively you phrase your opinion. Furthermore, criticizing the tournament rules are what allows them to be refined and clarified.** \n\nHopefully, some day very soon, the rules can be written to a point where they no longer need to be criticized. Then we can simply copy-paste them about, each host making minor adjustments to make each individual\u0027s tournament unique and presenting new and exciting design challenges to overcome. I\u0027d encourage everyone reading this to give tournament hosting a try, it\u0027s much easier than it looks.

Sorry that this is the first round, but really!?!?\n\nI believe your plane lost due to the its use of repeated Elevon 4s to build its control surface. In previous versions of KSP, attaching multiple small control surfaces was superior to using a single large one. But since the aerodynamics update, each control surface adds a MASSIVE amount of drag to the craft. So because you used multiple Elevon 4s to build your elevator, your plane was extremely draggy. That drag made it slow, but more importantly, made it difficult to maneuver. Its lack of maneuverability prevented it from getting its weapons on target and resulted in its death. The use of quadruple wings in the Proto 4 aggravated the issue. You can see in the footage how the Proto 3 takes off much sooner and turns faster; that\u0027s because it doesn\u0027t have as much drag, because it doesn\u0027t have as many Elevons, because the Proto 4 had two more wings of them attached to it. \n\nBut it could have been a number of things, that\u0027s just my opinion."},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T01:14:11Z","Content":"I\u0027m really sorry, if we ever meet Alphasus, I will totally let you punch me in the face."},{"CreatedByName":"CreativeCombat","CreatedById":112338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T01:19:11Z","Content":"Reserved."},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T01:35:32Z","Content":"I did about an hour of independent testing on that exact subject.
