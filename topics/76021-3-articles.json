Why would you risk an expensive \u0022smart booster\u0022 by trying out an unproven technology with it when you could just strap the same experimental technology (once again, talking about something like an aerospike engine or a thermal rocket) in parallel to the BDB\u0027s normal propulsion systems, as in with a strap-on booster, not as a replacement) to a much cheaper rocket, and not care as much if the whole thing goes up in flames (not only is the rocket cheaper to begin with, but there\u0027s a good chance it might have gone up in flames even without the experimental technology...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m working off here is that there are basically 3 main classes of failures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Failures that destroy the rocket and payload- these are much less of a big deal with a Big Dumb Booster carrying a cheap payload like fuel (the BDB is cheap, the payload is cheap, and there\u0027s a chance as high as 1 in 3 with Aquarius it would have failed/exploded WITHOUT the new technology). Of course, just because a strap-on booster with risky experimental technology explodes doesn\u0027t mean the main rocket will fail- but it\u0027s likely to as it will probably cause some serious damage in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Failures that simply fail inertly- they don\u0027t do ANYTHING. Such as an engine the simply fails to ignite, or cuts out in flight without causing catastrophic failure. The dead weight of a dead strap-on booster (which could then be decoupled anyways if this didn\u0027t cause loss of control) would be much less significant with a hugely powerful BDB than with a smaller and more efficient rocket- especially since BDB\u0027s don\u0027t normally operate with strap-on boosters to begin with (most BDB designs are two-stage-to-orbit), so it wasn\u0027t exactly relying heavily on strap-on boosters to begin with (it might just have to settle into a lower orbit, assuming the payload was increased due to the addition of the strap-on booster with experimental technology). And, if it causes mission failure in the end, once again that\u0027s less of a big deal than with a \u0022smart\u0022 booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Failures that have some other unintended, but deleterious effect, falling somewhere in-between an inert failure and total mission loss. The possibilities are many, but as always, it\u0027s less of a big deal with a Big Dumb Booster in almost all cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith (1) and (2), which seem to be the most common in rocketry, it\u0027s going to be much less of a big deal with a Big Dumb Booster. It\u0027s like choosing to transport nitroglycerin on a cart drawn by a cheap workhorse vs an expensive racehorse (which you probably wouldn\u0027t use to draw a cart anyways) back in the 1800\u0027s- the big dumb animal is a much better choice when risk of total annihilation is involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe experimental tech may be expensive (because it represents investment in new prototypes), but it\u0027s also typically dangerous. This usually leads to a LONG approval process before an experimental new space technology can be launched atop or alongside a typical modern \u0022smart\u0022 booster- driving up costs and stifling innovation.

Rockets that can carry things to space are big, EXPENSIVE machines due to their \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E precise engineering margins- despite there being no inherently high cost in the actual technology they involve (rocket engines, for instance, are actually CHEAPER, lighter, and more powerful than jet engines built to the same level of precision of a comparable size).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves 2 solutions to get large total payloads to Low Earth Orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Build an EVEN BIGGER rocket, with lower precision in construction but much greater safety margins, to get the same payload to orbit much less efficiently. I.e. like the Sea Dragon- which would have been SEVERAL times the size of the Saturn V, but the payload to Low Earth Orbit was relatively much smaller due to the much larger safety margins. Such rockets are actually more reliable than traditional \u0022Smart Boosters\u0022 due to the higher safety margins, and the potential to utilize large rocket engine clusters (think 21 nozzles of thrust- 3 of which could fail on any given launch) or just a single huge rocket engine with enormous safety margins. This is the \u0022classic\u0022 Big Dumb Booster approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Build a CHEAPER rocket- one in which the precision of engineering is low (allowing these rockets to fit the \u0022dumb\u0022 part of \u0022Big Dumb Booster\u0022 despite their small size), but the safety margins are similar to a \u0022Smart Booster\u0022. This will lead to FREQUENT launch-failures, but \u003Cstrong\u003Eunlike the Sea Dragon\u003C/strong\u003E, you only use this style of rocket to lift payloads with low inherent value- like fuel, food, and toothpaste for astronauts. This is the \u0022Bread Trucks were used to move Bread, not Brinks Trucks\u0022 approach to rocketry. You still need an alternative style of high-reliability rocket, such as Big Dumb Boosters styled after the Sea Dragon, to lift high-value payloads: such as live astronauts, valuable scientific instruments, and EMPTY interplanetary vessels or probes (you lift the fuel on Cheap-O-Fail rockets like the ones just described). The classic rocket in this category is the Aquarius- which would have amortized the launch failure rate approaching 1 in 3 over many launches through a small payload capacity of only 1-ton-to-orbit, and avoided risking damage to ground launch facilities or space infrastructure through sea-launches and a specialized depot to collect the supplies of multiple launches in orbit (before transferring them over to more expensive space stations like the ISS via orbital tug).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth styles of Big Dumb Booster had much lower cost-per-kg to orbit that \u0022traditional\u0022 Smart Boosters. Both would have had their own unique niches where they performed best (Aquarius for launch of consumables and fuel; Sea Dragon for launch of heavy, expensive payloads that you simply can\u0027t afford to lose- it would have been more reliable than a \u0022Smart Booster\u0022). Both would have had drawbacks- a high designed launch failure rate (and thus bad PR) for the Aquarius, a low mass-ratio for the Sea Dragon (a rocket several times the size of Saturn V, yet much cheaper and with only slightly larger payload capacity). Though, IMHO, the drawbacks of either would be well worth the benefits- as these rockets would be BY FAR the cheapest way to get mass to orbit, even today with the days of Space-X reusable rockets rapidly approaching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E For those interested, somebody actually made a working Sea Dragon mode for 0.23.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84810-Official-release-of-my-SeaDragon-mod\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84810-Official-release-of-my-SeaDragon-mod\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-03T19:20:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2014 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caroliano","CreatedById":38614,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T15:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to leave here an Elon Musk quote about this topic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0027Big Dumb Booster\u0027 usually refers to a pressure-fed stage. It usually means, minus the turbopump. I think that is actually not a good way to go. You want the turbopump, otherwise your rocket is just too heavy, because if you go with a pressure fed stage, your entire stage has to operate something like the chamber pressure, and you\u0027ll have a ton of pressure left there at the end of the flight. So it\u0027s just not a great way to go. Turbopumps are hard, but they\u0027re not that hard. They\u0027re just a spinning centripetal pump, that\u0027s tricky, but they\u0027re not that tricky. The hard thing about a rocket engine is just getting those last incremental seconds of ISP. That\u0027s where it\u0027s really quite difficult, and those last seconds of ISP matter a lot for something that\u0027s going to go beyond Earth orbit, where just every little tiny bit of ISP is important. So I really do think you just have to push everything to the limit in terms of advanced materials, smart design of everything, high efficiency engines, everything, it\u0027s all got to be pushed to the limit. What you don\u0027t want to do though is have insufficient margin in your engines and structure such that you have to rebuild them after returning them. That\u0027s, I think, an error that was made with the Shuttle. The SSMEs were just really difficult to reuse. They required a lot of inspection and parts replacement between flights.
