The graphics in KSP2 are great, a huge improvement over the original, and I\u0027m not here to beef about performance because I haven\u0027t had issues with that. That said, while I love that devs are actively working to fix bugs and improve the game (and devs are doing a great job so far), there is still a lot lacking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my personal list of suggestions/needs (labelled accordingly) to improve QoL and playability - others please feel free to chime in, it\u0027s my goal to provide honest and constructive feedback, so community input on this can only produce better results (because who is to say that my opinion is in the majority?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeeds - Just one that I\u0027ll put in this category, but it\u0027s the one keeping me from recommending KSP2 in its current state when friends ask about it (they\u0027re waiting for my recommendation)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSmooth/stable orbits - I\u0027ve chimed in with bug reports on this previously, but even when the\u00A0bug\u00A0part (in low orbits of celestials without atmospheres) of the issue isn\u0027t occurring, for me it takes a lot of fun out of playing the game trying to pilot/orient a vessel while it\u0027s putting on a demonstration of Heisenberg\u0027s Uncertainty Principle.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestions (mostly) in no particular order [please please please]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nManeuver timers need a numeric deltaV readout, ie remaining deltaV to complete the maneuver, as it was in KSP 1. The timer/countdown is useful, but leaving things purely to reaction time is very unscientific, and far less useful for very precise maneuvers like for rendezvous/docking. Sometimes you want to handle that last little bit while throttled down, or with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is top of list for me, and will probably be very helpful for people new to the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRefine aerodynamics/collision boxes\u00A0(like the 5m fairing in 0.1.1 - seriously, just leave it off if you want to retain any control of your vessel, the juddering/part clipping is terrible, even on the launchpad)\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlso, is anyone else experiencing spontaneous roll in symmetrical rockets above 8500 meters in Kerbin atmosphere? Maybe I\u0027m doing something wrong...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI know there are proponents of each (though I side with the originals), so would it be possible to make an option in Settings as to which PAM interface is used? I see both sides of the issue, but for me I find it annoying having to figure out which part I\u0027m altering if there are multiples of it in the vessel, in different stages, and I only want to alter one (part highlighting when scrolling in the PAM isn\u0027t always easy to see). Also not sure how resource transfer will work in the current PAM\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA \u0022warp to next sunrise\u0022 (and maybe sunset?)\u00A0button for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAbility to toggle/hide certain classes of object, like debris, from showing in map view\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDifferent mounting options for engines - ie, shroud/truss/bare like in late version KSP1 - this would make clustering engines on plates much easier, without worrying about part clipping.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrthogonal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E blocks, por favor! and the 5 horn variant?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCargo parts and EVA construction (or will this be obsolete when we get orbital construction?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTrip Planner/DeltaV calculator that can be adjusted for different atmospheric states\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice to haves\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDebug menu\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParts with \u0022Monument Detection\u0022 ability in the Science update, like we had anomaly detection in KSP 1\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nShielded Clamp-o-Tron\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOthers have said it, but UI resizing ability\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(This might be due to a bug but I\u0027m not sure) Clamshell Fairings should deploy outwards, to the sides of the vessel - for me they go straight forward, clipping harmlessly through the vessel, before either vanishing or plummeting straight down to the planet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExtra Ground Stations for CommNet\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSetting to adjust ambient light, at least in Map View (though maybe this could only apply to worlds you have previously visited, mapped?
