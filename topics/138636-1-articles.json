In other words, if you have a pointy front, not much drag along the sides, and zero thrust, then having a centre of lift behind the centre of mass will ensure that if flies like an arrow through the air. It can\u0027t do anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, as soon as you start adding drag and thrust into the equation that changes.

It is stable without parachutes, but adding parachutes adds just a bit too much drag to stay prograde on its own, and this is worse if you exceed about 2/3 thrust. Which actually goes to show, again, that it is drag which is the problem.

The only thing that can\u00A0bring the nose back to prograde if it diverges is passive aerodynamic forces (which aren\u0027t fully represented in game since it only shows center of lift, not drag) and the pod\u0027s reaction wheel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the dependence on speed is consistent with drag being the key factor, since drag depends on speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, that stack of fuel tanks is going to guarantee that your center of mass moves backwards more than it otherwise would in flight, as the top tanks will empty first while the bottom ones are still full. Using one big tank would keep the center of mass more stable while the fuel is partway expended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth, it\u0027s only got three of the smallest fins. The force they contribute is more in line with what you\u0027d need to stabilize a smaller rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, this craft also has a notable source of drag: the flat edge of the\u00A01.25m service bay attached to the 0.625m end of the pod. Both front and rear nodes are checked for smoothness, and some measurements have indicated that the drag penalty is actually worse at the back. Try moving the pod to where the nosecone is and keeping the middle parts of the rocket all the same radius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point\u00A0I agree with other commenters\u00A0that a bug has not been demonstrated here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T18:17:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222565421\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138636\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462555676\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158940\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thereaverofdarkness2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n37 minutes ago, thereaverofdarkness2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/dZoDi/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis rocket becomes unstable after separating the second SRB.

Several notes about that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, again you\u0027ve got very little control. Engine without gimbal, fins without control surfaces. The only thing that can\u00A0bring the nose back to prograde if it diverges is passive aerodynamic forces (which aren\u0027t fully represented in game since it only shows center of lift, not drag) and the pod\u0027s reaction wheel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the dependence on speed is consistent with drag being the key factor, since drag depends on speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, that stack of fuel tanks is going to guarantee that your center of mass moves backwards more than it otherwise would in flight, as the top tanks will empty first while the bottom ones are still full. Using one big tank would keep the center of mass more stable while the fuel is partway expended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth, it\u0027s only got three of the smallest fins. The force they contribute is more in line with what you\u0027d need to stabilize a smaller rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, this craft also has a notable source of drag: the flat edge of the\u00A01.25m service bay attached to the 0.625m end of the pod. Both front and rear nodes are checked for smoothness, and some measurements have indicated that the drag penalty is actually worse at the back. Try moving the pod to where the nosecone is and keeping the middle parts of the rocket all the same radius.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point\u00A0I agree with other commenters\u00A0that a bug has not been demonstrated here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll good points, however there is little I can do to fix any of them at the stage in the game the rocket is built for. I have no control surfaces, no larger fuel tanks, I don\u0027t have a high enough part limit to put on more fins, and the only capsule I have is a cone. I can\u0027t bring the science home unless it is behind the capsule on re-entry because it is so light relative to the capsule that the capsule\u0027s weight will flip it around and take the heat shield away from the direction of movement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to find a solution that doesn\u0027t involve getting farther into the game.

The uneven surface will create a bit of drag and I could believe the rocket might not be able to remain steady, but it would not cause it to flip around and become stable pointing its engine into the wind.

Without exception, the heavier end will end up coming down first. This is a problem for rockets due to the weight of the engines, and in KSP this is only just countered by the weight of the command pod, SAS and fins at the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, the problem shouldn\u0027t really be all that bad for the second rocket. I managed to get the first rocket to fly alright with nosecones and 1/2 thrust - so drag forces were never too great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just tried the second one. With 4x symmetry for the fins on the last stage, it was fine. With 3x symmetry, it wasn\u0027t quite enough to cope with full thrust for the final stage, when the heating effects were at their strongest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I certainly didn\u0027t find it resolutely facing engine-first into the airflow.
