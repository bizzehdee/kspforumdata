flight through the atmosphere on their way to space.\u00A0 I was absolutely certain I\u0027d cracked it a few nights ago, but alas no... it\u0027s back again with a vengeance.\u00A0 I\u0027m really really stuck with this one, I\u00A0have\u00A0 absolutely no idea what to try next; possibly I\u0027ve been trying to solve it for so long I\u0027m missing something obvious, but anyway, maybe some of

board.\u00A0 On the readout in this image It says the Thrust Torque is currently 0.1.\u00A0 Not sure what that term\u00A0meant, I googled it and discovered it refers to the gimbaling on a rocket engine.\u00A0 I\u0027m using a Swivel engine for the main stage but it doesn\u0027t fire up until the two \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s are

it\u0027s very slight, and really not an issue at this stage, but if you look closely at the Navball you\u0027ll already see it has rolled very very slightly clockwise.\u00A0 However I could live with this amount of roll.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225bpehIY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/5bpehIY.png\u0022

much worse if I wasn\u0027t fighting to correct it.\u00A0 The problem is it\u0027s extremely difficult to try to make a reasonable gravity turn while having to counter this, although as you will see shortly I did a pretty good job of it on this occasion (a little bit of unabashed blowing my own trumpet there!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, this Thrust Torque remains in such small fractions as to be inconsequential, so the problem must be related to them in some way, however I\u0027ve no idea why.\u00A0 They seem to be on straight, and as I\u0027ve already said, in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly

here?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a pity I\u0027m having this problem, indeed in five attempts at a launch, four of them had ended up totally out of control because of this.\u00A0 The fifth one I sent much higher than normal before pitching over, and it did help to lessen this rolling somewhat, but it was more like a sticking plaster rather than a proper cure.\u00A0 The result was one of the best orbits I\u0027ve ever established without tweaking it, the readings on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E in this image shows the

do say so myself!\u00A0 However this was a fluke, I couldn\u0027t hit an orbit like that with the best rocket ever produced by any KSP player, let alone one rolling as bad as this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wmVzPBb.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/wmVzPBb.png\u0022
