The only thing is that I can\u0027t get the emission animation to work. The tutorial I found shows steps to do it but the screenshots don\u0027t match what\u0027s in my unity so I don\u0027t know if its working or not. Is there another tutorial out there? What do I need to check for to make sure the animation makes it into my .mu file?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T21:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using unity 4 you\u0027ll have a horrible time with emissive animations, I had same issue, only way I resolved it was by getting an earlier Unity 3 install and doing all emissive anims from there, in fact it\u0027s a lot easier to do all anims in unity 3 although the curve editor can be a fiddly thing\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
