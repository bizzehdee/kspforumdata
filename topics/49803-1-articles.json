I am not a physicist, or even an engineer. I am a night stocker/cashier at a grocery store, with a GED. There are some aspects of it supported by certain experiments, but, more importantly, it is not contradicted by any experimental data to date. Please take it for the total amateur speculation that it is, and not a hard hypothesis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI myself prefer the idea that space is not, in fact, a membrane and is, instead, a soup of unidentified fundamental particles...like another layer of the Higgs Field. Its behavior doesn\u0027t make sense any other way, from what I\u0027ve read in various papers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the particle soup scenario, normal matter would interact with the Higgs Field, thus being imparted with the effect of mass, and causing interaction with the particles responsible for \u0022space\u0022 or rather the definition of separation between any two other particles. More mass, less separation...less separation, more \u0022gravity\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, if time were not an aspect of space, and not a \u0022fabric\u0022 or membrane, itself, it too would make more sense. Time would be linked to space, as a particle which prohibits interactions from occurring in reverse, and the local distribution of which determines the apparent rate at which interactions do occur. These particles would apparently have to exist in a natural equilibrium with particles of space, assuming there were no other matter or energy present, or else something else is at work also. In such a case, it would be likely that something such as charge or spin would be responsible for their \u0022mixing\u0022 properties? There doesn\u0027t seem to be anything inherently wrong with the assumption of a natural equilibrium, all outside factors accounted for, so we\u0027ll stick with that for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo normal mass would push away particles of space, reducing separation (and thereby increasing \u0022gravity\u0022), while massless energetic particles don\u0027t (or may even gather them up, in some instances), increasing separation...and this would in turn cause particles of time to fall in and fill the void, or be thrown away to make room...thus slowing time in a gravity well and \u0022speeding it up\u0022 farther away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcceleration through these particle fields would have the same effect at sufficient velocities because the particles of time determine rates of interaction and if you acquire more interactions within that frame, the effect should increase, and since everything is always moving relative to everything else, you\u0027d get relativistic timeframes. The faster something goes, the more Higgs particles its material is forced to interact with, the more mass it gains, the more space particles are forced away, the more time particles are gathered up...and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt occurs to me now that one might ask, \u0022then what\u0027s between particles of space and time\u0022? To which the only possible answers are of course, nothing...or something. I\u0027m inclined to go with nothing. There\u0027s otherwise no reason to assume yet another particle\u0027s existence in this case. But if there\u0027s nothing, then WHY is there nothing? Well...technically, there isn\u0027t nothing, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the particles overlap one another. Their density being the measure of what we call time, distance, and gravity. They can never be separated from that overlap entirely (or perhaps they can and that\u0027s what a wormhole is?), and so no matter how \u0022empty\u0022 space seems, or the overall distance travelled, everything will appear directly as though it were traveling across a uniform surface or membrane. Hence, why even cosmically distant light appears to arrive here without significant deviation, when the idea is that a particle soup of spatial fabric would indicate they should stutter and be less bright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...Higgs, Space, Time...the three together give us substance, universal bindings, and interaction. Higgs gives everything else mass dependent on everything else\u0027s own traits otherwise (which I\u0027m sure there\u0027s uniform rules to, but we won\u0027t get into that right now...because I\u0027m clueless on it), most likely by increasing in field density around those objects. The increased concentration of overlap in Higgs particles forces spatial particles farther apart, which causes temporal particles to constrict into the region of less spatial density...and for whatever unaccounted for reason at the moment...don\u0027t seem to care about Higgs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm...maybe a hole in the idea...darn. Ah well...I\u0027ll keep thinking on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thoughts, criticism? I don\u0027t at all expect this to be well-recieved, but rather to be torn up hard as an \u0022armchair physicist\u0022 with no idea what I\u0027m talking about. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E: For clarification of various points and assumptions. For the purposes of this clarification, \u0022known\u0022 refers to that knowledge which currently has fewer actively lingering questions, than acceptable answers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) All currently known natural universal laws are governed by one or more particular forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1a) All currently known forces are fields composed of specific and unique types of fundamental particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1b) These particles, to date, never \u0022pull double duty\u0022, and are always responsible for only one field and its singular effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1c) It can be reasonably assumed, given our current understanding, that while any given field has only a singular effect, those effects can have far more varied results through interactions with other fields and entities within those fields and itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1d) It is probable that certain natural universal laws that seem too complex to be related to a single field in the above case, may as such be related to multiple fields, instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Space is a field of force composed of fundamental particles whose individual volumes always overlap one another, and all other particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2a) As such, they have no requirement for intermediary particles that \u0022fill in\u0022 the otherwise nonexistent gaps between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2b) The field of these particles serves as a matrix of dividers between all other forms of particles, except for Higgs particles, and temporal particles; which are themselves additional complimentary field matrices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2c) The degree of \u0022density\u0022 of this overlap between spatial particles is what gives the appearance of gravitation between massive bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2d) Greater field density increases the apparent separation between non-spatial particles, presenting the appearance of decreased gravitation; while lesser field density decreases that apparent separation, therefore increasing the appearance of gravitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2e) It is the greater and lesser density of these particles, and their effects on the appearance of distance, that cause relativistic effects, rather than the fundamental particles of time; as a given interaction spread out over a greater span, intrinsically appears as though it occurs over a longer period, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The Higgs Field is responsible for the appearance of mass for given particles, and particles with given traits interact or fail to interact with the field to varying degrees, producing a variety of mass effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3a) It is not unreasonable or contradictory at this time to assume that a given Higgs particle has a given effect on a given piece of matter, and that the appearance of greater mass is due to interaction with greater numbers of Higgs particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3b) Given the immediately prior assumption, it follows that a given mass in relative motion through the Higgs field interacts with a greater number of Higgs particles than it would at rest relative to the field; causing the same effect as though that body were proportionally more massive than it actually is, contributing to the appearance of time dilation in transit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3c) Given all of the above assumptions, it is reasonable to assume also that Higgs particles and spatial particles attempt to avoid interaction with one another, as a greater density of Higgs particles would seem to cause a lessening of spatial density and thus increase gravitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Time, like space, is also a force related to a field composed of fundamental particles, which serve as a matrix for mitigating the interactions of all other particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4a) These particles\u0027 effect is the mechanism whereby the energy required for an interaction to operate in reverse is directly negated in response by a reciprocal quantity of energy in the field, and so reversed interactions are prevented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4b) Given all prior assumptions, particles of time do not otherwise seem affected by Higgs or spatial particles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-21T09:52:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2013 09:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tharios\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarification and revision.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duxwing","CreatedById":42282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T03:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad that you\u0027re thinking about such questions!

Firstly, I don\u0027t expect to have \u0022hit the nail on the head\u0022. It was pure speculation and I said so from the start. I never claimed to be an expert. In no way was I dishonest about any of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the primary purpose was more to offer a different point of view for, say, the purpose of inspiration. Maybe someone who actually knows what they\u0027re doing, might look at it all and say, \u0022no, you\u0027re completely wrong...but THIS particular part is interesting, let\u0027s see if there\u0027s anything behind it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m grateful for any correct information to supplant or supplement what I have available. I would rather have accurate information, than not. I would rather produce effective and accurate hypotheses, than not. My ire is due to the fact that, as you can read below, he\u0027s accusing me of being a liar, essentially claiming that I\u0027m intentionally attempting to dupe people into believing my claims OVER those of experts. When such accusations themselves are, in this context, petty and dishonest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing...law is strictly a matter of interpretation, currently. It isn\u0027t in any way equatable to scientific endeavors. A better example might have been going into a hospital and insisting that I can do a better job than the surgeon. Honestly, at this point, as far as Washington DC goes, there is almost no one who couldn\u0027t do a better job in any of those roles...except for the fact that nearly all would be instantly corrupted as well. Just look at the mind-bogglingly wrong interpretations of the 2nd amendment. Or the decision that corporations have a right to free speech and that money counts as speech (grossly simplified, but accurate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd what did you expect? Anything that can be understood without spending a decade building up a proper background has been understood \u003Cem\u003Ecenturies\u003C/em\u003E ago.

Though perhaps I\u0027d be better off going to a Canadian university. Their curriculums are more focused and their standards better than American schools. Guess I\u0027ll just have to look at all possible options and hope for the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, one last thing, Einstein\u0027s capability certainly benefitted immeasurably from an extensive education (though he largely ignored it), but what he did with that knowledge...that, was most certainly a birthright. The way in which he viewed the universe in the light of his acquired knowledge was something that cannot ever be taught, or copied, by someone not born with it. The same is true of Hawking, and a myriad of others who\u0027ve made the biggest and most groundbreaking strides.
