I \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E add\u00A0my custom terrain preset, so it seems, but the name doesn\u0027t come up. It instead repeats\u00A0High (i.e. there are two settings called High).\u00A0When I select the second High setting (presumably my custom setting), click Accept, then return to the graphics settings, it says \u0022New Text\u0022. When I try the game, however, I can see that my custom setting has been correctly selected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, when I try to change the\u00A0Low, Default, or High preset names themselves in settings.cfg, the name change does not show up in the setting menu in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone reproduce this?

We don\u0027t directly support custom presets and manual edits are at your own risk. However, this may have worked in the past and the new preset appeared, but\u00A0with localization, it seems that only 3 presets are expected. Adjustments of the individual \u0022Planet\u0022 detail on the settings page\u00A0wanders into feature territory, so\u00A0not really a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease do report this on the tracker as feedback so we can take a look.
