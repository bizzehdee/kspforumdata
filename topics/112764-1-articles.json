This seemed to work when I relaunched KSP, but another issue has arisen.\n\nAny prior saves, including all training missions \u0026 scenarios, cannot be loaded. The preview loads fine, but when I click the \u0027continue\u0027 button, nothing happens.\n\nThe game DOES run new games normally, though (still can\u0027t access scenarios or training though)\n\nMods installed:\n\nDistant object enhancement\n\nChatterer\n\nPlanetshine\n\nMechJeb\n\nI used the search function and found no threads with this **specific** issue."}]}
