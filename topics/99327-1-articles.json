I do like the idea of contracts and more complex space programs but I\u0027m getting frustrated now that I\u0027m looking at Duna and beyond. With missions to Mun or Minmus I could pretty well keep track of multiple flights on the map. I could fill the time for transfers with other flights. Things too and from my space station, etc. The times to Duna being half a year are just too much and what if some thing is out of position? In some ways this is realistic but it\u0027s also very annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an idea I\u0027d like to toss out for you to kick around. If their is already some way to do it please tell me. What if when you hit Esc. and returned to space center you had the option to also revert in time to the launch. So what I\u0027m basically suggesting is that there could be two different times. One is space center/space program time the other being mission time. I know this sounds strange. Let\u0027s say I start a long mission to Duna or Jool. I fly the probe or satellite all the way to Duna and land or circle or what ever. Then when I hit escape I have the option of returning to mission launch time when I go back to the space center. It\u0027s like being able to run parallel missions but I can focus on one at a time. Space program time progresses along as it normally would. In the mean time that Duna mission is theoretically progressing. It has a date associated with it and on that date it will appear in orbit or on the surface of Duna. If I wanted to send a second mission to meet it I could launch another probe or ship and once it passed the save date of the last mission you would find that last probe waiting there for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize this is kind of complicated and I may not be doing a very good job of explaining it. But mull the thing over and kick it around a bit. I think it could be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T22:19:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFMRS\u003C/a\u003E does this, but it might be kind of unwieldy for your purpose\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps consider \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/a\u003E so you can get notifications for your flights and switch back to them when they need attention?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T03:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took me awhile to figure out what it is that you actually wanted out of your suggestion, but you want a Kerbal Alarm Clock.
