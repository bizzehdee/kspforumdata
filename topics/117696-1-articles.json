I\u0027m calling it a \u0022brute force\u0022 rendezvous because it\u0027s a series of small burns to get you close, not a single exact burn. That\u0027s not to suggest that I\u0027m claiming to have discovered this though...I\u0027m sure it\u0027s probably nothing new for the more seasoned folks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re like me, you might want to practice in sandbox mode with fuel cheats enabled, put aside all the fancy details (like getting it perfect on the first maneuver) until later, and just do a plain, basic rendezvous to acquire some general familiarity with the whole process. Then move on to dealing the more complicated details like precise maneuvers, fuel efficiency/consumption concerns, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start with, this rendezvous guide is fantastic and you should already be familiar with the maneuver node intersect indicators he talks about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1v1ZLXLBMQo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis initial burn gets him within 4.7k of the station, but with a real heavy load (or due to certain noob factors on my part), after my initial launch maneuver I usually end up ~50\u002Bk away from the station instead. Clearly my launch maneuver was not very exact, but what to do? Revert to the launchpad and try the whole thing again? No!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you have Target selected in the navball\u0027s velocity indicator (not Surface or Orbit) as you should:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Turn to face the yellow 3-prong petrograde marker and wait/warp until you are no longer closing the distance to the target. Then burn until velocity shows as close to zero as you can get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. With relative velocity at (or near) zero, turn to face the magenta target prograde marker and burn toward the target. Choose a reasonable speed based on how far away you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Repeat step 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it! It will use up a bit more fuel, so you\u0027re going to want to get better at reducing the number of burns, but following these steps over and over will eventually get you close to the station. The trick is: do not burn toward the target unless your relative velocity with it is zero, otherwise you might as well be trying to swim in a whirlpool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome extra info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As suggested in the video, it\u0027s easiest to sit on the launch pad and warp until the target station is directly overhead (\u002B/- 20 degrees or so). Then launch. Otherwise you\u0027ll want your orbit to be above or below the target so you or it can catch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you can\u0027t seem to get the intersect indicators to move closer together by dragging the maneuver node\u0027s prograde vector, then try moving the maneuver node itself to a slightly different location in your orbit. That almost always does the trick for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The further away you are from the station, the more affect a non-zero relative velocity will have prior to burning prograde toward the target. In other words, you burn directly toward the target, but by the time you get there you\u0027re way off. So take the time to chase the petrograde marker around and get your relative velocity as close to zero as possible prior to burning toward the target, as it will reduce the total number of burns you\u0027ll have to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This should go without saying, but the target\u0027s orbit inclination should be 0 degrees to make it easiest. Take the time to get your station into a good, workable orbit before trying to rendezvous with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I hope this is helpful for anyone else who has tried to follow some rendezvous tutorials and ended up in situations that weren\u0027t exactly like the \u0022perfect world\u0022 situations depicted in them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wouldn\u0027t let me pick How To\u0022 as a thread prefix, so I had to pick [Answered].\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T14:26:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Binary_Digit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Binary_Digit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.

For people who are not, stuff like that doesn\u0027t really make sense yet. It just serves to overcomplicate the whole thing and makes it that much harder to learn the basics. When I was trying to learn, it frustrated me that all the tutorials I found have obfuscated the simplicity of the whole process by adding extra tricks and shortcuts like that. It\u0027s like trying to learn simple addition/subtraction by sifting through lessons on polynomials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I found easier to digest in the beginning was this simple, 2-step algorithm. That helped me get familiar with the navball markers, the RCS strafe controls, and to know instinctively at any given time what direction I need to burn.
