Shocker, right? Anyways, I remember watching music videos in the past where the rhythm, beat and bass are visually represented by something. That made me wonder if something like that exists for iPhone as an app, something which can interact with the speakers and turn pandora into a beautiful if trippy audio-visual... Thingy. And so we have the problem. I can\u0027t seem to figure out what this is, or what it\u0027s called. I barely understand that it\u0027s supposed to work through the microphone and convert that sound into code that triggers visual patterns matching the music being played. Any help on this? I just started a Foster The People station on pandora and think the visuals would be... Interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T04:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn old stand alone device was called a color organ.
