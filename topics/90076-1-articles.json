After mulling over the idea, I came up with an even simpler way to implement it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt starts off with you in orbit around a body - let\u0027s say, Kerbin. Let\u0027s also say that you want to go to Duna, but you don\u0027t know the transfer window or the ejection angle to get there. No problem - all you do is target Duna and immediately a dotted line and an indicator that looks similar to the Ascending/Descending nodes appears on your map. Mousing over the red indicator tells you how long you have until the optimal transfer time. The dotted line also shows you where in your orbit you\u0027ll need to burn once that time arrives.

This way does not take into account eccentricities and inclination of orbits, so fiddling of maneuver nodes may be necessary. Personally, I\u0027d limit the \u0022Optimal Transfer\u0022 time to just days accuracy for interplanetary travel, and moons down to hours (and maybe even increments of minutes, such as 15/30/45/60 minutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps this idea could be implemented into Upgrade-able Buildings as well, such as upgrading the Tracking Station high enough to where this dotted line will appear and assist you in interplanetary travel. It could even start off being inaccurate, giving you transfer windows that are off by a few days to a weeks time and ejection angles that are off by 5-15 degrees, making further upgrades to the Tracking Station necessary to pinpoint transfer times and ejection angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you guys think?

This would take some of the mystery and difficultly out of reaching other planets. Then again, if this tool for traveling to other planets isn\u0027t provided in-game, some players may never learn about transfer windows and ejection angles, and some may resort to third-party sources to teach them or to do it for them (not that it\u0027s bad or anything to do so). This suggestion of ejection angles shown to you in the base game just eliminates the one extra step it takes players to download a mod to show/help them, having to switch back and forth between a web-browser and KSP, or having a physical cut-out triangle that you hold up to the screen. Anyways, implementing a way to show players how to get to other planets without it being cheat-see is difficult, and I\u0027m positive that this \u0022visual arrow in map view\u0022 idea is not the best way. Players may just always have to rely on third-party sources, memory, their math skills, or even trial and error in order to arrive elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the least, I\u0027d be nice to have something like this in the Kerbal EDU version that teaches the players how to calculate transfer windows and ejection angles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
