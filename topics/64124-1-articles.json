I guess I screwed up the design on the two support-ships, because I installed way too small antennas (I\u0027m using Remote Tech). It\u0027s vital to the mission that the two support-ships are connected to the command-ship at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, all three ships are in orbit. I\u0027m nearing the launch-window, so I don\u0027t think I have the time to launch two re-designed support-ships with the larger antennas. Looking through the quicksave-file, I\u0027ve been able to copy in larger antennaes, which seemingly look all fine and dandy. The problem is that although the position of the new antenna matches the position of the original one, it\u0027s not really attached to the same parent part. This results in an antenna floating in mid-air. In my case, I just copied the new antenna from another random ship, where the parent was number 11. On the ship in question, the parent should\u0027ve been 76. Therefore, I tried copying the lines from and including UID to and including srfN from my backup quicksave-file. This should\u0027ve left me with the positioning data of the old antenna, and everything else for the new antenna. This results in most of the ship being gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I post the VESSEL-data here, do any of you think you can help me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T00:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had to do something similar when I first installed RemoteTech 2; I had a bunch of deep-space probes that I had to upgrade from the stock Communotron 16. Fortunately, it\u0027s not too hard if you\u0027re careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour first method should have left you with an antenna that \u0022looks\u0022 like it\u0027s not attached, but is. In that case, simply tweak the position and rotation values until you get something that looks correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re starting over from scratch, you may find it easier to keep the old antenna almost intact and only replace a few key values: name, mass, rTrf, ModuleAnimateGeneric, and ModuleRTAntenna. You definitely don\u0027t want to edit parent, srfN, or attN by hand; I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a way to do that that doesn\u0027t corrupt the ship\u0027s structure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbrud","CreatedById":92900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T00:55:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to fix it.
