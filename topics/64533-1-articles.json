From my point of view, however, it seems that the more successful mods/additions/ect. all start here in the forums before they ever hit the Spaceport. This allows for the more active aspect of the KSP community an input of their thoughts towards your concepts, allowing the creator to tweak what might have been an over/under powered part, into something more balanced. In my months lurking the forums, I have seen on more then one occasion, that some very gifted and talented artist will offer their skills to design a unique part (if the idea catches their interest enough).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitworks","CreatedById":97023,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T22:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAyo99, I think the comments above have hit all the main hangups.
