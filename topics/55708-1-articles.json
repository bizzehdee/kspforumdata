I got some files of the internet but this program needs an DOS emulator to work. I got DOSbox but I couldn\u0027t get it to work at all, I went through so many tutorials and stuff but most were filled is computer jargon that I couldn\u0027t understand. So here is my current situation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I have 3 disk .exe files which I have managed to extract the contents from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I have a setup.exe file as well, and that seems to be the only one that works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I have a SPACESIM.exe file \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-And finally I have a SS1.exe file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have managed to mount this to the drive using DOSbox and get the setup running but no further. When I run the game all I get is a flash then the command prompt. Any help is appreciated. (I don\u0027t come from the time of DOS, so a step by step tutorial would be really helpful.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currrently using a windows 7, 64 bit laptop which a Radeon graphics. I am currently using DOSbox version 0.74.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hawkinator","CreatedById":57569,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T16:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Einformation on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.dosbox.com/comp_list.php?showID=1022\u0026amp;letter=M\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis page\u003C/a\u003E might help you somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stargazer1235","CreatedById":52505,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T07:24:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see that I got 115 views but only 1 reply. Don\u0027t sweat, if I was in you chair, I wouldn\u0027t know what it was anyway. Anyway the point is that I found a file that configured the game to run on Windows 7 so I don\u0027t need DOSbox anymore.
