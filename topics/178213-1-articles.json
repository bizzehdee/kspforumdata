So im trying to test a new 2 stage reusable rocket in career and in kerbal engineer redux increasing the size of the monoprop tank only decreases the deltav of the first but not second stage. and removing the tank removes about 300m/s from the second stage. NOTE: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E is of in the kerbal enginner redux readouts. Could anybody tell me why this is happening and if it is a bug how i can fix this??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrClottom","CreatedById":191791,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-10T18:01:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh i realize my error. it calculates the delta-v according to the root part and the root part was the second stage so it was calculating the delta-v as if i would be seperating my payload therefore not accounting for it\u0027s weight. why removing it completely increased the delta-v by a couple hundred m/s idk but that\u0027s trivial\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
