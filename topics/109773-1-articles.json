Some intelligence is possible for automatically sorting parts, but for custom sorting (e.g. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104231-1-0-x-Filter-Extensions-2-1-3-(May-19)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFilter Extensions\u003C/a\u003E), we basically have to take a part at its word, so please set these fields to ensure that your parts get sorted properly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock values for bulkheadProfiles are size0, size1, size2, size3, mk2, mk3, and srf (for \u0022surface attach\u0022), but we can also use our own. A few that I have seen (and one that I\u0027ve made myself): size1p5 for 1.875m parts, size4 for 5m parts, and size00 for 0.35m parts (that\u0027s the one I\u0027ve made up -- \u0022Size -1\u0022 doesn\u0027t fit very well into an alphanumeric-only naming convention, so I took a tip from the clothing, model railway, and shotgun ammunition industries and called it 00). You can put anything you like in bulkheadProfiles and the stock system will happily show it as a separate subcategory under the \u0022Filter by Cross-Section Profile\u0022 tab, but you need something like Filter Extensions to give it a proper icon and description, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/FQtgXiJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FQtgXiJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FQtgXiJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s Mk2, Mk3, J (from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97525-0-90-WIP-OPT-Space-Plane-v1-6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOPT Space Plane\u003C/a\u003E), Mk 4 (from Nertea\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699-0-90-Mark-IV-Spaceplane-System-(14-12-14-important-fixes!)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMark IV Spaceplane System\u003C/a\u003E), K (from OPT), size 00 (from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102502-1-0-2-Sounding-Rockets!-Start-small-Dream-big!-0-2-1-2015-05-15\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESounding Rockets\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120579-The-SSR-MicroSat-and-MiniRocket-aeroplane-mounted-launch-vehicle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMicroSat\u003C/a\u003E, and a few parts from stock and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90218-0-90-RLA-Stockalike-12-1-15-Dec\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERLA Stockalike\u003C/a\u003E), 0, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75129-Universal-Storage-1-1-0-4-%28For-KSP-1-0-x%29-26th-May-2015\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUniversal Storage\u003C/a\u003E wedge, 1, Mk1x0.5 and 1x1 BoxBase from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87546-KashCorp-Parts-1-0-2-Rovers-Roadsters-%28v0-6%29-1-0-2-KAP-%28v2-1%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERovers and Roadsters\u003C/a\u003E, 1.5 (from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60974-1-0-2-HGR-1-875m-parts(v1-2-1-released)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHGR\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98456-WIP-Socke-s-Parts-1-875m-Extension\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESocke\u0027s 1.875m parts\u003C/a\u003E), 2 (which also includes the type I cockpits from OPT), Hex Truss (from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86388-1-0-Speedy-s-Hex-Truss-System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpeedy\u0027s Hex Truss System\u003C/a\u003E), Octo-Girder (from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-1-02-Near-Future-Technologies-(NFSolar-NFSpacecraft-NFConstruction-hotfixed)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENear Future Construction\u003C/a\u003E), Size 3, Size 3 Octagonal (from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91706-1-0-2-Freight-Transport-Technologies-v0-4-1-2015-05-15\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFreight Transportation Technologies\u003C/a\u003E, if RoverDude chooses to sort his parts under it), \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94947-Exploration-Rover-System-by-A-S-E-T-%2810-10-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExploration Rover System\u003C/a\u003E (if alexustas chooses to sort ERS parts under it), Size 4 (from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408-1-0-2-SpaceY-Heavy-Lifter-Parts-Pack-v0-13-1-(2015-05-14)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpaceY\u003C/a\u003E and FTT), HX from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92630-0-24-2-B9-Aerospace-Release-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EB9 Aerospace\u003C/a\u003E, and finally Surface Attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also, for kicks, I removed Filter Extensions to see what stock would do.
