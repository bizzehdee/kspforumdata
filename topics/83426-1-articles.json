Bartemone Kerman, a relatively new recruit to the space program, was piloting and would join the colony as the head of exploration. Either through the carelessness of the engineers, the age of the rocket used to launch the rover, or some unknown factor, the launch went terribly, horribly awry. The rocket cleared the tower as it normally did, it flew up to 5km and began its gravity turn as it normally would, but the turn didn\u0027t stop. The rocket carrying Bartemone Kerman and his shiny new rover for the Mun base began to spin out of control and Bartemone bailed, but he couldn\u0027t escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design of the launcher involved in the crash omitted any sort of LES. While manned missions in the past normally used a LES in case something went wrong, but the Maiden series had an unmatched safety record and so it was considered unnecessary.
