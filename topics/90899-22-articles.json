Which will be needed to create super strong magnetic field to contain the exotic Matter which is extremely volatile. Maintaining the super strong magnetic field will require a lot of power (At least 1GW) but it will always leak a bit of exotic matter due to Hawking radiation. This will prevent you from gathering exotic matter over a long period with low tech reactors. This means only with Antimatter reactor with a significant supply of Antimatter you can generate enough power to use the warpdrive comfortably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can implement this effect by adding FNModuleCryostat module which require a lot of power just to keep the magnetic field strong enough to prevent the exotic matter from escaping too fast. This will make the Warp Drive only useful in combination with antimatter reactor and a significant storage of antimatter, since only antimatter reactors have enough power to maintain the Magnetic field and generate Exotic matter to create a warp bubble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[USI_WarpDrive]:FOR[WarpPlugin]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    @title = Large Alcubierre Drive (2.5m)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    !MODULE[REGO_ModuleResourceConverter]{}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = REGO_ModuleResourceConverter\u003Cbr\u003E        StartActionName = Start ExoticMatter \u003Cbr\u003E        StopActionName = Stop ExoticMatter\u003Cbr\u003E        RecipeInputs = Megajoules,10000,LqdHelium,1\u003Cbr\u003E        RecipeOutputs = ExoticMatter,1,false,WasteHeat,1000,false\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    !MODULE[ModuleEngines]{}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    name = ModuleEngines\u003Cbr\u003E    thrustVectorTransformName = thrustTransform\u003Cbr\u003E    exhaustDamage = False\u003Cbr\u003E    ignitionThreshold = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E    minThrust = 0\u003Cbr\u003E    maxThrust = 100\u003Cbr\u003E    heatProduction = 10\u003Cbr\u003E    fxOffset = 0, 0, 0\u003Cbr\u003E    PROPELLANT\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = Megajoules\u003Cbr\u003E            ratio = 1\u003Cbr\u003E        DrawGauge = True\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E    PROPELLANT\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = ExoticMatter\u003Cbr\u003E        ratio = 1\u003Cbr\u003E        DrawGauge = True\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E    PROPELLANT\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = LqdHelium\u003Cbr\u003E        ratio = .1\u003Cbr\u003E        DrawGauge = True\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    atmosphereCurve\u003Cbr\u003E     {\u003Cbr\u003E        key = 0 15000\u003Cbr\u003E       key = 1 10\u003Cbr\u003E     }    \u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    !RESOURCE[ExoticMatter]{}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    RESOURCE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E         name = ExoticMatter\u003Cbr\u003E         amount = 0\u003Cbr\u003E         maxAmount = 15000\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    !RESOURCE[XenonGas]{}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E    name        =    FNModuleCryostat\u003Cbr\u003E    resourceName    =    ExoticMatter\u003Cbr\u003E    resourceGUIName =    ExoticMatter\u003Cbr\u003E    boilOffRate     =    0\u003Cbr\u003E    powerReqKW    =    1000000\u003Cbr\u003E    boilOffMultiplier =    1\u003Cbr\u003E    boilOffAddition =    1.0e-6\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-06T09:28:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2015 09:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T02:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERock on, as long as it lands in a place that does not mess with NFT or USI mods if they are in the same install, that\u0027s pretty much my one request given this is an active mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeaning, if NFT is installed it\u0027s power reqs should scale back to what it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T05:25:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been reading through the thread and well...yeah stopped at page 12.

On the other hand, Exotic matter should have the side effect of pushing everything away, which could be modeled I think. Might function like a AoE repulsor, pushing every vessel in the vicinity away from the warp drive. Perhaps it would also be possible to try to slowly pull the vessel apart, the more Exotic matter is created, the stronger the effect. Exotic matter should function as the Opposite effect of a miniature Black Holle. Instead of pulling everything in, It would push everything away. Therefore you might want to create a ship that is strong enough not to be ripped apart by the tidal forces generated by the exotic matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-06T09:47:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2015 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T09:42:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note - once we get CRP sorted out, me you and nertea should talk and figure out how to get the different power and heat systems in sync.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently KSPI uses ORS which has some nasty side effecys which causes it to behave unrealsitic and weird at high time warp.
