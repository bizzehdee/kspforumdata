You just need to achieve an acceptable Low Kerbin Orbit (LKO) almost circular and equatorial (0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination), and set a maneuver node on it so that Mun is seen at a relative angle from Kerbin of about 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of the node. With that node, place a burn prograde of about 800 m/s and you will see your trajectory elongate, its projected apoapsis to reach an altitude about 11400 Km (same as the distance Kerbin-Mun). If the node position is about right, the projected apoapsis will be where Mun will arrive, and you will see the trajectory change when entering Mun\u0027s Sphere of Influence (SoI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Minmus the basic procedure is similar, but you have to also correct for Minmus inclination, and that may require an additional maneuver. The angle from the node to Minmus position is 114.9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and the burn prograde is 907 m/s for a LKO of 100 Km altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also set your target to the desired body first, from the map view, so to be presented with markers about your vessel and your target future positions at closest encounters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case the above is not yet enough, you can certainly PM for \u0022private KSP lessons\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
