I was working quite hard on that, and had just finished it when the crash occurred. Upon seeing that the thread was not recreated, I decided to replicate it myself. After all, why let all that hard work go to waste?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/rmstapw6r/screenshot0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKenry and Malhat in front of their base at the systems check.

I had previously neglected to attempt the gravity turn, as I did not quite trust myself, but for this launch it was necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/ijnajb58d/screenshot4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularizing.
