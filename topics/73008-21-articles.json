My reentries were about 40 degrees nose-up, turning 45 degrees to each side in 60 degree banks, and Angel slows down really fast with the belly and bottom of the wings turned into the airflow like that. I experienced no controllability issues in those high-alpha maneuvers until getting close to MACH 1, when the nose was finally pulled down onto the velocity vector. If you try to plow in nose-down at hypersonic speeds, I fully expect it to MACH-tuck you down and burn you into cinders (but I didn\u0027t try it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-10T02:30:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2014 02:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheReaper","CreatedById":75943,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T06:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei wonder if anyone built a perfet aircraft, you know with controll values for FAR that some should be negative and some positive and some doesnt matter. even in simplest designs there is always a flaw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"marach","CreatedById":72245,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T08:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheReaper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheReaper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei wonder if anyone built a perfet aircraft, you know with controll values for FAR that some should be negative and some positive and some doesnt matter. even in simplest designs there is always a flaw\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built a few that are green across the board but yaw when machtuck sets in with the yaw increasing as you hit 1km/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AccidentalDisassembly","CreatedById":110936,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T20:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cashen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cashen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor anybody who is having trouble getting the SpacePlanes Plus IVAs to work with RasterPropMonitor 0.17 and the latest version of KSI MFD, here\u0027s a fix you can apply.\u003Cp\u003EOpen these two files:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameData/SpaceplanePlus/Spaces/Mk2CockpitInlineInternals/internalRPM.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameData/SpaceplanePlus/Spaces/Mk2CockpitStandardInternals/internalRPM.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd replace all instances of \u0022RasterPropMonitorExampleMFD\u0022 with \u0022RasterPropMonitorBasicMFD\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t prevent the inevitable crash about 2 minutes after I place the normal MK2 cockpit in the SPH - was there something else I was supposed to do to fix this?

Recently I was able to get a long and stable game going with only a few crashes when switching from space view back to space center or exiting the VAB. I use this mod for some detailed ships, one is on the way to Jool in my most recent game. Few days ago I had just completed a Munar shipyard using Extraplanetary Shipyard mod when my computer locked up. It was KSP, but that scary \u0022huuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\u0022 noise that Windows makes when everything goes to and you have to do a hard reboot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did that, and restarted KSP. KSP crashes during load. What does this have to do with Space Planes? It locks up when it reads GameData\\SpaceplanePlus\\Parts\\mk2Cockpit_StandardCockpit_Lum.. It stays locked up for a minute or more then CTD. I\u0027ve replaced the entire mod with a fresh DL, no luck. I\u0027ve erased the file, then it does the same with the dockingportMk2 file, then CTD. I\u0027ve rechecked the local files with STEAM constantly and no difference in outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets very frustrating. I\u0027ve played KPS for 1500\u002B hours with little to show for it because of the constant CTD.
