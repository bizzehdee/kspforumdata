Seemed to only start after updating to the latest versions of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E (unless it was \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E...) and changing some other mods around that I can\u0027t remember. Will try disabling the ones I remember to see if they\u0027re the culprit when I get a chance, but KSP takes so long to boot so may take a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI load a saved game, click on any building (except , nothing happens, but the tooltip gets stuck to the cursor, and I can\u0027t click on any other buildings. I can open the menu, but clicking quit or trying to load a saved game do absolutely nothing (except some buttons close the menu). Using the buttons in the corner I can open the \u0022launch vessel\u0022 screen, but clicking launch does nothing. It leaves you with basically no other option but e.g. closing KSP from the task manager. Most mod menus \u003Cem\u003Eseem\u003C/em\u003E to still basically function visibly at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally annoying as I\u0027d finally got the game working basically fine. Do have a hell of a lot of mods installed but this happened very suddenly and affected all of my saves (even new games).
