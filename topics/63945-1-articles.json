I think it would be beneficial, and also just more realistic which would be nice, to include tethers from space stations to your kerbonauts. It would prevent those random times when you EVA and get caught in orbit too far from your ship to get back with just the RCS. Have any mods added this anywhere? If not I definitely think it would be something cool to add, mostly just aesthetic but still useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
