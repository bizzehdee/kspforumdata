Now, when there are more biomes on every planet/moon I decided to try the career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have one problem - science progression is too fast (yes, I have mods).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to use more biomes mod (forgot the exact name) and DMagic Orbital Science (for moar experiments, of course) - this resulted in significant increase of science harvest.

Then Eve unmanned rover - one biome. And cleared enitre Minimus using jumping-flying science lab. And of course some basic missions, like Mun and orbiting around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is - considering that I won\u0027t remove DMagic - how to reduce science gain?

This is ideal, right now, because each trip allows me to unlock a new tech node of 160, and the rest is saved up for the 300 ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have my \u0022Archer Program\u0022 of Apollo stile landers, and am collecting science and finding anomalies. It is really fun preparation for a grand Duna mission, that should collect all the biomes there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA typical satellite contract gives 6 science, but I also turned the $ reward up to 180%, so that I could do the missions I wanted and not have to repeat the same satellite contracts endlessly (180% turned out to be too much, I think, If I started again I would try it at 120%). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am really enjoying these settings, and the possibilities for fine tuning the kind of challenge you want and integrate mods into your career are great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: note that the science from contract\u0027s, little as it is, does come in handy sometimes. With 50% it\u0027s not so easy to unlock the first nodes, unless you are willing to visit Kerbins biomes (after doing that so many times already, I am kind of bored by them), and sometimes I have been just a few points away of unlocking some node I really want before my next big mission (first munar lander, extraplanetary probe, etc), that\u0027s when 6 science points are really nice to get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother EDIT: yes, 180% is way too much money, but it also allows me to fail from time to time and let some kerbals \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Ehave terrible accidents. I can\u0027t really play without reverting/quicksaving (minor staging mistakes forced me to restart so many careers), but the temptation to revert a disastrous landing is hard to avoid. When you have the money to afford it without loosing your entire career, it\u0027s more fun to claim Ronvin\u0027s tragic disaster when landing on the Mun was caused by a nearby anomaly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-06T18:31:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2015 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Musil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T19:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Musil: There is a mod on kerbalstuff, which does more intelligent auto-staging, I will add it to the recommended mods for seti.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/398/SmartStage\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESmart Stage\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-06T19:45:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2015 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yemo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Musil","CreatedById":132791,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T20:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yemo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Yemo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@Musil: There is a mod on kerbalstuff, which does more intelligent auto-staging, I will add it to the recommended mods for seti.\u003Cp\u003Eedit: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/398/SmartStage\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESmart Stage\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I have seen it.
