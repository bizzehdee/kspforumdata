I\u0027m gonna get straight to the point: I ran a small interplanetary craft into Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. The problem? There was nowhere near enough fuel for capture! I ran out of delta-v about a quarter through capture, and that\u0027s not even counting landing. So, here comes Bill. I started having him burn retrograde with his jetpack, and I wondered: Can I actually save him? I got him to around an aerobraking periapsis and his orbit came to a close. I thought he was gonna make it!\u00A0\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229KmAwRu.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/9KmAwRu.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\nAbove is when I started documenting.

I was landing on the equivalent of Moho in the early game(don\u0027t ask me why) and I realized I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to return after landing. So I decided to land. The lander quickly ran out of fuel, and I was forced to jetpack down to the surface. But I made it!
