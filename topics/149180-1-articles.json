We have a science point grind which drives a very basic tech tree mechanic and a mini-quest generator which lets you grind for funds. Then we have an almost entirely pointless crew experience mechanism with some not very logical rewards and a bare bones base-upgrade mechanic. The way the tech tree is set up doesn\u0027t give you a great many options for gathering science and most of those options are dependent on building upgrades or are sufficiently far down the tech tree to be essentially irrelevant. Combine those two factors and you end up with very linear gameplay that you have to try really hard to break away from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nThere\u0027s been a lot of effort put into simplifying the game mechanics because complex game mechanics\u00A0were deemed not to be fun.

I\u0027m thinking more of Sid Meier\u0027s Alpha Centauri which has story elements and distinct characters\u00A0woven through it whilst still remaining a pretty\u00A0open ended strategy game. The kerbals on the other hand are just the same old green, googly eyed rocket fodder that they\u0027ve always been. We know nothing about them, we\u0027re given no reason to care about them, either collectively or individually, there\u0027s no worldbuilding at all to speak of.

The overarching objective is (duh) build a city. How big and what style is up to the player of course but at the end of the day you\u0027re still building some kind of a city. If the game is going to last any length of time you really\u00A0need to take that\u00A0one step further - the overarching objective is to build a financially sustainable city. All the various buildings you plop down (and spend money on) contribute to that objective in a more-or-less efficient way depending on player skill. If you don\u0027t develop a certain level of efficiency then the game ends because you go bust - hence the game includes planning elements too. Granted, SimCity doesn\u0027t include any \u0027complete objectives for money\u0027 elements although making money is certainly an objective in itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI presume the same is roughly true of say, Rollercoaster Tycoon but feel free to correct me if I\u0027m wrong.

This is one of the reasons that a friend of mine will not play KSP... there\u0027s no way to \u0022win.\u0022 There is no overarching objective that the game provides to drive the player forward, that is something that the player has to provide for themselves. While KSP does provide contracts which provide some challenges, many of the contracts will feel rather \u0022grindy\u0022 after a while as you say. But if you play KSP strictly relying on the contract system for purpose, you will be disappointed as it appears you already are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP invites the player to push themselves... some of my fondest memories of KSP were way back in version 0.18 when I first started playing. There were no contracts, it was just one big sandbox. I challenged myself to go to the Mun before I had a good idea of the fuel requirements. This resulted in a landing with barely any fuel left, and a stranded Jeb on the surface. For some unknown reason, I cared about what happened to my goofy looking little green astronauts, and suddenly I had created a new mission for myself: \u0022Bring Jeb Home!\u0022 So I designed a rescue craft, bigger and better than the vehicle than landed Jeb. It was a success (barely) and Jeb was returned home safely with Bill and Bob to thank for his rescue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat little story is a microcosm of the appeal of KSP to me... the ability to make your own vehicles, missions, and challenges. That is the \u0022purpose\u0022 of KSP... the constant asking of \u0022Hey, what if I did this...\u0022 and challenging yourself. Many people will struggle with this as most video games will force feed the player the \u0022purpose,\u0022 to the point where there is little left for the imagination or independent thought. KSP and other games that require an artistic, intentional, or imaginative mind simply will not appeal to everyone, which is really a shame given how much KSP offers in its current form. Sometimes I wonder if more people would be interested if there was a \u0022space race\u0022 aspect to the game... two continents on Kerbin competing with one another. Such competition will appeal to different people and possibly draw them into the game more. With this in mind... your sense of purpose may come in the form of multiplayer when SQUAD implements it. Until then I encourage you to find your own sense of purpose in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I do agree with you that the game has untapped potential, but if past plans are any indication, I am confident that the Devs will integrate content that will add depth, variety, and challenge. I am hoping that the Kerbol system will be more fully fleshed out not just with more celestial bodies to explore, but also more reasons to explore them... and more environmental dangers to have to prepare for. I am certain that KSP will continue to grow for a long time, onward and upward so to say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-03T18:26:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2016 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Justicier\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T18:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222785628\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149180\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475518224\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139580\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MailletC\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, MailletC said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I understand it, once the tech tree has been fully researched, that is the point you have technically \u0022won\u0022 the game, as there is no longer any reason to go anywhere to collect science.

Launch your first ship, escape the atmo, orbit Kerbin... Ok, you do those and suddenly you are bombarded with a million \u0027test this part\u0027 or \u0027get a temp here\u0027 or \u0027get so much ore from Mun\u0027. You do those and suddenly it\u0027s a repeat of the same 4 or 5 goals, just a different distance or from a different body. Once you get to the Mun the only real challenge (if you want to call it that) is adjusting your ascending/descending node to get to Minmus. Ok, great. Now what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther planetary bodies? Sure, just add more fuel and a bigger candle... done.

You can go back and start a harder career mode but that is simply overcome by driving around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E until you can get to Minmus and then the science tree is pretty much done...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game is missing depth. It has so much potential that is just sitting idly by... rotting. There is no story, there are giant worlds of varying sizes with nothing more to do on them than find the handful of Squad monoliths and \u0027anomalies\u0027 such as the arch on the Mun.

Not to say that there aren\u0027t great mods. There are, absolutely. However, none of them really go all the way on the story idea. Yeah, you can sandbox it and pretend but why start up the game in the first place if you just want to imagine doing things.
