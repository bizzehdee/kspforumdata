Personally, I\u0027ve always thought it silly that the game gives you absolutely zero knowledge about the other planets, not even maps and rough biome maps. So, instant scanning? Given that the orbital scanner is so vague, I see it as no more than an abstraction of centuries of ground-based observations you should really already know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI haven\u0027t tried Karbonite, but I have lots of experience with Kethane.\u003Cp\u003EYou had to \u003Cstrong\u003Ework and think\u003C/strong\u003E to get Kethane\u0027s resource map.

And I submit that with Kethane, scanning was both highly unrealistic (no beam spread regardless of altitude) and horrible, horrible torture for the player. There was no working or thinking involved, you just did the trivial task of putting yourself in the proper orbit that you already knew well in advance, and then you had to sit there for hours and hours due to the inability of the scanners to work at high warps and having to keep focus on that ship or the scanners wouldn\u0027t work at all. Scanning for Kethane was the exact opposite of fun and engaging gameplay. I\u0027d rather gouge my eyes out with a fork, and that way of scanning needs to be knocked in the head and buried in an unmarked grave at midnight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite has 2 ways to scan. If you just use its own scanner, you don\u0027t get much useful info. You can see the whole hemisphere below you immediately but the resolution is quite low and it fades away as the satellite moves. OTOH, you could use SCANsat, which gives you exact info but requires flying over the whole surface. Again, getting into the right orbit for that is trivial and the scanning takes time, but at least it works at all warp speeds and you can go fly other ships while you wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI much prefer Karbonite to Kethane for this reason above all others. Plus, Kethane distributions are arbitary, taking no account of the terrain, so on Laythe it\u0027s pretty much all uselessly under the ocean. Karbonite, however, is based on the terrain. Kethane is available only in relatively small quantities and can be used up, so is really only good at supporting small-scale exploration trips. Karbonite, OTOH, is available in unlmited amounts so can support truly industrial consumption for large, permanent colonies and bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in either case, scanning is a doddle to set up--it\u0027s just a question of the player\u0027s time, not his effort. The proper orbital parameters are well-known, or can be calculated or even derived experimentally without too much effort. And in both cases, the scanning process is just a hurdle on the path to actually extracting and using the resources, which is the whole point of having resources at all. Everybody tries to minimize the time and effort needed to do it so they can get on with what they really want to do in the game. So the sooner we can get to the exploitation phase, the better IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
