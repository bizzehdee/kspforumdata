My first stream was on KSPTV, so I was rushing myself to just land on the Mun anywhere that had a hint of a resource deposit. It turned out that the landing site had a 2% yeild and the drills kept overheating. This took a loooong time to extract the ore. However, on my own personal stream last night we captured and drilled an asteroid that had 90% yield, and this was SUPER quick (we\u0027re talking seconds!) to fill the tanks. I had four gigantor solar panels and the drills (which were both shaded and cooled by the solar panels) didn\u0027t overheat at all (we timewarped to test).

Totally unrealistic.\n\nBut OTOH, don\u0027t forget that Kerbals have been observing all their neighboring planets for centuries with telescopes, spectrometers, and all that, so they already have a pretty good idea of what the surfaces of planets are made of even before they send a probe there, same as we do in real life. Personally, I\u0027ve always thought it silly that the game gives you absolutely zero knowledge about the other planets, not even maps and rough biome maps. So, instant scanning? Given that the orbital scanner is so vague, I see it as no more than an abstraction of centuries of ground-based observations you should really already know.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I haven\u0027t tried Karbonite, but I have lots of experience with Kethane.\n\u003E You had to **work and think** to get Kethane\u0027s resource map. You had to take into consideration your *orbital period*, *inclination*, *rotational period of the body* you\u0027re orbiting and your *orbital height*.\n\nI\u0027ve used both Kethane and Karbonite quite extensively--all my career games have revolved around one or the other (see various \u0022Kethane/Karbonite Travelling Circus\u0022 threads in the mission report forum). And I submit that with Kethane, scanning was both highly unrealistic (no beam spread regardless of altitude) and horrible, horrible torture for the player. There was no working or thinking involved, you just did the trivial task of putting yourself in the proper orbit that you already knew well in advance, and then you had to sit there for hours and hours due to the inability of the scanners to work at high warps and having to keep focus on that ship or the scanners wouldn\u0027t work at all. Scanning for Kethane was the exact opposite of fun and engaging gameplay. I\u0027d rather gouge my eyes out with a fork, and that way of scanning needs to be knocked in the head and buried in an unmarked grave at midnight.\n\nKarbonite has 2 ways to scan. If you just use its own scanner, you don\u0027t get much useful info. You can see the whole hemisphere below you immediately but the resolution is quite low and it fades away as the satellite moves. OTOH, you could use SCANsat, which gives you exact info but requires flying over the whole surface. Again, getting into the right orbit for that is trivial and the scanning takes time, but at least it works at all warp speeds and you can go fly other ships while you wait.\n\nI much prefer Karbonite to Kethane for this reason above all others. Plus, Kethane distributions are arbitary, taking no account of the terrain, so on Laythe it\u0027s pretty much all uselessly under the ocean. Karbonite, however, is based on the terrain. Kethane is available only in relatively small quantities and can be used up, so is really only good at supporting small-scale exploration trips. Karbonite, OTOH, is available in unlmited amounts so can support truly industrial consumption for large, permanent colonies and bases.\n\nBut in either case, scanning is a doddle to set up--it\u0027s just a question of the player\u0027s time, not his effort. The proper orbital parameters are well-known, or can be calculated or even derived experimentally without too much effort. And in both cases, the scanning process is just a hurdle on the path to actually extracting and using the resources, which is the whole point of having resources at all. Everybody tries to minimize the time and effort needed to do it so they can get on with what they really want to do in the game. So the sooner we can get to the exploitation phase, the better IMHO."}]}
