The mission either ended in failure or I didn\u0027t have a 0inclination orbit. I then decided to see what the MechJeb autopilot controls were like. MechJeb pretty much did all the work from lift-off, to stabilizing orbit, to rendezvousing with the space station. I didn\u0027t have to do anything except build the ship and input some data into MechJeb. So what\u0027s the point?

If you want a slightly more realistic autopilot system try out Progcom and program your own flight instructions for every mission. Space agencies do not just download a program off the internet and hit go and watch as their rocket magically gets to orbit. Not to mention that real space agencies are dealing with rockets worth millions of real dollars, real human lives, precious cargo, sometimes years of planning and their funding (Disasters means bad PR which means less funding and popularity). It is incredibly important for them that nothing goes wrong. But KSP? Not so much, you can just revert your flight and it\u0027ll be like nothing ever happened and there is no negative effects to failing a mission anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is also a poor learning aid for several reasons, the greatest example being that it doesn\u0027t actually teach you anything. You might copy it when it does say, a gravity turn. But you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing or why you\u0027re doing it. You\u0027re just copying what mechjeb did. The only way to truly learn is to look into it yourself. No to mention that people have a tendency of never letting go of mechjeb and just using it as a crutch as evidenced on a certain person\u0027s stream (I\u0027m not going to name anyone). He claimed all day that he could do all of these tasks, but when he actually came to try he just couldn\u0027t do it. Maybe in the past he could, but he obviously forgot how because he has grown to be so dependent on mechjeb. This is why you shouldn\u0027t advocate the use of mechjeb as a learning aid, rather you should encourage people to actually play the game and figure out these things for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, yeah, it\u0027s a singleplayer sandbox and you are fully entitled to do whatever you want, and I\u0027m not going to hate you just because you choose to use mechjeb. Just don\u0027t forget that everyone is also entitled to their opinion of you and mechjeb.
