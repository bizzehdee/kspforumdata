I got a temperature scan contract for Gilly and one of the parts needed me to scan near a point above 6400m which turns out to be in high space over Gilly so you can\u0027t log the temperature. It\u0027s the one in the middle for 7-EKS. I was in the area and only just above 6400m. Looks like the contract parameters might need a little extra tweaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m posting it here as it is a stock contract with parameters outside stock planetary ranges rather than an actual bug per se, please move to modded installs if that is the right place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a screenshot, sorry for the huge size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qOV9sR7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qOV9sR7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : Just checked and the highest I can get and still be in space near gilly is 5999m\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T22:57:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 10:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T22:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s a bug, Arsonide knows, for now though all we can do is use the debug menu to complete the contract, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T21:48:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T23:23:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool.
