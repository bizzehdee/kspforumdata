I got a temperature scan contract for Gilly and one of the parts needed me to scan near a point above 6400m which turns out to be in high space over Gilly so you can\u0027t log the temperature. It\u0027s the one in the middle for 7-EKS. I was in the area and only just above 6400m. Looks like the contract parameters might need a little extra tweaking.\n\nI\u0027m posting it here as it is a stock contract with parameters outside stock planetary ranges rather than an actual bug per se, please move to modded installs if that is the right place. \n\nHere is a screenshot, sorry for the huge size.\n\n![qOV9sR7.png](http://i.imgur.com/qOV9sR7.png)\n\nEDIT : Just checked and the highest I can get and still be in space near gilly is 5999m\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T22:57:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 10:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by John FX**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T22:47:20Z","Content":"Yeah, it\u0027s a bug, Arsonide knows, for now though all we can do is use the debug menu to complete the contract, sorry.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T21:48:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T23:23:02Z","Content":"Cool. As long as it is known. Didn\u0027t think of using the debug menu, was going to RP it as a less than competent mission control.\n\nI\u0027ll be aware now that 6km is the max on Gilly so I\u0027ll decline those.\n\nThank you Sal."}]}
