(You *can* stage in physics timewarp, which is the 2x, 3x, 4x mode you get inside an atmosphere.)\n- Does pressing Alt\u002BL change the staging light color/behavior, or is really nothing happening at all?\n- Do you have an input lock? Press Alt\u002BF12 to open the debug menu, go to input locks, and press the clear button. See if anything changes after that.\n- Do you actually still have a stage remaining that could trigger? You may want your spacecraft to separate, but if you didn\u0027t correctly configure it in the editor...\n- Does anything change if you quicksave (F5) and reload (F9)?\n- Are you running any mods?"}]}
