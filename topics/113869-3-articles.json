The topic of \u0022breaking old game saves\u0022 is probably in the top 5 common complaints for new game releases. It really should have been found before 1.0.3 came out.\u003Cp\u003EIf Squad want to be taken seriously by the big-wigs of PlayStation 4 (and good grief those are some seriously big wigs!) then they would do very well to tighten up their internal testing procedures. I know a fair amount about software development and release (business software and not games admittedly) and customer perception is not just a bullet-point on some consultant\u0027s slideshow, especially when there\u0027s some serious money on the table. PS4 could be the big break that squad deserve, since it brings the game to the attention of a whole new audience. I want them to do well. Releasing the game twice in a day makes the developer look like amateurs (and I no doubt suspect that Squad are embarrassed every time this happens).

How about coming off your high horse just a bit. I\u0027d be happy to point out the insanely large number of big name titles from major developers that were released buggy on consoles, that required after the fact patches immediately after release. Destiny, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Dragon Age: Inquisition, GTA5, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, just to name a few. Don\u0027t even get started on Battlefield 4, which was a buggy mess for MONTHS after release, even though you could spend over $120 out of the gate for all the Day 1 DLC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it have been nice if this one bug got caught before release?
