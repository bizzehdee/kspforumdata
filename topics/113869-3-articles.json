DVDs are expensive to stamp out you know ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E ?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The criticism is for the lack of basic testing, not for the hotfix. The topic of \u0022breaking old game saves\u0022 is probably in the top 5 common complaints for new game releases. It really should have been found before 1.0.3 came out.\n\u003E If Squad want to be taken seriously by the big-wigs of PlayStation 4 (and good grief those are some seriously big wigs!) then they would do very well to tighten up their internal testing procedures. I know a fair amount about software development and release (business software and not games admittedly) and customer perception is not just a bullet-point on some consultant\u0027s slideshow, especially when there\u0027s some serious money on the table. PS4 could be the big break that squad deserve, since it brings the game to the attention of a whole new audience. I want them to do well. Releasing the game twice in a day makes the developer look like amateurs (and I no doubt suspect that Squad are embarrassed every time this happens). I know, I\u0027ve been there more times than I would want to admit.\n\u003E \n\u003E I adore KSP (1500 hours in 12 months, it\u0027s an illness), and Squad can do no wrong as far as the game is concerned in my eyes, but I\u0027ve had more than my own fair share of rushed releases and panicked hotfixes to know that it is always better to delay a release and *get it right.*\n\u003E \n\u003E *An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.*\n\nWow Wossname. How about coming off your high horse just a bit. I\u0027d be happy to point out the insanely large number of big name titles from major developers that were released buggy on consoles, that required after the fact patches immediately after release. Destiny, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Dragon Age: Inquisition, GTA5, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, just to name a few. Don\u0027t even get started on Battlefield 4, which was a buggy mess for MONTHS after release, even though you could spend over $120 out of the gate for all the Day 1 DLC.\n\nWould it have been nice if this one bug got caught before release? Sure. But given the open nature of ship construction in KSP I can understand how it could have been missed.\n\nThanks Squad for a quick patch."},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:40:19Z","Content":"Is it just me or did some posts disappear?"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:44:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks guys but are we just beta testers for the PS4 community?

Either in the background, if it\u0027s asleep (or running) and will automatically update if you attempt to run a title if it has been completely powered off.\n\nThe argument that updates have to be tightened up for console, is silly. It\u0027s based on assumption.\n\nThe only negative for a rapid update cycle is the impact on a mod community that will sometimes have to recompile mod code, even if KSP had a 2 line fix applied in source requiring absolutely no changes in mod code.\n\nThis is \u0022better update cycle, because they are all different\u0022 argument redundant on any platform, however, that doesn\u0027t support third party addons; in any case the argument that fixing issues in rapid succession is automatically somehow bad, is flawed. \n\nRather it is the knock on effect that is likely more relevant to people, either mod\u0027s or game-save impact.\n\nThe only issue I have is the notion that \u0022only update if you experience the bug\u0022 is an unfortunate choice of phrasing. No the new version should be used because that is now the current release, that people will expect mod\u0027s to run on.\n\nOptional updates should die in a fire.
