Before they used to just release the rocket but now they explode. Anyone else noticed anything similar in their games? I have the Steam version of the game. Has there been a sneaky patch that has caused this or is it fuel lines/struts etc getting caught up in them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T08:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou must have one of Romfarer\u0027s mods.
