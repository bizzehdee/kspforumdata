I need to be able to use docking ports to fully connect the base together. My only problem is i don\u0027t know how to tell the orientation of the docking port. Before you assume that\u0027s it\u0027s the normal question on docking ports, I can assure you it\u0027s not. I CAN GET THEM TO CONNECT. My issue is that they spin to connect and then the connect parts are not in the correct orientation. e.g. my hallways have the windows facing the ground. How can I tell on the docking port that it will connect correctly and leave the windows of the hallways on the sides instead of rotating?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-19T17:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormal docking ports should not spin the vehicle when docking.\u00A0 They don\u0027t care about orientation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using the Konstruction! docking ports with the rotation snap on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome screenshots, or better yet, a screen capture of what you\u0027re dealing with would be very helpful.\u00A0 If normal docking ports are spinning your vehicles, then there\u0027s a clipping/collider problem (which are basically invisible) or some other bug going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superhero34x","CreatedById":197529,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-19T18:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese were problems I was having a while ago and havent currently tried in my current game.

When I got the rotational energy completed diminished by using some wheels (derped) they actually matched up just fine without spinning!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
