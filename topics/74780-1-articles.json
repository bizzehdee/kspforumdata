To that end, it needed to be able to carry 3 crew plus the pilot. Having used rockets in the past with the hitchhiker module for crew movement, I wanted to avoid the hitchhiker if I possibly could. This is the craft I ended up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can get to Kerbin orbit following a standard SSTO ascent profile, but doesn\u0027t carry an abundance of fuel so will be a test for anyone who tends to fly inefficiently. The changing CofG as the fuel is used up tends to make it a bit pitch sensitive. I haven\u0027t found this to be a problem on the way up, but you need to be gentle on the elevator when returning if you want to avoid flipping it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction keys are simple; 1 toggles the rocket engine and 2 toggles the jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/shut01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022shut01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/shut02.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022shut02.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/shut03.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022shut03.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/shut04.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022shut04.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/dl6mtjeglprmkhr/Crew%20shuttle.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECrew Shuttle craft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-13T13:36:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2014 01:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb Cubed","CreatedById":70444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T18:18:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks a bit like something vaos would make.
