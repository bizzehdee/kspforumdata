The chart says this will take 310 m/s to get into a 14km circular orbit (we can therefore work backwards and understand that the flyby periapsis the chart had in mind was also 14 km).\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, to land at the mun takes about 580 m/s.\u00A0 This is a little higher than the amount of orbital velocity you need to shed, again because of gravity losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you add these all up, the chart says you\u0027ll need (3400\u002B860\u002B310\u002B580) = 5,150 m/s of delta-v on the pad in order to land on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the return trip (if there is one... sorry kerbals), you can just reverse the numbers, because the maneuvers are symmetrical.\u00A0 The one exception is on planets with atmospheres.\u00A0 As you probably know, you don\u0027t need to spend delta-v landing at Kerbin (beyond a small deorbit burn), since the atmosphere soaks up that energy for you.\u00A0 The chart denotes this with the little triangle pointing the way you can use aerobraking (i.e, to reenter Kerbin, but not to leave).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-04T14:29:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2019 02:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aegolius13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-04T12:06:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223629249\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186048\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221562215038\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165625\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aegolius13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Aegolius13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(we can therefore work backwards and understand that the flyby periapsis the chart had in mind was also 14 \u003Cstrong\u003Ekm\u003C/strong\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNicely explained, tiny typo correction for you\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-04T13:02:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a good question, and has a great answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-04T15:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStep 1 -
