The first flight, with Val at the controls, I managed to get up to 11,000 meters and a bit and then hit Mach 1 (just about) in a dive afterwards (which I am [I]pretty[/I] sure the real U-2 couldn\u0026#39;t possibly do), then flew over and landed on the KSC runway, which I have never done before (admittedly, MechJeb\u0026#39;s auto land did [I]most[/I] of the work, but I had to take control at the last minute because otherwise the dang thing would fly the plane straight into the runway. Hands-off it is not. That\u0026#39;s beside the fact that it had a strong tendency towards phugoid oscillations during the whole flight back, which I thought was peculiar). On the whole, I was pretty pleased with myself, because this is not impossibly far off from the real U-2\u0026#39;s performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[I]Then[/I] I decided to tweak the design to see how high I could go with a single Wheesly. I extended the wing and cut the amount of fuel onboard by half since it had provided a mission duration much longer than I needed to set an altitude record. Those modifications let Jeb reach 13,000 and a bit meters, almost 14,000, which was pretty nice.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe real fun came when I tried to descend, though. I attempted to combine the dive with a 180 degree turn back towards KSC, but instead of smoothly turning, the airplane went into a flat spin! Fortunately, SAS recovered it after a few moments, but then I tried to continue turning (now at a significantly lower altitude), and it started spinning again! That one elicited an \u0022Oh, ....!\u0022 from me, but once again SAS saved the day, and afterwards I had no more major problems (aside from clipping one of the outer wing panels off on landing). I was pretty impressed that you could actually have flat spins occur nowadays, though.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIncidentally, I was ultimately able to achieve an altitude of 14,725 meters on a fourth test flight (also flown by Val) by further reducing the amount of gas in the tanks and shortening the wing. As this was just 200 meters higher than my third flight, though, I think this is about how far you can push the design without putting in a turbojet instead of the turbofan, and it has an endurance of only 10 minutes or so with so little fuel on board.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T01:16:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 01:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Workable Goblin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T01:42:18Z","Content":"\nBuilt an early career Science and Exploration aircraft with short takeoff and landing capabilities and a cruise speed of 250 m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/crafts/7307\u0022][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/1LmRENE.png[/IMG][/URL]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T02:00:42Z","Content":"\nThis bug is getting old... really, really old...
