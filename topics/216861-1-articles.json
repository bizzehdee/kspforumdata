Even when I rotate the camera, the zoom levels are set relative to the focus point distance to the camera position so I can very quickly zoom too far in or so far out that I can\u0027t get any extra information. I\u0027ve found this to be the case in both KSP 1 and 2. I think that having the ability to focus the camera on a specific point in an orbit (rather than a celestial body or vehicle) would be a great feature. Perhaps a center-mouse click on a point in the orbit to focus the camera? Has this been a problem for anyone else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
