Namely, I want to know precisely how the lab determines a value multiplier depending on its location. Does it simply read out the celestial body multipliers? And if so, does that indeed mean that a lab \u0022high in space above \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022 generates less data from the same experiment than a lab \u0022low in space above \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022... except for Kerbin, where it\u0027s reversed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of the descriptions I\u0027ve seen only make a difference between being generically \u0022in orbit\u0022 or generically \u0022on the surface\u0022. Since there is even the potential for \u0022splashed down\u0022 and \u0022landed\u0022 multipliers to be different (Kerbin does it!), that means that either the lab does not in fact examine the celestial body multiplier and has its own, less granular list of destination values somewhere... OR, said descriptions are oversimplifying the way it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo which of the two is it? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s odd - I was sure I answered this question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMust have been another thread. \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EParticularly since I want this thread to die since almost all of the info in the first nine pages is obsolete\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E. Hmm, maybe I should try and emphasise that last line a bit more... ; )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeriously though, I did test this since I have a few labs moving around the Jool, Duna, Eve and Kerbin systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nthe original* science value of the experiment determines, precisely, its \u0022data value\u0022 for the lab\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nif you are \u0022landed\u0022, you get a 10% bonus. There is no other location-based difference that I know of. I would assume that \u0022splashed down\u0022 counts as landed but I haven\u0027t tested.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nif you are within the SOI of the body where you picked up the data, you get a 25% bonus when you add it to the lab.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I would say that planet reordering won\u0027t change anything other than removing that 25% bonus if the experiment is no longer marked as coming from the SOI where your lab is located.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* edit: the \u0022original\u0022 science value is the value of that experiment the first time you do it. So a gravity scan in space just above a biome over Minmus, for example, would be worth 80 science points =\u0026gt; 100 data if lab is in orbit or =\u0026gt; 110 data if the lab is landed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-23T14:33:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2016 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-23T15:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAaaah, I see!

To be efficient, you need to send your scientist to plant flags on the Mun and Minmus, bring him/her home, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E send him/her back up to the MPL to get a decent return.

It provides \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ean alternative route\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E for dedicating time and effort, it doesn\u0027t take away the need for some time and effort (or at least, planning and execution).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in any event, the only people who really can benefit from \u0022non-grind\u0022 are those that are willing to warp forwards for years between missions. And they must be willing to do that after having done all the missions they needed to get the MPL to start with. A couple of quick missions to Ike and Gilly, not even visiting all the biomes, would also fill out the entire tech tree at that point so you could just as well claim that interplanetary travel is OP if you\u0027re willing to warp enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2) The MPL is absolutely not useless and over-powered for people who like mining science\u003C/strong\u003E, because it adds a further benefit to industrious science-mining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- mining science involves training up scientists to do it best, and once trained they have a place to \u0022hang out\u0022 between missions, paying back the efforts made to train them,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- it can\u0027t be overpowered if you\u0027re seriously mining science, because by the time you get any significant return from the MPL your tech tree will be virtually maxed out, therefore it can\u0027t have changed your own personal style of play prior to that time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while I hear you where you say you find it OP and useless, I still don\u0027t understand why. In particular, I cannot imagine a point in time when you could have unlocked the MPL and then suddely found that your science-mining gameplay was being overshadowed by the science points you were getting from the MPL. I can understand you looking at the specs on paper and \u003Cem\u003Ethinking\u003C/em\u003E that, but not actually \u003Cem\u003Efinding\u003C/em\u003E that in real use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use MPLs all the time, from the time they can be unlocked. And I find that the vast majority of the tech tree is unlocked without a single \u0022OP\u0022 data-derived science point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3) \u0022Repeatability\u0022 is not an overpowered aspect of the MPL in-game\u003C/strong\u003E. This is because the repeatability of earning science points from experiments requires multiple MPLs and also multiple scientists and/or massive time warping and/or multiple stops at different moons and/or multiple repeats of missions you\u0027ve done in early career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo by the time you get around to using multiple copies of experiments to get science points, you no longer actually need the science, and they in fact become a way of ensuring a constant revenue stream to fund your exorbitant projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for all these reasons, I cannot quite fathom how anyone could consider the lab to be overpowered and/or useless. It can\u0027t fundamentally change gameplay (unless you\u0027re desperately wanting to stop science-gathering missions... in which case one may wonder why you chose to play career to start with). It cannot compete with science-mining from missions, especially if you tend to have a bunch of missions on the go at the same time. And it doesn\u0027t provide something for nothing since optimal use of the MPL requires good planning and skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strollen","CreatedById":142693,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T05:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222463386\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022105811\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458342042\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/18/2016 at 1:00 PM, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the issue here is basically one of \u0022different players have different playstyles\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example:\u00A0 Personally, I agree with you.\u00A0 I don\u0027t like that it provides potentially infinite science, and personally consider the science lab to be a game-breaker, for my own play.\u00A0 But it\u0027s not as if that ruins KSP for me-- I simply don\u0027t use the lab at all.\u00A0 The only time it ever pops up is if I have to launch a base or a station with \u0022have a science lab\u0022 as a requirement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand:\u00A0 there are plenty of players for whom science is a grind, who would like the challenge of career and don\u0027t want to play sandbox.\u00A0 Those are players who \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewant\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E science to be easy so they can spend more of their play time doing other things that they like better.\u00A0 The science lab is designed to be a way to give those players an option for not having to grind science so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe goal (make lots of different players with different playstyles able to enjoy the game) is a good one.\u00A0 Is the implementation good (i.e. is this science lab behavior the \u0022right idea\u0022)?\u00A0 Well, that\u0027s a matter of personal opinion, I suppose.\u00A0 It\u0027s a really hard problem to solve, from a game-design perspective.\u00A0 I\u0027m not super fond of the current science lab mechanic myself... but I\u0027m not inclined to kvetch because I don\u0027t think I should complain unless I can propose something better, and I\u0027m hard-pressed to think of one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot a better idea?\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:1432px;margin-top:266px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv title=\u0022Found 1 error in text\u0022\u003E\n1\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like the MPL, and I think it is possible to use them and not exploit them, all you have to do is not go crazy with time warp. \u00A0I am playing at Hard career level (with a slight boost to income),so without any revert to mission reloads I end up having to pay for all my rockets that go boom. \u00A0I also have reduced science and contract income, and significantly more expensive upgrades, it is a challenge to pay for everything. \u00A0The final upgrade on the R\u0026amp;D lab is 3.500K and I only have $1.500K. \u00A0So I don\u0027t have funds to launch science only trips to Mun, and Minmus. Not to mention since Jeb died on Mun, I\u0027d rather user safer unmanned landers despite them only yielding \u00A0half the science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt cost like 75K to launch a space station, and much of the cost is associated with the getting the heavy MPL labs into orbit around various objects., \u00A0so it seems silly not to utilize them. Right now I have four polar stations around Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, and Kerbol which is on the way to Duna. \u00A0Mun and Minmus have 2 stars scientist and the others 1 star. \u00A0I have lots of ships active so I rarely warp more than a day at a time. \u00A0About once a week I transmit science and get 40 science from the 2 stars, 20 from Kerbol and only 10 from Kerbin. \u00A0The Kerbin station is only 1/2 full of science experiments, so I\u0027ve made several not always successful attempts to add more science experiments to it \u00A0\u00A0The science absolutely adds up, but it takes more than a month worth of 4 labs to equal one manned mission to Minumus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find that much of my career is devoted to the care and feeding of the science labs. A Kerbin base expansion contract, cool I can add the \u00A0Atmosphere fluid instrument, add tundra and ice cap biomes and also add more science to the MPL. Base expansion for Minmus,\u00A0a good excuse to include the new orbital \u00A0survey for future mining operations to my base.. I have landers on both Mun and Minmus and I periodically send them down to the surface, so that I don\u0027t run out of science for the lab \u00A0 I also use tourist spacecraft as a way of shuttling experiments from the science stations back to Kerbin. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, I think the labs adds a lot element of realism to the career mode. \u00A0I think without that added emphasis on gaining more science, \u00A0adding or expanding orbital stations \u00A0just another fairly lucrative way of making money . Without actively\u00A0MPL I doubt I\u0027d need nearly the number of Kerbals in my space program. I can easily imagine setting up another science base on or in orbit are Ike. but I\u0027m out of scientists, and don\u0027t have spare 500K to recruit a new scientist. so that makes me excited to get more rescue missions. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to focus on making money. I expect that by the time I make another 2 million to upgrade my R\u0026amp;D, I\u0027ll also get enough science to need the upgrade. \u00A0My science labs, will probably account for roughly as much science as I gain from exploring Duna and Ike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong term, I expect to complete the tech tree, and then probably stop playing Kerbal for a while.
