Remember my (what I\u0027m now calling) Kojourner mission? Probably not. Anyway I put a SCANSat probe in orbit with a small rover attached, plotted out the anomaly I wanted to go see, and dropped the rover. Well then I lost my bearings and was kind of sort of aimlessly heading in the right direction. The rover wasn\u0027t big enough to add a BTDT, and the probe can only see the rover and anomaly on two different maps (stock and SCANSat map). So in my frustration I got the bright idea to (gently) crash the probe into the surface near the anomaly and use that as a point of reference while still hopefully functional enough to show me the map. That turned out to be a very bad idea, which I realized as I careened into the surface at about 650m/s due to a severely underpowered engine. So I sighed heavily and loaded a save, and now I\u0027m trying to calculate where I should be based on longitude and latitude of the rover vs the anomaly, and *supposedly* it\u0027s directly north of me. I hope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t care too much about this mission before but with .25 rapidly approaching I\u0027d like to go ahead and wrap it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill kinda far away though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-09-2701-25-52-16.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-09-2701-25-52-16.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit again: I\u0027m not going to spoil the spoiler too bad even though everyone probably knows what it is... But I\u0027m almost to the objective and I\u0027m working on a followup mission now, manned. I have sent a transfer ship with a Kethane scanner, and a lander / crane with a rover on it. The rover has assorted science equipment and also a winch for towing capabilities -- It will pull a \u0022Kethane Trailer\u0022 to be sent by probe during phase 2 of this mission, which can drill, store, and refine Kethane as well as store fuel, in relatively small amounts of course. It\u0027ll be perfect for refueling the lander crane for phase 3 when I start to drop base supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander crane rover assembly had some extra fuel in the ascent stage since I pretty much use the same setup to lift everything right now (lazy) so this is the messed up docking procedure. I disconnected the lander (which was upside down) from the ascent stage, turned it around and docked with the transfer ship, and KAS piped the lander to the ascent stage to transfer the remaining fuel. I can probably make it on what I have, but I\u0027d like to still stop by my Minmus depot to top up and be sure. And yes those are drop tanks on the transfer ship because it\u0027s carrying a little more weight than I intended.
