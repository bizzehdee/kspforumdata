One of my first jobs in Games was optimizing a game recently ported from PC to run at a reasonable framerate on XB1 and sacrifices had to be made. That was soon after the XB1 and PS4 released. The 1X/Pro versions have better CPUs, of course, but they are still garbage by modern standards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of rendering, the terrain tech we\u0027ve seen demonstrated might strain the GPUs on XB1/PS4, but it should be runnable. So the only real concern is the CPU performance. Yes, KSP2 is reportedly much better optimized, but it\u0027s also doing so much more. Additional computations for continuous collision detection, larger structures - even if things like space stations won\u0027t be simulated, that\u0027s still a lot of additional collision geometry to process, all of the resource and route logic, better physics warp - because you have to for interstellar, and so on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd Intercept isn\u0027t a very big team. It\u0027s not like Rockstar throwing bodies to get GTA V to run on PS3/360. Intercpet just has enough people to make the game. So I have serious concerns about the game being able to run smoothly on Gen8 consoles. Given that KSP2 is only expected to come out later in \u002722, and by that point we\u0027ll be coming up on 2 years into Gen9, Intercept and PD might chose not to bother with getting the game to run on the older consoles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if we don\u0027t see KSP2 on PS4/XB1 or if it\u0027s a cropped down port, possibly, managed by a 3rd party developer on behalf of Intercept and Private Division.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asap1","CreatedById":209758,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-21T15:09:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell before any of that happens let\u0027s hope we see the release of 1.12 and 1.11 on console cus they are 2 major updates behind pc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhave not been able to find any useful information on blitworks page(there the company responsible for porting over ksp from pc to console)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave1904","CreatedById":153882,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-22T16:09:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t expect modern games to run good\u00A0on 10 year old hardware by the time KSP is released.\u00A0That goes for the pc playerbase that think KSP2 should run on a duo core laptop with 1gb of ram too.
