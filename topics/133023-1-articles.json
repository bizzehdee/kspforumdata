At first i thought i had squished one of my housecats, but when i looked at it it was my own hand, completely numb and twitching. (it stopped squirming when it surfaced.) My first instinct was to grab it with my other hand and slam it into the ground near my bed and that did the trick i think, i got some control over it. I think it has something to do with sleeping on it because it was cold and out of circulation, and i got more control as the circulation returned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-27T08:01:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2016 08:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Souper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T08:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPartial sleep paralysis?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-27T12:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably nerves misfiring due to lack of fresh oxygen and\\or being squeezed under your body.
