This vessel is always at where we should be. After an imperfect burn, we find ourselves not exactly there. In other words, our position and speed are different from the imaginary vessel. By doing corrections we go back to where we should be, or where the imaginary vessel is. We rendezvous with the imaginary vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we set the target to the imaginary vessel, then the relative speed will be the same with delta-v. The Target sign on the navball, however, does not have a stock-game analog, which is in fact very useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-02T15:30:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2024 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 2\u0022\u003EJuly 2\u003C/time\u003E by EwTE_H\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ethe translation app misunderstood me\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-02T15:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think some things may have gotten lost in translation. \u00A0 \u00A0 A maneuver is really any action take by a spacecraft, while rendezvous is a type of maneuver. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
