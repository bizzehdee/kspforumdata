Spurred on by major technological advances in recent years, especially in the frontier of manned spaceflight, the Kerbals have turned their attention to their nearest celestial neighbour. They choose to go to the Mun not because it is easy, but because it is hard; because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of their energies and skills; because that challenge is one they are willing to accept, one they are unwilling to postpone, and one they intend to win. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Book Antiqua\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis is\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Book Antiqua\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAPOLLO AND BEYOND\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing on from the successes of the Mercury and Gemini programs, the Kerbals are now ready to set forth into the next great frontier.

At T-8, the engines activate as they throttle up to a TWR above one. Then - at T-0 - the launch clamps retract and the rocket roars into the sky. As the massive first stage runs out of fuel, eight ullage motors fire to send the S-IC first stage clear. The five J-2 engines ignite to propel the Saturn V just short of orbital velocity. At this point of the launch there was a failure in the Boost Protective Cover, which failed to detach properly and remained stuck to the front of the rocket until orbit. The S-IVC stage is used to push the craft into a parking orbit. This is then reignited, sending the apoapsis up to 1.5 million km to simulate a lunar reentry profile. The CSM separates and, several hours later, the command module detaches and reenters the atmosphere safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOUTCOME: Success!

Deployment time was around 15 or so minutes, with actual roving going on for another 5. The EVA had to be cut short as it became apparent that the intended 2 day stay on the surface would result in the orbiting CSM being misaligned with the landing site for ascent due to the inclined trajectory used to reach the interesting crater formation.

Telemetry indicates that a slight error in the guidance system caused the rocket to pitch over too soon, exposing the petal interstage adapter to high aerodynamic and thermal stress in the upper atmosphere. This caused it to overheat at around T\u002B00:04:32, detaching the Apollo CSM from the stack. This resulted in the Saturn V stack impacting the SM engine and crushing most of it, which in turn triggered Abort Mode I (AM1), activating the LES engines and successfully pulling the CM away from the rapidly accelerating stack. Crew reentered successfully at T\u002B00:17:45 and have been recovered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9kJ6COF.png\u0022 alt=\u00229kJ6COF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, Range Safety were unable to trigger the destruction of the Saturn V stack, which continued to burn until depletion. This put the rocket on a suborbital trajectory with an apoapsis at 255km. The rocket reentered engine first, protecting it from much of the reentry heating, although data indicates that several ullage motors, guidance systems and parts of the LEM did burn up. As the rocket passed over land once again, mission control was able to re-establish contact with the probe core in the S-IVB stage and used it to decouple and attempt a soft landing burn to preserve hardware and reduce the force of the impact. This attempt was unsuccessful and the debris impacted at 550m/s less than an hour after launch.

The mission profile was slightly different to the usual, with the S-IVB stage being retained longer in order to save CSM fuel for the return journey. The S-IVB stage was used to slow down when approaching Minmus and left in a high Minmus orbit. The CSM \u0026amp; LEM continued down to 13km before LEM separation. The LEM landed in the flats before blasting off a few hours later. Hardly any fuel was used in the descent but in order to have a correct CoM for docking it had to be discarded and was left on the surface. Upon docking with the CSM it became clear that there would not be enough life support to survive the return journey if the standard mission profile was used. Taking a gamble, the crew burned the CSM to depletion towards Kerbin, resulting in a very rapid return which left only 15 units of ablator following reentry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESKYLAB\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7UXB62N.png\u0022 alt=\u00227UXB62N.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RsMpZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Jessie immediately embarked on a second EVA, replacing the damaged solar panels in order to power up the station for crew to enter it.
