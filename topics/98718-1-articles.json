This is less of an issue now we have the gizmos, but previously it was hard to line up radial attachements precisely. I\u0027ve used it for small rovers - start with a micronode with its main nodes oriented up-down and build off it, then you can easily attach it to a ship either wheels-inwards or wheels-outwards as you choose. A bit of weight is generally a good thing on a rover too, build too light and you\u0027ll have poor grip.
