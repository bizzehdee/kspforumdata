This is a new mechanic in the game designed to make some of the heat mechanics more sensible, e.g. ISRU units need a high core temp for efficient operation but if they get too hot they will slow down. It sounds like there may be an inefficiency (or possibly a bug causing log spam) in the code that handles this mechanism. As sal_vager said, please post a log from a reasonably short run of KSP where you reproduce this issue...\n"}]}
