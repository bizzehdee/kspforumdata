Your log file is a train wreck of epic proportions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first suggestion is to get KSP off of your desktop. That\u0027s a known problem for KSP vs. Windows DEP. Make sure you \u0022Copy \u0026amp; Paste\u0022 it off, or install a new copy to someplace like C:\\Games\\KSP.

I am a Mac guy, mainly use the PC to run KSP as my Mac can\u0027t run the Mac version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, i use my Mac laptop to download the game and parts and such, then use a thumb drive to move them to the PC. Also BTW, the PC got some severe viruses on it a few months ago. Finally got rid of the viruses, but I do not let it connect to the internet anymore, just not worth it and do not need it to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I would unzip the downloaded game into the thumb drive, and then copy the unzipped game to the PC. I know I did this a few times for earlier versions such as .19 and .23, and they were OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I copied the .90 game from the thumb drive to a folder in the PC listed \u0022Games\u0022. Still did not work, Directly copied from the thumb drive to the hard drive. Still did not work (by not work I mean could not open a ship file in the VAB). I even tried to run the game off of the Thumb drive copy, same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mentioned how the log file was an epic train wreck. It occurred to me that perhaps the train wreck was not necessarily WHERE the game had been copied to, but HOW that copy had been generated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I copied the compressed zip file to the PC. THEN extracted it, letting the PC extract it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarted the game, went to the VAB, nervously clicked on the folder icon to open a ship file\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and got the \u0022Select a ship to load\u0022 window!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may also explain why I could never get .24 or .25 to run, they would hang at the same part of the start-up load. But .90 loaded and runs fine\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.. until the point of trying to open a ship file. So if I want to go back and try .24 or .25 then I ought to try copying the original zip file to the PC, then extract it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, thanks very much! Now I have a some tasks ahead of me to copy and move over the ship files I could not open before, and reinstall various mods that I have found work nicely on a modded copy of .90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps with your expert\u0027s knowledge base for future bugs other people report. There probably are not many who use a 2nd computer to download the game and then use a thumb drive like I did.
