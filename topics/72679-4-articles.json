The included SCANsatRPM.dll doesn\u0027t work in my case, possibly because I built RPM off the last full version and not the release.

Namely, the first 10 seconds or so of glancing at the code for your version of SSRPM enabled me to figure out how you got it to work as a drop-in on the pre-built release of RPM: you changed the RPM project reference to referencing the pre-built RPM dll instead. (I should\u0027ve thought of that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I installed release RPM, used your SSRPM, and then used the same trick on MechjebRPM to get it to work as a drop-in. It *seems* to work, but I\u0027m in the process of inquiring if I applied the fix correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, it\u0027s pulling the version # through sharedassembly.cs somehow; your SSRPM has a ver of 0.0.0.0, for example. SA.cs only specifies the first two fields, however. I don\u0027t know where it\u0027s getting the 3rd and 4th, but they\u0027re the ones that have been the problem as far as drop-in replacements (the pre-built release and the source of the release come up with different numbers in those two fields.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe version only matters when one of the .dlls is used as a reference, though, so it\u0027s the version of RasterPropMonitor.dll that matters, not the versions of SSRPM or MJRPM. As long as SSRPM is built with the same version of RPM.dll that the user has, it\u0027ll work as a drop-in. If the user\u0027s got a different version, it\u0027ll blow up (which is why it didn\u0027t work on mine originally.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-19T16:52:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2014 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T22:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to detect anomalies with the normal antennas, reasoning the anomalies would give out some distortions and/or wideband signals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding the MODULE to all antennas was easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleDataTransmitter]]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\t//antennas can detect anomalies//\u003Cbr\u003E\tMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = SCANsat\u003Cbr\u003E\tsensorType = 16\u003Cbr\u003E\tfov = 5\u003Cbr\u003E\tmin_alt = 5000\u003Cbr\u003E\tmax_alt = 500000\u003Cbr\u003E\tbest_alt = 250000\u003Cbr\u003E\tpower = 0.01\u003Cbr\u003E\tscanName = multispectral scan\u003Cbr\u003E\t//animationName = Multi_Antenna\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut can I also bind the activation of the scan to the activation of the antenna?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DivisionByZero","CreatedById":62591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T02:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E?Hi guys,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Great job picking up the pieces after Damny went MIA!
