An over-arching strategy that defines the player\u0027s goals (ie complete the grand tour, colonize the Joolian moons) chosen when the game is started would give the possibility of contracts being offered if they support the player\u0027s grand design. For example, if the player wants to colonize Duna then contracts to establish outposts on or stations around Mun and Minmus would not be offered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my career mode game, I hate repeatedly doing 7 \u0022test landed\u0022 contracts with one vessel because it isn\u0027t testing anything (I don\u0027t even include fuel tanks) and it isn\u0027t setting up infrastructure to make future missions easier (ie LKO refuel station). The only reason I do them is because I can\u0027t afford to do what I want with out doing mind-numbing click-fests on hundreds of ships designed to do nothing but hold 7 random parts together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T00:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, something that I\u0027m still falling back and forth on in the conversations is the idea of \u0022grindy\u0022 and \u0022contract farming.\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably has a lot to do with just how much money is required in 0.90 to get anywhere.
