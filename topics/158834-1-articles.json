No issues what\u0027s so ever. \u00A0So today I started up the game and I see that it\u0027s hanging up on \u0022loading assets bundle\u0022 now at first I thought I might have too much stuff open so I alt \u00A0f4 \u00A0and closed everything and restart the game. Same thing. Waiting at asset bundle. Then I thought maybe a incompatible MOD or something not up to date. \u00A0So closed it. Made sure all is correct. Start up. Same thing. At this point I\u0027m getting frustrated so I say how about a fresh install. So I did. \u00A0Put back all the mods that I need. Start and AGAIN stuck at asset bundle. So I tell myself let me wait a bit. So by some miracle it started loading from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E but EXTREMELY SLOW. I mean it took almost 20 minutes for the game to load up. And whole time I\u0027m watching my memory building up to 60% and my CPU barely breaking a sweat at 6 to 8% usage. And I got a pretty good PC i7 win7 with 16 gigs ram. So finally the game loads up but runs like molasses. I managed to get a craft on the run way and it just got worse from there. I might as well be watching a picture book at those frame rates. The messed up part is there is no crash log or output log because it\u0027s not really crashing. It\u0027s just freezing and forcing me to shut it down. I have no clue why it\u0027s doing this. It was running just fine yesterday and it just decided to call it quits. I run about 64 mods with 7500 patches applied but most of them are parts mods ad the rest are just essentials like mechJeb AA config containers \u00A0etc... \u00A0can anyone shed some light on this. Because I confused and frustrated that I can\u0027t get it running correctly. Thank you for taking time to read and respond to this.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
