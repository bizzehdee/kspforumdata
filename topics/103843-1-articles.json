One view being the Pilot\u0027s view in the cockpit and the other being the map view for a Mission Control view. \n\nI\u0027m working on some joysticks for the pilot for control of the vehicle and want the other view to be for the other support players. So mission control would be able to set maneuver nodes and see the whole solar system and mission objectives. The Pilot would then pilot the ship to achieve the goals.\n\nAny idea\u0027s? I looked through the forums and didn\u0027t see anything that would do what I wanted but I may have missed something.\n\nThanks guys!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T15:11:44Z","Content":"There was a mod that did almost exactly what you\u0027re describing, but I believe it hasn\u0027t been maintained for a while: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76273](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76273)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jerec81","CreatedById":111462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T16:28:33Z","Content":"Sweet, I\u0027ll try it out!"}]}
