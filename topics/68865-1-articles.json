Upward acceleration should drain blood from their heads, causing an inward-creeping blackness on crewed vessels lacking probe cores. Downward acceleration should pool blood in their heads, causing an inward-creeping redness on crewed vessels lacking probe cores. Sufficient upward or downward acceleration should render them unconscious until relieved; sustaining acceleration beyond some further bound should kill them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECamera Effects\u003C/strong\u003E - The external camera should not track the CoM but where the CoM has been as a function of acceleration, asymptotally approaching the CoM. The internal camera should slightly translate with acceleration, reflecting the Kerbals\u0027 movement.

These details would greatly increase immersion when viewing Kerbals\u0027 cameras and seeing them in IVA.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart Reactions\u003C/strong\u003E - Lesser sounds of acceleration and jerk should precede those indicating impending doom.

Motion blur and general immersion is pretty interesting but ksp was never a very immersive or pretty game. The affect of directional G effects (kerbals can\u0027t take movement one way as well as another) would actually limit some awesome and interesting ship designs.
