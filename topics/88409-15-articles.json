Thanks Nathan that was a good read. Got another question. Go figure! The Saturb 1B. Now ive seen people posting about troubles with this craft in the past. I dont know if it was stock or RSS, but it seems the 1B is a tricky beast. I cannot get the required Dv out of it. Not even close. I can cheat, throw some SRBs on the 1B and a second J2 and that\u0027d do it. But before i give into that id really like to try and make the craft work as it was. How they did it.. no idea. I have stripped the Apollo capsule and service module of 95% of all propellents and cut the ablative sheiding by three quarters. And again I dont even get close. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems the S1B cuts off too early with only 2,712m/s of Dv. The single J2 engine of the S-IVB has a good number at 4,511 Dv, but nowhere near the thurst to take over the rest of the flight and I end up fighting gravith with a 40 degree pitch the entire time. The S-IVB could do it, but the S1B is not boosting it far enough. I have enough fuel then in the service module for 768 m/s. But then i go and read the S-IVB did the job without the use of the service engine to complete the orbit. It was at that point i decided i needed to inquire about this. Every flight my trajectory just got steeper and steeper and everytime I came up drastically short. I try to cicularize after Ap before i hit the atmosphere, no luck. And yet through all this I am actually cheating a bit by using the most powerful of each engine variant. The H1/RS-27 and the J2-S provide me with the most Dv. So at what point should I consider this a bug vs player error?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I dont know if its related, but I had to use a procedural decoupler for the dual plane seperation. The only one i have is the 5m part for the SaturnV and cant be sized. Cant find one for the S1B diamter so the procedural part worked nice. And its 2.25 tons versus 0.43 on the larger 5m part. Well crap im guessing theres my culprit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: Doesnt make much of a difference without it. 2,881 Dv on the S1 without the dual plane seperation, but it\u0027d be nice to loose the ulage motors as It should be done for the S-IVB. The APS doesnt have the kick for the J2 to ignite and i dont have the time to wait for the fuel to settle before i have to get on the throttle. Thing flies... and falls like a brick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: 3: The more i look into this the more it seems my issue is the S-IVB. My numbers for the S1B are quite close to the real ones. And now that i think about i remember looking at the fuel after the S-IVB cuttoff. There was a good bit of liquid hydrogen left over. So i tried removing the fuels then replacing them. And the Dv went up too 2,888. ( im guessing because im using the J2S ). And still i dont think it is enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-18T00:05:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2015 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T03:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe FASA changed (again), I\u0027ll check it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T06:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMotokid, you are only trying to orbit the payload that the Saturn IB is rated for, right?

It seems the nodes are not quite in the right posistion and the adapter doesnt come up far enough leaving a gap between it and the service engine. So i placed a procedural interstage between the two and attatched that to the bottom of the service engine. Which allowed me to raise and lower the adapter as i pleased. It works, but it does add that extra weight because you need to use fairings on the proc IS adapter so it holds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres that and not having a decoupler the correct size of the S1B for the dual plane seperation.

As for the ullage motors i use KW, there perfect. The issue is i cannot seem to find a 6.6m decoupler that can go under the interestage for the dual plane seperation. The larger part for the SaturnV cant be scaled. Ive had to hot stage the rocket to get ithe J2 to ignite and retro motors on the first stage so it pulls away before the interestage ( still attatched to the depleted stage ) rips off the J2. Its happened twice because i failed to put on retro motors. I am able to achieve dual plane seperation with the procedural decoupler, but its far too heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T05:14:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 05:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T06:50:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDual-plane separation is only between the S-IC and S-II.
