Whoa ! Already 230 hr played !?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027m late, but here I am.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I want to thank Squad Team for their work and praise them for making this game. I\u0027m born the very year Apollo 11 mission set foot on the moon, and as a child, and then a young adult, I\u0027ve always been fascinated by space exploration. This game reactivated the virus. Badly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENote : : Will publish pictures of my craft later, as I cannot access them at the moment.\u003C/em\u003E Edit : Images added\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experiences, sofar, are (in a science game context) :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Trying to build an orbiter, and managing, after many tries, to satellize and de-orbit Jebediah Kerman. Even managed not to forget to set a parachute onto the command module. Then same ol\u0027 Jeb took a trip to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn for a flyby, and got back alive to tell his story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Played a bit with a basic plane to collect Science on Kerbin biomes. Many crahes later, I managed to learn landing... errr... devise a correct landing procedure, and landed a plane on Kerbin polar caps. A few kerbals where hurt, but the first thing I try to add to my designs is an escape system. Actually, the only thing I thing I master now in this game is safety systems design. Well, Call me softhearted, but I really don\u0027t like loosing a kerbal. Even in a science game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I found that I wanted some difficulty, and added a few mods to my game, notably FAR, KJR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Tried to optimize my basic plane (FAR). Still not satisfied with the result - many control issues, and I bump on control settings questions (will post about it on questions forum). But, I\u0027ve catched - with a lot of help gathered from these forums - how to set CoM / CoL, use spoilers (now I can land ! Well, it looks less like a crash), and use the FAR stability tabs to validate my designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic Science and Test Plane, in flight :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/9BTkaIa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9BTkaIa.png?1\u0022 alt=\u00229BTkaIa.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I then got enough of plane problems, and sended Valentina Kerbal to the Mun, then Bill Kerman to Minmus. Apollo-style design (wanted to learn docking procedures). Learned the art of docking, and before that the art of RCS systems fine tuning. Thanks a lot to the guy who created the ingame tutorial. In the same time, I mastered dV calculations (Have made my own spreadsheet, then discovered KER mod. Well, that validated my spreadsheet, and now I use KER. Great Mod!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus Mission on launchpad (A bit overdid it with dV ^^ ):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/mYLM1GW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mYLM1GW.png?2\u0022 alt=\u0022mYLM1GW.png?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- After that, I started to plan a future unmanned mission to Duna, so I began building a small rover, for science and for fun. The idea behind it is to stack it inside a 2.5m structure (service bay or fairing). So was born the C.R.A.B., a 6 wheel multipurpose science Rover (Pictures later). Tested it thouroughly on kerbin (it also fits in a Mk2 bay).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC.R.A.B.

Then I successfully tested the package by deploying Scan Sats and Rover to Mun, Minmus. Moaaar Science ! And the opportunity to play with ore ressource scanning... and that idea that a refueling base on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn or Minmus could be a great idea for later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna I.0 payload :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/wl0nI1V\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wl0nI1V.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022wl0nI1V.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- That was enough a refreshment to motivate me to tackle plane design again, and I set my first ambitious goal : building a functional VTOL science plane. With the small plane experience, I quickly converged to a Mk2 based design, incorporating the C.R.A.B. as a science platform. After a lot of cras... err... pilot problems, I finally found a way to manage a procedure for transition between horizontal phase and vertical hovering (with or without landing) using vernor engine and SAS to help the craft to remain stable through this transition. That was by far the main hurdle I had to jump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVTOL Science Hopper:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/VV2om98\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VV2om98.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022VV2om98.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZoom on the C.R.A.B.

The launch was great, and the ship in en route for the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. The lander has a full science service bay, and I plan to deploy a C.R.A.B. rover from another 2.5m Service bay to explore around with a science specialist aboard. I already identified an interesting (good Ore%) zone near a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn canyon. I expect a tricky landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : Landed !!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/jDQ5Qqc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jDQ5Qqc.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022jDQ5Qqc.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next planned steps are :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Send Duna I.0 mission to deploy scanning sat and CRAB rover around the red planet (waiting for a good transfer window at the moment)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Explore Kerbin with my VTOL plane, with a desert mission and a south pole landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Experiment with mining on the Mun (canyon landing site or another).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-20T19:45:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2015 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kordolius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EImages added\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T17:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Kordolius, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a wonderful first post and I\u0027m very pleased to have you aboard.
