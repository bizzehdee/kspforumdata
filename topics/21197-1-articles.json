I purposefully set a collision course with the prograde side of the moon, then detatch my extra engines leaving just a nerva, and a large amount of debris that collides into the moon. I luckily haven\u0027t bombed my kerbals doing sciency things over there... yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SBaL","CreatedById":11004,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T17:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is how it currently looks in my save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b82/jonsen2k/KSP/screenshot20-2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot20-2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b82/jonsen2k/KSP/screenshot19-2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot19-2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only debris is some pieces from the fairing plates from two of my missions where i failed to aim them in for a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar crash course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027m not really bothered with leaving the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar-injection/interplanetary stage in orbit around the destination.
