And then everything I\u0027ve done is lost, because it didn\u0027t save in persistent either. it\u0027s not that the game interface is forbidding from saving, like it happens when you move on the surface. no, you click save game and nothing happens. you click return to space center, and nothing happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made some experiments; small rockets seem to be fine. large ships seem consistently to generate this bug. on the launchpad, they are fine. even if I alt-f12 them directly in orbit they are fine, most of the times - although the bug can still strike later. but as soon as I activate staging, they get screwed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy main mods are kerbalism, near future parts, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E. a handful of smaller mods like simple fuel switch and antenna sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been launching and using ships a lot more complex than that in the past, and i never encountered this bug, so I strongly suspect \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E is to blame - i had all the other mods back then too. but i was using the 1.09 or 1.10 version, now i updated to 1.12, so maybe that\u0027s the problem. next thing I\u0027m gonna do is to transfer all those mods into a 1.09 version and see if it does the same. unless someone can help me first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptSmollett","CreatedById":192681,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-01T03:49:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same issue but I don\u0027t have the mods you\u0027ve listed.
