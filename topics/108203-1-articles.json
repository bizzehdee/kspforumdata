The special problem of 1.0 and onward is that drag in atmosphere now depends somewhat on orientation of the ship. So, as one control system tries to correct it, it creates an oscillation that a second control system tries to correct, perhaps in a much more violent way. The first control system tries to respond, they feed into each other until something breaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice is turn on the minimum number of control inputs to maintain heading. Think about which inputs are coarse adjustment (gimbal, big aero surfaces) and which are fine (SAS torque). And if you\u0027re not doing so already, stay away from SAS direction headings like prograde hold, those are all under-damped.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this was new with 1.0, but you can adjust how much gimbal your engines have with a slider. In the VAB I usually reduce this to about 20% for all of the engines in my lifter stages. Add some fins near the bottom of your rocket, make sure you use plenty of struts to keep the \u0022joints\u0022 (read: decouplers) sturdy, and make sure you have a high CoM. Don\u0027t deviate far from the prograde marker and you should be able to have a smooth flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gimbal sliders seem to be the most help, set them low, but do not lock the gimbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T21:03:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is clearly more struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
