Cant we limit the angle that the comcentre can transmit trough(like only 15 degrees straight up becouse who in their right mind sends a signal over the horizon right?) Or atleast have proper world detection (Last time i checked this issnt bethesda\u00A0game studios.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIve looked trough the settings but found nothing, ive dug trough so many mods but found nothing that can help.
