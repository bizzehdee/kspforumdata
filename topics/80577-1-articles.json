It\u0027s not customisable, and doesn\u0027t have a few of my fav things like the suicide burn countdown, but I like how much less obtrusive it is having just the text HUD there. I really like the biome display on the HUD too, now I know when to do an EVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only tried Kerbal Engineer once and found the windows were too huge for my liking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried Raster Prop Monitor for IVA info, but I didn\u0027t get used to the IVA view and it wass annoying having to turn all the monitors to the right screens at the start of each flight, I\u0027ll have to try it again some time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoo, what does everyone else use for info displays?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blind Dead McJones","CreatedById":109600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T13:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like KER because I actually like the way it looks over Mechjeb, and I love having certain features like time to impact and altitude over terrain. This is why I think of Mechjeb exclusively as autopilot. I also like Scansat which is great for knowing biomes, where my orbit goes, altitude of certain areas etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T14:31:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe upcoming KER 1.0 is highly customizable. You can make your own windows, modify the existing ones, and resize them.

My earlier gripes about the overly-padded UI are completely gone and having it run without a part is just awesome. I also like RPM with Hyomoto\u0027s MFD when I want to IVA, which is fun sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
