A few versions back, I had no issues with this. But now targeting debris targets the root part of the debris, not the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and once the klaw is attached, I can\u0027t target the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E, like I can when attached to an asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I missing something? Or is there a workaround? I\u0027d gladly install (or even write, if I knew where to start) a plugin that adds the \u0022target \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 ability to the right click menu, or changes the game\u0027s targeting behaviour to target vessels\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E by default, or treats debris as a singular part that forces \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E to be targeted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have suggestions for this issue?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
