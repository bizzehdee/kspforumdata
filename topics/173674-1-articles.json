A small wing, orbit capable, jet powered, spacecraft. It is capable of long distance jet flight, of close to the speed of sound at low altitudes \u0026lt;10 kilometers. It is incredibly maneuverable, incredibly stable, and easy to fly. It can transport 3 kerbals into orbit aboard its lifting rocket, and can dock to an orbiting spacecraft with its small docking port mounted atop.

The vehicle flew to an altitude of 150 kilometers, reentered the atmosphere, an under low power, flew itself to the island runaway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlying instructions for launch, start your gravity turn as soon as possible, the flight profile would allow for the vehicle to get into orbit even if the gravity turn is not perfect. There is excess delta v in the orbital insert stage, and the OM stage just for this scenario, but it is advised that you avoid such a situation as possible. Once on orbit, it is advised, though not required, that the jet engines be deactivated, as to avoid a burnout within the engine. But it has no effect on the flight profile. By default, the jet engine fuel tanks are disabled, to ensure that there is excess liquid fuel for the return journey, and can easily fly great distances if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/FiSR3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/gallery/FiSR3\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffff00;color:#000000;font-size:15px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.mediafire.com/file/hx5cqimoko0qfdv/DreamFlyer.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.mediafire.com/file/hx5cqimoko0qfdv/DreamFlyer.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketscience101","CreatedById":12864,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-09T06:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn update on the vehicle, a second test flight of an updated version of the vehicle attaching two small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks, the smallest possible, at the center of mass, to ensure the center of mass did not move, and the attachment of several \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters around the craft, proved that it could rendezvous and dock with an orbiting target vehicle, it delivered Bob and Bill to a space station orbiting at about 150 kilometers, and returned the pilot Jebediah safely to kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eagle92lightning","CreatedById":170551,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-10T19:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmmm...
