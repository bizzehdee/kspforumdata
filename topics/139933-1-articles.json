I find it hit or miss whether my spacecraft is suitably illuminated by the lights I\u0027ve placed in the VAB. Sometimes it\u0027s ok, sometimes it\u0027s just spall spots and edges that show up. A mod to turn off the lighting in the VAB would be great. I think I read in one of the dev notes that some of the lighting is bult into the static scene, but making the ship dark should be possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T07:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen something like that over at spacedock.info.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nookos","CreatedById":144067,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T12:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/102558-105-lightsout-v015-daynight-mode-in-vabsph/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 1.1 compatible version is \u00A0available towards the end of the thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
