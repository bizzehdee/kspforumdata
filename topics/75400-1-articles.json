These are just minor annoyances that can easily be fixed I\u0027m sure, and if a fix for these problems is out there or I am not doing something right be sure to let me know. I am new after all. So here they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Kerbals keep being reset after ever minor change on your craft or every transition between areas. Not that kerbals have much use at all but I enjoy using certain kerbals for certain missions and I cannot explain how many times I have found myself on the launch site with the default Jeb kerbal. This is especially a problem with certain parts like the mobile research station. Many times I have sent it up not realizing is has no crew. Yes I should get into the habit of launching after choosing crew but when you\u0027re popping in to add one strut to your craft you don\u0027t always think of these things again...perhaps once you save a craft the allocated kerbal can be saved in that slot too?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Setting off stages from the map mode. I do not have a beefy rig and the transition between flight and map mode is a little bumpy and laggy, I spend a lot of time in map mode doing my movements and while launching when I\u0027m setting up the perfect orbit, it is a pain to \u0022m\u0022 back, miss the stage and lose momentum. And please don\u0027t suggest Mechjeb ( I think thats the name) because not everyone likes automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 Small suggestions I have so far that have been bugging me enough to come and post a suggestion.
