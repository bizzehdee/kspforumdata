This craft has a tight fuel budget and requires a skilled pilot to pull off or if your like me and lack the skills you will want to strap your trusty AR-202 Mechjeb unit to the side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have only had one successful trip so far with the Munficiency II and the fuel budget was tight to the point I could only return to Kerbin using a Bi-elliptic transfer maneuver that brought me out to 40 million meters from Kerbin at apoapsis so I could cheaply bring my periapsis down to 31k above Kerbin. After this maneuver i had little more than a whisper of fuel left to set the valiant Kerbins down in the ocean which was just enough that the capsule and all that where aboard survived. All previous attempts using a Hohmann transfer maneuver to return from the moon only allowed me to get within 800k of Kerbin before fuel exhaustion. As an aside I have not yet been successful at getting back from Mun with the fine Koalemos II by kosmo-not so a better pilot than myself may be able to get back from Mun more directly since both ships have very close to the same delta V left in the tank once reaching a 70K Kerbin orbit when I used the AR-202.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres some pics of the Munficiency II \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/cEWkQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cEWkQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/tgF3V.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tgF3V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/gnBqS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gnBqS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust before stage 2 separation and prep for final stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/unpgo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022unpgo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal stage not my most efficient orbital insertion since this was a mechjeb free attempt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/WloH2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WloH2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttached is the craft file for your enjoyment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: don\\\u0027t know how to post pics in spoiler tags properly so here is the link to the album. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/reIT7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/reIT7\u003C/a\u003E Added craft file for Munficiency III removed landing legs added fins went from 374 units of fuel in LKO to 382 units of fuel thanks sal for the suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-07T08:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi grovest, you need to put the direct link in the img tags, not the links from the album or they don\\\u0027t show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice tiny ship, can you show us the full flight to the Mun and back?

Part of my design criteria was to see if I could match the performance of the other ships I have seen that use one and a half tanks that lack legs I wanted to match their performance and range while keeping the legs. Also another efficiency in my design is that all engines are in use during all stages so that I am not carrying dead weight its also one of the reasons I went with the LV-909 over the LV-T35 during the launch stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt launch the ship makes 250 thrust the ship i originally set my goal on beating the benchmark for performance I set which was the Koalemos II which makes 600 thrust at launch but also has a 50 thrust engine hiding behind a coupler contributing nothing to the launch but adding payload to to the launch. When launching the Koalemos II it gets off the pad very well but for efficiency the Mechjeb auto dials back the power to about 80 percent throttle and from that point on your carrying more power than you need and the added weight of the big powerful engine not being fully utilized which adds to the mass that you have to carry to orbit expending more fuel to do it. Its a fine line ideally you want the perfect engine that has only as much power as you need assuming equal power to weight ratios of course but none of the engines quite match that criteria Koalamos II falls on the side of to much power and mine falls to the other side of the line being under powered such that at 100 percent utilization I\\\u0027m not able to reach an ideal climb out speed so have to waste fuel fighting gravity for longer but my final design seems to be closer to that line. The II designator in the Munficiency name is my 4 tank model that i revised from a 5 tank version when I discovered that others had created 4 tank moon rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may be on to something with substituting the legs with wings not only are the fixed wings lighter but i essentially am getting lift for free since they have the same amount of drag as the landing legs. Fitting the wings will be a challenge though since some of my legs are tucked behind tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-07T10:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see what you mean about the tanks obscuring the wings, they would have to be mounted higher, also on my install the legs have a drag of .2 while the wings are .02\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the underutilized engine is concerned, the extra power is helpful just to get your velocity over 100m/s as early as possible before throttling back, the penalty to your fuel budget from the poor acceleration at launch from using only the lander engine may be a factor, but as you said it\\\u0027s lighter in weight which is better over the full course of the flight, I base the above on closette\\\u0027s work on the goddard problem, rockets are too inefficient just after launch until they can build sufficient speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShame the engines aren\\\u0027t radially attachable without a tank, they could be dropped earlier

seems amazing that they have a tenth the drag of the landing legs yet are creating lift something is a little off here not only do they have increased frontal area but they seem to be creating lift without the corresponding drag that is a product of lift creation either that or the drag value for the legs is to high seems like seems something needs an adjustment but then drag implementation in this game is a bit wonky at the moment anyway but when or if it is fixed my ships will loose a good deal of there efficiency advantage over the narrower stacked ships.
