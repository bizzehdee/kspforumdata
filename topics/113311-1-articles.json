Do you still believe it can be great again?","CreatedByName":"One-Way Films","CreatedById":90926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T10:28:05Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"One-Way Films","CreatedById":90926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T10:28:05Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been playing DayZ for ages now (1.5 years) and the number of interesting people I run into has dwindled. Now it\u0027s all KOS (Kill on Site) and there\u0027s no roleplay anymore. It\u0027s been in early access (the standalone anyway) for too long. \n\n**BUT!!** There\u0027s still a bit of hope! The Devs are adding in some new fixes and fully intergrating their new engine, meaning more Frames Per Second and new vehicles that don\u0027t send you to orbit. They\u0027re moving to Beta. I hope they stick to this promise though. There\u0027s not many games that really pull off zombie survival like DayZ once did. \n\n\u0022It\u0027s not the zombies you need to worry about. It\u0027s the people amidst the undead who will kill you\u0022\n\nPlease vote on what you think of the game. Thanks in advance. Maybe KSP players could come together to play and reck a DayZ server once it\u0027s pulled out of it\u0027s slump.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T10:53:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 10:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by One-Way Films**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T13:07:29Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t played the game so I\u0027m not voting but personally I wouldn\u0027t be optimistic. A game where you want some level of spoiling behaviour from the players but not enough to ruin the game altogether, strikes me as a very very difficult balance to strike. In my experience, relatively few players are interesting in roleplaying - they want their possible actions to be defined solely by the game mechanics and if those mechanics allow them to do nothing but aggravate other players then so be it - \u0027it\u0027s part of the game\u0027."},{"CreatedByName":"Halban","CreatedById":89536,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T15:09:07Z","Content":"Although DayZ is definitely not shining with polish, it\u0027s a great concept and It\u0027s still easy to tap into that while in game. So I\u0027m actually still having quite a bit of fun playing to game, and if the E3 announcements are anything to go by then it should \\*fingers crossed\\* then in the near future I\u0027ll be having even more fun. As for the player base... Well, I\u0027ve more or less given up on them. It seems about 90% are simply morons. In time the less patient players will leave the game, but for now I have a trusty No KOS Roleplay server to use ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T16:31:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 04:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HatBat**"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T01:57:44Z","Content":"Personally i\u0027ve found that the game is just as great as it was back in the day, if not more so. Granted, my opinion is based on the fact that I never really switched from the \u0022lone wolf\u0022 type. So my playstyle hasn\u0027t really been affected by the admitted increase of KOS in the game. However, I\u0027ve also found that people are less into KOS on lower population servers, which in my opinion are the servers where the game really shines. (The max player servers almost always boil down into free for all unless the admins are forcing it otherwise)\n\nI\u0027ve found more non-hostiles in low pop servers than I have in high pop ones. And if nothing else, the rate at which I find people who just agreed to back away and part ways was much higher in these servers."}]}
