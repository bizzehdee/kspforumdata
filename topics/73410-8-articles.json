This is mostly to minimize the number of potential resources and conflicts in the game- as I am likely to switch over from RealFuels LV-N engines to KSP-Interstellar nuclear rockets in the long run.

Moreover, Universal storage has an Electrolysis block in it which produces H2 and Oxygen. I\u0027ve been meaning to throw together things like a O2 phase changer (lox-\u0026gt;gox \u0026amp; vice versa) using the Universal Storage blocks. A quick note about my diagram above for RCS, I am aware of the error in the Sabatier reaction, but the net result is the same. It produces an excess of Oxygen, but that\u0027s not a bad thing, really. Oxygen is inevitably lost over time, not to mention is needed for the RCS system. Also, I did the math, and turns out that water holds 78% the oxygen by weight per cubic meter compared to LOx, and holds 157% the hydrogen by weight per cubic meter compared to Liquid Hydrogen (comparisons at 1 atm), not to mention it\u0027s non-cryogenic, and stable over a wide temperature-pressure range compared to LOx/LH.

Apparently, Dreadicon already sent NathanKell a pull request with the latest Ksp-Interstellar/RealFuels integration config we (well, mostly Dreadicon) designed, but it shouldn\u0027t include resource or TWR/ISP fixes for the Meth/LOX engine when it gets integrated into RealFuels, as I understand it (NathanKell, am I reading you correctly on how it\u0027s going to look when integrated into RealFuels?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there needs to be a file for each engine config, including this one, that adjusts the names of the Resources consumed by the engine (this fix was in the *old* integration config- I still have it installed, so send me a PM if you can\u0027t find it), and there should also be TWR/ISP fixes for it, as I mentioned before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re looking for MORE to do, still, I\u0027m trying to get FractalUK to add Nitrogen as a propellant for the KSP-Interstellar plasma thrusters.
