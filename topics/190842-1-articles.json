I admittedly feel as if the CM of the part is fairly unrealistic and that it needs some offset, although I\u0027m not sure where to start with writing a config file to change the CM so that it is more inline with the booster component than the attachment spokes.\u00A0\u003Cs\u003EAlso when are we getting stock inline sepratrons/option to toggle between spoke mount and no spoke mount motors\u00A0lol\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I just want to change where the CM is without having to hard-code the values in, as well as what portion of code I would need to look at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiscelanousItem","CreatedById":194744,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-05T10:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patching here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@PART[sepMotor1]\u003Cbr\u003E\n{\u003Cbr\u003E\nCoMOffset = x,y,z ///What this does is add a new variable to the part cfg to overwrite the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E pos, since normally \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E is coded in the model\u003Cbr\u003E\n}\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should work if you replace x,y,z with the coordinates of the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-05T17:20:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2020 05:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by MiscelanousItem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded precision\u002Bremoved un-nice bit, sorry\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-05T19:05:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
