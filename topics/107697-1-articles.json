I have been stubbornly trying and failing to exceed 13000 meters with my only jet engine, which so far is the Wheesley. I\u0027ve tried large wing surfaces and 6 intake scoops (I only have the earliest one) but nothing has worked so far. \n\nIt\u0027s hard to tell when you\u0027re learning what contracts are actually feasable with your current resources. I\u0027m finding that a lot of them require specially made craft which lowers the benefit of such contracts quite a bit sometimes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T21:15:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:40:17Z","Content":"most people have done it by attaching rockets to their planes.

You\u0027ll definitely need to disable angle snap when doing this if you want the CoT to be exactly aligned with CoM.\n\nYou\u0027re also going to have some interesting control issues when flying it with only one Thud, because while the CoT would be aligned with the CoM, it won\u0027t be aligned with the capsule or cockpit. You\u0027d have to point slightly off-target to be able to burn precisely.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T19:45:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:48:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s very good to know.
