BTW im using KAC mod, but i searched for an option to disable it in the mod (cause like you thought would be a feature from the mod) but couldnt find in the mod anything about it so i went ahead and google it... found this link to ksp forums about the changes on 1.0 concerning this buttons (line 12): [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110482-KSP-1-0-General-Thread-All-the-new-features](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110482-KSP-1-0-General-Thread-All-the-new-features)\n\n Still i will be super happy to find the source of this and if possible a solution, thank you for your time and hope you can help me out ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBest regards\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ah, you know.
