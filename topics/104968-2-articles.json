That\u0027s pretty much following the core definition of most interactive media, and even more so for a open-ended game like KSP. That seperation is personal, so you can\u0027t really ask if something is cheating \u0027by general definition\u0027, but only if it is cheating to a person and the way he or she enjoys the game. I\u0027m e.g. played around with infiniglides in my sandbox mode, while I kept that exploit out of my career mode.\n\u003E If you want to go for a very strict rule interpretation that doesn\u0027t include the human element, then no, it\u0027s not cheating, because squad implemented it as a part of their rule system. Your question is a catch 22: Either you go for rule interpretition to get a general \u0027sterile\u0027 idea and no personal interpretation (which doesnt really affect how people play), or you go for personal interpretation and don\u0027t get a general idea (which varies from person to person).\n\u003E \n\u003E Btw: I think the system is kinda flawed in how you can mine everywhere independent of ressource density, so I probably will still limited my mining to ressource rich areas (instead of mining in poor areas and time-accelerate for a few days). It is a bit tricky: Ways to limit this, like life support, or some kind of mod to limit the lifetime of a drill, would just add another ressource system atop of our ressource system for the sake of it. Kethane limited deposits were also kinda boring and one dimensional.\n\nIf one were to accept that cheating is only defined by each player by his or her self, then the question, \u0022is this cheating?\u0022 is indeed not a valid one to begin with.\n\nThe fact that someone has asked \u0022is this cheating?\u0022 implies that there *is* an objective way to measure it, that there is a standard against which to measure it, and I argue that the standard is the official ruleset, which is defined by the game developer.\n\nIMO, that pretty much sums up every \u0022cheating?\u0022 thread I\u0027ve ever seen on this forum.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How does that have anything to do with KSP?

The Mun at least is mostly covered by ore. I would prefer the surface be mostly barren, with small islands of ore (learn precise landing technique). I would also like it to be kind of odds based, like you see a spot of high concentration from above and it means that there is 75% chance there will be ore under you when you land. i.e. a square kilometer of high concentration will be divided into 100 blocks 75 of which have ore, the rest don\u0027t. There is only so much you can tell from orbit, without landing and actually seeing if it\u0027s there. This would also encourage adding wheels to your rig.

I dont process 1 resource to make another one; there always has to be loss and refinement; in fact I still have yet to tweak fuel systems resource production; I have Aluminum all done and I could even add more resources to it but I dont want to go overboard; I further refine Aluminum to make Sapphire to which resource contracts will be added so I can sell refined resources for funds...ya.\n\nI say all this because honestly I been working on this for the last 6 months; it is a simple matter of rewriting cfg codes to get what you want in a resource game; for me 6 months worth; I could use some support I think it would be nice...I know my streams arnt so great but hey, I think I can put myself up on a pedestal here; I feel great about what I have done and am trying to showcase MODS as best I can; mostly the artwork of the parts I use; about half or more is the resource coding from me; it was alot of work; but now I have an AWESOME KSP game.\n\nCmdr Zeta\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T00:25:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 12:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cdr\\_Zeta**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyrus","CreatedById":117194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T00:50:41Z","Content":"I fail to see the merit of the argument that ISRU is \u0022cheaty\u0022.
