I have a simple suggestion: Folders in the craft list. Basically you can add folders and put your crafts in them instead of having them cluttered in one pile. Lets hope this gets reality because I really want organization in my crafts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A-Stax32","CreatedById":113992,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T00:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere here, I will definitely second this request.

I would also like to see a single unified database for where crafts and subs are stored. Then with folders the root would simply be the \u0022corporation name\u0022 of that particular save and expand from there.
