In real life, you can just run all the numbers and come up with the exact angles of attack for each phase of the launch to get you to your desired orbit (if possible). In KSP, you just have to play it by ear and actually fly the rocket by the seat of your pants. Which is fun....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for giggles, I took the Mercury retro pack from Frizzank\u0027s Gemini pack and put it on the bottom of Asterix. (It\u0027s roughly the same diameter as the satellite part.) It\u0027s visually horrible, because the retro pack part is built to include an auto-fairing that simulates the adaptor between the Mercury capsule and the Atlas or Redstone, so you wind up with a strange, detached halo surrounding the third stage when you stick it on the Diamant. But.... it put Asterix into a Kerbin escape orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo really, the only thing keeping Diamant from being useful for very, very small probes is the lack of very, very small solid motors to attach to those very, very small probes....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Good_Apollo","CreatedById":46497,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T20:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(Snip) woops\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XNerd_Bomber","CreatedById":54332,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T23:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else feel that the Ariane 5 is still a little too overpowered?
