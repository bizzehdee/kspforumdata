Sort of a mix between a Klingon and a seven-foot ogre in powered armor. Of course, in those tales a daredevil hero with a blazing rocket always saves the galaxy, defying all laws of physics, logic, and his own ship\u0027s fuel tank capacity in the process.\n\n Modern Kerbal science has long ago debunked those Kerlywood fantasies. If protein life was to develop on a super-Kerbin the size of Jool, the \u0022giants\u0022 would be crushed under their own weight long before they\u0027d have a chance to invent any kind of powered armor. The laws of the universe simply do not allow for existence of such ridiculous creatures!\n\n But if those aliens do exist, wouldn\u0027t it be terrifyingly fun for any self-respecting Kerbal to abduct some of them and study in lab conditions? Just think of the amount of SCIENCE that can be gained from examining such a monster... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![JPxq5M3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JPxq5M3.jpg)\n\n Hi! \\o/"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T14:53:59Z","Content":"Woah....\n\nWhat a fantastic entrance!
