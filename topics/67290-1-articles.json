(you know you\u0027ve done it) I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the only one, who has just wanted to load up an orbiter in KSP and let it run, just so the scenery of the planet can roll by as if I were looking at a screensaver...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want a camera mode that is designed for this. Is it is now, all camera modes are relative to the craft. This means that the planet will fall out of view when the craft goes behind it. How about a 4th camera mode that always keeps the nearest space body visible behind the vessel at all times?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amaroq","CreatedById":57607,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T03:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh. Wow. Yeah, orient the camera so that it is pointing from one side of my craft, through my craft, to the center of the SOI. Very good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T03:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, there are two methods I know of so you can get beautiful rolling-by views.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a close-up experience, try using a Cupola module or a lander can (or any pod with a good set of windows), go IVA, and zoom in until you can\u0027t see the sides of the windows. This makes for an epic view, and if you go to 10x warp, it looks simply spectacular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a farther-out view, simply use any old craft in any orbit you want, and zoom out like crazy. Eventually, your craft will no longer be drawn, and the view of the planet or other body will be hardly changed at all. This is a great view for seeing sunrises/sets or looking at Munar eclipses!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor best results, press F2 to disable the HUD and stuff. These two methods I\u0027ve actually used in my filming (albeit films that I won\u0027t upload, they were just for testing purposes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T03:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmm, isn\u0027t this what free mode does? If you don\u0027t like that the craft seems to tumble, then just install MJ and use Smart A.S.S. to hold a heading relative to the surface, F2, physwarp, and enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T05:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maximus97\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Maximus97\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor a farther-out view, simply use any old craft in any orbit you want, and zoom out like crazy.
