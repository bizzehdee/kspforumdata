I think a Museum would be a great addition to the kerbal space center. Here you can find all the kerbals accomplishments. When ever you plant a new flag a kerbal would be carrying a camera that they carry so when you take a picture that picture would be sent to the Museum and you could write out the explanation of what happened that day, and if you don\u0027t like a picture you could send it to the \u0022Top Secret\u0022 folder where you can decide to delete it or keep it there. The museum could also come in handy with money. The more objects in the museum the more tourists and that means more money! This could also hold another Celestial Bodies dirt or rock that you would bring back and put in the museum. The most uncommon things benefit you by having more tourists, increasing you money! The camera can be used anywhere, such as space walks, inside the capsules, planets, moons,etc. But (This will be tailored by another suggestion) if you were to send monkeys into space or whatever creature equivalent to monkeys up there, they can\u0027t use cameras. This will bring a bigger use of kerbals instead of using computer based rockets. There would also be a camera part for rovers. Such as the Curiosity rover. As well as a scoop thingy to scan rocks, BUT you can\u0027t bring rocks back! This would bring a greater use to kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me your take on the suggestion!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-16T19:25:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2013 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Hoagster35\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T19:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis has been suggested a lot and lot of times\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49955-Flight-History-and-Museum?highlight=museum\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49955-Flight-History-and-Museum?highlight=museum\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48447-Mission-Pictures-Rock-Samples-Kerbal-Museum?highlight=museum\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48447-Mission-Pictures-Rock-Samples-Kerbal-Museum?highlight=museum\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46699-Recoverable-Randomly-Generated-Artifacts-with-Display-Museum?highlight=museum\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46699-Recoverable-Randomly-Generated-Artifacts-with-Display-Museum?highlight=museum\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45688-Space-and-aeronautics-museum?highlight=museum\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45688-Space-and-aeronautics-museum?highlight=museum\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
