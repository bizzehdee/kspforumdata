I\u0027m unrepentantAuthor, real name Jack. I\u0027ve been playing KSP on and off since v0.21 or v0.22 - I can\u0027t recall - and I\u0027ve occasionally dipped into the online community here and elsewhere as a lurker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started playing again the other day when I realised I was missing it, but I struggled to find a meaningful experience. I used to push myself to land on all the celestial bodies and conduct more efficient missions to them, but I think I just lose my sense of direction fast in sandboxes with so few innate goals - particularly as career mode in v0.23 is effectively over after an ambitious moon landing. After that, and watching YouTube videos of KSP creations I could not possibly hope to match, I became very briefly frustrated at my own lack of ability and direction - but then I resolved to improve. I wish to strive towards the proficiency demonstrated by these titans of Kerbal YouTube videos, and I thought that maybe, joining the forums would help push me towards that. I like a good community, too, despite being quite anxious about new people and large groups of them especially. It will be a pleasure to meet you all, I\u0027m sure!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027m rusty, I\u0027ve made a manned return trip to Eeloo before, barely, and I can just about manage rendezvous and docking. I pick up new skills fast if given decent guidance, and I love learning how to solve space engineering problems. I\u0027m receptive towards mods and I believe MechJeb is a personal choice. I play the game to build stuff, mostly, so I allow myself its use, but fear not; I can fly almost anything I tell my autopilot to do. Spaceplanes fascinate and terrify me. I look forward to looking back on this post as a veteran who\u0027s set foot on Eve, borne by SSTO, and returned intact!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA very good evening to you all~\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-06T18:58:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2014 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by unrepentantAuthor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T18:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Jack, it\u0027s good to see another new(ish) fan of KSP join the forums, you\u0027ll find a lot of players here who can give you ideas and encouragement \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T00:26:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re in need of direction you might be pleased to know that the upcoming 0.24 update (about which you can find a few more details \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/279-0-24-Update-Update\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/284-0-24-Update-Update-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E) are going to be adding contracts (and a budgeting system within which they can function), which may help give you some more immediate and concrete goals to achieve as you play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you mentioned you\u0027re brushing up on your skills, I\u0027m going to recommend that you check out some of the resources I\u0027ve collected on the Drawing Board, which is conveniently linked in my signature. Some of them are more specifically targeted at new players, but I try to include a wide variety so that even old hands have the opportunity to learn a new trick or two. Also, feel free to ask questions if you get stuck (or even help newer, less experienced users with their own questions, if you know something that they might find helpful).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
