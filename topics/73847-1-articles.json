You can visit all nine or ten biomes on Minmus (plus the two orbital ones) in a single mission easily. This yields a truly ridiculous amount of science. You can get more visiting Minmus with 3 goos and 3 mat labs with a basic lander (ditch two in orbit after collecting upper and lower) than you can get for visiting and landing on both Ike and Duna with an experiment cleaner, which requires a far bigger rocket, re-docking your lander and stuff like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mun biomes aren\u0027t so bad because getting around on the Mun is annoying- the relatively high gravity (at least in comparison to Minmus), poorer visibility due to the colour, and rougher terrain, makes it relatively expensive to visit more than a couple of biomes in a single trip, especially when considering the increased fuel you need to get off it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbin biomes are the other way around. They yield so little science that once you\u0027ve researched the first 3-4 technologies, you basically have to get to Mun or Minmus to get any decent science income. Grubbing around on Kerbin for biomes takes forever and yields virtually nothing- especially since you cannot automatically harvest the biomes but have to spam the EVA report button. Compared to building a slightly bigger rocket and going to Mun, Minmus or solar orbit, the biomes on Kerbin are useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, I don\u0027t feel that players want to hang around on Kerbin. I would just double or triple the science for, say, lower and upper Kerbin orbit, then remove the Kerbin biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus needs to have the number of biomes or the science awarded drastically reduced to bring it more in line with the other options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I feel like the biome information available to the player is way too limited. It\u0027s obvious that there are different biomes, but how many, where they are, and if you just entered one isn\u0027t presented. For example, Gilly\u0027s \u0022Low\u0022 is way below 1x timewarp and nearly at the point where you start smacking into the highest elevations, but it\u0027ll take more than one orbit (at 1x) before you discover how low \u0022Low\u0022 actually is. I feel like this information should be more readily presented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NERVAfan","CreatedById":72817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T20:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the fact that there is way more science than you need so that you aren\u0027t pushed into visiting everything -- having \u0022too much\u0022 science lets you choose your own path/order of doing things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T20:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does seem odd that the Mun and Minmus can provide more science than Duna and Ike.

Personally I don\u0027t go to Minmus that often -- while Mun takes more delta-v to land on and return from, it\u0027s well within the range of rockets I\u0027m comfortable building, and I find it easier because I can actually see the Mun rise above the horizon and thus know when to burn to get there. For Minmus I have to guesstimate it from map view. I can get to the Mun every attempt, but I have maybe a 50% (if that) success rate on getting Minmus encounters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the couple of times I did land on Minmus, I ended up on really extreme slopes, which was also annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus, yeah, gives you more science for a given delta-v, but unless you are specifically trying for that kind of efficiency, I really don\u0027t see why it matters... different playstyles, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T02:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeadMG\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DeadMG\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre you kidding?
