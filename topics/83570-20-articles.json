I just now realised it is because the majority of Mk2 parts come at supersonic flight in the techtree but the Mk2 cargobays are at high altitude flight which also happens to be when the bulk of the S2 parts including the S2 cargobays get unlocked. So in effect, the Mk2 cargobays get superseded at the very moment they get unlocked. Just a suggestion, but it seems a bit odd to me. I have edited the required tech on the Mk2 cargo bays for myself this time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely loving all of B9 R5... thanks a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KamaKaZzie","CreatedById":119980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T05:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wondering how feasible it would be to include a package that enlarged the size of the launch pad?

Another nitpick: IMO the landing gear wheel behavior is not very convincing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can basically do 360 degree spins around your vertical axis on the runway. It happens mostly at low speeds. For instance when i touched down for landing, and i slowed down to 5 m/s or so, i can do this! Although it needs a lot of control force. Even if i don\u0027t do this and just apply full brakes, the craft starts sliding sideways and slides and slides. Takes very long to stop. I expect it to roll over and explode. Or at least stop very rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
