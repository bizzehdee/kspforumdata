With your help I figured out the problem. Has to do with the fact that I use a custom keyboard layout. On all games I play, I prefer to map movement keys to the numberpad on the right hand side of the keyboard. This works fine normally. But when I tried using shift with those keys, it just rotated the camera view in the SPH/VAB. So I remapped to standard WASD config and the shift key works as advertised. I think what I can also do is set the keys in the config with alternate settings so that I can use both methods. And remember to use the WASD \u002B Shift for the fine rotation. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
