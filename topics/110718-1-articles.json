Back in those High And Far Off Days Of Gods And Heroes, Duna\u0027s atmosphere was very analogous to the clich\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 description of Mars\u0027 atmosphere: \u0022too thin to ignore, too thin to be useful\u0022. Making anything fly at all was a challenge. Being able to control it was a bigger challenge. Being able to land safely was even worse. And then, having made something capable of all that, getting it from the ground on Kerbin to Duna was even harder. I had a challenge thread for making a flying machine for Duna, active for about 2 years, and only about 10 people ever managed to succeed at it.\n\nBut now we have 1.0.2 and it\u0027s a totally different story. Duna\u0027s atmosphere has become the opposite of the clich\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9. Now, it is most accurately described as being \u0022thin enough to ignore completely yet thick enough to fly in effortlessly should you so desire\u0022. It is now exceedingly easy to fly on Duna and I expect, if things remain as they are, that everybody will be doing this as a matter of routine in preferrence to long-range rover trips. Ironic, isn\u0027t it? So many folks whining about how the new aero stuff makes flying difficult, when on Duna it makes it way too easy. So I\u0027ve closed my challenge thread.\n\nAnyway, whatever you think about the 1.0.2 aero stuff on Kerbin, when applied to Duna, it\u0027s not at all a good thing. Anybody else notice this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tada","CreatedById":57283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T23:41:26Z","Content":"Meh, duna atmosphere treats me same as it did in previous versions..."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T23:42:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Meh, duna atmosphere treats me same as it did in previous versions...\n\nYou obviously never tried to fly an airplane there."},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T23:56:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You obviously never tried to fly an airplane there.\n\nI have.

Still need to pack heavy chutes like I did in 0.25.\n\nActually, what you describe is the pre-1.x situation, especially if you really wanted to fly anywhere on Duna, not just landing in the smooth, low-altitude basins. If you wanted to land out in the main dune fields which cover 80% of Duna\u0027s surface, at altidues averaging 2000m or so, which used to be the equivalent of about 16km on Kerbin, you needed a real Gossamer Albatros sort of plane. Which is what you\u0027d expect given the very thin air.\n\nNowadays, however, all control surfaces, including airbrakes, work nearly as well on Duna ss they do on Kerbin, and you get way more lift out of way less wing. The result is that you can fly what are, compared to pre-1.x, absolute bricks all over Duna no problem. You can fly much higher, go faster, land slower, and stop shorter at higher alitutude.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I didn\u0027t really have a problem back in 0.90:\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/pxadYKq.png](http://i.imgur.com/pxadYKq.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E That was my long-range SSTO spaceplane, designed to go straight to Laythe from Kerbin without refueling.

It would probably fly along just fine at idle speed these days, however.\n\nCheck out some of the entries in my old challenge thread and compare them to your thing. For example:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50619-CLOSED-Flying-Duna-AGAIN-%28Thanks-for-Participating%29?p=1039168\u0026viewfull=1#post1039168](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50619-CLOSED-Flying-Duna-AGAIN-%28Thanks-for-Participating%29?p=1039168\u0026viewfull=1#post1039168)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50619-CLOSED-Flying-Duna-AGAIN-%28Thanks-for-Participating%29?p=1073737\u0026viewfull=1#post1073737](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50619-CLOSED-Flying-Duna-AGAIN-%28Thanks-for-Participating%29?p=1073737\u0026viewfull=1#post1073737)\n\nNow compare all that to this thing I made today. Just slapped it together, no thought involved, and it blew all the parameters of the old challenge completely out of the water in terms of performance and payload. In the old days, folks would do without cockpits just to save weight. Nowadays, that\u0027s not an issue at all due to all the lift we now have on Duna.\n\n[![18049468792_42cd60536f_z.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5325/18049468792_42cd60536f_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/tuYfeN)\n\nIt could land at 30m/s at 3000m ground altitude, which was essentially impossible pre-1.x, Yet it could exceed 20km and reach nearly 400m/s on just 1 electric prop, whereas previously most planes struggled to reach 5km and barely topped 100m/s.
