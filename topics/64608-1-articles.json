You can\u0027t build too extravagant of a spaceship just to reach the Mun. My idea is has 2 options to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E First is that if any part of the ship is safely recoverable and still intact, that that whole part actually goes into a new button in the Hangar, which is \u0022Recovered Parts\u0022. These parts act like the \u0022pre designed\u0022 parts, which you can then equip back onto your ship free of charge. If they are fuel parts, then you still have to pay a small cost to refuel the part but the main chunk of cost is knocked off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond option is that the cost is simply refunded entirely back to your account. As if the part was recycled. Simpler to do, and still gets the job done ultimately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond idea are timed ignitions of stages. Which would play into my idea above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say you have a rather large rocket, and to make sure the stages separate nicely you have those fancy little staging boosters on them to push them away from the ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they separate you can no longer control them. So if the timer was added in, you could put a parachute on the fuel tank, timed to go off 4 seconds after you activate the stage to decouple the engine. So now, even though you have no control over anything on that fuel tank and engine, and it\u0027s now free falling towards Kerbal, the parachute will still go off 4 seconds later to make sure that it falls safely into the water to be retrieved later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
