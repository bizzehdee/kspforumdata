Your engine(s) are too strong. An obvious solution is to use a less powerful (and usually more efficient) engine. Another is to right click your engine and limit the max thrust to for example 25%.

You then set your lander legs on those outboard tanks, which then widens and shortens your stack and makes it less prone to tipping over on landing (which is an issue a lot of us have faced the first few times we make it down without \u0027sploding - correctable with pod torque on Minmus but a catastrophic mission killer on Mun). If you haven\u0027t got fuel ducts, keep the FL-T400 but put the lander legs out on Modular Girder Segments; this does nothing to shorten the stack but it at least makes it wider and you should still have enough fuel to make it there and back.

When I play the demo, I still use that method. What you do is after you\u0027ve made your braking burn and you\u0027re pretty much vertical, go IVA and look for a gauge that looks like this one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.navfltsm.addr.com/collins-ra.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022collins-ra.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe needle won\u0027t twitch until you\u0027re closer than 2,500 meters to the surface. Once it reads 2,000, go back to staging view (hit \u0022c\u0022 to toggle between IVA and staging view) and \u003Cstrong\u003Enote your altimeter reading\u003C/strong\u003E. Take 2,000 off of that reading; the result is the rough elevation of the deck. Use that estimate to slow down. If you need to, occasionally go back to IVA and glance at the gauge again to figure out how much further you\u0027ve got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the basic design I mentioned in my last post, bingo fuel is at 80 liquid fuel units. At 90, be thinking about heading back into space if you\u0027re not close to the deck. At 80, you better be hitting space. At 70, you might as well finish landing because you\u0027re not making it back to Kerbin...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast bit of advice I can give: hit F5 before you make the landing attempt and hit F9 when you mess it up. Practice, practice, practice until you get it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-30T13:41:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2014 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T13:57:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that radar altimeter is, as I recal, only available in the lander cans, not in the MK1 pod\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T14:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use the smallest Rockomax tank on my lander to give a nice wide base for the feet, and enough fuel for a 909 land me on the mun and get back to Kerbin with a materials lab, a couple of goo canisters, and a Mk1 capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood tip on the radar altimeter, I\u0027d assumed that was something I\u0027d eventually be able to research and add on to the ship.
