The full report on the incident can be found under document number K-IIC-0046308-F.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reported communications between Rocker-X3ANSZ and R-0DN361 is problematic. The details presented by Pilot Maxanne Kerman and available telemetry are conflicting. Summary time line is as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Pilot Maxanne reported she disabled several systems as part of the process of stabilizing the situation. This included portions of life-support and telemetry recording. The only communication equipment available was the C-16 class equipment in audio only mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Pilot Maxanne was able to make contact with another craft. The craft reported its name to be Rocker-0DN361, call sign Kotan. It reported that it was on an outbound trip to asteroid ZYH786. At the time both craft would have been in the Kerbin relative radio shadow of the sun. R-0DN361 would relay the report of the incident once he resumed contact with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- During the duration of the contact R-0DN361 provided Pilot Maxanne with both psychological and technical assistance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- R-X3ANSZ was in the radio shadow for approximately three hours after reportedly loosing contact with R-0DN361. After Deep Space Tracking indicated that R-X3ANSZ left the radio shadow \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E sent a one way message advising of receipt of the relay package.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- R-X3ANSZ was recovered seventy-nine days later and is undergoing repair and refit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe details in conflict are as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Deep Space Tracking reports there were no craft with a trajectory that would have brought it with in C-16 communication distance with R-X3ANSZ.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Upon recovery of R-X3ANSZ critical damage was observed to all communications systems, with sufficient repairs made to the C-16 to allow basic operation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The transit record indicated that it was broadcast from the C-16 antenna of R-X3ANSZ. The transit record was damaged during transmission. The corruption centered on the record of intermediate relays of the message. That section of the package was determined to be unrecoverable. \u00A0However, there are indications elsewhere in the package that the message was formatted using older, but still valid, data protocols.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- R-0DN361 reported that it was outbound to asteroid ZYH786. This asteroid was catalogued two years ago. No mission to it is currently scheduled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Pilot Maxanne reported details about R-0DN361 and Kotan while not of confidential or higher classification are not general knowledge. Some of the details predate Pilot Maxanne\u2019s enrollment in the Rocker Group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Kotan was aware of details about systems on R-X3ANSZ while not of confidential or higher classification that were part of a refit three years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The registry of R-0DN361 is unique and was registered twenty five years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The call sign \u201CKotan\u201D appears in the registry three times. Only one of which appears in the SR-Pilot registry during the active life of R-0DN361.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- R-0DN361 was recorded as lost nineteen years ago. The suspected cause is catastrophic reactor failure. Details of the investigation can be found in file K-IIC-00313031.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has been recommended that the flight status of R-0DN361 not be communicated to Pilot Maxanne. It is also recommended that Pilot Maxanne be returned to active status once psychological and physical evaluations are suitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
