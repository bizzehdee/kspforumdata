The empire formerly dominated the whole Kerbol system and were planning to expand to different star systems, when the Great Rebellion happened. After the rebellion, Jool was left with three of it\u0027s five moons, and two planets, Dres and Eeloo. Enraged of their failure by the rebellion, when Duna declared war on Kerbin, therefore purging the rebels into war, they quickly regained half of Duna, the other half being dominated by Kerbin, and the Dunanese fleeing to Eve. Will Jool reconquer Duna? Will they rebuild their empire and stand the test of time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbo-Laythian Alliance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the Great Rebellion, Kerbin and Laythe quickly formed friendly relations with each other. Laythe, with ownership of Vall as well as their home moon, quickly sent satellites equipped with warheads, ready to strike Jool, should the Joolians try to reconquer them. Suddenly, after the Dunanese declaration of war with Kerbin, Laythe was quick to jump in with full support of Kerbin, whilst Eve fought with Duna. Duna was quickly conquered by Jool \u0026amp; Kerbin, and the Kerbals are mobilizing for an invasion of Eve. Will they end the Joolian purge? Will they conquer Eve? Will they stand the test of time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEvian-Dunanese Alliance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the Great Rebellion ended, Eve quickly fostered friendly relations with Duna. Duna, scared of an invasion from any side, sent satellites in orbit around them and Ike in fear of either Jool or Kerbin attacking them. Eve, being the most technologically advanced planet in the system, donated their tech to help the Dunanese war effort. Eventually, out of fear that Kerbin was already mobilizing, Duna declared war. With Evian reinforcements not being able to arrive in time to battle the invading Kerbals and Joolians, the reinforcements were converted to bases and escape crafts for Dunanese refugees. Most refugess went to Eve, but some stayed in Ike. Now Eve, being the only surviving planet with ownership of Gilly and Moho, must be ready for invasion. Will they survive the assault? Will they stand the test of time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EVehicle Equipment\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStandard - The armies are the army you would expect to see in the 1950\u0027s, during the early cold war.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool - Jool is dedicated to military strength, so they usually focus or warships, warheads, and infantry transports. Unlike the standard 15 infantry packaging of other factions, they can deploy troops in packages of 20. Their special unit iis the Royal Pikemen, who is good in melee, but the Joolians also developed a solid propelled pike end for the pikemen, doubling the pike as a bazooka. Military vehicles are much cheaper for the Joolians than any other faction, so they can create a formidable army in a short amount of time. Other than that, they have standard military units, except better disciplined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbo-Laythian - The alliance has a mostly regular arsenal of military equipment. However, they have slightly better engines than Jool, both in the TWR and ISP departement. With that, they can form a decent fleet in a short time, being able to defend against enemy forces. Given time, an offensive force can be created, being able to attack Jool. Laythe also has baby nukes, which are weaker than standard nuclear warheads, but can easily be created in a short time to bombard Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvian-Dunanese - Eve, being the technological powerhouse that they are, have four unique attributes: pasnidels, bansk troopers, ubermensch engines, and antimatter warheads. Pasnidels have a katana-bazooka thing that launches 20 small explosive pellets in a single volley. The weapon takes about 1/4 the time it took to reload a musket to reload a pasnidel weapon. The katana part is the barrel which is also a blade, making pasnidels excel in melee. Bansk troops have a gun that switches betwwen shotgun and sniper rifle. The weapon includes homing rounds, making bansk troopers incredible in combat. Ubermensch engines are designed to escape from Eve\u0027s heavy gravity, having a thrust of 4000, and an ISP comparable to that of a skipper. Antimatter warheads are devastating and can easily destroy a whole colony with a single explosion. Duna is pretty much useless until their planet is retaken by them, which then they have an average force with a touch of Evian tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EBattles\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite about battles in this space below!

The Class-37 Ionic Propulsion, nicknamed \u0022Electronic Storm by the crew because of its occasional release of high voltage shocks and the occasional fatal dose of Gamma particles, was the cheapest and easiest propulsion system for the Interplanetary-Grade cargo vessel \u0022Goliath\u0022. Goliath was armed with the latest and greatest in safety and anti-threat measures. Now, the bi-monthly runs were routine, transfer to a very far Jool orbit (Outside Joolian militarized space), burn to a perfect Layth or Vall encounter, then hop to the desired target among the moons. Since the destruction of the Kerbo-Lathian super capital ship above Kerbin, runs needed to be faster and quieter. With rumors of Joolian military technicians creating a sort of \u0022Hyper-sonic in atmosphere nuclear projectile\u0022 the size of a Mk. 1 command pod. What stood out to the ship\u0027s captain, Shean Kerman, was the fact that even through all this off planet chaos, no word of acivity in the Joolian activity had been reported. No scout missions, no launches, no anything. Heck, the last 5 missions have gone without as much as a sight of anything non-alliance. Either run their luck or investigate were the only two options seen by Shean. As the craft was being loaded up, news blared across the orbital facility: NEW JOOLIAN MISSILES LAUNCHED FROM IN ORBIT CRUISERS DESTROY MOST OF LAYTHIAN CAPITAL MANUFACTURING AND RESIDENTIAL. This brought the death count to \u002B1 million. Still in both shock and awe, the facility cargo boss announces a new mission is in place of the cargo run. They would still run blind in a high Jool obit, but this time, they would carry 45 50 Megaton nuclear missiles. The idea was to use a lighter missile frame and payload to strike both the in-orbit war machines and the Tylo manufacturing and industrial facilities. As the craft was released and the SOI escape burn commenced, Shean had that ugly feeling inside. Not a moral problem, but a mental one. He didn\u0027t feel right going into this. He just thought that... it wasn\u0027t going to be that easy. As the burn went on, Shean stared out to the great black studded blanket in front of him. He could see the wonderful star Kerbol, with the transit of Eve and Moho pass by. What wonderful and serene places they looked, but marbles in the sky. As Shean thought about the sight, the engines stopped, lurching him forward a bit. The faded red dot of Duna was below him, once the site of beautiful cities and wonderful people, now just a mess. War was evil, Shean thought, but a necessary one at that. After lapping the ship many times, inspecting the cargo, and running about as many tests as you could, Shean occupied himself long enough for the journey to finish. But something was wrong. Jool was nowhere to be seen. Out Sheans window, the ball of green gas would be visible, but now its gone. Smoke filled the cabin, screaming was heard. Something had gone wrong. Very, very wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose engines. Those unreliable, cheap engines. They cut out too early and nearly tore the ship apart. Now they were just a hunk of smoldering space junk in enemy space. But, where was enemy space? where was Jool? As the ship slightly turned on its axis, it saw the truth. The horrible, ugly truth. The outermost edge of Jool was 5000k from that window. The vibrations of distant shock waves hit the walls, knocking off every picture of home Shean had. They were here. And they wanted blood. The siren came on and the lights went red as the crude arms the kerbals had packed were displayed in hands. Each kerbal fastened his helmet and prayed. The airlock opened, shooting the kerbals out in a suicide blitz towards the cruisers. Shean saw in horror as every puff of smoke erupted in the space. The already crippled vessel took so many more hits before the captain could to no more. Shean ordered a ship-wide evacuation and stood tall. His blood stained face, looking far off to the distant Tylo fleet. In his eyes, there say no longer the innocent boy from Ike who was separated from his family as the bombs fell, he was single kerbal who would get revenge. A smile rose across his face as a he said his final words. His departing words. The words that would end his own life, but start something new. Something that would create a new foot in the war for the alliance to stand on. A hand slammed on the red button, and the cargo doors opened. All 45 nukes flew out into the fleet of ships. And that smile stayed on his face as long as he remained. The shock waves of the nukes lanched debris in all directions, with the largest cruiser of them all flying towards poor Goliath. Goliath met the Tylo ship David in the direct center, smashing the vessel into many parts. Each and every part entered the green depths of Jool, with Shean on board. And that smile remained.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"botse","CreatedById":39993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T04:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Ekerbol news\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrange goings on\u0027s have been herd of in moho orbit a evian probe sent to find out has been attacked by a unknown power the larst pic the evians got was of a huge dry dock with a ship in it the public are calling them \u0027the sun\u0027 thanks to there logo on the ships\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been ENN\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-29T04:24:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2013 04:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by botse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sytaline","CreatedById":64225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T07:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EE.B.C one radio transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the burn to escape Kerbol\u0027s influence Jebediah kerman in his newly built kerbellian skyhawk intercepter flew in with two lazor guided missiles and shot the probe straight out of the sky.We asked the president of Eve how he felt and he told us that he thought it was a crime not only against Eve but science itself!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat concludes this radio broadcast.
