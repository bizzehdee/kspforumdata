If so, you could just de-orbit that one section and send it back up without the winch. That would work so long as it isn\u0027t the core part and you happen to have a tug handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS winches only have 50m of slack but your idea might work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for file editing, are you using the inline one or the non-inline one? IN the latter case, make sure you get the winch, connector, and any attachment it might be on (grappling hook, electromagnet, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CorruptDB","CreatedById":75308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T16:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a non-inline winch, I think it is called the vertical stack winch in the VAB. It is hooked to one of the nodes on the standard 6 node connector. The only thing it should have attached to it are the connector (which I also removed from the file) and a couple of struts. If the file layout is a tree it should be the second to last thing (connector being last) on that branch so I have no idea why the rest of the station would depend in it being there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CorruptDB","CreatedById":75308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T16:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, and regarding the 50m vs 100m of slack, I was envisioning being all the way taut on one side then thrusting the opposite direction (passing near the winch in the middle of the burn) so 100m total.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T16:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CorruptDB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CorruptDB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am trying to remove a KAS winch (actually 2 winches) from a space station.

Bring something alongside like maybe a big orange tank with some reaction wheels and a remote control unit then line it up and pitch forwards or backwards and just smack that sucker off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther option is go back to editing the persistence file but instead of deleting the part, change it to something else. (and be sure to delete the modules on the part so that it stops thinking it\u0027s a winch)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why it failed is probably something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EsrfN = None, -1\u003Cbr\u003EattN = top, 1\u003Cbr\u003EattN = bottom, 3\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not 100% certain but I believe that the last digit indicates the the part number on the vessel. By outright removing a part you changed the ordinal position of every part after it. In the above example, this happens to be part #2 (first part is #0 btw) and part #1 is attached above. Part #3 is attached below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lets say your winch was part #13. The part that it\u0027s attached to would have one of the nodes having the #13 at the end. Say you had it attached to one of those adapters that lets you surface mount (winches aren\u0027t surface mountable are they?) The adapter piece might say something like attN = top, 13. But you deleted it so now something else is #13 and it confuses the hell out of KSP because basically everything after a certain point can\u0027t be logically connected in the way that they say they are. Make sense? You\u0027d have to go through and re-number everything with no margin for error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: actually I lied, I am certain that\u0027s how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CorruptDB","CreatedById":75308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T22:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a ton for the detailed answer Starwaster.

The key thing is to make sure you get ALL the references to it. I don\u0027t know what it does if you fail to do so in the save file itself, but if you miss a reference in a .craft file it screws the game up something fierce when you try to load it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key thing here is that the link system works by putting a reference to the link on BOTH SIDES of the link. So the winch contains a reference to the connector, the connect contains a reference to the winch, the winch contains a reference to whatever it\u0027s attached to, and whatever it\u0027s attached to has a reference to the winch. The VAB really, really hates dangling references (it actually locks the edit up and you have to force close the game), and I can\u0027t imagine the actual game handles them any better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d have to get anything that was radially attached to the winch too, and all the references to that as well.
