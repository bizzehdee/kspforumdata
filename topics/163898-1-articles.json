At least she could control herself to the point of not trying to yank his clothes off when the pheromones took over. Another head shake. He rummaged around in his black suitcase to find the thing he wanted to discuss with her. A little black box, textured like soft felt. It contained something he found in Duna\u2019s canyons that the R\u0026amp;D guys put together for him. He opened the box. There lay a gold ring and on top, a beautifully cut, modestly sized diamond that reflected the munlight like a disco ball in the room.

They\u2019ve been in a secret relationship since the 60s and nobody else knew except for Bill. Valentina walked out with her normal behaviour again, carefully packing the eggs into the cooler with the clear wrap. The munlight made her look as young as she did back then. But back then, they were in it for fun and genuine friendship. Now, there was a clear lack of libido and motivation to go out on the town.
