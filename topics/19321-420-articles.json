So far, so good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I just returned from a test flight (testing reenty heating with modified heat config values), and on the capsule, I had both a mk16 main chute and a pair of mk12-R drogues. And what I noticed on descent is that apparently the drogue chutes produce exactly as much drag as the main chute does (that is, a single drogue chute fully equaled the mk16). Checking the info panel, that sort of makes sense in the way that both of these have the same deployed area, which I presume is the main figure that\u0027s taken into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut doesn\u0027t that kind of invalidate having a difference between drogues and main chutes at all? Also, if the drogues are as good as main chutes, but deploy safely at higher speeds, that makes them just massively better all around. Stock KSP has a drag multiplier that is set higher on the main chute than on the drogue, but it seems to have gotten lost in the transition to RealChute lite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that the mk16 main chute actually isn\u0027t able to slow a single starter pod down below 7 m/s before touching down. In stock, it would be able to do so, even with one or two extra parts attached. That\u0027s important for career mode, where this is the only parachute you have available at the start, yet pretty much all the parts you have (other than the pod and the modular girders) don\u0027t survive touchdowns over 6 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now have a whole bunch of questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If I wanted to edit the various parachutes\u0027 ability to generate drag in order to differentiate drogues from main chutes in my save, how would I go about doing so with FAR installed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are safe parachute deployment speeds a thing with FAR like they are with stock? If so, what are those safe speed limits for main chutes and drogues? Can I view or change them in configs somewhere? The stock chute safety indicator that was added in 1.0.3 didn\u0027t survive the transition to RealChute lite either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Running the latest version of FAR, manually downloaded and installed today on a fresh 1.0.4 instance.

Firing any kind of decoupler or even heating the previous stage to death results in instant runaway overheating of the payload. This will occur regardless of the reentry heat slider. In line with previous reports however it will happen anywhere so long as staging takes place, and the runaway centers on parts placed inside a cargo bay (in this case a probe core or an array of batteries are what fails. Other contents inside are fine).

I am guessing it\u0027s because I just don\u0027t know that much about aircraft, so I\u0027d be curious to learn what\u0027s going on here - or maybe whether FAR actually is doing something funky, if in fact it is. The effects I\u0027m noticing are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Flaps seem to produce a really, really large amount of drag when extended past something like 20 degrees (ish), even at low speeds. Also, the drag they produce at those angles jumps very quickly from just a little at ~5 m/s to a WHOLE lot at ~10 m/s. If they\u0027re not deflected as much, you can watch the drag vector arrow things slowly grow in proportion with speed, like the lift arrows. Is this how they work in real life? I thought flaps on something like a 747 extend to a pretty steep angle without bringing the plane to a screeching halt. The flaps at around 40-45 degrees are far more effective than airbrakes... This drag is happening at 14.4m/s. I had to go 120m/s to produce equivalent(ish) arrows from a fully-extended airbrake. Fully extending those 3 flaps (on the double-wing version) in flight at ~70 m/s basically made the plane fall out of the sky in a couple of seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/extremeflapdrag.png\u0022 alt=\u0022extremeflapdrag.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Wing area seems to correlate to slower takeoff speeds less than I imagined. I\u0027ve put absolutely massive wings on small planes, reduced wing mass on the slider in the VAB, took out fuel tanks, whatever, but it seems kind of \u0022off\u0022 somehow. For instance, I doubled the wing area on the plane in the picture, and it went from maybe 36 m/s takeoff to 33 m/s (doubled version below). The craft with single wings weighs ~9.5t, double 11.5 - middle bits are cargo bays, no fuel in rear, 40 fuel in tank behind cockpit. The wing seems absurdly large to me, like the thing should be able to take off at pretty darn slow speeds. It sits with something like 10-15 degrees of AOA on the runway; its stall speed is the same as takeoff speed, I think, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a question of not being able to nose up enough. I mean, 33 m/s is only 70ish mph, but still... Flaps help, but are my expectations unrealistic given the proportions of the plane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Flaps seem to interact strangely with the rest of the wing. When I extend flaps one notch (max deflects are 30, 37.5, 41 from outside to inside), something like 80% of the lift is lost from \u003Cem\u003Eall \u003C/em\u003Eof the wing pieces, and only the flap parts produce much lift. I would have expected that the wing parts right in front of the flaps would \u0022transfer\u0022 their lift to the flaps, so to speak, but should the entire wing lose lift uniformly?

I still am confused about a couple of points though, especially the drag of the flaps. Here\u0027s another picture - I am just guesstimating that the flaps are at roughly 50 degrees to the airflow (41 degrees deflected, something like 5 or 10 degrees of AOA from the way the wheels are). The airbrakes look like they\u0027re maybe 50 or 60 degrees to the air too. But the flaps are radically more draggy. Top speed of the aircraft with flaps at 30, 37.5, 41* is ~14 m/s. With all four airbrakes fully deployed but no flaps, it takes off just fine and top speed is something like 70 m/s. Are the airbrakes just that weak in KSP? Is it their placement that makes them so much less draggy than the flaps? The picture is at ~14 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/flapsvsairbrakes.png\u0022 alt=\u0022flapsvsairbrakes.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I think I have terminology problems and that that\u0027s the source of some of my confusion. I was thinking of angle of attack as something relative to the ground, but it\u0027s relative to the air the plane\u0027s moving through. Let me try this and see if I\u0027ve understood: Normal plane moves through air at a steady altitude. Wings are angled to hit the air at a 5* angle (or whatever), making lift in addition to whatever else makes lift on a wing, but the plane overall is perfectly parallel to the ground. Extend the flaps and their downward deflection of air makes the plane climb a little. On the navball, the angle of the plane relative to the ground might be the same, but the flaps\u0027 extra lift, which makes the plane move upward on a 5* slope, let\u0027s say, makes it so the wings are now effectively moving straight through the air - so much less lift. So that\u0027s what I\u0027m seeing here, I think. I was only focusing on the plane\u0027s angle to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T18:17:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T17:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gilflo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gilflo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHello guys\u003Cp\u003EI was on holidays and left KSP 1.0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing back I loaded 1.0.4 updated FAR and a lot of mods , then I loaded my last SSTO flying perfectly on 1.0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as it appears on runway, the temperature gauges begins to grow up to the red sector, then I got an explosion....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft seems ok, but in fact once in flight I can\u0027t handle it.
