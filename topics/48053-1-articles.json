So I have a few questions/requests for you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst: What version of MacOS are you using (listed in \u0027About This Mac\u0027 on the Apple menu)? I\u0027ve heard of others trying to run KSP on an older OS-X that doesn\u0027t support things the Unity engine needs. I /think/ Snow Leopard is supported, but I know Lion and Mountain Lion are. (Check the requirements on the Steam page.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: Can you get a screen print of the dialog boxes with missing text? \u00C3\u00A2\u00C5\u2019\u00CB\u0153 \u002B Shift \u002B 3 will save an OS-X screenshot to the desktop (unless you\u0027ve changed the default screenshot folder). \u00C3\u00A2\u00C5\u2019\u00CB\u0153 \u002B Shift \u002B 4 will let you take a screenshot of just the part of the screen you highlight. Upload the screenshot to imgur or similar and post it here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally: Failing all else, try downloading the demo from kerbalspaceprogram.com and running that instead. I\u0027ve had issues with downloading demos from Steam before for cross-platform games. It usually trys to give me some other version (though I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s not your case since it runs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played both the demo and the full game on OS-X (Mountain Lion), and I\u0027ve only really ever had issues with an occasional mod or plugin that for whatever reason doesn\u0027t like my system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: I suspect this post probably belongs in the Support and Bugs section, so don\u0027t be surprised if a mod moves it for you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T23:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould be a missing font.
