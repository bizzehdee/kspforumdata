And while it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s pretty awesome once it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s up and running, it can also be intimidating to a newer player. So I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been carefully considering the best way to overcome this hurdle without sacrificing the spirit of the mod, and after a lot of discussion and feedback, have decided to build out a lighter, friendlier version of MKS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, I am happy to introduce MKS-Lite! It will give you a taste of a lot of the MKS subsystems, but uses a much simpler resource set and more forgiving mechanics. The best part is that when you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re ready to move onto the main MKS system and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more involved processes, almost all of the knowledge you learn in MKS-L will transfer directly over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get a feel for the specifics over on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS-LITE/wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWiki\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can grab a release over on GitHub here: \u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS-LITE/releases\u0022 ipsnoembed=\u0022true\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS-LITE/releases\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConfiguration files and code are licensed under the GPL v3 license.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssets, including Models (*.mu) and Textures *.png/*.dds) are All Rights Reserved.
