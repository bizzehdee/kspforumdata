The first two crashed at speeds far exceeding the speed of sound on impact, having plenty of fuel to begin with but too little thrust and too much mass to use it efficiently while landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third ship in the line landed safely, but it was almost 400 parts and after seeing what it actually took to land there I had an epiphany.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis fourth version represents a radical re-design that accomplishes almost everything Tylo III did, but with far less fuel and only 145 parts. I\u0027m not sure if it can manage a return-trip from Duna without any modifications (it does come with parachutes), but that\u0027s my next goal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
