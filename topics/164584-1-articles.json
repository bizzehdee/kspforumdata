Starting with 1, add the previous number to get the next number in the sequence. 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was messing around a bit with the relationships between the numbers, and hit on something kind of cool. If you take any two consecutive numbers in the sequence, square them, and add them together, you\u0027ll get the number in the sequence found by adding the places of the consecutive numbers together. For example, sequence places 3 and 4: 2^2\u002B3^2=13, which is 7th number in the sequence. For sequence places 4 and 5: 3^2\u002B25^2=34, which is 9th in the sequence. This holds true for any pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, as far as I can tell. If you want the fancy formal notation of this, it would look something like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor \u003Cstrong\u003EF\u003Csub\u003En\u003C/sub\u003E=F\u003Csub\u003En-1\u003C/sub\u003E\u002BF\u003Csub\u003En-2\u003C/sub\u003E F\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E=1, F\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E=1, \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EF\u003Csub\u003En\u002B(n\u002B1)\u003C/sub\u003E=(F\u003Csub\u003En\u003C/sub\u003E)\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u002B(F\u003Csub\u003En\u002B1\u003C/sub\u003E)\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(If I\u0027ve done that wrong, please tell me.

I\u0027m chalking it up to the golden ratio being spooky. I couldn\u0027t find anything on the wikipedia page for the Fibonacci sequence about this particular feature of it, but I\u0027d be really shocked if it wasn\u0027t mentioned somewhere already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I thought this was neat and wanted to share.
