Cosmetic changes can be done, when it is clear what makes it into the game. Otherwise it would be optimization before creation... i think that would be a waste of work resulting in less progress in gameplay. Lets wait and see, where KSP wants to go. I am pretty much satisfied with what this game has to offer right now and i am surely eager to see, what SQUAD has in store for us in future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T18:36:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vostok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vostok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe not so much a reskin, but it would be nice if the tank ends were more like the new SLS parts (you can see the fuel container caps, and some internal stuff).\u003Cp\u003EThe blank flat ends just look ugly, and it doesn\u0027t feel as if they contain fuel, they\u0027re just tubes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, this.
