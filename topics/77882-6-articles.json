However, I am eavesdropping a bit on the current plans, and will definitely build my craft based in large part on how you guys work things out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you soon.
