Taking off from the mun decoupling the lower landing part (Apollo esque) and leaving the landing platform behind. When I do this my engine sometimes gets injured since it falls trough the decoupler and stops for abit and then I turn on the engine since I had to turn off the engine for my landing stage if you get what I mean? Like I have third stage landing engines and the stage after that decoupler and my take off engine. Is there a way for me to go from 0 engine power to 100 instantly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

The length of the ellipse should be approximately 10 times the diameter of the Mun (guestimated from memory, your milage may vary).

Another approach is to use a crasher stage like in the Soviet space program. One stage was used for the lunar orbit insertion and the deorbit and braking burn. Then the Lander dropped it near the surface and used the same engine for the final decent and the ascent. This is more efficient, but it has a few disadvantage, especially if you are landing at a lunar base, because dropping a bomb on your buddies each time you land is considered bad etiquette.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
