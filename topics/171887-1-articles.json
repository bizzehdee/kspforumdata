I love the new parts in 1.4 the retextures are amazing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER I don\u0027t want my service modules to be black and white for my Orion space craft. I want it to be white. The only options are orange and black and white. Further I\u0027ve noticed that the old command pod that can hold 3 people before 1.4 came out is no longer their. BRING IT BACK! In this update the new parts and retextures are awesome but why does KSP need to be based around Apollo and N1\u002BSoyuz now? This is a sandbox game not a history game. As much as I enjoy doing these old missions I don\u0027t want to be forced to do them (Figuratively). Also the new textures for rockomax X200 don\u0027t flow well on a Falcon 9 Remake.\u00A0 In short I w=just want the ability for my rocket to look like its from the 21 century without needing to replace EVERYTHING especially when its modded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbolExplorer","CreatedById":177191,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-27T20:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthats true i always thought that KSP has to old fassion parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EpicSpaceTroll139","CreatedById":162839,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-28T01:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old parts still exist in the game. You just have to look for them in the additional sort by manufacturer (or other) tabs. I think you can also find them by using the search bar. I do agree there should be more texture options on the tank textures though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
