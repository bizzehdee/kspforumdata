The problem is most likely that you have an APU (graphics are integrated into the processor), and not a standalone dedicated graphics card. I used to be able to play KSP on my integrated graphics, but now I have to use the dedicated GPU. It is not possible to upgrade the graphics card on all laptops, and if it is it may be a process which involves disassembling the whole laptop. If you were on the fence about getting a good desktop, I\\\u0027d say jump for it. However, if you were looking to keep this laptop for another couple years and a GPU upgrade is possible it may be worth the investment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T13:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a very rare and hard-to-track-down bug whereby some orbiting objects end up with impossible numbers describing their irbits.

It looks really cool, but lights shining on a large craft cause noticeable lag. My first attempt had four different ones, and it put my FPS in the basement.

Since your hardware is not a high-end gaming monster, just one floodlight might be doing this to you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the lag goes away once you get clear of the light source, that\\\u0027s probably it.
