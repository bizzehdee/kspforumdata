Jebadaiah had yet again, snuck his way onto the launch without prior approval. He kicked Raybert out of the captain\u0027s seat, and hit the manual launch override. We can\u0027t seem to keep this guy on the ground!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaybert is a new recruit to the program, and didn\u0027t know how to say no to an orange-suit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo punishment was assigned to Raybert, as this sort of thing happens a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater that afternoon, the tanker and docking complex were loaded up on the same style Minmus heavy-launcher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the Jeb incident earlier, the engineers (under direct orders of Jeb\u0027s psychiatrist) constructed a 3-man return craft on top of the whole ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill, Bob, and Raybert were sent up in the return craft, and Sigbert took his originally assigned place in the cupola module on the tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1273.photobucket.com/albums/y402/UU92/KSP/screenshot311_zps41390fc6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot311_zps41390fc6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter reaching orbit, just before jettisoning the heavy orbital portion of the craft to begin their burn to Minmus SOI, Sigbert noticed an anomaly on his dash. It appeared that the fuel tank for the next stage was... EMPTY!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe quickly relayed the info up to the return module, which didn\u0027t have the same diagnostic instrumentation, as it was bootstrapped on at the last minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill went out on an EVA to check for leaks, and came back with news for the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that the engineers had used the new-fangled docking port Sr. technology to couple the tanker to the nuclear tug, and that they had forgotten that docking ports allow for fuel crossfeed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen on the launchpad, the crew had used 6 radially balanced boosters to drain the storage tank to make launch easier (then jettisoned them to save weight), but due to this oversight, they had also drained the tug\u0027s fuel tank!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat tug was their one ticket to Minmus, and Jeb really needed to get back home for his midnight snack (you don\u0027t want to see him hungry!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no time to wait around for a refueling craft, and a mission abort wasn\u0027t an option, as there weren\u0027t enough seats in the one module with a parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Bob had an idea. He told Sigbert to transfer all of the remaining fuel in the orbital stage into the tug stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the fuel was transfered, and the orbital stage jettisoned via centripetal force, the readout in Sigbert\u0027s module displayed more than enough Dv to make the trip to Minmus, and rendezvous with the reactor core. It may not have looked like much in the tank of the orbital stage, but it was enough for almost a full tank on the tug!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1273.photobucket.com/albums/y402/UU92/KSP/screenshot312_zpsa791790e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot312_zpsa791790e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trip to Minmus was short and easy, and the crew mostly took turns counting the bits of debris that passed their windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon arriving to the small mun, Sigbert skillfully brought the heavy tanker in for a rendezvous in record time! He will be receiving a gold rendezvous ribbon when he returns from his service on the tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking went smoothly, although the monopropellant tanks were running a bit low. The normally quiet Raybert spoke up and suggested that maybe the engineers had added too many RCS thrusters. The rest of the crew agreed that 16 thrusters was a bit too many.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1273.photobucket.com/albums/y402/UU92/KSP/screenshot315_zpsb46f8257.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot315_zpsb46f8257.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station is ultimately destined for a linear layout, but a slight complication with the reactor core\u0027s tug forced an awkward docking procedure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reactor\u0027s tug is, in fact, just a big hunk of metal. There is no way to control it once it has been disconnected from the main craft. It was originally destined for a centripetal-force style ejection like the orbital stages, but due to the monopropellant shortage and a fear of not being able to complete docking, and there being no way to transfer the monoprop in the tug to the reactor core in case of an emergency, the tug was left in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tanker was almost sent up with the same style tug, but hours before launch, Bodney (an intern at the research and development center) rushed in with exciting news. He had modified the controller from his RC airplane to control a modified probe core!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new tug was fitted with such a probe core, and Raybert was handed the controller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new tug was then used to detatch, and de-orbit the old useless tug (after all the fuel had been transfered to the storage tank, of course)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1273.photobucket.com/albums/y402/UU92/KSP/screenshot317_zps872e8fd5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot317_zps872e8fd5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tug, however used up the last of the station\u0027s monopropellant resources for the maneuver, and the station must stay in an L configuration for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs all of the hard work was being done by Sigbert and Raybert, Bill and Bob got to work on THEIR mission. They had a little talk with Jeb, and lured him back to the return craft with the prospect of extra snacks (which were brought along solely for this purpose).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as the hatch was closed, the decoupler was fired, and away they went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1273.photobucket.com/albums/y402/UU92/KSP/screenshot321_zps9ad9fe5f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot321_zps9ad9fe5f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that the crew has been reorganized into their proper places, the real work could begin for Raybert and Sigbert. This real work consists mainly of sitting around and waiting for the engineers back at home base to design a roving orbital tanker to shuttle kethane from the mining rig on the surface up to their station for processing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1273.photobucket.com/albums/y402/UU92/KSP/screenshot326_zpse4cedfa2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot326_zpse4cedfa2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the more short-term, though, they will be receiving a shipment of monopropellant to put the craft into it\u0027s final linear layout, and they will be raising the station\u0027s orbit, as it\u0027s relatively close orbit now makes docking quite a chore, because the two craft being docked \u0022rotate\u0022 around themselves rather quickly, due to their orbit around Minmus being so tight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will update with more stories as I fly/write them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-28T06:23:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2013 06:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by User Unrelated\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"User Unrelated","CreatedById":74021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T04:49:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027m going to come back and spiffy this one up later.
