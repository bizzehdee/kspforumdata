Pure future.\n\nIn this future stable fusion of deuterium makes fusion drives possible. This paves the way for large cruisers of several thousand tons. Cruiser parts will integrate to Civilian Population, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and possibly other mods.\n\nHere\u0027s an early look at the overall design.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I talk about plans to make mods but end up playing Skyrim instead. Need a break from the modding.\n\nIf the fusion engines seem overpowered they are, but it\u0027s because the cruiser parts target an era where travelling within the solar system is commonplace."},{"CreatedByName":"Whizzkid","CreatedById":126892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T11:25:19Z","Content":"Ok thankyou"}]}
