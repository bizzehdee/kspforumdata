After a hectic few days I have finally had a chance to sit down and fly. Thank you Khyron42 for being so flexible in this matter. After a little technical trouble I managed to get the persistance file to work and added the neccesary mods. For my addition I chose the mecha-jeb plugin. If you arent familiar with the system , it provides a limited number of \u0027autopilot\u0027 functions that can help a clumsy pilot like me get complicated parts into orbit , or as in this case , land them somewhere safely. In this instance it was also usefull to be able to land on an exact set of co-ordinates , something that I suspect would have proved impossible otherwise. Anyways , enougth banter , onto the mission!\n\nFull Report below. If you don\\\u0027t want to see my holiday snaps , skip past to the summary\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In this first shot you can see the Launch Vehicle , my Patented \u0027maximum overkill\u0027 setup. In the fairing at the top lays the communications relay package destined for the Cloria Base.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![wjj2hd.png](http://i48.tinypic.com/wjj2hd.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E On take off the mecha-Jeb was programmed to put the craft into a equatorial orbit at about 151Km , using the small guidence fins and gimballed thrusters to adjust heading. Here it is shortly before booster stage seperation\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2wdy9ls.png](http://i46.tinypic.com/2wdy9ls.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Shortly before mecha-jeb circularised the orbit I hit the staging button to prematurely eject the first stage. There was more than sufficient fuel left in the second stage for orbital operations and I didnt want to clog up LKO with junk.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2iaefbt.png](http://i45.tinypic.com/2iaefbt.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E After a single orbit of Kerbin the Mecha-Jeb was given new instructions to line up for a trans-munar burn. Though I am more than capable of doing this part myself the advantage of mecha-jeb is that it you can alter the periapsis of your munar encounter to put it into just the right altitude for a landing , about 100km to start with.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![15ywzy9.png](http://i45.tinypic.com/15ywzy9.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E following circularisation of munar orbit I ejected the near-spent second stage and began preparations for landing\n\u003E \n\u003E ![30k7eds.png](http://i49.tinypic.com/30k7eds.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Mechajeb is capable of landing a well-built craft within metres of a given point. In this case my relatively small vehicle could by guided into place without RCS , aiming at a point close to Cloria HQ. Note the clunky mecha-jeb unit (with its green \u0027Engaged\u0027 light) , and the GUI in the corner that allows one to enter landing co-ordinates.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2ewoz8i.png](http://i48.tinypic.com/2ewoz8i.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Prepare for touchdown!\n\u003E \n\u003E ![mkurnl.png](http://i48.tinypic.com/mkurnl.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Landing was succesfull and within 5 metres of predicted site. However , much to my chargin it appears that the target was too close to the wobbly HQ lander and when the terrain loaded during landing it fell over and broke up! My apologies there chaps...at least we now brought you a big radio to call for a pick up =P\n\u003E \n\u003E ![5212cj.png](http://i50.tinypic.com/5212cj.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E The Munar Communications Unit.
