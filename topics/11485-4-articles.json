After a hectic few days I have finally had a chance to sit down and fly. Thank you Khyron42 for being so flexible in this matter. After a little technical trouble I managed to get the persistance file to work and added the neccesary mods. For my addition I chose the mecha-jeb plugin. If you arent familiar with the system , it provides a limited number of \u0027autopilot\u0027 functions that can help a clumsy pilot like me get complicated parts into orbit , or as in this case , land them somewhere safely. In this instance it was also usefull to be able to land on an exact set of co-ordinates , something that I suspect would have proved impossible otherwise.
