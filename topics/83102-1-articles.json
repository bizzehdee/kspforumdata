It happens on both 32 bit and 64 bit install. The game loads fine to the main menu and in the options menu but when i click \u0022start game\u0027\u0027, the menu transitions about halfway and everything freezes, can\u0027t do anything and have to do a hard reset. The music keeps playing tho. My launch options are LC_ALL=C %command%_64 for 64 bit and LC_ALL=C %command% for 32 bit. I replicated this bug every single time i load the game.

I will try to delete the save file and verify cache. Could it be possible that steam installed my windows save file on my linux partition ?

However, KSP 64 bit did the exact same thing (freezing before the new game menu) So i searched the web for a way of fixing this and supposedly it was an issue with AMD and the fix was to uninstall all AMD drivers and install the beta. Now I have the 32 bit libraries and steam doesnt give me errors anymore and I can launch the 32 bit ksp and it still does the same thing as the 64bit. I tried launching it with the launcher but I don\u0027t know how to give it the LC_ALL launch command thing so it freezed loading at the command module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try your fix and give you feedback tomorrow !
