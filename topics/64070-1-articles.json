Still not sure if it\u0027s possible though: you\u0027d need eight engines for each 10 tonnes your craft weighs to get that half a meter per second squared acceleration. 8 engines draw roughly 120 E/s, so, given that batteries store 20E/kg, you\u0027d need 5.8 kg of batteries for each second those engines are active (assuming you have no generators, which probably is not optimal). So to make them work for those 500 seconds, you\u0027d need 2.9 tonnes of your 10 ton space craft to be battery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not to mention the part count, by the by.
