Or are simply trying to lower the mass and part count on your docked ships? Then step right up, because I\u0027ve stumbled across a technique that will help you dock quickly and easily without using any monoprop. My apologies in advance if this is common knowledge, but I haven\u0027t seen anybody else talking about it on the forums. I call it Double SmartASS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequired elements on each ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking port (obviously)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESufficient ASAS for a decent turn rate (able to turn 180 degrees in 30 seconds or less) without RCS thrusters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERendezvous with the other ship as per usual, fairly close (50m or so)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you\u0027re in target mode, and zero out the relative velocity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl your ship from the docking port, and target the other ship\u0027s docking port (standard docking procedure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngage SmartASS on MechJeb - go into target mode, and tell it to point at the target \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit the \u0022]\u0022 key to switch to the other ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the same as above, controlling it from the docking port, targeting the other docking port, and telling SmartASS to keep the ship pointed toward the other docking port\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two ships will now be perfectly aligned towards each other - SmartASS will stay active on the other ship as long as it\u0027s within physics range\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the smaller ship and thrust towards the larger ship at .3 or .4 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake your hands off the keyboard and watch your ships dock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your vector is a little bit off, don\u0027t worry about it - the ships will rotate as they get close to each other, will maintain correct alignment, and will still complete the docking maneuver\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it!

Only I do not use any mods at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a time when I didn\u0027t mount RCS at all for the ships below 30t.
