It\u0027s a great idea that I\u0027d like to use in my own game, but I was a bit put off that it re-purposed stock parts rather than using a custom part. However, rather than complain to the mod\u0027s creator, I decided to make one myself.

I don\u0027t really have an eye for this type of thing, so everything I\u0027ve tried adding to it so far has looked... strange. I\u0027m looking for suggestions for how I should texture this model: what the tanks should look like, any decals or warning labels, etc. Just to clarify, I\u0027m not asking \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E to texture, I think I know my way around GIMP and Blender well enough.

A hot chemical reactor running on Mars/Duna would heat quicker than on Earth/Kerbin due to the thinner atmosphere and lack of radiators.
