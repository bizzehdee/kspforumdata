I also put RTGs in the plane, I just use unoccupied space in the cargo bay. The decision not to use part clipping came from pre 0.23.5 when clipping would sometimes cause crazy wobble issues that even Joint Reinforcement could not fix. Besides, it is easier to see all the parts in case you need to fix them. So i do not consider it cheating as much as inconvenience in my particular case. The only clipping i do not like is 20x intakes for an SSTO, but then again it is up to designer :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx for the tips, will try them out\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"X52","CreatedById":123254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T11:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of my disappearing ships:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei looked in the debug console and found the following errors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 times:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Exception]: NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand one time:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Log]: SmokeScreenConfig could not load config\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is definitely Smokescreen that is causing my invisible ship problem. if i remove the smokescreen folder everything works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut i don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t know what type of problems could occur without SmokeScreen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone can help me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-26T13:37:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2014 01:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tetryds\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sufficient Anonymity","CreatedById":57923,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T13:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally had some spare time to really play around with r5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/bEQnf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I\u0027d really like the ability to store parts inside other parts if there is enough free room, a bit like MFT/KAS storage except the root part takes on the part-modules of what\u0027s inside (not engines obviously) idea being that you basically stuffed the internal volume with RTGs instead of fuel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fins on RTGs are heat radiators, and need to be able to \u0022see\u0022 the outside (there must be an unobstructed sightline from the flat side of the fin to, preferably, deep space, or somewhere else that\u0027s not producing much thermal radiation) in order to function properly, as they expel heat in the form of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eblack-body radiation\u003C/a\u003E.
