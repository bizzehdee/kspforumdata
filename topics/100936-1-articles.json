Once you have that vessel, you can just use Vessel.mainBody.position, and just check if the atmospheric pressure of the vessel is \u0026gt;= 1E-6 to know if you\u0027re in the atmosphere. You might want to check Vessel.landedOrSplashed else it\u0027ll also apply when on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m no expert in quats, but I think doing LookAt like that would lock the Kerbal in that position.
