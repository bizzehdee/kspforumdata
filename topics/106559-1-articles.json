I stowed radial parachutes into service bay.\n\nHere are my observations:\n\n- packed parachutes in service bay do not generate drag, as expected\n\n- as long as the bay is closed, parachutes cannot be deployed, as expected\n\n- upon opening the bay, parachutes can be (pre)deployed normally\n\n- if parachutes are only primed while bay is open and the bay is closed afterwards, they deploy \u0022visually\u0022, but generate no drag\n\n- once the bay is reopened, parachutes \u0022kick in\u0022\n\n- the bay can be safely closed again, as parachutes, once properly deployed, function normally regardless of the bay state\n\nSo, yeah, here\u0027s me wishing that service bay opening/closing was a stageable action..."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:37:20Z","Content":"You can assign opening an closing to an hotkey, you could also combine this with parachute deployment. \n\nYou can also key cutting parachute"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T15:44:10Z","Content":"Oh... this is interesting.
