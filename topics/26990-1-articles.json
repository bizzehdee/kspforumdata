If you set up your Abort action group to shut down engines, decouple capsule, and fire sepratrons, that\u0027s all that\u0027s going to happen, even if the game for whatever reason seems to put the chutes in the same stage as the decoupler. You should then be able to use the spacebar (might take more than one tap) to trigger the chutes once the capsule is clear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blackbird","CreatedById":25505,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T16:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Conarr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Conarr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do not want the parachutes to deploy right then - they are on a separate action group.

You probably mean stage(?). The easiest way to do this is as you stated: make an actiongroup with only the parachutes so when you push e.g. the button \u00222\u0022 the chutes will deploy. If you use the abort sequence dont put the parachutes into it or they will deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"corvus2606","CreatedById":57190,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T16:43:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb 2 seems to be responsible for this happening on mine.
