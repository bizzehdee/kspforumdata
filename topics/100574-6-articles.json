I\u0027ve flown a 10% infilled ABS structure with a fairly good sized hollow space in the middle (storing avionics) to 80k feet on a weather balloon, had it fall back at 15 m/s or so, and survive unscathed. The next flight, it came down on a rock and had only a small puncture. I\u0027m currently designing a both a fixed wing model aircraft and a bi-copter to be 3d printed, and I expect them to both perform fine structurally.\n\nEDIT: As for price, I bought 2 kg of filament for $40. Even with a decent profit margin, if it\u0027s standard plastic prints, they shouldn\u0027t be terrible.
