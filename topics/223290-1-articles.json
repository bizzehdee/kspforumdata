I\u0027m basically just doing contracts to get money \u0026amp; science. One of the contracts I have accepted is one that asks me to do a crew report above a certain altitude over a certain area, so I figured the easiest thing to do would be to launch a vessel into polar orbit \u0026amp; just keep it there forever, in case more of those contracts show up. The idea being that at some point, the satellite will be over the right area, so all I have to do is timewarp until I\u0027m there. The problem is, I keep warping past that point. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0Does anyone know of a mod that automatically collects crew reports over those areas, or a mod that could stop the timewarp once I entered the area?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. If I haven\u0027t explained the problem well enough, please just let me know \u0026amp; I\u0027ll try to clarify what I mean. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Also, just FYI, I do have mods installed. One is ForScience, which does automatically collect crew reports, pressure, temperature, goo \u0026amp; Science junior data (all the science experiments I\u0027ve unlocked so far), but it doesn\u0027t do the crew reports over the specific areas. I also have Science Alert \u0026amp; Automated Science Sampler installed, but as far as I can tell, neither of them work. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0And just for the sake of completeness \u0026amp; in case there might be interference between mods, I also have Kerbal Engineer installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-27T03:04:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2024 03:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 27\u0022\u003EJanuary 27\u003C/time\u003E by Ben_9_5\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
