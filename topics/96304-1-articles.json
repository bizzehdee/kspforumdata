Using an SRB was much cheaper than using a liquid-fueled stage with the same amount of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v, but was also much heavier (which got me over the mass limit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) and was also larger (due to its lower Isp I would guess). I guess that\u0027s an aspect of using SRBs instead of LFBs: more mass and size in exchange for lower cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EDid any of that even make any sense?
