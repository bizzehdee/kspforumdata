I know some folks used both side by side (i.e. MKS with EL), but I expect with the introduction of at least two different EL-\u0026gt;Karbonite conversions that will eventually go away as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Miro Beero","CreatedById":67935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T19:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure what I am reading in this post...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs kethane still supported for .24 or its being discontinued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt tells me its not a valid mod when I load up .24 but the game seems to run just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dzikakulka","CreatedById":116606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T19:36:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMiro, when you do not know if some mod is compatible with newest KSP version, check out few last pages of the discussion (if there was any after update) - there is great chance you are not first to ask about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic tho, taniwha has provided a fix for that, you can find it in this thread and it resolves all compatibility issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spookydonut","CreatedById":10744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T19:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBye kethane, you shall be missed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hremsfeld","CreatedById":23422,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T21:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Miro Beero\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Miro Beero\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am not sure what I am reading in this post...\u003Cp\u003EIs kethane still supported for .24 or its being discontinued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt tells me its not a valid mod when I load up .24 but the game seems to run just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was re-compiled against 0.24 but not 0.24.2 - it works, but thinks it shouldn\u0027t, and there\u0027s the chance that it suddenly won\u0027t due to it not being compiled against the current version.
