It occurs most of the time right after launch between 100m and 50km in altitude. I\u0027ve also had an increase in regular crashes, mainly during loading (such as after you recover a vehicle) or transitioning from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to the launch pad. As for the BSODs though, unfortunately\u00A0they do not leave crash logs, so I can only provide crash logs for the regular crashes. When I get a BSOD during KSP, everything on my computer screen freezes completely. Sound cuts out from KSP but if I have sound in any other applications (like music or youtube videos) the sound from them will continue to play for about 10 - 20 more seconds before cutting out. After that the screen will just remain stuck for a random period of time (seems to vary between a few seconds and a few minutes) before giving me a BSOD. Sometimes it won\u0027t actually give me a BSOD though and will just remain stuck, in which case I have to manually shut down the computer. This has only been happening witih KSP and not any other games. I\u0027ll attach what crash logs I have (from regular crashes) along with my DxDiag and current saves (including quicksaves). I hope it\u0027s okay that I zipped it since it\u0027s a lot of files (most of which being the quicksaves, which is also why the file is large).\u00A0If there are any other files that might help solve this problem, let me know and I will get them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.nz/#!IbZyUaCD!68rqMdj2zqPIwLP1GxhK0tVQoUfGQLtgyYaBXqTBWPo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mega.nz/#!IbZyUaCD!68rqMdj2zqPIwLP1GxhK0tVQoUfGQLtgyYaBXqTBWPo\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(Uploaded with MEGA because it\u0027s the only place that can handle the large file.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I included the saves because I\u0027m worried that my save game as a whole (as in my main game and all quicksaves with it) might be corrupted enough to be causing problems (like crashes) but not enough for the game to always detect. I\u0027ve had to restore my save game twice with back ups due to corruptions that the game actually detected (and wouldn\u0027t let me in). If this is the case, is there anyway I can fix my save game? Backups are kind of out of the question as I have a feeling they\u0027d be corrupt too. I\u0027d be really disappointing if I had to trash this save game because I\u0027m on career mode and have put a lot of effort into it. It would also likely make me not want to play the game again for fear of the same thing happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExtra Notes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*One time, a few days ago, Steam tagged the game as uninstalled but all the files were still there. Re-installing through Steam had it do no downloads and install almost instantly (because the files were already there).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*I have verified the files through Steam twice and both times it has found one file that was messed up or missing and needed to be replaced (which it said it would do). However, it didn\u0027t tell me what these files were.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*I have yet to try re-installing because I want to know what the problem is first in case it\u0027s a confliction with something on my computer and/or something that re-installing won\u0027t fix and/or will make the problem worse. I will re-install as soon as I know what the problem is and to what extent the damage is. Note that KSP is not installed in my Program Files (x86) but rather in my D: drive because there is a lot more space there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-30T20:13:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nError.log with the crash folders show:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E0 MB physical memory [0 MB free].\u003Cbr\u003E\n0 MB paging file [0 MB free].\u003Cbr\u003E\n0 MB user address space [xxx MB free]. \u003C/em\u003E(Note: xxx = 153, 163, 164, 183 MB with the different logs)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWrite to location 02000000 caused an access violation.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst line shows amount of RAM, total installed and [free].

Otherwise it won\u0027t boot at all. But the OS shows 0 RAM being available when KSP is concerned, the amount with RAM and other memory is a OS function being invoked, the wrong info isn\u0027t from KSP, but from the OS. Indeed that info isn\u0027t correct, can\u0027t be: but is effectively what the OS is providing and that is causing KSP to crash (when it is KSP crashing, not the BSOD). As for the BSOD, you are welcome to look for help anywhere else you like:\u00A0 there is no reason you\u0027ll get\u00A0 worse help about that\u00A0 than on this forum, and I may well not waste my time trying to help with such system failures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deoxys_101","CreatedById":164762,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T05:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to update this thread:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, the issue seems to have been fixed following a graphics card update. I still sometimes get regular crashes with KSP but they correspond with the common ones that most people get (for those who do get them). I was originally going to wait at least a week for testing but decided to get this down sooner. The problem turned out to be a confliction with KSP\u0027s 1.3 update and my graphics card and overall system set up. It wasn\u0027t a hardware failure like diomedea insisted on, especially since all the tests ran for any sort of hardware failures came back negative (no problems found). This included a full version of CHKDSK which took several hours to complete. So in short, I do not have a faulty hard-drive, or any faulty hardware. The closest thing to faulty hardware that I could have had was not even my hard-drive, but my graphics adapter (relating to my computer\u0027s screen), but again this turned out to be a confliction rather than a fault after testing. So, not to slam diomedea too hard here, the issue was in fact being caused by KSP. This was later also confirmed by Microsoft Support in combination with testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[snip]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T22:28:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease do not make the discussions personal, especially if someone is attempting to offer help.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SubsonicDrifter","CreatedById":180495,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T17:13:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same problem with my KSP it occurred after I installed a mod.
