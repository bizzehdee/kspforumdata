legally binding statement from the author of a work, saying what rules apply to anyone who chooses to use that work.\u00A0 So in principle you can put whatever you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, though, I\u0027d strongly recommend that you not do so, unless you really have some especially unusual use case such that none of the

I\u0027ve been modding for years and moderating other people\u0027s mod threads for years, and still \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EI\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E would be very hesitant to craft my own custom license.\u00A0 It\u0027s hard to get right.\u00A0 If you use a \u0022standard\u0022 license, then all the bugs have already been worked out of it and you\u0027re on pretty safe ground.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFor the users\u0027 sake.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Your users, by and large, aren\u0027t lawyers either.\u00A0 Do you really want every user to have to wade through a verbose license to figure out what exactly is or isn\u0027t allowed?\u00A0 When you use a \u0022standard\u0022 license, it\u0027s something all your users have seen a zillion times before, so it\u0027s easy for them to know the do\u0027s and don\u0027ts without actually having to read all the fine print.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFor the moderators\u0027 sake.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 There aren\u0027t many of us, and we\u0027re part-time unpaid volunteers who do this as a hobby, and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewe\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E aren\u0027t lawyers, either.\u00A0 If you post your mod, sooner or later someone is going to use it in a potentially questionable fashion, and then \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewe\u0027re\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the ones who are gonna have to step in, try to get everything figured out, and scratch our heads over whether something is allowed or not.\u00A0 And without going on a multi-paragraph rant about it, suffice to say that that only scratches the surface, and would actually be a pain in various other ways, as well.\u00A0 So by using a custom license, you\u0027re making our jobs a whole lot harder and taking up a lot more of our time.\u00A0 Whereas if you use a \u0022standard\u0022 license, you make everything easy-peasy for us, because it\u0027s something we\u0027ve dealt with a zillion times before and we know exactly where we stand.\u00A0 It turns half-hour decisions into five-second decisions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EYou probably don\u0027t need it.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Seriously, there are a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of different \u0022standard\u0022 license out there, so there\u0027s one to fit just about any combination of desires on the author\u0027s part.\u00A0 We see \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehundreds\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of mods flowing through here, of many different types, with many different kinds of authors who have many different motivations and attitudes... and pretty much all of them use some standard license or other, anywhere from \u0022totally locked down All Rights Reserved\u0022 to \u0022wide open, anyone can do just about anything MIT\u0022.\u00A0 Unless you\u0027re planning on doing something with seriously bizarre requirements, the chances are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Every high\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that there\u0027s a license that suits your needs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do it... but I\u0027d suggest that your interests would be better served not to.\u00A0 Just figure out which standard license meets your needs-- there probably is one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
