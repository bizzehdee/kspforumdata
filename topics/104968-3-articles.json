The OP mentioned he objected to creating fuel \u0022out of nothing\u0022 (I\u0027m paraphrasing here) though, which is an appeal to disbelief/unrealism, so I felt obliged to point out that it\u0027s not unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd personally, I have had the \u0022don\u0027t like it? don\u0027t use it\u0022 argument used against me way back when I objected to some part testing contracts, and I admit it is kind of annoying, but I can understand why people say it and there is some validity to it. Just because you won\u0027t use something, doesn\u0027t mean it should be removed from the game. OTOH, if the game practically requires you (out of game balance, for example) to use something that you dislike, then it actually can make the whole game go sour for that person. For example, if Squad included a planet with gravity so crushing that I had to use an overpowered part that I disliked for personal reasons, like \u0022oh, this is an ion engine but it\u0027s TWR is 4,000,000 and warps spacetime!\u0022 then I\u0027d probably actually enjoy KSP less (just personal preference, guys).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Levelord\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Levelord\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe community\u0027s increasing obsession with \u0027cheating\u0027 in a sigleplayer game makes me want to smash my head on the table.

Dropping a drill into a moon and refining whatever comes up into rocket fuel is exactly what Squad is talking about. Squad should be the one googling around nasa websites. Nowhere is there any mention of tiny drills pulling up the tons of rock necessary to generate the fuel needed to launch a manned craft into orbit from a planet. Perhaps soil for growing food, or building shelters, but bulk propellant isn\u0027t on the table. The weight of processing equipment just isn\u0027t worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T07:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll this talk about \u0022realism\u0022, \u0022cheating\u0022 and \u0022overpowered\u0022 are missing the main point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a game.

The Mun at least is mostly covered by ore. I would prefer the surface be mostly barren, with small islands of ore (learn precise landing technique). I would also like it to be kind of odds based, like you see a spot of high concentration from above and it means that there is 75% chance there will be ore under you when you land. i.e. a square kilometer of high concentration will be divided into 100 blocks 75 of which have ore, the rest don\u0027t.
