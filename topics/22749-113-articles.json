IRL, MIR has three sizes of panels. 38m2 ones on the Core and Spektr module, 27m2 ones on Kvant-2 and 26m2 ones on Spektr. Also, Zarya has different panels, with only 14m2 area. I think that after rescaling to KSP size, Kvant-2 and Spektr small panels could be passed off using a single panel size.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdodders","CreatedById":85280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T22:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know of a mod with a decent Apollo CSM?
