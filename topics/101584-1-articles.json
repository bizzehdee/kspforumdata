At the very least, make some of the engineers and scientists walking around the VAB/SPH female.\n\nSo who can be replaced by another kerbal?\n\nWe have the following staff:\n\nGene Kerman (Mission Controller, based on Gene Kranz)\n\nWernher von Kerman (Lead Scientist, based on Wernher von Braun)\n\nMortimer Kerman (Lead Accountant, not based on anyone as far as I can tell)\n\nLinus Kerman (Wernher\u0027s intern, not based on anyone as far as I can tell)\n\nWalt Kerman (Head PR guy, probably based on Walt Disney, even though Disney wasn\u0027t known to walk around in a hazmat suit)\n\nGus Kerman (Head of Operations, based on astronaut Gus Grissom, or maybe just because it\u0027s funny)\n\nSo how about Katherine Kerman being the Engineer Reporter, based on Katherine Johnson?\n\nBut I think the most important thing is having female scientists and engineers in the VAB/SPH.\n\nEDIT: Upon realized that typing up a post while on painkillers is a less-than-optimal idea, I have fixed some horrible errors in morality. Even though I still kinda hate Linus because he stole my snacks on several occasions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-09T11:55:02Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2015 11:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T01:42:23Z","Content":"I thought Walt was based off of Walter White?

And a very interesting thing to do with the concept of introducing a female character. It\u0027s also realistic potentially to the circumstances.
