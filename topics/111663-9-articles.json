Sites like steam charts certainly imply the games playerbase is incredibly stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T08:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI paid like $ 16 long time ago and spent more than 2000 hours with it meanwhile.
