I\u0027m working on getting a base on the moon right now, but I\u0027m doing some testing on the launchpad first to make sure everything works. I made a rover, and I\u0027m having a lot of trouble getting it to dock with the base --\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/efklsx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022efklsx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see on the navball they\u0027re pretty close to lined up. I had it completely lined up before, like they were touching and the target reticule was exactly centered, but I didn\u0027t take a screenshot, and I got a little hasty when I went back to do it again. But anyway, even when it was even more precise, the docking ports just don\u0027t seem to engage. Am I doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the two docking ports separated... maybe I\u0027ve just built something wrong.

Like the docking magnets don\u0027t turn back on until you are done undocking. Though I can\u0027t really tell from the pictures if this applies or not, as you look pretty far away from the port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould it be that the magnets are kicking in, but they aren\u0027t strong enough to move the craft while on Kerbin? Maybe setting the brake torque to 0 would be enough to let the magnet work? Or give the wheels a little jolt to help the magnet do its job? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, that is a very cool rover and the design gives me some ideas for my own attempts at Munar mining/refueling \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: and yes the claw is very handy for docking.
