They could look much cooler (metaphorically, I mean), because they could glow a dim red when radiating heat.\n\nSolar panels being radiators doesn\u0027t make much sense, because solar panels point towards the light, but radiators are generally pointed AWAY from the sun so that they aren\u0027t heated by it.\n\nIt would just be a bit more complete now that we have a proper heat system.

To avoid the \u0022killer solution\u0022 you could make radiators require electricity. While unpowered it would act like a normal part radiating heat at some (probably good) rate, but when you powered it up it would accumulate and thus radiate heat more quickly. When you turned it off it would continue to radiate out but would also share any leftover heat back into the craft. In my head that sounds like a good balance - it\u0027d be powerful and useful but with the costs of high power requirement and danger when you turn it off that it doesn\u0027t overheat other parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:24:32Z","Content":"Absolutely.

This would add more weigh to a rocket, but it wouldn\u0027t induce drag the way that radiator panels would, so it\u0027d be a better choice for liftoff stages and boosters. It still might be too complicated to bother with, though... unless it consumes monopropellant, which stretches believability unless monopropellant is pressurized gas instead of hypergolic chemicals. It\u0027s a thought, anyway.\n\nI do really want heat radiator panels, not only for functionality but aesthetics too.

I don\u0027t know the real life ratios so I can\u0027t tell if these masses were real or not and what it takes to cool something down in vacuum, but I had a very hard time lifting these to orbit.
