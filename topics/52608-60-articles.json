If you can match the SCANsatRPM background handler configuration, this module can load from the SCANsat assembly and will have native access to all SCANsat data, this will keep modules where modules belong. RPM API was designed so that while it\u0027s kind of limited, it\u0027s consistent, simple, and does not require hardlinking at all, nor does it care about version numbers, so that would be as future-proof as it gets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailing that, though, I have no clue what to do, nor do I have a clue if the licenses for SCANsatRPM (which is GPLv3) and SCANsat itself, (which is BSDv2) can mesh in such a way.
