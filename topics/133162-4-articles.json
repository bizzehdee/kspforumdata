I don\u0027t think I ever used MechJeb\u0027s SAS functions, just the autodocking and landing indicator.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFar as Ox afterburner, that\u0027s part of KSPI-E I think. If you run that mod, you should see a different version of the engine in game that works with all the fuel options from KSPI-E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor RCS drones, I don\u0027t know if mixing docking and grabber is a great idea any more after the adaptor. The small the overall size, the more they will interfere with each other\u0027s operation... Docking and Grabber nodes are technically never OFF, Docking nodes only attach to matching nodes and nothing else, while Grabber nodes will stick to anything in range, thats why the stock grabber is so big because Squad has to retract the grabber node inside far enough so the node is out of acquire range from anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nright now what I have in mind is something about the size of the smallest stack Mono tank; about 0.5m diameter, 5 direction RCS thrusters (Maybe I could have 2 sets, one for maneuver by itself, stronger one for maneuvering large parts in concert), light SAS, enough RTG to keep it alive EC wise, ~30Mono capacity and Small low profile Grabber. Grabber would have large pivot range and relaxed capture tolerance, attach it quickly and use the pivot to adjust thrust direction. Then you have a carrier piece, that can fit up to 8 of the RCS drones, looks like a cluster bomb when all assembled, all of that in a 1.25m x 1.25~1.5m cylinder volume. Colliders would section out spaces for the drones to fit through, maybe allow quicker docking back with the carrier after use. The carrier could be part of the adaptor part, since the utility of the service bay seems to be limited, too small for most stock parts. Save the whole affair as subassembly, altogether around 10 parts for a fair bit of utility.\u00A0 Biggest problem is there\u0027s no automated process to return the drones to the carrier since you can\u0027t target with mechjeb and autodock.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll in all my goal is to have a craft around a dozen parts where I used to need 40 or 50, that will have enough endurance to stay in orbit for pretty long duration without refueling, and can move large pieces for orbital assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course another option is just to turn every large piece into a remote controlled part... that has it\u0027s own draw backs though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neutrinovore","CreatedById":72520,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T19:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222464014\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133162\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458396629\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157768\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Buster Charlie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Buster Charlie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI Don\u0027t have a mod that lets me tweak the torque value, I used to have one but felt it was a bit cheaty to be able to double the torque with no weight costs (I know no cheat in a SP game but to me it seemed too easy) I\u0027ll try disably some of the reaction wheels and RCS and see if it works..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, sorry, I do use the TweakableEverything mod, it does come in pretty handy at times.\u00A0 However, I know Squad did add in \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Etweakability to certain things, and I thought that SAS torque was one of them, but apparently that\u0027s not the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, good luck getting things tuned in, sometimes it takes a little while to figure out all the nuances of how to get things working right in the game.\u00A0 Hopefully it will be a fun process in this case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T20:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwithout TweakableEverything you can only tweak RCS thrust in the Editor. not during flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buster Charlie","CreatedById":157768,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T22:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll try tweak everything again, I had over 100 mods and pruned it down to under 70 ish, hoping i wont need to once we get 64 bit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, I love this mod, I agree 100% with your goals, that\u0027s why I\u0027m so excited by this.

If you select Target\u002B, your ship will point at the docking port, but when you get almost docked, MechJeb will torque away from docking. Instead use Par- (parallel minus) and all will be fine.

I know it will probably just be me and my noobish abilities, but I can\u0027t seem to get the drones to re-dock to the tug after using them. Do I need to leave them with their grabber enabled or should they reattach? Thanks again for all your awesome work on this Mod, love the addition of the Drones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T04:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222476451\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133162\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459137217\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158480\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PhantomC3PO\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, PhantomC3PO said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi nli2work, to start with, I want to say how much I LOVE this mod.
