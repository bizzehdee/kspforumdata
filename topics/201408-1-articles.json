The Blender model also includes two single arrow objects for the attach nodes, and a collider model. It is not currently textured because it did not save the texture I painted properly, but I now know how to fix that once I remake the texture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI cannot find any useful information for the next steps of the process. There are a lot of resources floating around, but many are out of date or consist of broken forum links, and the sheer number of irrelevant, outdated, or otherwise useless information is making it impossible to find any documentation that actually makes any sense. The closest thing I can find is Beale\u0027s tutorial \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126101-beginners-part-modding-tutorial/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, but the utility breaks down at the transition to Unity since the tutorial model was not created in Blender, and what I actually have from Blender is too different from the results of that Wings 3D process for me to get any sense out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould someone please direct me to any resource that is at least somewhat up to date that explains how to take a model made in Blender, put it into Unity, and subsequently make it a functional part in KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-01T19:13:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2021 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by septemberWaves\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-10T22:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately the information is scattered - going from memory (its been awhile so don\u0027t take these as definitive - I may have forgotten some steps)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Export you model from blender - I think dae (may require enabling a plugin) or fbx are typical or just use the .blend file directly from blender. Things to watch for - fbx my scale your model by 100 (forget if it\u0027s bigger or smaller) unless you find the setting to change it and the blender export will as far as I know give you everything - I like to have a number of related models in one file so this doesn\u0027t work well for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) import into Unity - I just drag and drop the exported file into the Unity assets pane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Add an empty GameObject (you may want to rename) to your Unity project and when you select it the inspector pane should should see a \u0022Add Component\u0022. Click this select KSP then parttools. This adds the parttools to the root object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) drag and drop the model onto this GameObject.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Open up the tree under the GameObject and select your collider(s) - in the inspector pane \u0022Add Component | Physics | mesh collider\u0022 or add one or more Box, Capsule or Sphere colliders - these primitives are less expensive computationally. After you have the colliders setup you can remove the mesh filter and mesh renderer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) Select you meshes and add the textures. I make my textures in Gimp and export both a DDS and a png. Drag and drop the .png\u0027s into the Unity asset folder and the drag and drop a texture on each of the meshes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7) Select the top GameObject from step three and you should see a parttools section in the inspector fill in a name and click \u0022write\u0022 - at some point your ask to select a directory - maybe when setting up parttools?. You should now have a .mu file in your chosen directory - after you\u0027ve finished tweaking the part you will want to replace the texture Unity spits out with the DDS you created earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8) Setup your config file and you might have a working part in KSP - typo\u0027s in the config or any number of other things can prevent the part from showing up in KSP - in which case you look in the log and try to puzzle out what went wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome random thoughts: If the part shows up in game but once you place the part you can\u0027t grab it again - you probably forgot or miss configured the collider(s). Small typo\u0027s in the config can cause the part not to load - sometimes case maters - sometimes not. Animations have some extra steps I haven\u0027t covered here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck and happy modding!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
