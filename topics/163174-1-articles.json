After seeing that I want to play KSP without having to drag Steam and other personal stuff of it with me, I\u0027ve decided to buy the GOG/DRM-free version. I also intend to infect a few people at my university by playing it there :p.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question here is if I actually have to reinstall EVERYTHING or if I just need to grab something like GOG\u0027s ksp.exe or some file just so it doesn\u0027t launch the Steam version? Just need to know, because my internet is not the fastest where I am (and somewhat limited), so it would be good to know, provided anybody actually did the same.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose, too, that you can just copypaste the savegames?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be sticking with 1.2.2. for now as I still have a lousy career going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-12T10:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Steam version has no DRM, you can launch the game from the folder or copy the whole game folder to anywhere you want and play the game from that folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-12T14:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223118514\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163174\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221499855084\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119953\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Harry Rhodan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Harry Rhodan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Steam version has no DRM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be even more precise: No matter where you bought KSP, it is DRM free.

But in case you were more concerned about the \u0022how do I move my career saves from Steam to GOG?\u0022 part of the question, all you need to take is the saves folder. All other game files and folders are the same on both versions, though there are certain added files that are specific to each distribution platform.\u00A0So also don\u0027t think that since it\u0027s all the same you can just copy your entire KSP folder from Steam to GOG and expect it to work, you will have to redownload the core game from GOG and copy your saves folder to start where you left off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spraki","CreatedById":155616,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-13T17:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoh.
