I\u0027ve created a Grumman style wing with infernal robotics but not with stock. It would be an interesting feat to try and tackle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy bearing is held in place with\u00A0junior docking ports on\u00A0either side of the actual thing which\u00A0hold it in place.\u00A0The bearing\u00A0is designed with an axle made from ant engine enclosed in a sort of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecage\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of cubic octagonal struts.\u00A0Just below the cage is the decoupler which the whole wing assembly is attached to at launch. The decoupler prevents the hing/wings from falling off upwards. Looks kind of like a screw head. It\u0027s extremely\u00A0sturdy at launch before you stage the decoupler. After you do that however it\u0027s nearly impossible to get both the side, and is a bit wobbly. You can see in the video that it only sort of works. With a larger plane it would be flopping around everywhere. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RixKillian","CreatedById":145397,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T06:10:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm I don\u0027t know if this would work with a plane since the wings are trying to pull the bearing out but tightening it up as far as possible always seems to help with the wobble, and lengthening the axle down through the fuselage..
