Yes, it drove me insane until I figured that out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your ship is pointing straight north (nav ball surface mode) then the map appears as if you are going north and just a little east. But by the time you do go north, the planet has rotated. So if you tried to adjust your path slightly west to get the map line on the correct spot, you actually end up off course to the west. Very annoying for long range precision navigation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to be able to place a marker anywhere on the planet, MechJeb lets you do that. In stock, the only way is what Kasuha suggested, plant a flag or land a ship where you want to go, then navigate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealize that with either of these, they will be below the horizon and navigation to them is not always perfect because Kerbin is a sphere, and the navball was designed with spacecraft in mind, not low altitude airplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T17:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be great would be just having an add on to plot a point on the surface and that would just give distance and heading to that point, then the system would update these 2 parameters along your path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all we need. knowing the fuel flow of your plane at different altitude and power setting, the fuel on board, you\u0027re then able to know your range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T23:06:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, surface navigation with a system built for orbital navigation kinda doesn\u0027t work all that well.
