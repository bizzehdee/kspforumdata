These \u0022small\u0022 packs allow the user to fly about with the freedom unheard of with any other means of transportation. And for those urban agents, you\u0026#39;ll be able to sneak into that perfect parking spot, unheard, over the roar of the jet engine(s). These packs are perfect for getting into those tight and hard to reach spots, like the gutters, and are \u0022perfectly safe\u0022.(patent pending)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/vj3kncg1kxikup9/paps.zip?dl=1\u0022]Paps mk 1 and 2.[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/PAPS1_zpsh4bz8kvf.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey come in two styles. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe MK.1 is ultra futuristic and comes with 2 engines for redundancy and extra lifting power. Its lateral facing intakes improve airflow into the engine no matter how it\u0026#39;s flown.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe MK.2 is a stripped down little pack with just the bare minimums needed for flight. It\u0026#39;s much lighter weight allows it to reach higher speeds nearing supersonic. (not rated for speed reaching supersonic)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoth versions come with safety features like emergence parachutes should the engines cut out. Landing stilts, to take the weight off the passanger. And crumple zones, to fail when not expected, I mean protect the pilot in case of odd angled descents. And to top it all off, they are so small! Kerbal\u0026#39;s have an odd sense of small huh?\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/PAPS2_zpspkijtsfa.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd for those Agents on the move, we also have this little vertajet scooter. It\u0026#39;s a shrunk down version of the Sky Hopper series but it didn\u0026#39;t loose any of it\u0026#39;s abilities. In fact, this one is even faster. Great for those urban agents who need to get somewhere quickly, and still be able to park in the room.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/jm1xwbkq8t5jknm/Sky%20hopper%20MK_3%20micro.zip?dl=1\u0022]The new Sky Hopper mk.3 micro.[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/skyhoppermk3_zpsgqckcoa3.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis little guy is crazy maneuverable and can even roll over and play dead on command.

We\u0026#39;ll have to see what I end up doing with them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe engine pods themselves look pretty snazzy with how the attachment points of the Goliaths interact with the rest of the pod. Gives it a retro futuristic Buck Rogers look to them. The rest of the craft is all mk3 fuselage parts. Full throttle cruising speed is between 150 and 220 m/s. Top speed is over 250m/s. It handles pretty sluggishly compared to its smaller cousins, but that is due to its much larger bulk. It can carry a crew of 4 and 32 Kerbal passengers to anywhere on Kerbin. As long as that \u0022anywhere\u0022 is within relatively short range of the KSC. It\u0026#39;s top altitude varies, but stabilizes somewhere at around 8,500m. If the passenger fuselage parts were replaced with a cargo bay, it should be able to lift somewhere around 30 tons to about 7,000m or a range of 600km, but I may be wrong(and have been before).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyways, here are some pics to look at. ;) The craft its self and a comparison to show how much bigger it is then the Mk.1\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/skyhoppermk41_zpsmltjimvi.jpg[/IMG] [IMG]http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/skyhoppermk42_zpsgpo1b4ac.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know...
