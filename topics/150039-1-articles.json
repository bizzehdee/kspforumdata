If you can get through it, suddenly your engines start gaining tremendous amounts of power and thrust. Generally, if you have that problem you want to climb slowly to 8 to 10km altitude (if you can get that high, climbing at 200 m/s or so) -- then crank it up to full power and go into a shallow dive to get through that Mach 1 boundary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justicier","CreatedById":89671,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T13:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^ What bewing said. However, since your craft has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E greater than 1, I have a couple questions. What kind of engines are you using... RAPIERs? A Combo of Whiplash\u002BRocket motors? And what about the intakes... Shock cones? Radial air intakes? This is important because different engines will be more or less capable at different altitudes and speeds. The type of intake is also very important as some will not provide much if anything for the engines at supersonic and hypersonic speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally speaking, if you want your plane to go to space today, you should consider using a minimum of Whiplash jet engines for getting your speed and angels (altitude), then rocket motors (preferably aerospikes) for the last push from high altitude to orbit when the air has gotten too thin and the jets cough out. If it is available, the RAPIER engine used in conjunction with Shock Cone intakes is probably your best bet since that combo has the best high-altitude, hypersonic performance (well, in KSP terms).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is of course all assuming that your plane is nice and aerodynamic...
