There\u0027s not much we can do about it, sadly. If it irritates you too much, you can change the editor the forum displays for you, so that you always see the BBCodes rather than the formatting in the editor."},{"CreatedByName":"Pingonaut","CreatedById":15723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T00:10:40Z","Content":"Alright, thanks for the explanation.
