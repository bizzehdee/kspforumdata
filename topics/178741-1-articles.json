The rest of the Kerbals lived in lava tubes, hastily pressurized, always leaking and sometimes caving in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe food was terrible. Due to the lack of an atmosphere on Mesbin, and the distance to the sun, the Kerbals had to grow their food in the lava tubes, with sun-mimicking light bulbs powered mostly geothermally. These light bulbs were the ones that had survived the crash, and therefore were over 200 years old.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were 500 Kerbals on Mesbin. Due to Kerbin\u0027s impending doom, several hundred colony ships had been sent out to various star systems, taking hundreds of years to get there. The\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EManifest Destiny\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was one of the first to reach its destination. Unfortunately it crashed. What little supplies the Kerbals had were mostly from the wreckage of the ship. They were able to scavenge 5 years worth of supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose 5 years were spent trying to set up a sustainable system, food, water, and air,\u00A0and they succeeded, barely. In their off time, Kerbals tried to make metals from the surrounding resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were several things the Kerbals needed to figure out if they were going to survive. They needed a way of extracting and processing metal. They needed the excess farming capacity for fabrics, and animals. Only a few animals were still alive, they had been kept to a minimal number for the past 5 years. They also needed to figure out how to manufacture electronics, their supply from the crashed ship was dwindling. The supply chain, at this point, was unable to make spacesuits, which meant that most Kerbals were helpless in the event of a total colony depressurization. There were less than 200 usable suits remaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn time, they figured that all out, but barely. And being underground sucked. Scratch that, being on Mesbin sucked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it was decided to search for more habitable worlds in the system, they were unfound, as nobody had been to the surface in forever, and nobody had thought to accurately scan the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo quote the captain from WALL-E, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t want to survive.

The first launch, Savior 1, was piloted by Jeb, and was a short hop to gather science, weighed down by extra boosters as to not exceed a dozen or so meters. He gathered enough science to unlock the stayputnik, which is lower in the tech tree in this version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome things about Mesbin - it has 5g gravity at the poles, but only a bit above 1g at the equator because of rotation. Orbital velocity of Mesbin is a whopping\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E8000\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0meters per second, but due to the rotation you already have 4500m/s so you only need 3.5 plus gravity losses (a lot) to get into orbit. According to the release thread 4500 is a good number to aim for. Fun fact, Mesbin has a higher low orbit velocity than Earth! Also the equator is at about 1500km above \u0022sea\u0022 level, and space is considered space at 1535km. And fully a vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was for this reason we unlocked the stayputnik. Because it\u0027s really hard to return a Kerbal from orbit.

Most of the changes involve far away worlds that I have not visited yet, but two major things have changed. Mesbin and Statmun. Mesbin is now way smaller and spins way faster, every 28 minutes. Statmun is still tidally locked in a stationary orbit, but is twice as large and completely redesigned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news? You only need 2.5km/s to get into a low orbit. The bad news? You need more to go from there to anywhere else. I think it evens out, though, and we have a slight decrease in the total delta-v required to go places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut two major things in the save have been messed up. Due to Statmun\u0027s sudden increase in size, it ate our one module Statmun station... Not a huge loss, to be honest. But the major thing is that Treehouse Station is now in a medium orbit instead of a low orbit, making it impractical as a stopping point. The delta-V from Treehouse to Graymun and Statmun are about 2km/s each way for both... We\u0027d want to optimize for one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, instead of moving the pitifully tiny Treehouse station which can only support a few people for a short time, let\u0027s take advantage of the lower Delta-V to LMO and build something just a little bit bigger!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WUogdIX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WUogdIX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAAAA NO!

On the final landing approach it ran out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uqDmNJb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uqDmNJb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, the crew compartment and the samples survived!
