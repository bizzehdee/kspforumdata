The main problem I see is that input by clicking on the screen is very slow and tedious for any task like typing number / words - Unity has a tendency to treat quick clicks like a double click, which messes up targeting. The text input problem is why there is still no node editor in RPM. If the kOS programs were \u0022pre-loaded\u0022, and all the user had to do was select the programs, that would be probably be feasible.\n\n[it\u0027s been attempted at least](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109624-WIP-kOSPropMonitor-IVA-kOS-Monitor-for-RPM)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T04:40:29Z","Content":"I think that it would still be useful to have a primitive input to kOS programs clicking one thing at a time.
