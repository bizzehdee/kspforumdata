All the different sizes, the filters, reactors ... it really should be called Kerbal Accountancy Simulator. TAC is also the best supported LS mod. The others are great. I like IFI and I miss the original IonCross CS, but TAC is the market leader. I find myself always returning to TAC for important saves but I hate the number of parts it requires. And the models, especially hexcans, look far more Trek then Kerbal.\n\nOver a year ago there was a great stockalike parts pack for TAC. The radial cans were retextures of the long monoprop tank and a large inline can was built from Squad\u0027s cupola model. It was lighweight and non-intrusive. But TAC and KSP have changed in the last year. So, with permission of Somnambulic, I\u0027ve updated his mod to support TAC\u0027s current resource definitions. I\u0027ve also added a new radial tank containing a month\u0027s worth of TAC resources (the one with \u0022life support\u0022 written on the side). \n\nAt the moment I have FIVE parts in this pack. I intend no more. The radial tanks contain either a 90-day supply of a single resource or 30days of each for the combined can. The 2.5m inline can hold three years worth, or one year for a three-kerbal crew. All are now tweakscale compatable. So you can probably delete all the stock TAC parts. I do not want to discuss volume and part dimensions. I don\u0027t care that these parts do not comport with realworld resource volumes. The cans contain 90 or 30 days of resources because that keeps the math simple. Their mass comes from the resource definitions. While they may or may not be the wrong volume, they are properly heavy and therefore not OP imho. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/uhTYg)\n\n**I need feedback on three questions:** \n\n**(1)** How should these cans be labelled? I was going to make the external labels descriptive of contents (ie \u0022H2O - 30d\u0022) but that doesn\u0027t work once they scale. Or should I keep with the colour patterns? \u0022Life Support\u0022 is probably confusing because another mod uses that resource, so perhaps \u0022Supplies\u0022 instead?\n\n**(2)** Does anyone actually use individualized resource containers? I\u0027m tempted to ditch them and stick with the one inline and one combined radial cannister. That, with tweakscale, really cleans up the clutter.\n\n**(3)** Does anyone want smaller/larger parts without using tweakscale? Adding them is dead simple. A non-tweakscale version with 1-year and 1-week parts wouldn\u0027t take more than a few minutes. I just don\u0027t want to add to the clutter (3 sizes x 5 part types = 15 parts = an extra half-page in the editor).\n\nOriginal concept and non-Squad models/textures reproduced with permission of Somnambulic.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**Download:**[https://www.dropbox.com/s/gtctiuhm5e1bbwe/TAC\\_Stockalike\\_v0.4.rar](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gtctiuhm5e1bbwe/TAC_Stockalike_v0.4.rar)\n\n**Installation:** Put contents of rar in ksp gamedata directory.\n\n**Dependencies:** Relies upon two stock models.

I do want to remove clutter but things like FS, RealFuels, and procedural parts all just replace one form of clutter with another. And they create cross-mod dependency. With 1.0 only weeks away I want to keep dependencies to a minimum.
