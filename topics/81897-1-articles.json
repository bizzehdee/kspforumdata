The patch broke them for the most part, but a few designs still work. Recently the cheaty SSTO challenge rekindled my interest in this particular fuel-less propulsion, which I hope could be further developed in the community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kraken_Drive\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWiki entry on Kraken Drive\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven a kraken spacecraft, the biggest trouble with using it is its painfully slow rate of climb in slow mode. That is, when the craft speed is slower than 800m/s and you\u0027re trying to get off the surface. To find out whether kraken drive can be made practical, here is a challenge to build a kraken spacecraft that could climb the fastest in slow mode, with hopes that we may discover the best method of building kraken propulsions in 0.24.2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELadder drives and infinigliders are not a part of this challenge, since they are well developed, and neither is able to maneuver significant payloads for orbital transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
