(correct me if im wrong here) but I think it would be a really fun idea for multiple seat cockpits to have each seat control a certain axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch as the person in the left most seat controls yaw, or pitch, and can translate along x or y. The right seat takes the other option respectively, and center seat gets pitch and throttle or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was talking with a friend about how awesome it would be to be in the same craft, and then we thought it would suck to just sit in a passenger seat and wait for my buddy to do everything and get us to location. I think this would really help teamwork and could possibly start more competitions, what team is the most efficient achieving task X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my thoughts on an idea that definitely should not be passed up. And think of the shenanigans you would get into if you over rotated by 1\u0027, and bunce the space station into a spin whilst attempting to dock and everyone else in the craft flips their desk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously this translates into controlling stages and things but i just wanted to make sure shared controls isn\u0027t overlooked.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-01T06:59:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2014 06:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Huzke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\u0026#039;s galore... not fixing all the i\u0026#039;s though.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
