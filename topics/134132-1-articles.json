Let\u0027s say the floating colonies (I will not go into how hard it is to get something to float on a gas giant, I\u0027ll leave it at \u0027magic\u0027 for the purpose of staying on topic) are at the same level as the clouds. My guess is the bands would go around the continents in similar ways to how global air currents move around the continents here on Earth. They might mix together a lot more than they would normally, and turn into big random-looking\u00A0swirls that would look like Earth\u0027s clouds. The continents would get pushed around a lot faster than they do on Earth, so these air currents would rapidly change and be even less predictable than what we have here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
