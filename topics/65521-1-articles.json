I think it\u0027s a necessary skill that you should never have to do.

The bigger the ships, the harder it is. My \u0022tiny tug\u0022 ships can dock without RCS first try no problems, so long as the target ship isn\u0027t rotating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t think F5/F9 is cheating, a tip is to get them lined up nice, hit F5, and then you can try over and over under reproducible conditions. However, just get in front of the docking port of the target ship, get *ZERO* relative velocity, aim the other ship at you, aim you at the other ship, and go in SLOW (Like 0.1 m/s) and you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anybody\u0027s curious I can find some specific videos.
