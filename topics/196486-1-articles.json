If no, I humbly request one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with auto-fill is that it can be quite laggy with many \u0022heavy\u0022 part mods installed. Especially since it will display \u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E parts if you click on part search line when it\u0027s empty (which leads to massive lags if you have BDB\u002BTantares\u002BKNES\u002BNF\u002BMLP\u002B...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
