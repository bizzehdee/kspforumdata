Crew, supplies, capsule come in about 7.5tn. So the cargo variant will have about the same capacity of 11% weight cargo for a 70 tn craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a completely reusable craft, and will use a pure propulsion profile for ascent and decent.

My current ferry prototype is using two of the largest chemical engines and will most likely be scaled back to one or two of the smaller units. This will increase the time on the surface and I will need to look at what my limits will be regarding that. In moving away from the RTGs, I need to develop a solar plan. At current, I am thinking solar panel systems that will be deployed/assembled by hand/robot once landed on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I could build a permanent large solar installation on the surface and use that to power the ferry\u0027s refueling process, I prefer to contain the solar harvesting potential in the ferry itself. Most all initial craft, I think, will need to be lifeboats, and all but stand alone systems. Relying only on permanent solar installations would also limit sub orbital hop range. Later these solar installations will be present, but for the initial ferries and surface infrastructure I want as much self sufficiency as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETwo\u003C/strong\u003E is to take another look at boil off and scaling for time and active craft in game. We have good hardware/mods to keep fuels at the right temp, but I would like to look at performance of cryo systems in martian atmosphere and power requirements. I know this will take a decent amount of power, and there may be limitations in direct exposure environments. Heat-sinking and other methods of local thermal stabilization may be needed, and long term, desired for efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe station producing fuel in orbit will require the CO2 ferry and I have to really look at the fuel cost of bringing CO2 up. The savings in not bringing LqdHydrogen to the surface are small, but I think large solar solutions for processing will be easier in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO right now I\u0027m going to scale down fuel production on the ferry and see if I can get a deployed solar solution to power it on the surface. Then based on a flight schedule of two ferries, on their new fuel period, I will see how much CO2 I can run to the station. Then I will make a fuel production schedule for the station. Then I can make a LqdHydrogen delivery schedule from earth. Then I can look at the whole chain and see the rough potential of two craft and one station, with LqdHydrogen support from earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I can do a similar chain set up where all fuel is produced on the surface in a permanent surface installation. Fuel will be lifted via ferry to the station and LqdHydrogen brought to the surface via the same ferry. The station will still receive Hydrogen support from earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, I imagine, it will be a combination of the above that will take place for matters of convenience and complexity reduction as well as efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile some of this can be explored by my rudimentary math, I find working models to really spell it out much better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-14T08:47:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2016 08:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Lothaar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lothaar","CreatedById":159753,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T19:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I have been playing with trying to do precision landings so that I can have multiple craft in reasonable distance from one another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb is not playing nice, even the dev version.
