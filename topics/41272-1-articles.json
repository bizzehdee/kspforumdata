I have a few issues though. First is piloting the missles. My first attempt was remote control pieces on front of each missle and I\u0027d do \u0022Control from here\u0022 before launching them. This didn\u0027t work out because I would remain in control of the platform as soon as I launched the missle, and by the time I could click on the missle it\u0027d already slammed into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next attempt was to try different missle types. SRBs and MFB didn\u0027t work either. I then switched to manned kamakazie missles piloted by brave Kerbalnauts. While they all survived the 2 second fight from the platform into the ground, they also couldn\u0027t pilot the missles. Am I doing something wrong with trying to control these? They all have wings and control surfaces and yet it still doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, what\u0027s the easiest way to rotate a ship piece, such as an SRB, to a 45 degree angel?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-06T12:42:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2013 12:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by iwishiknew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T08:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can help with the rotation piece.
