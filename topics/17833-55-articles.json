It was a skeleton and only had a few simple proof of concept features... Maybe 5% of the functionality and polish which is in 1.0.8.1. It did not have any stylistic features at all, so I\u0027m going to reply with a more up to date message. It may become a little bit of a rant, sorry in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer to your question would now be, \u0022With a lot of code duplication and time that could be better spent on more important things.\u0022 The main premise for not having the Unity default style has always been about looking stock, and integrating with the KSP theme. So it uses a style that although is more complex, also more suits the aesthetics of the game. This is not going to change, but I will add to the why there is currently no optional selection for the styles. It is because KER builds around that style, with sizing and positioning. Not having to design for two separate styles with two separate sizes and positions for everything makes it easier and quicker to develop design integrated and stylising features. It is not as simple as just selecting another style in the code. Or more to the point, it definitely isn\u0027t that simple anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the only reason people have asked for the Unity default style is because of sizing. That is now solved considering you can adjust the size of everything, can edit and create your own displays, compact mode, whether to show the control bar on the Flight Engineer, as well as lot of other features. You can get a very tidy and sleek looking Engineer experience with just a few personal tweaks. Having to design just for one specific style gives greater flexibility and many more design oriented features; like some of the ones I just mentioned. Which many would never have been implemented if I had to work around the constraints of developing for two styles. When functionality is tightly coupled to the design, especially when development time is finite, the question to ask yourself is, \u0022Do I want two designs, half the functionality. Or full functionality but only one design?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA very simple answer in my opinion, as there is but one style that matches the KSP theme and the KER design philosophy. I\u0027ll also never sacrifice functionality for the many on a style for the few.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust stressing why an option hasn\u0027t been implemented, and will not be for at least the short term future of KER...
