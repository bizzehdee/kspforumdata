I landed in the highlands just east of the East Crater, so I decided to EVA over to the crater to get the science there. But on my way over I did an EVA report and it said that I was in the Poles biome. Do I not know the Mun as well as I thought or is that biome in the wrong place???\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T06:58:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etheres a few glitched patches here or there. you\u0027ll find a spot thats only a few tens or hundreds of meters accross where you\u0027ll sudenly be in poles biome at the equator. Incidently you can find these weird spots on kerbin as well. Of note theres a bit of tundra a few KM northwestish from KSC. Normaly you never notice them from orbit unless you\u0027ve got a mod like science alert that will bleep for a second leting you know of a new biome but you fly past it faster than you can take a reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T07:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you get both poles and polar lowland in that area. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe canyon going east from an crater on the other side of the Mun is more wild, in the area where canyon intercept crater its 7 biomes in a few km, a rover is so nice here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tall_guy","CreatedById":123847,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T19:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, thanks, thats good to know.
