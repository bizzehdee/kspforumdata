It is very slow to accelerate, even though four turbojets should be enough for a 34-tonne craft. As a result, it runs out of air sooner than even a plane with 1:1 intake-to-engine ratio would. There are a lot of wings in the plane, so maybe that contributes to the problem somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center of lift is too far forward. When you burn fuel during ascent, the center of mass moves behind the center of lift, and the plane starts pulling its nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T22:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo things I see that I would consider \u0022major.\u0022 (Well, three really.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Nice job on the plane design. It\u0027s really stable and flies at 3x physics warp with no problems. Well done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your CoM is a slightly aft right from the start. Make it want to pitch up a lot during flight, but if you\u0027re happy with it then it\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You need more TWR from your rocket stage -OR- add more intakes. Your plane has a hard time with the transition getting up to 32km on jets, but the TWR of your aerospike is a bit low to overcome it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got reasonably close to orbit with your design. I didn\u0027t have time to try out my suggestions yet, but hopefully they are a good place to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also want to tweak your liquid fuel amount. I had excess liquid fuel but was short on oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, consider adding a reaction wheel to help out with stability during the air/space transition. That\u0027s up to you. Not really required if you\u0027re happy with how it flies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I was pretty excited about it right from takeoff. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try my recommendations later.
