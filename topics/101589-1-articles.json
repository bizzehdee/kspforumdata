With this, I passed the surface at essentially the same location and altitude each orbit, which was around under 50m from the surface, as I recall. I do not have existing proof of this however, as that was some time ago."},{"CreatedByName":"Owen5595","CreatedById":122216,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T22:47:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Your attempt?
