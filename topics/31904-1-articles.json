I basically started with the parasite air/spacecraft, i then built the mothership attached above it. It took a lot of testing to figure out the best way to be able to get the maximum Delta V out of the configuration i had chosen. BUT FINALLY! I triumphed and the air/spacecraft is capable of getting into at least a 300km circular orbit, the parasite aircraft has, and can, complete a full un-powered landing but unfortunately in the first publicised flight it crashed dramatically. The mothership is redundant after \u0022dropping\u0022 because it is un-piloted and unstable on it\u0027s own. It usually floats harmlessly back to the sea a few km in front of the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/IcpIRfkSu9M?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
