Unless you are ready to do some serious coding. Think of every part as having a singular float location being the center of the part in question. Your big floating box in the game will function much like a beach ball. It will not float level. So you end up adding more parts, and those parts aren\u0027t balanced properly. Eventually you might have something that floats well but looks like a cardboard box with wings and drums all over it.

I was hoping that buoyancy was a factor of mass/lift and that you could offset the two to create a stable/self righting hull with little fuss.

The body of the boat has inboard motors and a probe so it can remain unoccupied along a shoreline etc. The Carrier has a cargo lift bay (use KAS) to winch the runabout up into the carrier. I\u0027ve had the runabout up to nearly 50 m/s but balance must be tuned for higher speeds. It can turn excellent, will not tip, and behaves just like it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater guys!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T16:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking awesome!

For the take-off distance, simply raking the aircraft (making the front higher than the back) by changing the gear position at the rear of the aircraft can really help with that... gives the wings more default angle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
