This new engine concept is powered \u003Cem\u003Eentirely\u003C/em\u003E by electricity. That means that, given enough solar arrays, your supply of fuel is limited only by how much of the Sun you can capture with those panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/187346-nasa-tests-impossible-no-fuel-quantum-space-engine-and-it-actually-works\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enews article on the engine\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s one to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://emdrive.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eprimary source\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the technology IS still in its infancy, and NASA testing was only able to deliver a fraction of the total power output a working engine would deliver, but it DOES still work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think this means for the future of space/interstellar travel? Will it become a major source of propulsion?

They\u0027re misrepresenting what\u0027s happening here. NASA took one of those engines and it produced thrust. Then they intentionally disabled the engine and it STILL produced thrust. This suggests that whatever is causing the force, it isn\u0027t the momentum conservation breaking mechanism the engine is supposed to work on. The thrust is most likely caused by electrodynamic interactions or some kind of photon thruster effect. Do not jump the shark with this, it is extremely likely its just some experimental flaw like the faster than light neutrinos. The media just likes to hype these things up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T14:55:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, there are already a few threads on this.
