To balance it out so it doesn\u0027t ruin gameplay you\u0027d have to make it really inefficient/slow, like comparing to ion engines, drains heaps of power to generate a tiny bit of thrust but can go for ages on a small tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather just advice you to get the Kethane mod and mine for fuel, if you\u0027re really just out to have easy quick access to heaps of fuel with no effort, toggle infinite fuel from the debug menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
