My goal was to use a rocket to boost a small space plane into orbit. Eventually...it did it, but the resulting creation was...ungainly in many different ways. As you can see below, I built the plane first as I knew the shape I wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I ran into was how KSP treats objects. Objects must be built linearly going from A to B to C to D. But this was the issue as I wanted a less...unstable launch platform for this specific craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ztsKNkw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ztsKNkw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue was that I could not designate distinct entities with in the editor. So my plane could not be one entity, my rocket could not be another entity, and I could not create assemblies to connect the two as an inline structure. Essentially clamping one onto the other much like the Launch Stability Enhancer clamps onto the ship and then lets go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I would like to suggest is three fold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The ability to create, on a limited basis, distinct entities or craft as a single project. This could be expressed in many ways but both would be valid and allow the user to build on then separately. Allowing the user to work on A-\u0026gt;D, and G-\u0026gt;K in parallel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The addition of a user created pallet for entities. This is so commonly used objects can be pulled out of the pallet or transfered in with out having to edit anything. So in this building a space plane, then placing it into the pallet and going to the rocket center where the plane can be grabbed, oriented, and placed onto a rocket. Why reinvent the wheel each time??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Allow the creation of, or add an object into the game, clamping objects. The simplest method is an I-Beam connecting two decouplers. On decoupler on each element your attaching. A small set of varying length objects could also be added to achieve this, but allowing the player to build unique and interesting solutions is more of what KSP is about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy the thought, please be constructive. And if your wondering, the plane got to orbit, flew great, and got Jeb home safe and sound.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T19:33:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SyberSmoke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T08:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. and part of 2 sound alot like the \u0022sub-assembly loader\u0022 mod.

The I-Beams would be the connection between the rocket and the plain portions with the decouplers releasing the two when the decouplers blew them away. This is what I was calling a clamp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second thought stemmed from the first, an object with arms that attach to the ship like the LSE\u0027s. These could be used for payloads or for objects that do not fit well with the use of a Stack Decoupler or a decoupler. You could also place it more or less free form on an object to tune the balance due to the asymmetric nature of some parts. Once placed, it would act as a mounting point for a stack. Or mounted to a stack and ready to hold a payload, depending on how you build your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was the thought at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcept Object: Payload Clamp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescription: The payload clamp acts like the Launch Stability Enhancer for payloads on the ship. The base comes in two sizes, Medium and Large. From the base the Payload Clamp has arms that rise from the base and attach to the payload. The arms must be symmetrical. It may be possible to allow the arms to be placed using Symmetry mode selecting the numer of arms with the remainder of the base filled in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the arms are adjusting pads that will attach to an object holding it in place. The pads will adjust to fit the objects shape to get a good connection or hold with the arms adjusting their angles to facilitate a good grip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen activated, the pads will release and the arms will rotate from a pivot point in the bass to be inline with he plane of the base (think Starfish). The payload will be released and allowed to escape under it\u0027s own thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, the clamp could be used as a grabbing mechanism. The arms could be powered using electric motors, when activated the arms will close and the pads will seek to attach to an object they strike. This would facilitate the capture and movement of orbital debris with out the risk of it jostling or bouncing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T19:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SyberSmoke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T19:25:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOff topic...but I read this as Altering how KSP treats snacks.
