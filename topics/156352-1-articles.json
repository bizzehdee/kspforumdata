In this case the parent body is Kerbin, and you start at the equator, so if you launch from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E heading North your LAN will be whatever the absolute longitude of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was at the moment you launched. If we knew the absolute longitude of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E at Y1 D1 00:00:00 then we could compute it at any time thereafter and you could always figure out when the next time to launch into your desired LAN would be. I don\u0027t see that information in the wiki so I figured it out by launching a rocket with at 90 degree North azimuth as early as I could and reading the LAN of the resulting orbit using Mechjeb.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 I come up with a start longitude for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E of 16 degrees and about 10 minutes. I say about because it is too difficult to not swing back and forth a bit during launch, but I can repeat the 16 degrees 10\u0027 to about \u002B/-20 minutes when getting into a polar orbit, your results may vary depending on the orbit inclination you are going for. (If you will get into an orbit with a very low inclination then tiny changes in your launch profile can make a big change in the LAN, \u002B/- 7 degrees for a 1-degree-inclined orbit for me.) Also don\u0027t read the LAN out right after launch because it jerks around all over the place while your rocket is still almost exactly over the equator.
