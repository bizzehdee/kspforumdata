The models are absolutely first rate and the system is quite clever.\n\u003E Using a 3.75m multinode heat sink and four XR-4500 Radiators, I successfully completed a 30 minute burn at full throttle (4 LV-N\u0027s) with no overheats. The cooldown time after the burn was ~40 minutes, but I actually missed the exact time. I was shooting for an hour to see what the temps were and noticed the entire ship was completely cool at the 40 minute mark. The radiators themselves were still quite hot.\n\u003E \n\u003E A 3.75m multinode heat sink and four large radiators from HM also successfully completed a 30 minute burn at full throttle. After 1 hour, temperatures had dropped to ~800. Overall temps were higher throughout.\n\u003E \n\u003E There is a trade off in mass, but certainly worth it if you need to dissipate heat rapidly.\n\u003E \n\u003E I didn\u0027t bother to test them in conjuction with an AHMS unit because I\u0027m relatively sure that you could fly into the sun with some clever placement with this particular combo. \n\u003E \n\u003E Two thumbs up!\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: Just for giggles I tried the XR-4500\u0027s with a 3.75 AHMS unit.
