Everything goes fine but memory usage continues to rise over my playtime until a crash happens. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have it running and was monitoring KSP and its memory usage. I have a problem, like so many others, with it crashing after it reaches a certain point. I just did a recovery and noticed I was over 2 GB of memory used and decided to test out Ramrush. I did an optimize and it took KSP down to just under 2 MB of ram. After the optimize it rose back up to 451,292 where it has stayed (currently in the overview of the entire space center). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to believe this will help crash issues until squad figures out the memory usage issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyone else use this and had problems?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for me, that one time using the optimize hasn\u0027t impacted the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
