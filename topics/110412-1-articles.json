Everything goes fine but memory usage continues to rise over my playtime until a crash happens. \n\nI have it running and was monitoring KSP and its memory usage. I have a problem, like so many others, with it crashing after it reaches a certain point. I just did a recovery and noticed I was over 2 GB of memory used and decided to test out Ramrush. I did an optimize and it took KSP down to just under 2 MB of ram. After the optimize it rose back up to 451,292 where it has stayed (currently in the overview of the entire space center). \n\nI want to believe this will help crash issues until squad figures out the memory usage issue. \n\nSo, anyone else use this and had problems?\n\nAs for me, that one time using the optimize hasn\u0027t impacted the game."}]}
