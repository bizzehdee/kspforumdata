It means something has gone terribly terribly wrong with PhysX (I think). I have no idea what the exact problem is, but what ends up happening for me is the Mir core detaches from it\u0027s docking port which is attached to the Buran, and the core loses it\u0027s velocity.

We\u0027re talking about a mod problem here not a realism problem, the Dragon CRS out right now can\u0027t dock to the CBM in the ISS pack either even though it does in real life since it too uses a CBM. It has to be made universal even if it isn\u0027t realistic so that it can work with other mods.\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have a clue what\u0027s wrong with the PMA...what does the open/close function do because at the moment it seems functionless and cosmetic, the thing has no docking capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-21T19:26:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2013 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Good_Apollo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T19:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom a known good docking port:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMODULE\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = ModuleDockingNode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E referenceAttachNode = top\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E nodeType = size2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efrom the PMA-1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = ModuleDockingNode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E deployAnimationController = 1 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E nodeType = size1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy guess, and it is only a guess since I haven\u0027t edited the PMA\u0027s part.cfg to test this as I am at work... is that the missing referenceAttachNode = \u0026lt;something\u0026gt; needs to be there. however, since the PMA can be docked on EITHER SIDE...

Realistically the PMA should be able to dock by itself on both ends, but when I look at Bobcat\u0027s videos and such it appears he uses a CBM on the \u0027CBM\u0027 side. Perhaps KSP is incapable of having a two ended docking port so that\u0027s the solution? Either way I don\u0027t think the APAS side functions...\n"}]}
