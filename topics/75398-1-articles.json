I clicked everywhere around the planet, but only ended up targeting various moons, and never the actual planet. Tried restarting, but nothing changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I clicked on my path and created a random maneuver node, and hey presto, I was immediately able to select the planet as a target. I then removed the node and the planet remained as my target. So this doesn\u0027t explain why it happened - just a bug I guess - but it was an easy fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for your suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
