So, looking out the window, you can\u0027t tell if an impact crater is a kilometer across or just 10 meters across. You can\u0027t tell if the hills you see on the horizon are only 500 meters away, or are in fact huge mountains 50 kilometers away.

People often preset outsourcing as a way to save money, but it\u0027s usually the opposite. You need tons of regulations and procedures to control how public money is spent and how procurement contracts are handled. Because people don\u0027t want the government to waste taxpayer money on useless projects, they introduce commissions and studies to make sure that the rules are properly followed. Then you need people to do all the paperwork that is required to ensure that the regulations are enforced and that the commissions are properly informed.\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, the actual work still needs to be done by the same people, only now they work for a private company, which charges more than the government would have spent by doing the work in-house, because the stockholders need to take their share.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the best way for the government to save money would be to actually hire more government employees to do the work instead of pay the private sector for juicy outsourcing contracts that only make the stockholders richer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting take.
