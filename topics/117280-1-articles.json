Oh, the Eve probe is on its way, though with frustrating inefficiency; departure stage had to be used to circularize orbit, \u0026amp; departure burn of 1000 m/sec will require a course-correction burn of another 1000 m/sec to actually get an encounter (bad window read). Highly unlikely the main probe will have the Delta V to return to Kerbin Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T17:45:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt around cubic octagonal struts, small probe cores and if you are willing to only use radial attached science parts you can get a simple probe down to around 0.3 tonnes excluding propulsion. It wouldn\u0027t be able to do much, but maybe if you pack several on a mission to disperse over an area or something it could be fun. For propulsion on something that size you only need something like an Oscar-B tank and an ant engine to get enough delta-v to go to duna or eve, keeping the total spacecraft weight well under a tonne. So if you\u0027re good at launchers and flying efficiently (and I\u0027m not, so I may be horribly wrong about this) you should be able to get a funtioncal, if limited, probe to Eve or Duna at less than 5 tonnes on the pad, and if the science parts are kept to the bare minimum only a few thousand funds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T23:26:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GarrisonChisholm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GarrisonChisholm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow, that is all with starter engines too??
