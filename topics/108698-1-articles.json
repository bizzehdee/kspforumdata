That is, early on we get the RT-10, which by far has had the best TWR of the stock SRBs (well, until the Flea showed up ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)).

The actual thrust you\u0027ll get from each stack will be lower than a Kickback, unless you triple them up (3 stacks of RT-10s for each Kickback you would have used).
