So, after lots of pain I decided to make something really simple but keeping stuff close to reality. And, what is most important, not requiring big mods that break the balance, that are complicated and, as well, for the sake of being modding-friendly. That is how I got the idea of MicroFuels. It is basically a number of MM configs for tanks and engines, that require only Firespitter plugin (for different tank configs) and MM for the configs themselves to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload proof-of-concept: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/541/MicroFuels\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E@KerbalStuff\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EREQUIRES \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64117\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMODULARFUELTANKS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E AND \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMODULEMANAGER\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EThis is currently in conceptual phase of development, thus, it means that even the necessity of such a mod is a subject of question.

But hypergolic N2H4/N2O4 (hydrazine/tetroxide) mix in this case will look like \u0022Monopropellant/Oxidizer\u0022 and that\u0027s just ODD. Maybe an MM patch replacing all parts \u0022Monoropellant\u0022 with \u0022Hydrazine\u0022? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Methane is a must for any ISRU mods support. It\u0027s a byproduct of Sabatier process (both life support oxygen regeneration and ISRU fuel production) and also was and is concidered as an alternative fuel for real nuclear drive projects, providing better thrust at cost of lower ISP (comparing to liquid hydrogen) while not being as highly cryogenic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... we should have such fuels and mixes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerosene - for jets and propellers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerosene/NTO (skipping the nitric acid part) - robust early/lowtech mix, not messing with cryogenics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrazine/NTO - effective hypergolic mix for both engines and RCS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrazine - monopropellant for RCS and smallest probe engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerosene/LOX - cheap and dense lower stage mix, more efficient than Kerosene/NTO, less expensive and poisonous then Hydrazine/NTO, but needing cryogenic tanks for long term missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EH2/LOX - highly cryogenic mix - either use it as low stage or face severe boiloff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECH4/LOX - not-so-highly cryogenic mix - mostly for ISRU refuelling capability and to utilize LS byproduct\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EH2 - highly cryogenic nuclear propellant severe boiloff!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECH4 not-so-highly cryogenic nuclear propellant (less boiloff, more thrust, less ISP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXenon - ionic propellant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
