I received a contract to rescue a kerbal from low kerbin orbit. I created a vessel to retrieve him as usual, and then when I tried to launch and set my target I was unable to do so. I got up into orbit thinking there was some limitation there, but no, I still could not target him. I tried reloading stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas there some change that would prevent me from targeting something in orbit from the launch pad now?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ald","CreatedById":121195,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T10:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost probable - low tech tracking station.
