Its about hardware, so space lounge seems right...but it\u0027s also about the game software, so space lounge doesn\u0027t work. Gameplay questions doesn\u0027t work cause its about hardware and about PPFX highlighting. Support doesn\u0027t work cause I\u0027m not asking for support really, just some questions about PPFX highlighting and such. So i just threw it here for the mods to decide. Cause I\u0027m really lost as to where this goes.\n\nSo, my question is, what hardware supports PPFX highlighting? I have a NVidia 330 graphics card with 1GB of VRAM, but I can\u0027t use PPFX highlighting because it has \u0022no hardware support\u0022 well what hardware do support it? Cause my desktop couldn\u0027t do it either, even with its very modern8 Intel Integrated HD graphpics.\n\n\\*off the shelf a month ago\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T12:35:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 12:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Endersmens**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T12:34:20Z","Content":"This is a strange one...
