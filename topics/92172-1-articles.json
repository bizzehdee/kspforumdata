This is probably the better solution. Even with 4x warp some nerva burns of mine took about half an hour in real time.

Get MJ, make a maneuver node, click Smart A.S.S. -\u0026gt; Node and it will hold the node heading for you. Then accelerate 4x using physics warp and leave it running. If you want to do something else on your PC you can alt\u002Benter and alt\u002Btab to keep the game running (just alt\u002Btab doesn\u0027t work, it pauses the game).
