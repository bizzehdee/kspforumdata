Your projected orbit shouldn\u0027t be a lot bigger/smaller than that of the target planet. That\u0027s why your dV requirements are so big. The way you should do it, if you want to save fuel, is wait for the phase angle between you and the planet to be right.

So it\u0027s a time vs fuel situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way you do it is, you put a node somewhere in your orbit and add some prograde/retrograde until your Ap/Pe match the planet\u0027s orbit, and then you slide the node around (keeping Ap at the orbit) looking at the encounter markers to see if they get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chewy","CreatedById":115853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I see the problem. You have two issues going on. One is that you\u0027re ejecting out of Kerbin\u0027s influence in the wrong direction. Two is that Eve is in the wrong position relative to Kerbin when you make your transfer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Once you are in low Kerbin orbit, you should make your transfer burn on the light side of the planet. Remember that Kerbin itself isnt stationary and has orbital velocity around the sun as well, so if you want to make a Hohmann transfer to lower your sun PE to Eve\u0027s altitude, you need to eject from Kerbin in the opposite direction to the direction Kerbin is orbiting the sun. Your transfer burn should therefore be occurring sometime between sunrise and noon. Adjust the position of the node so that your trajectory angle lines up with Kerbin\u0027s retrograde vector at the Kerbin escape point (you might need to zoom out to see Kerbin\u0027s path around the sun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Since Eve is also in motion around the sun, you need to schedule your departure so that Eve happens to be near your PE (around the sun) around the same time you arrive there. Since Eve is in a lower orbit, it is traveling faster than Kerbin, so you need to leave when Eve is behind Kerbin by about 60 degrees. This alignment will allow Eve to catch up to you while you are in your transfer orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also have to do an inclination correction at some point during the transfer (at the AN or DN). You should be able to get an encounter for less than 1500 m/s dv if you do these two things (less if you luck out with the inclination)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
