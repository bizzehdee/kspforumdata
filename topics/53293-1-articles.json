The first thing you need to know is that the atmosphere on Eve and Duna doesn\u0027t support air intake engines because the atmosphere isn\u0027t oxygen. However, you can make planes that fly on Eve and Duna as long as they\u0027re rocket powered. Landing is kind of difficult, you have to pick a good landing zone that\u0027s smooth enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my current design that I\u0027m using on Duna as a Duna SSTO, this plane was designed to fly and land on Duna, doesn\u0027t have Jet Engines and can be refueled in orbit. It also has retrograde rockets to help it stop quickly. If you have a vertical take off plane design or one that can land vertically, then landing zone problems are more easily solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/1046252431510769744/72CD8BA697A3035A89D3A55014A949C96BD68BC3/\u0022 alt=\u002272CD8BA697A3035A89D3A55014A949C96BD68BC3\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T11:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFlying on both Eve and Duna is very doable but there are a few things you should keep in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Both Eve and Duna lack oxygen, regular jet engines \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill not work\u003C/strong\u003E!

Eve is a whole different ball game compared to what get\u0027s off the ground on Kerban. The terrain is rough and difficult to land tall and thin vehicles on. You want to make sure you have a wide landing base so your craft doesn\u0027t flip over when it lands. Also, parachutes deploy at different altitudes and can rip the ship apart due to the thicker atmosphere\u0027s sudden deceleration. The best way, is to use landing engines to decelerate your lander or other craft to a safe 40 m/s or less before you deploy the parachutes so you don\u0027t risk structural failure to the craft. Also for rovers, the wheels will break easier from impact with the ground just by the craft hitting bumpy terrain at medium speed of 10 m/s or faster depending on the weight of the rover. So be careful if you haven\u0027t been to the surface of Eve yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
