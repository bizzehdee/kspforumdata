You will likely loose a lot of potential subscribers if people only see the old version in that first posting, and only new users who saw a review someone would download it, such as the one just released on youtube by KattabosGames (from what I found so far he does the absolute best ksp mod reviews, so many are likely going to check this out)\n\nI haven\u0027t tried this back when it was current so I have no idea what is in the \u0022extras\u0027 as a whole.   Maybe a better purpose for the \u0022extras\u0022 would be the Titam II themed tank (unless you add parts to build a full Titan II style rocket then those parts could be integrated to the Corvus pack) and parts like that adapter to have a clean transition between from the Corvus skin theme to other parts from vanilla or mods. (it would have a better appearance on the launch pad or in space if the adapter matched the capsule before transitioning to other parts, giving the vessel the appearance it was made for the other sized parts"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T01:04:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/13/2017 at 2:03 PM, micha said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks, but [@linuxgurugamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/) already found a download link which worked.

A bit unsure about integrating the CorvusExtras into Corvus itself as for most people they won\u0027t actually be useful. One is an adapter to the non-standard 1.875m size, the other just a reskinned tank. Might make more sense to add them to HGR? I see now why these parts were released separately. What do people think?"}]}
