War is draining. War has turned our technological skills towards the art of killing, not the art of advancement. But now, now we have peace. We have put our differences aside for the sake of kerbal kind, for the sake of our species. For generations we have dreamed of going to the great beyond, going where no kerbal has gone before.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWe have the capabilities, we have the technology, we have the ambition and we have the opportunity.

Their wars destroyed nearly all civilization on Kerbin. In end days of the war, leaders from the three main factions, Project North, the Kerbal Republic, and the Karn Dominion, came together to find common ground. Those three Kerbals, Jebediah, Bill, and Bob, managed to bring about the end of the war and promised a greater future for the united Kerbalkind. Their plan: to expand Kerbalkind throughout their solarsystem and establish a grand Kerbal Solar Empire.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThe Series\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\u0027ve finally learned how to play KSP it\u0027s time I put my idea to work. I\u0027ve wanted to do this series for over a year now and it is finally going to happen. I\u0027ve been received some inspiration from HOCGaming and EE in the genre but I feel the story and idea is largely my own. I hope everyone can be as excited about seeing it as I am for making it. There will be fleets of ships, colonies, plot, and plenty more! Furthermore to make the series more interesting I am heavily considering doing it in science mode, the whole schebang! Eventually mods may hopefully be added in but for it is vanilla! A good portion of the episodes will be in cinematic or story telling fashion with minimal out of character commentary by myself/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also want to make this series interactive for the viewers. So... if you want to voice act or submit a ship, satellite or colony module for the series I\u0027d love to hear from you. I will be posting all the episodes to here along with many screenshots of the project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EEpisodes\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPILOT \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NijKijCiF1U?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
