Allowing a player to accept a contract failing (and not revert \u0026amp; try again) depends on the player - some like it the hard way, some will revert even for a couple of thousand bucks. You can\u0027t fit everyones desires, that\u0027s why the suggestion was a self-defined minimum base value for funds. I reckon I tried to fit the vast majority of players - making them accept a failed contract even if it eats through your small starter budget due to compensation by the government. Failing a contract and losing reputation in later game would just eat little money, and since the reputation loss for compensation money is applied one week later you have plenty of time to fix that until it finally takes that bit of your money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the grinding back - this is the nicest feature of my proposal: You don\u0027t have to. You\u0027re just rewarded if you succeed. If you\u0027re down on your luck, the government will help you. The reputation loss is never that big and most of the time easy to compensate, and even if you don\u0027t do that, you lose money only once (next payday), afterwards even a 1 point reputation gain within the week will give you the bonus money (the only way I can imagine this system to be exploited, by small reputation gains even at small stakes, but there\u0027s ways to prevent even that). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoney for personal projects: You will have plenty. Trust me on that, I\u0027m atm building a Munar lab base in Kerbin orbit, launch costs at 2.4M, and I still could easily do another one with my current funds.

Once you produce enough bricks and wood to eat half your transportation capacity (and at later points you have to do that), are supposed to supply 20 cities on the map with 20 types of stuff, half the cities growing steadily, increasing production and need for supply and have to pay your employees (about 2500 atm) and taxes once a week (in my current game this eats ~200k gold, growing by 20k-40k per week, with a ton of beer being worth about 40 straight) - I\u0027m used to one mistake throwing back production/progress of one or all cities for months. L\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCbeck (my main bricks production site) was besieged in early March, killing all my production and employees (about 500 \u002B 1500 family members - half the population) - I\u0027m in mid July, and still not yet back at 100% production capacity, despite gigantic efforts to shove (SHOVE, not lure, because it\u0027s way more effective) people into the city.
