I buil a 40k rocket (messing with Kethane scanners). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rocket is flat probe core, mechjeb, gyro, longish liquid fuel tank on top of a solid fuel tank. On top of all this I have a docking port, then a docking port to the \u0022satellite\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I get into position to complete the mission, decouple the satellite, switch to it and seem to suddenly get a bunch of money, maybe 26k (more than the solid booster was worth, that\u0027s for sure). In fact, as I switch between the satellite and launcher the mission parameters change (kinda expect that) but the dollars moved around on the first jump (possibly the first jump that is all green in orbit parameters, be that the first time you switch to a sat, or after switching back and forth a few times). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I can then also complete the mission with the satellite. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is something ... odd going on with rewards. Not sure if it is caused by the docking node or the ship switching (I didn\u0027t test with a standard decoupler)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I built the rocket like that so I can deorbit, land and recycle the main body, but walking away from the first mission with, somehow, 136k seems a little odd! (Hmm, I guess I did have a polar orbit, not sure that comes into play here).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T19:13:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by TinyPirate\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legion1202","CreatedById":78116,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T15:49:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello all.
