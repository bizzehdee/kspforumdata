But then, the game is way out of balance, and I have to get Realism Overhall. I did not really like that, but I liked the simulation of the off-axis tilt of the earth, and the look of Earth-like kerbin. Please let me know if you need more information, I am willing to help. I will post a poll. If you want it, vote yes, if not, vote no. if a lot of you guys say no, or say the mod exists, then I will close the thread and move on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T14:04:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RoketMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPoll will close unless people don\u0026#039;t want it to.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T19:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mod already.
