IF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WANT IT TO STAY UP, I WONT CLOSE IT.**\n\nGood day, KSP community,\n\nI started to get into mods about a month ago, and I discovered in RSS, Kerbin looks like earth. But then, the game is way out of balance, and I have to get Realism Overhall. I did not really like that, but I liked the simulation of the off-axis tilt of the earth, and the look of Earth-like kerbin. Please let me know if you need more information, I am willing to help. I will post a poll. If you want it, vote yes, if not, vote no. if a lot of you guys say no, or say the mod exists, then I will close the thread and move on.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T14:04:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RoketMan**\n  \nPoll will close unless people don\u0027t want it to."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T19:27:35Z","Content":"There is a mod already.
