It\u0027s like the Kraken itself is dragging it\u00A0somewhere into\u00A0space.\u00A0As a result\u00A0of this \u0022free acceleration\u0022, it has been impossible for me to achieve a stable orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis bug is not new for me, I have seen it in many others situations in 1.0, 1.1 and so on. but with just a simple restart it was fixed but now restart doesn\u0027t\u00A0work even I created a new game still it persists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are the only mods I have installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QuRN60.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img923/7834/QuRN60.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
