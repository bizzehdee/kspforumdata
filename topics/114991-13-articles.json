Compared to that, Ampyear does quite alot changes to the save file (at least I\u0027ve read so, didn\u0027t try it so far), making the removal of the mod difficult. It provides also alot unneeded complexity in GUI and usage - against the motto \u0022one job, one tool\u0022.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong: Your mod is the best for its job I know this far, I am grateful to you providing it, and you have every right to make this mod as you like. But I think, this thread is also here to provide feedback for you. And my feedback is, that a simple window showing the power consumption/production, maybe also the dark times of orbit, and doing nothing else, would be sufficient to me and most of the users. It could also be, that I am totally wrong and that the additional features are used by most of the people.
