This cleans up the orbits and gives me some additional funds from the recovered parts (although the funds are probably a lie).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used to do it with cargo-bay equipped rescue craft, but was having less than optimal results. Also, some derelicts are too big to safely capture and return in a cargo bay. So one night I said the hell with it and decided I will just throw reentry capability to the derelicts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince then, my standard RescuePod is usually some variation of:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n3.75m heatshield on one end (the part that will face into the atmosphere at reentry and keep everything else mostly safe from the heating)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMk1-2 pod (a safe space for up to three Kerbals to be rescued, the derelict parts aren\u0027t always guaranteed to make it through reentry so they can\u0027t stay in there)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nprobe core (so I can send it up unmanned and use all pod seats for rescue)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA.G.U./Claw on the other end (since derelicts never seem to have docking ports, for grabbing the derelict and holding on to it through reentry).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAlong with that I strap on some battery, extra monoprop, a helping of linear RCS ports, a few advanced canards (airbrakes are too melty), drogues and chutes, and if I feel generous some landing legs for a more comfy lithobreak at the very end of the trip (actually it depends on the weight of the derelict to salvage). Somewhere on there I attach a couple of oscar tanks and Sparks with just enough fuel to make it all dip back into the atmosphere, and it\u0027s either enough by itself for a full reentry or it will slowly aerobrake into a return after a couple orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fully ablator-filled heatshield with the pod and stuff, are usually heavy enough to keep the shield facing the airstream and the to be salvaged derelict trailing. When not, the canards help. Even with 3.75m sized derelicts and the less than optimal angles the Claw sometimes grips a part, the wake of the heatshield protects it enough from overheating. The couple of times it didn\u0027t, it was just the derelict that melted and the Kerbals made it down safe in the pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this can usually be fit together in a pretty compact package, which does well in a fairing on top of a simple, recoverable rocket with enough dV to lob it into a rendevouz orbit. Helps me keep the orbits clear as well as add to my ranks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it work in a hard mode career? No. Is it a feasible way to earn some extra funds? Probably also no, even with a fully recoverable lifter stage (fuel used is probably more than the derelict is worth). But it makes me feel good that I salvage, no parts burn up in the atmosphere and pollute it, and it keeps my orbits groomed. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T22:20:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStuff in orbit is \u003Cstrong\u003Evaluable\u003C/strong\u003E.

There is an old sci-fi short story by David Brin called \u0022Tank Farm Dynamo\u0022 that deals with this topic, for anyone who may be interested in the reality of it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenius! I\u0027m a convert to this for my next career. I doubt a real space program would be quite so quick to adopt junk without inspection or refurbishment, but on the other hand it\u0027s neat\u00A0how this alludes to the \u0022build it in orbit\u0022 solution to lowering launch costs\u00A0that would be necessary for larger-scale projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T08:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took a page from NASA on this and went a ways further. I RP that everything I launch has explosives on it. NASA does this too and I\u0027m certain other agencies as well, they have explosives on rockets for safety reasons, which is the page I took. Where I went was, once a mission has ended, mission control sends a command to activate said explosives. This is how I justify the use of terminate x in tracking center. Just mah two cents lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
