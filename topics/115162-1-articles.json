At the same time, it comes with the consequences of those purposes and goals, namely explosions, rapid unintended individual component flight, dramatic crashes and more. Some of us have grown especially fond of this latter aspect, especially in the real world: you could say that we are explosion admirers. In the same way that an art admirer must also learn his artists and appreciate them on a personal dimension, so too must we explosion admirers learn to appreciate things that blow other things up. This means becoming intimately aware of weapons such as tanks, artillery, fighter jets and other items. To return to the likening of our particular movement to that of art, there are also particular and interesting submovements (we could draw parallells to those who collect rennaissance art), which tend to focus on one particular group of things that make other things blow up. Some seem to prefer modern era things that blow other things up, whereas others are drawn to the World War II \u0027dieselpunk\u0027, if you will. Now, given that KSP is a very practical tool for creating all things - literally - between the heavens and the earth, some choose KSP as their medium of expressing their appreciation of things that blow other things up. And so they build weapons of war, such as tanks, artillery, and fighter jets.\n\nWhat I\u0027m trying to get at is, let\u0027s just appreciate it for what it is, regardless of our personal approval of machines of war in KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T18:03:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Umm, sure, OK.
