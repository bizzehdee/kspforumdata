For all we know, conditions under the surface of those moons are very hostile to the \u003Cem\u003Eformation\u003C/em\u003E of life. Martian life could conceivably have a common origin with Earth life, but the outer solar system moons almost certainly cannot be seeded via meteorites. They sit at the bottom of huge gravity wells, so meteors impact at very high speeds, and with the exception of Titan, they do not have atmospheres to cushion their impacts. All outer solar system moons have surface conditions that are lethal to all forms of life as we know it. Add to that, they are very far away, so materials blasted off of Earth (or Mars) has an extremely, incredibly low probability of impacting into, say, Europa, and even if a Earth/Mars meteoriod were so lucky, it would still most likely happen only after it had been floating around in space so long that all the biologicals it was carrying had died. So if we find anything living out there, it will almost assuredly be the result of a separate genesis of life.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T14:15:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T14:40:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a body large enough to establish a decent hydrostatic equilibrium to turn itself into a proper ball, and it\u0027s far away making it possess ancient nebula H2O, chances are very high (I\u0027d say 100% for all intents and purposes) there will be at least one pocket of liquid water at some depth where the heat is trapped and pressure is high enough.

Without aerobraking you need crazy delta-v to slow down from interplanetary speeds... i cant remember of anything landing on a body without an atmosphere (not counting stuff like rosetta/philae and the moon, obviously)\u003Cp\u003EOr you could do a jupiter aerobrake and then continue towards ganymede/europa maybe ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA jupiter aerobrake must be very risky, you dont want to get too deep in its atmosphere... What do you guys think ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you would have to carry a heat shield to avoid burning to a crisp (and considering the depth of Jupiter\u0027s gravity well, probably quite a chunky one). I\u0027d guess that the delta-V savings from the aerobrake are probably almost completely negated by the cost of having the heat shield.

A low circular orbit around Jupiter is greatly improved by aerobraking. A higher, more elliptical orbit, and the cost of the heatshield rapidly outweighs the benefit in fuel savings, which I suppose makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
