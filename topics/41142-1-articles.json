Once an idea has been \u0027approved\u0027 as good enough to get promoted to the ideas forum, it gets debated as normal, and then gets included in a monthly communique post at a top level forum, so you would have \u0022July ideas digest\u0022, which would contain a, say, 50 word outline of the idea, and the link to the post, for the top 10-15 ideas from that month. Once those ideas have been raised, they\u0027re effectively locked in and so the devs can approach them in their own time. Each month, any new ideas get added to a new post, and the cycle continues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a more direct and intensive process to suggestions, but since suggestions are the place for the community to feed back their thoughts, it deserves a bit of love.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the main ideas get debated, the hope is that we get a bit of dev two-way communication to say \u0022oh! we hadn\u0027t thought of that, that\u0027s great!\u0022 or \u0022Nah bro, ain\u0027t never gonna happen!\u0022.
