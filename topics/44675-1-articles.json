Now I\u0027m looking to push the boundaries a bit farther out into the solar system. My question is, how do I set up an IP comm network. I know I need the sat dishes; I\u0027m talking about where to place the satellites. I\u0027d like 24/7/365 coverage of every planet eventually. That means I\u0027ll need to set up comm sats to transmit the signal around the Sun to planets that may be on the opposite side of the Sun from Kerbin. Any suggestions on what orbits I should place the comm sats in?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T10:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will need at least one satellite for each planet/moon, plus one for solar orbits, with at least one dish. You\u0027ll need a craft with the same amount of dishes, or multiple ones with fewer dishes, in orbit around Kerbin, with one dish pointing at each celestial body. RemoteTech seems to totally ignore line-of-sight if the target is in a different sphere of influence. In case you want to go for realism, then the satellite requirement doubles (put the two satellites in opposite points of the same orbit), plus you\u0027ll need a satellite in orbit around Kerbol with an identical orbit to Kerbin, but 1/4th of an orbit ahead or behind it, to target anything that might be behind Kerbol. And of course, you\u0027ll need a satellite network around each planet to propagate the signal from the relays to the planetary surface or other points in orbit around the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
