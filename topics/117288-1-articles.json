Many programs have installers which do this. I would imagine it also adds a desktop shortcut and similar things which wouldn\u0027t be added if you just downloaded the game directly (although I don\u0027t know for sure). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need it. You can just download the version(s) you want and extract them wherever you like from the zip file, then run the game from there. The installer is just an alternative way of getting the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
