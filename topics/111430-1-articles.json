I loaded without any mods and that problem was solve (only one setting per wheel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I had another problem, in the VAB, it was showing about 3 pages of random (?) parts. The bar on the left that let you switch categories was missing. If you hit \u0022Enable Advanced Mode\u0022, you could see parts by category, but the parts displayed wouldn\u0027t change when you changed categories unless you resorted them. And some of the categories were cut off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started fresh. Then I found out that if I brought my old saves into an unmodded program, same problem with the corrupted VAB. In the end, it turned out I had a persistent file that had the problem in it. So I\u0027m using a save from last week. Sucks a bit, but it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a problem last few days where the heat shield module on ship wouldn\u0027t show that cover between the heat shield and the coupler (you could see a gap between the modules, it looked like the capsule \u0026amp; HS where floating above the coupler). I had thought it was cosmetic and would go away when that mission ended. Maybe not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo one question. Is any of this worth reporting to squad or are they going to feel it just too complicate (and the fault of mods anyway)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T19:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d not help to report this to Squad, the issue is how module manager changed your save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack it up and open it, and look for the line with modulemanager in it, that\u0027s pointing to a modulemanager tech tree file you don\u0027t have installed anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange the line to point to /GameData/Squad/Resources/TechTree.cfg and it\u0027ll work again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECAREER\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tTechTreeUrl = GameData/Squad/Resources/TechTree.cfg\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T19:50:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T02:01:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027d not help to report this to Squad, the issue is how module manager changed your save.\u003Cp\u003EBack it up and open it, and look for the line with modulemanager in it, that\u0027s pointing to a modulemanager tech tree file you don\u0027t have installed anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange the line to point to /GameData/Squad/Resources/TechTree.cfg and it\u0027ll work again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECAREER\u003Cbr\u003E        {\u003Cbr\u003E            TechTreeUrl = GameData/Squad/Resources/TechTree.cfg\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange the one that says....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022TechTreeUrl = GameData/ModuleManager.TechTree\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T23:19:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidpsummers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022davidpsummers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EChange the one that says....\u003Cp\u003E\u0022TechTreeUrl = GameData/ModuleManager.TechTree\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid this.
