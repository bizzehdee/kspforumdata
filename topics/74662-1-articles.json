I\u0027m new to the modding community and have never actually made a mod but there is one ship nasa is working on that i would love to be able to use to shuttle kerbals to and from my stations. The ship im refering to is the NASA Dream Chaser. Some of you might not have heard of it before but its like a smaller newer (wingless) space shuttle. Yes Wingless!!! It\u0027s body is flat and has a big surface area to support the craft to land. To take off it sits on top of an atlas V rocket (which i would also like in this mod) and is meant to shuttle astronauts (and kerbals) to orbiting facilities. Again I\u0027ve never modded a craft or anything for that matter but i would like to have someone mod this for me or with me for us and the entire ksp community to enjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.space.com/images/i/000/016/832/original/sierra-nevada-dream-chaser-120425a-02.jpg?1335367681\u0022 alt=\u0022sierra-nevada-dream-chaser-120425a-02.jpg?1335367681\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would like to help me on this project just post in the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will hope if I get help to have the mod up by the end of the summer, but not really sure how long it will take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -GBLAKEM1999\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey guys. I decided that I am going to make this modded part. I downloaded the software yesterday and I\u0027m currently getting used to it. After i get used to it then im going to make a few easy parts getting progressively more challenging like boosters and fuels tanks to rcs ports and that stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m putting a rough estimate on the release to be Sunday, July 31, 2014 for the prototype of this part.
