It may turn out to be one of those things that I am ignorantly unaware as being common or easy, and if so I apologize for wasting your time. But I haven\u0027t been this proud of something since my first Mun landing over 18 months ago.\n\nI\u0027ll spare you the details of why I got into this position, but if you\u0027re curious and have time to burn, the story is [posted here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1970576#post1970576).\n\nThe upshot of it all was that due to my own error in construction I found a ship\u0027s command module spontaneously disassembled from the rest of it, so it was dead in the water. Or space. Whatever. And, it was in deep space, its orbital path around the sun, periapsis from just outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI and apoapsis touching Duna\u0027s orbit. Basically in the middle of nowhere, no planets even remotely close by. I decided to try a rescue mission, so I built another ship that would attach a new command module via the Claw. But how the heck to do the rendezvous?\n\nI had tried a similar deep space rendezvous about a year ago but gave up immediately when the closest I could get a rendezvous point was over 10,000 km. But I thought to give it a go this time. So, after getting the rescue ship into orbit and burning out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI into deep space, I set up a manoeuvre node and once again the closest I could get to the broken ship was ~12,000 km. Disappointing. But I thought maybe somewhere along the way I could refine it. So I time-warped about halfway, stopped, and rotated my ship to each of the 3 axis points. First I tried prograde-retrograde; small squirts of RCS thrusters forward and backward to see if I could get the encounter closer. And I could, by a little bit. The I tried normal-antinormal, that made a bigger difference. Then I did the same with the other axis, and that also made a slight difference. By the time that was done, the encounter was down to ~9,000 km. Better but still way too far away.\n\nTimewarped halfway throughout the remainder of the course to the broken ship, stopped and made all the same adjustments. Then again and again and again. By the time I was three days away from the rendezvous I had whittled it down to 5 km!!! I honestly didn\u0027t think that was possible, but it turns out that it is.\n\nSo, the moral of my story is that no ship, no matter where it is (other than the surface of Jool I suppose) is without hope!\n\n![Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.07.50-PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.07.50-PM.png)\n\n![Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.14.13-PM.png](http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.14.13-PM.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T15:32:19Z","Content":"Excellent work!

The issue appears to be that the closest approach is always measured when your ship is at the point where the orbits come closest to crossing. But if you have a significant difference in velocity between the two ships, they might pass one another before or after that point, but be long gone by the time the other gets there."},{"CreatedByName":"lazarus1024","CreatedById":65276,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T16:23:59Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve gotten within 5km before at such a distance, but I have gotten within something like 50km and tightened it up after that and gotten dock. As you found, you sometimes have to tweak several times on you way towards your meeting place. I doubt I\u0027ve had the distance within 1,000km at anything over half an orbit away. Time warp to a quarter orbit, tweak a little. Time warp a little more, tweak a little more. Rinse and repeat.\n\nYou kind of, sort of have to do the same thing with asteroid rendezvous (unless you get one within an SOI of something).\n\nIgnoring asteroids, I think I\u0027ve done it 3 or 4 times over the years. Once to rescue a ship, once to try it and 1-2 times because I was building a space station orbiting between Duna and Kerbin. I only latched up 1 or 2 modules before I threw up my hands and said it was too much work."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T16:32:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve noticed that too.
