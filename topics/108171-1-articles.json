I am sure its very complicated but I succeeded pretty well in starting an accurate graph model. [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sgwvpnc2sk](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sgwvpnc2sk) (this is a velocity vs time graph on the rocket taking consideration with mass changes over time and the constant gravity force ignoring also the drag force since it doesnt seem to take effect right away as I am calculating it)\n\nthe acceleration I change a bit just to show how closely related these are to the points. Its pretty impressive and a good start. Let me know what you guys think of this."}]}
