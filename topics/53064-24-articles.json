Ooooo...I may have to switch from TAC next time I start a game. I\u0027m enjoying this tech tree mod enough that it is a certainty I\u0027ll start a new game with it at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this brings up an issue that I\u0027m running into: the power demands of antennas in the RemoteTech 2 mod. The power demands seem much too high and mean that communication satellites based on real satellites don\u0027t work. This may be an issue to take up on the RemoteTech thread rather than here, but it is partly a result of which photoelectrics you have early in (just about any) tech tree. I\u0027ll post it to both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the antennas which seem like logical choices for the main antenna on an early, low-orbit comm sats (omnidirectional ones with a few thousand km range) requires power to the tune of 0.1-0.2 units per second. The only photoelectric panel available at the start is the ST1 which generates 1.1 units/min. So to power your antenna you need around 10 panels facing the sun. Fitting this much on a single satellite makes for a big satellite. The smallest I\u0027ve managed able to power an antenna like this had a fueled mass of 5.4 t (admittedly, I could have built it with empty fuel tanks, but as long as it has to be this big I figure it might as well supply a good portion of its own delta v). To make a higher orbit satellite with a dish (say the Comms DTS-M1) the smallest satellite I\u0027ve managed is 6.1 t and a ridiculous part count of 405 because of all the panels. I\u0027m not convinced this even has enough power (I\u0027m still getting it into orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, early comm sats like Syncom and Intelsat had fueled masses under 100 kg. They only used surface mounted photoelectric panels, like what the early game panels are trying to model. So it would be good for realism if the power demands were such that we could build satellites in this size range and have them work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow of course, if you\u0027re not using ECLSS, you can rely on the power not draining when you aren\u0027t looking at the satellite, but this feels like cheating and it doesn\u0027t solve the problem of how you maneuver the satellite into place without constantly running the batteries dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, like I said this probably more an issue for the RemoteTech thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T20:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the same place where you set your range multiplier (Remotetech2_settings.cfg) also change the consumption multiplier to like 0.1 or 0.05; that will give a more realistic power draw.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bulletrhli","CreatedById":55960,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T20:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aazard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aazard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Elife support is among the most important of all\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut not required by my books \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I did eventually end up adding it but it isn\u0027t something I will probably keep.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T21:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the KI-9000 Super Stretchable Fuel Tanks supposed to only have a max width of 2.5 m, or is there some node later in the tech tree that increases their maximum size?

For flavor, experiments have been renamed to match these achievements. I redid them up until Vanguard, so the follow ups will be \u0027Kerbal\u0027 versions of their historical counterparts. Until either someone makes those probes, or I find the time and decided to play resize madness to make one that looks close to it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Mechjeb, yes, that\u0027s indeed in the plans. But to not delay MS19, I\u0027ll go ahead and release it without that tweak. But I\u0027ll do a hotfix for it. If you wouldn\u0027t mind, how exactly do you go about of setting MJ\u0027s additional features within the tech tree? Is it a file you modify in the MJ folders? I\u0027m sure the info is out there, but i\u0027m swiming in plugin land of my own. So any help/tips would be awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, and everyone else, for trying this out! I hope the next release will be a plesant first step towards a more complete experience! But again, forewarning, up until I\u0027m able to create enough custom experiments to potentially have missions for all bodies, and soon-ish, also have biome specific ones, one must be mindful to at least unlock some \u0027stock or mod\u0027 regular modules to make sure you can still get some science when you run out of RPL experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those braves ones who\u0027ve peeked at my experiment files, or the plugin itself. I would be more than happy to accept submission of completed missions! I\u0027d suggest focusing on Moon, Venus \u0026amp; Mars. As those are the ones that need the most attention for now. Then we can move towards Mercury, Jupiter(and it\u0027s moons). I\u0027ll skip adding manned experiments to this release, but may add them as a hotfix as well. (MS19 will be like tempered steel with all those hot fixes... ok it\u0027s not that funny...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve spent the day finalizing the plugin, I think the chemical release module is up to spec. Just need to tweak and rename a few methods so that it makes more sense, then I\u0027m jumping back into MM files. To finish it off by a glorious mega sweep of the tech tree, followed by a long session of reading all the involved mods to see if I didn\u0027t miss anything in my never ending update for MS19. Sadly NathanKell is away for the day, so hopefully I can snag him tonight to pry all this sweet information from him. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still intend to release development videos and/or tutorial videos showcasing the functionality of the tech tree and the Experiment plugin I\u0027ve built. So for those who hate my walls of text, and don\u0027t mind my ramblings, then you\u0027ll be able to get an update here and there on the work in progress and future plans. In the meantime, I had started a series of very casual 10 minute reviews of old DOS games, if you go on Youtube and check The Medieval Nerd, you should find some lightly entertaining material. Disclaimer, all those are pure adlib, and zero prep, so there are extensive sessions of rambling going on. Don\u0027t expect a well throught out review. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough of that!
