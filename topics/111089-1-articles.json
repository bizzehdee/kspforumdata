I\u0027m definitely on the sunny side of the planet. I did multiple orbits to ensure and its nothing but blackness.\n\nI\u0027m using EVE, planet shine and outer planets.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/pm9wu4dn1aaq6i7/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pm9wu4dn1aaq6i7/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\noutput log.\n\nThanks for any help.\n\nDel"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T04:30:22Z","Content":"The first thing I noted was the fact it appears you have some outdated mods\n\nI would first make sure ALL your mods are current. This typically eliminates many issues.\n\nSecondly I noted a repeating error, the source of which is unclear. To determine the source I recommend installing Exception detector. This mod will determine the offending assembly and aid in determining the cause of the repeating error.\n\nThird, I noted that your clouds enhancement for EVE is causing errors as well... \n\nSo the effect you are getting on Moho may be related to this.\n\nSteps for remediation:\n\n1. Install current versions of all mods. (I quickly noted Module Manager and MechJeb as being out of date, could be more)\n\n2. Install Exception detector to aid in determining the source of repeating errors.\n\n3. Remove offending mods (or make them current) based on the results of Exception Detector\u0027s results.\n\n4. Begin removing mods one by one, until your Moho error goes away. Note the mod and reinstall the remainder to ensure the error \u0022stays gone\u0022.\n\nHope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"MrCynical","CreatedById":116703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:40:02Z","Content":"I\u0027ve just found the same bug, and after some switching in and out of mods it appears to be the outer planets mod, or the Kopernicus mod it depends on that\u0027s causing the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Delrey","CreatedById":131343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T00:59:05Z","Content":"Is there a current version of EVE?"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T01:12:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there a current version of EVE?\n\nAt the moment, no, but I\u0027ve been informed that it should work in 1.0.2.

If you take a look at the discussion thread, there has been some conversation on \u0022nursing\u0022 it thru the image loading process, as it caches the images after it converts them... But that may be Active Texture Management I\u0027m thinking of...
