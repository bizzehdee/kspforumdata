Not placing any bets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort explanation - I need a parser program that will check the integrity of a craft file and show me where things go awry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong version - I went to load my Mun Base craft to work on it some more, but the menu said it now contained an invalid part. It worked fine yesterday. I looked to see if the part was available in the part tabs and it was not. I had trouble with this part once before. Early on it had an extra } at the end of the file that I had to fix. I opened the cfg to check today and it was fine. I made no changes. Loaded KSP again and the previously questioned part is now available. The Mun Base craft opened in the hangar, except several later added items are not there. Closed KSP, opened the craft file, and I can see the parts towards the bottom of the file. The craft file is long and will be a bear to try and spot an error - especially for someone with very little experience. I need some way to automate the process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T21:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, this may be best in addon requests, but I think something like this did exist, it was a part of some tools years ago so I don\u0027t know if it will still help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t remember what it was called though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T08:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made a lua tool for parsing standalone .craft file, but i\u0027m assuming the craft part of the save file structure would be the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile my tool isn\u0027t made for error checking (it\u0027s for swapping equivalent parts: mk2 short fuselage -\u0026gt; mk2 crew compartement. it allows me to do build transport, cargo and tanker variants of my spaceplanes very easily), It would probably be able to raise any simple error (ie. file syntax error)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContact me if you haven\u0027t found anything better in a couple of days, and if command line invocation of such a tool isn\u0027t scaring you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T09:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to do something like that.
