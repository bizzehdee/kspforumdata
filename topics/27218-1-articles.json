That is to say, you have an intrinsic bias towards your own implicit state. Given that existence appears to indeed be a state dictated by systems which can be understood; any estimation of your physical body as a representation of your person however, is wildly hypothetical. The body is in a constant state of replacing itself, you are no more a person you were ten years ago than the person you were yesterday. The neurons supposedly responsible for a decision today may be gone before a verdict is made. Are your memories reliable or the byproduct of cellular replacement? The problem with being a selfish observer is there is no second state from which to contrast. It is little more than acceptance. I think, therefore I am. The definition of a person then, is merely a accepted consensus of general patterning, as really, that\u0027s the portion of it that tends to appeal to other observers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo ask, \u0022What is a person?\u0022 Is just a different version of \u0022Why am I here?\u0022 or \u0022What is the meaning of life?\u0022 Both which reveal the same answer; dictation by the observer. Consensual observation is what dictates the entirety of your existence. If you believe everything is well and fine, everything is well and fine because that is what you perceive to be true. Our reluctance for change is a prime example, we prefer ordered similarity to chaotic change. If change must happen, we prefer it in measured doses rather than sweeping adjustments. Therefore, a person is what you see when you see a person. This has proven useful to manipulate; typically a lack of perceived similarity between an aggressor and their victims is characteristic. We are more likely to incite violence and aggression against something we perceive as different from ourselves. We are people, they are things.
