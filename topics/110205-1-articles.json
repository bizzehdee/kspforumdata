My calculation is ~25% (simple 1-(226.67/261.6)^2), but I\u0027m not so sure since I assumed equal distribution of energy on the area of the sun we see, but this assumption may be false. A more reasonable assumption is equal distribution of energy on the surface of Sun, but I don\u0027t know how to calculate that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing anything or any stupid calculation mistakes? If not, then I\u0027ll probably feel better about my RT comm network around Kerbin where I forgot to handle eclipses.

I don\u0027t know about the distribution of energy across the area of the disc, though, so I can\u0027t say if you\u0027re right about the amount of energy. I believe KSP determines an eclipse by where the center of the Sun is, not the edges, so you stop getting electricity precisely halfway through sunrise or sunset--it also doesn\u0027t seem to take into account local topography, which is especially noticeable on Minmus, where I\u0027ve frequently noticed my ships continue receiving power long after the Sun has passed below the apparent horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T08:21:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP you loose all power in any eclipse, even if the body in not even visible against the sun.
