Probably the biggest is structural stability. I\u0027ve gotten good at building heavy lifters. This is the inevitable result of my efforts: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72938-Flyingfox-SSTO-Heavy-Lifter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlyingfox SSTO Heavy Lifter\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have found you need to have a solid engineering process so that you know the plane is going to work. This will prevent the scenario where you put countless hours into a build only to find one issue makes it fail it\u0027s mission requirements. So, I start with a power plant that I know is going to get into orbit at maximum load, plus the fuel tanks for stated range and all the various \u0027wiring\u0027(fuel lines, intakes, etc). After that is the battery of tests, the most important of which are the structural tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe absolute essential tests are, the drop test and the taxi test. The drop test it to put your craft on the runway as early in the build process as possible and using hack gravity, drop it onto the tarmac from higher elevations until at least 10m is zero threat. This has to be done with maximum payload in the cargo hold. The taxi test is to go down the runway(again under full load) at takeoff speed, power down and aggressively swerve from side to side. If your plane stays together without breaking or undue wobble during these two tests then your design will hold up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother test which I like to do is sit on the runway at 4x speed. This will show me where my fail points are likely to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also use temporary aerodynamic and flight control surfaces before I \u0027skin\u0027 it with wings. The wings take the longest and you need to know the craft is right before the wings go on. I use winglet stacks and a wing arrangement I call the pizza box to do my orbital tests. Once I\u0027m happy it\u0027s going into space as per its mission requirements, then it\u0027s time to put some clothes on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my approach, based on design lifters designed around a girder and strut super structure so they can STOL to and from other planetary bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eO4bRCf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eO4bRCf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulreaver1981","CreatedById":38542,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T04:47:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etanks for your tips o-Doc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis build was inspired by youre flyingfox\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
