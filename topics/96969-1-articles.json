I mainly use the custom categories to break down the \u0022utility\u0022 tab into more manageable chunks, like I have a tab for power, one for parachutes, one for legs and ladders, etc. I love the fact that any categories/tabs you make are preserved across saves, yes it\u0027s a bit of a chore to set them up the first time, but then you\u0027re done. I do have a few suggestions to make the UI better tho (imo):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Is the \u0022Filter by Manufacturer\u0022 button really needed?

Just wanted to say that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) This isn\u0027t really a squad problem, but I wish mods would spruce up their entries in the \u0022filter by module\u0022 tab.
