For example, both the mainsail and the skipper have had their Isp bumped to 320/370, and the skipper lost a ton of mass. The skipper in particular is finally a viable engine, having better stats and connectivity options than the old trick of using a cluster of 3 LVT-30s. The poodle also lost half a ton, and is a bit more viable as well. Some of the KW Rocketry engines now look worse in comparison, simply because they now have some of the lowest Isp figures around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else talked about this much?
