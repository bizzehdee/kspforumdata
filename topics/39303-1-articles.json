If your RCS is at least attempted to balance, it should stay pretty close to your locked heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the not so announce addition, was if you have Fine Controls on, the RCS will attempt to balance itself as well, depending how far the thruster is from CoM. This will reduce the overall thrust available, so your movements will be slower, but also your attitude drift should be lower as well, so the SAS will use less Mono maintaining.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
