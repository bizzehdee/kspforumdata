I was flying a plane around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and I paused the game while in IVA mode. Then I pressed F2 to get rid of the UI and I saw my own ship, while I was in it. It seems like pressing F2 changes the cameras position somehow. The bug only seems to appear while you are turning very fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImages:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/HAbE1cE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/HAbE1cE\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
