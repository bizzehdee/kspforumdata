On the bottom of this I put the \u0027baby\u0027 heat shield.\n\nI have 2x radial parachutes on the science bay, and a radial \u002B mk16 parachute on the pod.\n\nI have a liquid fuel engine (for secondary stage / space) \u002B 4 Thumper solid fuel as first stages.\n\nNow, I did a test to ensure the thing wouldn\u0027t burn up on reentry. I got all the way to space, jettisoned the boosters \u002B liquid fuel and did a test re-entry. Worked fine, no problems. No overheat components.\n\nOn the actual flight, I did 4x goo observations. I closed up the science bay, and proceeded to reentry.\n\nHowever, I seem to overheat and blow up every time.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts as to why the test re-entry was ok, but the \u0027real mission\u0027 is such a failure? ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nThanks in advance ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T11:50:21Z","Content":"Orbital flight is at least 2200m/s while vertical reentry from a suborbital jump up will rarely exceed 1000.
