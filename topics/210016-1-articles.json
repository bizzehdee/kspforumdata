It was great. I was still single at that point, and if I had a mind to I could have totally gotten a date or two out of it. Yeah, there were some folks there who were really trying way too hard to impress everyone. (One guy showed up with two dates, bragging to anyone who would listen about how he had just been accepted to medical school. Um, okay, dude...) But I thought it was really cool to find out how everyone was getting along. I think what I found most interesting was how many people I had not interacted with at all in high school I wound up sitting down and chatting with. Like the girl who had been super overweight, who was now super fit, married, two kids. I didn\u0027t even recognize her. We talked for a while about really deep stuff she went through after high school. We had one guy who had been busted for selling cocaine on campus right before graduation, it had been this huge scandal. He showed up married, one on the way, working in real estate, going to church, had really turned his life around. It was really inspiring, actually.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20-year was even better. I was married at that point, my wife was three months along with our first, so she went home early. A lot of the same folks were there, but some others showed up who hadn\u0027t been there for the 10-year. Amusingly, I had like three ex-girlfriends show up, and two of them were divorced and very disappointed that I was now married. LOL Best part was afterwards. So one of my best friends from HS, who graduated a year ahead of me, decided to crash the reunion. He\u0027s one of those guys that everybody knows and loves, so he was immediately the life of the party. When the doors of the actual party closed at 11:00, a couple of us and him walk down the street to the Hard Rock Cafe. We walk in the bar, and the bartender is another guy from the class ahead of me that we had all been friends with. We had no clue, complete random chance, none of us had even seen him in years. So suddenly we\u0027re all hanging out together and he\u0027s not letting us pay for drinks. We closed that place down, and then wound up at some pirate dance club down in West Hollywood for a couple of hours. It was so much fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to go to my 30-year reunion, but they scheduled it for the same weekend that they hold the homeschool conference down in Phoenix, and that was the one weekend a year that my wife had to be able to get away by herself without the kids.

(Again.) I\u0027ve had tons of fun at my reunions. They weren\u0027t earth-shattering, life-changing experiences, but I wasn\u0027t really expecting them to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10-year I went back and it was a nice dinner and drinks party at a hotel on Friday night, and then Saturday we all got together at the school campus with the families and a bunch of the teachers who showed up. It was great. I was still single at that point, and if I had a mind to I could have totally gotten a date or two out of it. Yeah, there were some folks there who were really trying way too hard to impress everyone. (One guy showed up with two dates, bragging to anyone who would listen about how he had just been accepted to medical school. Um, okay, dude...) But I thought it was really cool to find out how everyone was getting along. I think what I found most interesting was how many people I had not interacted with at all in high school I wound up sitting down and chatting with. Like the girl who had been super overweight, who was now super fit, married, two kids. I didn\u0027t even recognize her. We talked for a while about really deep stuff she went through after high school. We had one guy who had been busted for selling cocaine on campus right before graduation, it had been this huge scandal. He showed up married, one on the way, working in real estate, going to church, had really turned his life around. It was really inspiring, actually.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20-year was even better. I was married at that point, my wife was three months along with our first, so she went home early. A lot of the same folks were there, but some others showed up who hadn\u0027t been there for the 10-year. Amusingly, I had like three ex-girlfriends show up, and two of them were divorced and very disappointed that I was now married. LOL Best part was afterwards. So one of my best friends from HS, who graduated a year ahead of me, decided to crash the reunion. He\u0027s one of those guys that everybody knows and loves, so he was immediately the life of the party. When the doors of the actual party closed at 11:00, a couple of us and him walk down the street to the Hard Rock Cafe. We walk in the bar, and the bartender is another guy from the class ahead of me that we had all been friends with. We had no clue, complete random chance, none of us had even seen him in years. So suddenly we\u0027re all hanging out together and he\u0027s not letting us pay for drinks. We closed that place down, and then wound up at some pirate dance club down in West Hollywood for a couple of hours. It was so much fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to go to my 30-year reunion, but they scheduled it for the same weekend that they hold the homeschool conference down in Phoenix, and that was the one weekend a year that my wife had to be able to get away by herself without the kids. So I missed that one. We\u0027ll see what the 40-year looks like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow...
