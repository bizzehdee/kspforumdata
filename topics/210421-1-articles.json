I am about to split my mothership in two, and I am transferring the fuel to the part that will need it most; routine operation, but I noticed something different\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t tell from the image, there are a bunch of fuel tanks with a radial symmetry. I selected all of them simultaneously, then drained the fuel to another target tank\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022pMcZpKj.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pMcZpKj.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere I noticed that some of the fuel tanks had a lot more fuel left than some others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe tanks are all symmetric. they are all identical. I started with my tanks full after completing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E on the planet below, and they were all at the same level after ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyet now that I drained them into the big tank, their individual fuel levels changed. some tanks were drained faster than others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas you can imagine, this is going to be a problem because my fuel mass will no longer by symmetrical. it may lead to asymmetric thrust and the ship spinning - though as long as the difference is small, the reaction wheels and gimbals can compensate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to stress once more than I never did anything that could differentiate those fuel tanks. I selected them all simultaneously before giving the transfer order - which was for the larger tank to get fuel inside it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone knows why fuel is behaving like that, and how I can fix the issue without manually readjusting all the tanks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caerfinon","CreatedById":207619,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-03T14:10:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224194796\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210421\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667483012\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow I can fix the issue without manually readjusting all the tanks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use a mod called\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0TAC Fuel Balancer\u003C/strong\u003E.
