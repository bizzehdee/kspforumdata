It seems to me that a couple questions need to be answered in the following order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Is there any incentive to get close?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me the answer is yes. Without teleportation, it would be the only way to board and capture a vessel. Unless a vessel can be completely captured by hacking... but it seems to me that this wouldn\u0027t be likely when there are actual crew members aboard the target vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Will it be feasible to get close? (Will you be shot down? Is it the risk/cost worth the reward?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the answer to this. As has been mentioned, it is difficult to hide your approach in space, so the target will have lots of time to prepare. Will you be shot down or can the surrounding orbital space be made so risky (such as with mines) that the reward is not worthwhile? What kinds of countermeasures will an attacking ship be able to take in order to rendezvous successfully?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Assuming yes to the above, will close-range encounters involve small craft that engage each other, or will it be more practical for both vessels to simply attack each other with their mounted weapons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I don\u0027t know the answer to this. A key question might be whether a mounted weapon on a large vessel can be precise enough to disable a target vessel without destroying it, or whether you would need a fighter to get in close, a-la death-star trench run. Another reason you might have fighters is that they\u0027re really there to do surface operations, but can also engage in short-range orbital encounters if needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty much a noob when it comes to thinking carefully about space warfare, so some of this may already be well-discussed and understood by others... if so I\u0027d be happy to hear your thoughts. One final caveat, I am assuming two warring factions on different celestial bodies. Surface-based weapons seem like they would always be more practical when it comes to war between two factions on Earth, regardless of technology level...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T21:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s because of the safety margins. Military operations allow for a much higher risk factor. And if you throw landing into a fully automatic mode, a computer can plot a course and land a ship within at most a revolution from the target, or about 90 minutes. It can also plot intercepts that are very hard to counter. Point is, if you actually get into close combat situation, things can be interesting.\u003Cp\u003EProblem is getting close.

This could potentially be able to burn a hole in a satellite in a couple of seconds. It\u0027s easier to hit the target, because you can aim for where the target is NOW rather than where it will be in 10 minutes. You don\u0027t need the power to blow up the enemy satellite. All you need is to burn a hole big enough in its solar panels to cut the power or in its tank to make it outgas and lose control. The problem is that these lasers are big and heavy and expensive, which makes them impratical to send to orbit. It is probably more efficient to fire them from an Aegis cruiser or an airborne platform, like the (cancelled) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_YAL-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBoeing 747 YAL-1\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it is completely impossible to have such a laser on ground based weapons, as atmospheric diffusion would make it a) impossible to hit a target \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E defocus the beam.
