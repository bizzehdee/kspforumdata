The mod doesn\u0027t send any info. All it does is it makes a HTTP connection to beta.kerbalstuff.com and asks for the latest version of DebRefund. It doesn\u0027t send anything. It doesn\u0027t tell KerbalStuff what mod you have installed. It doesn\u0027t tell KerbalStuff that you\u0027re even running a game. You can open a web browser and perform the exact same check that DebRefund does by going here: \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgba(242,199,68,0.1);color:#1d1c1d;font-size:15px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E[Moderator removed defunct website link]\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbalStuff responds with the latest version of the DebRefund mod. DebRefund then compares its version with the version number from the server and if the versions do not match, it alerts you of a new version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-28T14:30:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2022 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by James Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Elink removed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
