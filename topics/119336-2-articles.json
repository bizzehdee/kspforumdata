It kept us informed, which meant there was a lot less speculation and a lot less room for misinterpretation. Sure, it probably impacted HarvestR\u0027s productivity, but I believe it was more than made up for in the relationship it fostered between SQUAD and the players. Plus, it seemed as though he genuinely enjoyed sharing. And as an indie developer, shouldn\u0027t that be more important anyway? If there\u0027s anything to be learned from the development of KSP, it\u0027s that open communication is \u003Cem\u003Evital\u003C/em\u003E to preserving a positive atmosphere in the playerbase. It\u0027s my opinion that the instances of community backlash against SQUAD for various actions is directly related to the disappearance of these kind of blogs and the openness they brought with them. And while I understand the fear of similar backlashes in the future, withholding communication in the way we\u0027ve seen over the past 2 years is only making those fears a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother key point is that those blogs were usually featuring work and systems which were already done (or mostly done) and the hurdles which had been overcome. Since then, that fear I mentioned has driven a more defensive communication style \u0022Here\u0027s what we\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Eplanning\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 instead of \u0022Here\u0027s what we\u0027ve \u003Cem\u003Edone\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022 But while prefacing everything with \u0022Things can change in any way at any time\u0022 is good CYA, it means that anything that follows won\u0027t actually tell us anything reliable (the source of speculation) and excessively qualifying every statement only comes from a place of fear and weakness. As game developers who want to interact with their players, you \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E grow some really think skin. Harsh criticism will come, regardless of how well you communicated. That\u0027s one price of being in this industry. So, since you\u0027re already making changes to the way you communicate anyway, consider keeping us in the loop about what\u0027s actually been done in a given time frame going forward. It doesn\u0027t even have to be weekly, really. Remember, we can\u0027t get outraged at things that are already done when we had no idea what the original, nebulous idea had been in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T23:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a little puzzled about how SQUAD can say they\u0027re so close to QA with Kerbal 1.1 when \u003Cem\u003Estaging\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Eorbits\u003C/em\u003E still need work.

For the latter we use an external tool called Vectrosity, which handles drawing lines on screen. It seems that just like Kerbal Space Program, Vectrosity was overhauled for the new Unity UI system, which means that a lot has changed with it now, which in turn means that our orbits are all messed up and need fixing. This is a good opportunity to rewrite the code that draws the orbit, as it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s never been one of the most efficient parts of the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this means what I think it means (No more vanishing conic patches right as your predicted path gets close to the world you\u0027re aiming for) then I have one word: YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it doesn\u0027t mean that, I have another word, but this forum would auto censor me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SQUAD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SQUAD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAfter last week\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Squadcast there have been questions about how exactly multithreaded PhysX will work in Kerbal Space Program, One of the biggest improvements is that is optimized for multi-threaded processing. The short answer is, we aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t sure how it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll work exactly. The insides of PhysX are hardcoded deep under Unity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s hood, which means we have very little access to it from our end. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C Our own code hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t changed to support multithreaded physics simulation, so how exactly it will handle KSP objects like multi-rigidbody vessels, is not something we can see in detail.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 -Felipe (HarvesteR)\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There also seems to be some confusion about the difference between the terms multi-threading and multi-core. When we talk about cores, we are generally talking about hardware. Software, however, deals with threads. Threads and Cores are related, but they are different concepts altogether. Threads are virtual, abstract entities used by software to split their workload for separate. Cores are the hardware used to actually process multiple threads at the same time.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What this means for KSP is that there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no way to know which CPU cores will get used for any given vessel, part, or anything along those lines, and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re also not sure how simulation is split into separate threads. The way PhysX handles its multithreaded execution is internal to PhysX, and we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really get to see behind those curtains\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a bad thing though. We get to focus on making the game on top of the physics engine, and PhysX handles the low-level simulation/computation stuff.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all this.
