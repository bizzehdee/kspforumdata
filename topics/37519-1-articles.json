Laythe is gorgeous, has an atmosphere with oxygen, clear blue water, a fantastic view of Jool (for half of the surface anyway), but it has issues.

Yes, transit times are much shorter, but the closeness also means the phase angles align less frequently since Vall moves quite quick relative to Laythe, so it takes Laythe longer to catch up in orbit. If you\u0027ve ever tried to do a rendezvous in Kerbin orbit between two craft at different orbital altitudes, you know that the closer your orbits are together, the less delta-v you need but the longer you have to wait to get the alignment right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan is to have an excess of stuff in the system.

Then you\u0027d set up a large orbital station around tylo. It\u0027s large gravity well makes for easy SoI captures and it being the 2rd of 5 moons makes it the ideal location for a large space station (just not so much ground operations). I\u0027d keep a small mobile ground operation going on Vall because it is close and even at peak time, it can deliver to Lathe rather quickly if it needs it. The big land ops would be obviously on bop and pol. I personally lean towards pol because it\u0027s less inclined and easier to transfer to. Both would be good locations for large scale ground operations but I imagine my Pol operation would be bigger given it\u0027s easier to get to (IMO) but that could change if I get a big deposit under a flat spot on Bop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: What is a good way to access offshore kethane deposits on Lathe?
