The problem is whenever i launch a craft on either to launchpad or runway the screen is all black. In addition to the screen being black, the altitude gauge is blank, the speed reads: \u00220.000000m/s\u0022, and the time reads the maximum time (999 years or something like that). My other mods are the B9 parts pack, adjustable landing gear, aviation lights, BD parts pack, better burn time, chatterer, firespitter, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, KSP AVC, KW rocektry, spaceY heavy lifters and parts pack.
