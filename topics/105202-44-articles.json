Unfortunately Fertiliser is not available in the small 0.625m form factor tank so a 1.25m Kontainer is the smallest and (and waaayy overkill for fertiliser in volume and mass :D). You can also attach a radial cubic strut and a Mk-V Supply Redi-pak to it to get a tasty 1250 fertiliser compared to the fertiliser minipak.
