Here\u0027s how. FYI I\u0027m running v1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn one mission that turned out to be extraordinarily epic and took me at least 8 hours to finally finish (contracts to get science from orbitting Duna and Ike) I just couldn\u0027t get him to survive Kerbin re-entry, so I let him escape Kerbin and go into a parked orbit whose AP was just past Duna. Actually this was my first attempt at returning from an interplanetary mission in v 1.1; I thought I had planned ahead. I was wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause this pod had over 1000 science on it I wasn\u0027t going to give up easy. I also try to never, ever let a Kerbal die or go \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E. So I devised an interplanetary rescue mission (which worked first time to my amazement!) to salvage the pilot and his science. However, thinking I had learned my lesson from the last attempt at re-entry I had put several airbrakes and retractable radiators on this rescue pod, thinking it would work. But it didn\u0027t. On several attempts, at various altitudes, they burned up on re-entry.\u00A0 To be honest this was my first time using airbrakes and radiators of this type, I just didn\u0027t know how to use them. Regardless, they heated up way past their tolerances and quickly burned up. I then realised I had enough delta-v in this final stage with its lv909 engine to slow down sufficiently to get into a parked Kerbin orbit. And I did. However, even at Kerbin orbital speeds none of my radiators or airbrakes survived, so I let them burn up in the hope they would bleed off enough speed to let my pod survive. And it did. The pod landed safely, after what was for me a totally exhausting mission, and I got over 1200 science from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what the heck am I doing wrong here? How do you survive interplanetary re-entry?I know I could \u0027bleed\u0027 off speed but how do I do that when I burn up the moment I hit the upper atmosphere? Even if I try an aero-capture I have to survive long enough to do that, and I don\u0027t; I start encountering heat at about 58km and it just gets worse. I don\u0027t survive long enough to get captured. Believe me I tried everything, at all altitudes. It just wouldn\u0027t survive. For a one-man pod with a small tank and an lv909 engine there really isn\u0027t many options. I did think about using the 2.5m heat-shield...would that work better? Not only at deflecting heat but creating drag too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrior to aerodynamics and re-entry heat being added proper to KSP I\u0027ve done countless interplanetary missions; however, now that I\u0027m playing v1.1 it\u0027s meant I have to re-evaluate and even scrap my previous designs. I\u0027d love to hear what the more advanced KSP players do to deal with this problem! All advice welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers,\u003Cbr\u003E\nTim\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE: After I wrote this, I tried recreating the entire mission in sandbox mode, this time using a single 2.5m ablator shield on my final stage, with no radiators. It worked brilliantly. Even with a Kerbin PE of 30km none of the instruments or other parts of the final stage experienced ANY heating at all, travelling at 3500m/s. My only issue now is working out the best way of incorporating the 2.5m shield into my 1.5m final stage design. Also, does this mean that if I want to send more than one Kerbal, and use a 2m pod, I will have to use an even bigger ablator shield? In the same way the 1m shield was useless, I\u0027m guessing the 2.5m shield will be useless too. Unless the larger pods have a greater heat tolerance....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-03T19:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does your pod look like?
