I\u0027ve tried reentry at different periapsis\u0027s, and different speeds. All that is attached to the Pod is the default starting parachute. I keep hitting the ground/water at speeds of 400-500m/s which means I never slow down enough allowing me to deploy the parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this helps but I just did a quick orbital flight to come up with these numbers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas in a 100 by 100 orbit around Kerbin. Did a retro burn to lower Peri to 25km This is my altitude vs surface speed as I re-entered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E50Km, 2143m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E40km, 2136m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E30km, 1975m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E20km, 1540m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E10km, 913m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E05km, 558m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E01km, 340m/s\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESplat.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh wow so its not just me...
