I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E that the green fuel indicators by the engines in the \u0022staging\u0022 display just show the \u0022LiquidFuel\u0022 resource for all LF burning engines (either air-breathing or OX). I think it would be useful to have another bar for typical LF/OX engines that indicated remaining oxidizer in the staging display as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe OX bars should be in a different color than the LF bars so you can easily tell which is which.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bars could be shown in series (OX to the right of LF) or in parallel (OX below or above LF). I think in parallel would make more sense so so levels could be compared at a glance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, only one bar could be shown for each LF/OX engine, and the bar would display the \u0022limiting\u0022 reactant type, e.g. green if LF will run out first, or blue if OX will run out first (or whatever color is selected for oxidizer). It may already show the limiting reactant, I\u0027m not sure, but both display in the same color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven better would be to provide several of these options in the game menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s a small UI tweak that could be useful IMO, given we have engines and designs that can upset the LF:OX ratio in vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T18:03:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt may already show the limiting reactant, I\u0027m not sure, but both display in the same color.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way fuel shown is pretty weird at times, but IIRC it basically shows the amount of available, usable fuel for the given engine, like you say here.

Sometimes you end up with the mix off and you end up carrying a bunch of useless fuel (of whatever sort) into orbit. IMO, it would be nice to have a split bar for fuel, where it looks exactly like it does now if the ratios work out perfectly but changes so that the non-gauge resource (you can set what resource is in the bar within the engine config) shows as a different color and takes up half the height of the other resource bar if the mixture is off.
