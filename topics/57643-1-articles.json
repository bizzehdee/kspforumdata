I built a station in LKO and, just at the very end of the assembly, the last part, an arm with three hubs, doesn\u0027t connect completely to the rest of the structure. Here\u0027s some pictures to help you understand:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s244.photobucket.com/user/gianlupo/media/screenshot612.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg32/gianlupo/screenshot612.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot612.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s244.photobucket.com/user/gianlupo/media/screenshot613.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg32/gianlupo/screenshot613.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot613.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI moved the arm in using the central docking ports as reference (\u0022control from here\u0022 with the port on the hub and \u0022set as target\u0022 with the port on the science lab), but the result was that the right hub didn\u0027t dock to the hitchhiker pod. It looks like the docking ports aren\u0027t perfectly aligned, probably because while in orbit I moved the station to position it so that the solar panels could have the best exposure; problem is, it wobbled a lot and that probably caused a misalignment, as it wobbled while I performed the docking manouevre, despite keeping the speed really low. I tried to undock and redock the parts in various ways, but nothing seems to work. So, given that I don\u0027t want to have to redo the whole thing from the beginning, or spending an eternity reassembling it in space, I\u0027m asking you: is there a way to edit the vessel in the persistent.cfg file to realign the docking ports? Or any other solution, of course, that can help me finish the station assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
