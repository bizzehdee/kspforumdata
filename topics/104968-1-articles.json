It\u0027s your own different game with your own rules. Unless it makes the game objectively harder on the player, you cannot compare any accomplishments to a player using the original rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when someone asks, \u0022is this cheating?\u0022 I assume they mean, \u0022at the video game called Kerbal Space Program\u0022 which to me assumes stock rules defined by the developer. To say otherwise is just defining your way out of cheating (\u0022well in MY ruleset that I have defined arbitrarily, it\u0027s not cheating (by definition)\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m playing the game, so of course I make my own rules up, play after my own ideas, and want to have fun however it goes. That\u0027s pretty much following the core definition of most interactive media, and even more so for a open-ended game like KSP. That seperation is personal, so you can\u0027t really ask if something is cheating \u0027by general definition\u0027, but only if it is cheating to a person and the way he or she enjoys the game. I\u0027m e.g. played around with infiniglides in my sandbox mode, while I kept that exploit out of my career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to go for a very strict rule interpretation that doesn\u0027t include the human element, then no, it\u0027s not cheating, because squad implemented it as a part of their rule system. Your question is a catch 22: Either you go for rule interpretition to get a general \u0027sterile\u0027 idea and no personal interpretation (which doesnt really affect how people play), or you go for personal interpretation and don\u0027t get a general idea (which varies from person to person).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw: I think the system is kinda flawed in how you can mine everywhere independent of ressource density, so I probably will still limited my mining to ressource rich areas (instead of mining in poor areas and time-accelerate for a few days). It is a bit tricky: Ways to limit this, like life support, or some kind of mod to limit the lifetime of a drill, would just add another ressource system atop of our ressource system for the sake of it. Kethane limited deposits were also kinda boring and one dimensional.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T23:19:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 11:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stealth2668","CreatedById":57377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T23:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xavven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xavven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think you can still \u0022cheat\u0022 at a SP game.
