Who defines the rules of KSP? You could say the game designers/developers define the rules. So if you use mining in the way the developer intended, I think you\u0027d be hard pressed to call it cheating.\n\nWhat\u0027s more, ISRU isn\u0027t just a game gimmick. Real space agencies are proposing ISRU as part of future missions to the Moon and Mars. You can get a crash course here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_resource_utilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_resource_utilization)\n\nMy personal favorite example of ISRU being a keystone of a future possible mission is the Mars Direct mission. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct)) The proposal is to bring a feed stock of hydrogen gas (edit: correction - liquid hydrogen) to the surface of Mars and use its atmosphere (which is mostly carbon dioxide) to manufacture methane and oxygen (a rocket fuel!)\n\nWe can even melt the Moon\u0027s regolith (on the real life Moon) to extract useful elements that can be turned into rocket fuel, though some people [citation needed][weasel words] doubt that this is a realistic proposition.\n\nSo is ISRU in KSP cheating, or even far fetched? Neither, I say.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T22:27:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xavven**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yellowburn10","CreatedById":107558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T22:15:28Z","Content":"Yeah, as long as things are properly balanced, I\u0027m fine with it.

What I love most about KSP is building colossal interplanetary exploration motherships and flying them on grand tours around the solar system, and harvesting fuel is going to make that much more sustainable--I can only send out so many gargantuan uncrewed fuel tankers before I get tired of it.\n\nThe one thing that has bothered me about Karbonite is how possible it is to make one single craft that can simultaneously act as harvester, refinery, lifter, and tanker--I always assumed that there would be some reason that making separate crafts for all of those (a ground base with resource drills, a lander with tanks to carry the resource from ground to orbit, an orbital refinery to process the resource into fuel, and an orbital tanker to move the fuel to whatever ship needs it) would be more economical.

Is it cheating to set the starting science and funds to max?\n\nWell, the best comparison I can make is playing any game on the easiest settings. Man, wasn\u0027t the original SNES Street Fighter II easy to beat on difficulty level 0? Could you say you beat SF2 if you beat it on difficulty 0? YES. But your friend would ask you, \u0022at what difficulty level?\u0022\n\nFor some things, like an Eve return mission, the current option sliders we have for KSP don\u0027t make much of a difference, so I wouldn\u0027t feel the need to qualify whether funds/science were set to max from the get-go, or whether saves were allowed. The bulk of the challenge is in designing the ascent vehicle to have enough TWR and delta-v while still having enough structural integrity to land intact.\n\nFor other things, difficulty might play a role.

That\u0027s pretty much following the core definition of most interactive media, and even more so for a open-ended game like KSP. That seperation is personal, so you can\u0027t really ask if something is cheating \u0027by general definition\u0027, but only if it is cheating to a person and the way he or she enjoys the game. I\u0027m e.g. played around with infiniglides in my sandbox mode, while I kept that exploit out of my career mode.\n\nIf you want to go for a very strict rule interpretation that doesn\u0027t include the human element, then no, it\u0027s not cheating, because squad implemented it as a part of their rule system. Your question is a catch 22: Either you go for rule interpretition to get a general \u0027sterile\u0027 idea and no personal interpretation (which doesnt really affect how people play), or you go for personal interpretation and don\u0027t get a general idea (which varies from person to person).\n\nBtw: I think the system is kinda flawed in how you can mine everywhere independent of ressource density, so I probably will still limited my mining to ressource rich areas (instead of mining in poor areas and time-accelerate for a few days). It is a bit tricky: Ways to limit this, like life support, or some kind of mod to limit the lifetime of a drill, would just add another ressource system atop of our ressource system for the sake of it. Kethane limited deposits were also kinda boring and one dimensional.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T23:19:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 11:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Stealth2668","CreatedById":57377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T23:16:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think you can still \u0022cheat\u0022 at a SP game.
