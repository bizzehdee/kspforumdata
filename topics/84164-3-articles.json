The \u0022mass/drag\u0022 model is...counterintuitive.

What we have now is simply not ISP. Now, we can say \u0022we don\u0027t care\u0022, but the argument of \u0022it would be too hard\u0022 is just that, an argument for the sake of argument. For that matter, who is the one to judge what is too hard for others? We have engine overheating!!! How often could i not go full thrust because the rocket would just overheat? If thats not too hard...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust do it right instead of finding arguments to do it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely needed. Why? Because its the MAIN difference between a short trip into orbit and to the moon and a multiyear mission to the outer planets. When ppl say \u0022not needed, too hard\u0022, then how about fuel for the rocket? Its exactly the same stuff, just for Kerbals. If fuel is not too hard, then consumables for Kerbals arn\u0027t either. Lets face it, it adds to the challenge, and once you reach orbit/moon, KSP can need a challenge.

We are not talking equations here, we are talking \u0022oh...it did go booooomm...the game tells me i overdid xyz\u0022.

It still took a couple of attempts to make it die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree that it\u0027s a bit easier to break wings on large planes than it should be, at least from a game-for-fun POV, but that\u0027s more to do with KSP than Ferram. If they\u0027d give us decent sized wing pieces (either larger, or tweakable, or procedural, or weldable) so that we didn\u0027t have to build jigsaw wings and strutting became unnecessary, that\u0027d be a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much every flyer struts their wings anyway; why not make the strutting reinforcement a given? It\u0027d improve the aesthetics, ease the engineering learning process and reduce part counts. I don\u0027t see any downside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EObviously, not all aircraft are designed for acrobatics. And Skylon, with its short wing, it\u0027s probably only going to be good for climbing, but that\u0027s an extreme. And clearly you can\u0027t make sharp acrobatics at match 3. OTOH, you can easily check how well the 787 can perform, and that\u0027s not a plane made for acrobatics.\u003Cp\u003EHave you spoken (or written in a forum) about FAR with actual pilots? Or are you a pilot? I was testing it with a small plane I use for Kerbal rescue missions, I don\u0027t even know what I changed, but I was going at 700 km/h on the runway and still not taking off. Anything that has wings and an aerodinamic shape will take off at those speeds. It doesn\u0027t matter if it has flaps (it has), where is the landing gear or anything else. The wings make it take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed about either larger or weldable wings. KSP physics and damage might be fun, but it\u0027s not realistic, specially with aircraft - they shouldn\u0027t act like ensembled legos but as pieces welded together. But structural failures in aircraft, specially absent turbulences, are very, very uncommon. Which is why I think something of the simulation you\u0027ve built has to be wrong somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EComparing actual aircraft, that are designed to work together, vs lego aircraft makes little sense. It\u0027s amazing KSP planes work at all. Engines are not just slapped onto a jet, 10 jet models might all have the same engine (say a CFM56), but the thrust in each might vary by over 50%. Yes, some are early vs later versions in the same family, but it\u0027s not just improvements, it\u0027s what the original aircraft was designed for. Modern planes with the \u0022same\u0022 engine often have very slightly different version---tweaked for each airframe, and they do not produce the same thrust. In KSP, there is the one basic jet, one turbofan, etc. One is slapped in something not much bigger than a BD-5, the other is the size of the space shuttle. Instead of customizing the engine (as they would in RL as needed), you have only the throttle control (or thrust limiting) in KSP.\u003Cp\u003ERegarding disintegration, it can be a toggle option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, isn\u0027t it established that the current atmosphere is a place holder? If so it\u0027s going to change regardless, so the only question is more vs less realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWell, a certain amount of abstraction is required.

However, having a working throttle makes rockets easier to control and easier to make fine adjustments to the orbit with, so it\u0027s a good tradeoff. Same with restartable engines, they tend to be the exception rather than the rule IRL, especially for lifter engines, but they make handling rockets easier in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Simplified fuels: In KSP there is a single fuel/oxidizer combination used for all liquid fueled engines; in real life there is a variety of fuels and oxidizers used with varying properties of density, specific impulse, storability, etc. While having more fuel options would increase realism, IMO it would just be adding realism for realism\u0027s sake while confronting new players with a bewildering set of options.

Emergency situations and desperate rescues are some of the best bits of KSP. We shouldn\u0027t be trying to discourage them. Half of the reason I have EVE installed is because I love popping out of the cloud bank on reentry only to discover that I\u0027m face-to-face with a mountain.
