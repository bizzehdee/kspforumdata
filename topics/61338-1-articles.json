Assuming you had access to some kind of capable hardware, lets find one to hack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, as a list of possible candidates, you\u0027d need one that hasn\u0027t been properly decommissioned. Ones that were decommissioned via deorbiting are obviously not viable candidates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022When NOAA decommissions a geostationary satellite, it is boosted further into orbit, the remaining fuel is expended, the battery is disabled and the transmitters are turned off.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027d need one that the previous owners didn\u0027t feel bothered to turn off, but it would have to be fairly recently retired so that it\u0027s still oriented in a position to receive a signal. So your list of candidates is getting smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut lets assume you find one. Don\u0027t know very much about satellite communication and control protocols, but I\u0027d imagine most older ones would be very hardware specific. It\u0027s not like if you hacked into Hubble you could hit the \u0022take picture\u0022 button and receive a jpeg of a galaxy. You would have to know specifically the commands to send, how to send them, then have software(possibly hardware) to decode the signals into something useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as mentioned previously, you are a hacker, and you tricked some old retired engineer to send you the protocols to communicate with your target by promising him billions from his recently deceased uncle who was a Nigerian prince. So we have all the tools required to pull off our hack. Now depending on the type of satellite it was, our payoff could be really cool, or be really lame. Now we have to power up and get our baby working again. Assuming all the hardware is still functional(It was retired for a reason). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we got some kind of imaging satellite with still working reaction wheels we could now decode random pictures of earth at varying times. It\u0027d be like using Google maps, but instead of being able to see what you want we\u0027d get a random picture every few hours! (This is the good payoff) otherwise we get a number feed which is some random science fact which we could\u0027ve just looked up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hey, we put all that effort into it. Who cares if we get a random spew of insignificant numbers. We put a lot of time and money into this. The world should know my 1337ness. Lets post our exploits on the internet to boast about our number feed. Unfortunately, this would require others to gain access to the same hardware resources just to verify, which most people wouldn\u0027t do being that they won\u0027t even get the benefit of accomplishing it themselves, so the \u0022look at me\u0022 benefit is kinda low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOfftopic: Something I found while looking stuff up for this.

Unless you know the protocol before hand, you will need to communicate with the target and/or spy on its normal communication (up and down stream).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich means the military could easily detect your attempts and localize you (if they care about your target, which they probably do).

If the thing has ROM memory and analog processing (quite likely in a machine that old), the best you could would be to give it instructions similar to what the owner might, like attitude or orbit change, which could easily render the satellite inoperable. The kind of hackers would do harmless jokes for the lulz would be out (why make a 40 year old satellite turn by 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 if you can try to post shopped pics of colonel Hadfield on ISS computers (yes, they have internet))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m not sure the premise is true.

If you would actually have the capability to do such things, you can find the frequency to send signals to it at, being 2114.676697 MHz.
