That is pretty fast for rovers in this game. It is possible that the forces you got at the bottom of the hill caused a structural failure (you didn\u0027t include the end of mission report, though, so I cannot confirm).\n\nFrom those two alone I would try redesigning. First I would try for a wider wheel base with more space between the front and back wheels. I would also attempt to reinforce them with struts. Maybe add another pair of wheels at the midsection to help bear the load. If that doesn\u0027t help it may be a problem with the physics of the wheels (people have been reporting them behaving a little weird in 1.0.0, and I am not sure if they made any fixes there)."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:27:19Z","Content":"I would say the main cause for your flipping is that you are hitting a roughly 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (for lack of a better word) edge at the bottom of the slope. I don\u0027t think this would be much of a problem on normal terrain, as it usually has far smoother changes in angle. Also, I would strongly reccomend following blu\\_c\u0027s advice, lower your CoM and build a wider base etc. I think most vehicles that have such a high CoM to with ratio would have problems there"}]}
