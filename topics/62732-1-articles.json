For something where you\u0027d be under thrust for a large portion of a mission they are great, and significantly better for power to weight ratio compared to any other solution, which is why ICBMs use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor space missions, not so much. They might make sense on something like a solar powered probe mission, just for the launching vehicle, since in all likelihood the launcher is going to require significantly more power than the probe itself will, between initial guidance, control surface operation, rocket motor gimbals, etc. It might be on the order of dozens of kw or more, compared to the probe which might use dozens of watts to hundreds of watts. A 50-200lb alternator might make more sense powering the thing (even one per stage) than hundreds of pounds of batteries for the 10-20 minutes that the launcher is likely going to be under thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lazarus1024","CreatedById":65276,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T15:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SSSPutnik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SSSPutnik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah a thermoelectric generator would be fairly simple I think...

I\u0027m pretty sure almost every rocket engine has some sort of turbine to draw power from the fuel. How else can you supply the stupid amount of horsepower needed to drive the pumps? Once you have such a configuration, attaching an alternator to it should be no biggie. But again, you\u0027re not going to carry with you and burn a 10000000000000000000000 lbf rocket engine just to run a few hundred watt dynamo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrZayas1","CreatedById":95654,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T14:56:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that kerbal space program should be entirely realistic, because if it was then it would probably take alot of system power when it is completed, but if you really wanted to make an extremely realistic game then you could probably install a lot of mods! In actuality, I am sure if NASA really wanted to make a power providing option for engines they could, but doing so would be kind of expensive for a lot of power, for only about 3 minutes maximum of burn time. (for example i know that some engines burn for longer) See the world is all about finances, and creating an energy harvester for engines is pointless since we have solar panels that we can use, to power batteries for absent-lighting travel. But like i said i\u0027m sure we could definitely do it! And for the technicalities to answer your question on how they would do it, scientists have came up with many different ways to harvest almost any type of energy whether it be radioactive energy, vibration atoms, heat, or even solar power. So i am sure that they could develop a way to take the radiation from the NERVA engine and harvest it\u0027s energy if you really wanted to. But like I said, you will only be burning for a few seconds at a time, and very rarely in inter-planetary travel so you would still have to have a backup power system such as solar panels, which makes it kind of pointless to have another energy input because once you leave earth the sun is always shining.

In a large design that means you need to force a vast amount of fuel (the Space Shuttle burned 535,000 gallons of fuel - about an Olympic swimming pool full - in 8 minutes) against an incredibly high pressure (200 atmospheres for the Space Shuttle). That requires some enormously powerful pumps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact these turbopumps are generally the most important and expensive component of any design - sometimes launch vehicles get called \u0022a turbopump with a rocket attached\u0022.
