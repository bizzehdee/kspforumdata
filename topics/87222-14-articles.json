And I noticed that some applaucher and toolbar icon where getting their textures rescaled by that ingame setting. It\u0027s not really consistent, so it might be my overrides that are just poorly written, but I can\u0027t see where is my error.

The other thing I though about was the \u0027\u0027make not readable\u0027\u0027 option, could it prevent the game from rescalling ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I\u0027m just wondering how that ingame setting is interacting with your mod and with ATM, and how to optimize the three of them.

I know also that ATM suggest to put that setting to high res and to use atm as your scaler, but I find it pretty convenient to change it ingame and to flush a few hundred of mb of RAM before crashing, and then reload them when it get smoother.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"disorderpunk","CreatedById":75858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T15:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rottielover\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rottielover\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo paraphrase the immortal R.

Secondly, what are the uses of mipmapped textures in KSP?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDXT1 is half smaller than DXT5, but doesn\u0027t support transparency (except full transparency/no transparency). Mipmaps should be used for all model textures, otherwise they get ugly when you look them from a distance or under a sharp angle. In stock KSP (without ATM or TextureReplacer installed) all textures except PNGs and JPEGs have mipmaps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T17:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was quick!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more question: do normals and height maps (making planets) benefit from mipmaps, or is it only for visual textures?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-04T17:59:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2015 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptRobau\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
