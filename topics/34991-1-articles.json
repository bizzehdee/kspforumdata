Click on the orbit on one of those nodes and pull maneuver node in the \u0022up\u0022 or \u0022down\u0022 direction depending on the node you picked. Make sure your inclination difference is as small as possible (0.1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 - 0.2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 is easily achievable and is fine enough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that you need to match the phase. If the ship you are controlling is behind the target ship, enter a lower orbit to catch up. If it is in in front of the target, a higher orbit will slow you down.

You have to set one vessel as your target, and make sure your NavBall is set to target mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Adjust inclination as others have described. It\u0027s actually possible to do a rendezvous without adjusting inclination, but your indications are harder to read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Go to map view and determine whether your target is ahead of you or behind you. If it\u0027s ahead, do a slow retrograde burn until your closest point of approach to the target is within about 20 km. If your target is behind you, do a prograde burn to the same effect. Then warp until your vessel is about 20 km from the target. Now you\u0027re done with map view; you can complete the rendezvous using only the NavBall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENotes:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rule of thumb is that you want your speed relative to the target in m/s (which is what shows on the NavBall speed indicator when it\u0027s in target mode) to be about 100x less than your distance from the target in meters. So at 20km, you want to be approaching the target at about 200 m/s. If you go much faster, you can lose control of the situation, particularly if you\u0027re not used to rendezvous. If you go much slower, you will get very bored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When you are 20 km or less from your target, you should be able to see an indicator showing its position and relative distance when you are in vessel view (i.e. not map view.) You need to be able to see this unless you\u0027re using Engineer Redux or MechJeb to display target information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The pink circle marker on the NavBall represents the direction of your target, i.e. if you point your vessel\u0027s nose at the pink circle, it will be pointing directly at the target. The goal of a rendezvous is to have your prograde indicator sitting on top of the pink circle (and likewise, your retrograde indicator should be sitting on top of the pink cross.) This indicates that your ship is travelling directly toward the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When you engage your engines, you are increasing your speed in the direction your nose is pointing. This has the effect of \u0022pulling\u0022 your prograde marker toward where your nose is pointing. Likewise adding throttle will \u0022push\u0022 your retrograde maker away from where your nose is pointing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- So what you\u0027ll be doing is burning either near prograde to increase your relative speed or near retrograde to decrease your relative speed, while at the same time trying to keep your pro and retrograde markers pointed at the appropriate target markers. If you\u0027re burning near prograde you will be trying to \u0022pull\u0022 the prograde marker onto the target circule and if you\u0027re burning retrograde (which is most of the time during a rendezvous because you\u0027re usually decreasing your speed as your distance to target decreases), you\u0027ll be \u0022pushing\u0022 your retrograde marker onto the target cross.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) So, say you get to 20 km separation and your relative speed is only 60 m/s. You want to burn prograde to increase your closing speed to 200 m/s. You do this by pointing your vessel toward a point on the \u003Cem\u003Eopposite side of the \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etarget circle\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E from your \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eprograde marker\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. When you burn, you\u0027ll be dragging your prograde marker toward the target circle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Once you\u0027ve reached 200 m/s at 20 km, you\u0027ll notice your relative distance dropping pretty quickly. You\u0027ll want to turn your vessel around so you can slow down as you get closer. I readjust speed at 15 km, 10 km, 8 km, 6 km, 5 km, 4 km, 3 km, etc. When you\u0027re facing retrograde you want to burn with your vessel pointing on the \u003Cem\u003Eopposite side of your\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E retrograde marker\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E from the \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etarget cross\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E so you can push the retrograde marker onto the cross.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Once you get to within 1 km, you might find it interesting to switch to map view and notice how your orbit and the target\u0027s orbit have magically aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Keep slowing until you get within 50 meters; you might have to turn prograde occasionally if you drop too much speed or if you get near the end and are going to pass too far from the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) At 50 meters, you should be going 0.5 m/s relative to the target. Kill all of your remaining relative velocity by pointing straight at the retrograde marker (don\u0027t worry about pushing the marker at this point) and burning until your relative velocity shows 0.0 m/s. (If you\u0027re running MechJeb, you can zero it out to within 10 mm/s.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you\u0027re ready to turn on RCS and start docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-27T17:03:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2013 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T12:26:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy, you people are helpful.
