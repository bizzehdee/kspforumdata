This would be particularly important for autonomous missions, but would be relevant for manned missions sending science data back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo deal with this, we (as players) would have to set up satellite formations with comms equipment onboard. The idea would be that all comms are just be trivially re-routed (with bandwidth and electricity constraints at each node) via the nearest comms node to mission control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be really cool because we\u0027d have to learn how to create satellite constellations to cover areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the contract mode, this could be related to some kind of government contract to create a comms/GPS constellation for planetary use, and just generally add to the overhead costs of running a space programme.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T13:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-Development-Resumed-RemoteTech-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-Development-Resumed-RemoteTech-2\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T13:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the last I have heard (before .23.5 or .23, I think it was in a interview with Scott Manley or on KSPTV), Squad was not interested on making any line of sight (To keep the game accessible) but were considering having some communication area allowed by satellite for transmitting science.
