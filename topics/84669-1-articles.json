(Things are running better now that I am using KSP x64) that particular mod is actually pretty cool, but i have a problem with adding extra Stars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere the issue is for me IMO, these extra heavy objects are in near perfect orbits around the parent star, the laws of celestial mechanics dictate that these companion stars should be in orbit around a barycenter somewhere between SUN and the companions, now i have worked the math out, and based on assumed density and mass, that barycenter should lie between Kerbin and Eve. well now, here is the problem. (I set this up in Celestia) Tying all the extra stars together and sharing a barycenter poses a problem for Kerbin, Duna, and Eve. the gravitational forces would have eliminated the Sweetspot for life, in other words no Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is my request;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anyway to eliminate the Extra stars, but keep their planets in orbit around the Sun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this question has been asked, and for rambling. I know its a game..
