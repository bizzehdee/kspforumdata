Maybe they would not be able to adapt to a static coriolis free environment.

If you wanted to go back to Earth at any point you\u0027d want to have at least something like 0.8G so you didn\u0027t feel 3 times as heavy when you got there and be unable to support your own weight. That\u0027s only really a problem in the long term. Partial G is okay for missions or whatever when you\u0027re not going to be in space longer than 5 or so years, or if you\u0027re planning on returning to Mars. A martian station would want to rotate at martian gravity, which is between 0.3 and 0.4g (maybe that\u0027s why it was suggested). I also imagine if you wanted to go back to Earth after living in partial G like Mars , I expect you\u0027d need to be made gradually used to higher gravity over a period of months or years so you don\u0027t collapse under your own weight from your weakened muscles. Going to Earth straight after living for ages on Mars would probably be like if you started walking around with someone piggy backing on you all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
