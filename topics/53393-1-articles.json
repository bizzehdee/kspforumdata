So, my TWR is 0.082, do I simply have too much fuel for two nuclear drives to push, or is everything just too heavy, or what would be a more effective interplanetary launch and return ship?

If you have two ships, you just split the work in half, but then need the capsules etc to fly them so each rocket is smaller, but it takes more. There is a trick I use however to slow down. It adds a little bit more weight, but is what I like most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Bring along braking solid rocket boosters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Affix braking engines to your booster tanks. example, the four outer tanks there to burn off their fuel. Remember, as your fuel is consumed, less dV needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latter works when you plan for obsolescence. Example, you only need the orange engine to escape, so use a different less efficient engine for braking. Ditch some interstellar boosters on way or something possibly as well. The 2m smalls aren\u0027t too heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, there is something else to do in conjunction. Don\u0027t try to decelerate all your speed. Instead, as you just enter the solar system or get close, adjust your flight path for atmospheric braking. For Moho and the other small bodies, not really effective with their low/no atmo, but it can help. Is how I always capture Duna with it\u0027s lower gravity. Just skim down nice and low to save alot of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: And returning to Kerbin while really low on fuel, saves lots of burn time the further out you make your tweaks.

A lander doesn\u0027t need a huge TWR, at TWR 1 you can land but it takes skill/time, but at the same time you don\u0027t need bucketloads beyond that either. And lander dV you can check on charts as well, a good rule of thumb is that you need to kill your orbital velocity and then extra for soft landing. If you\u0027re in low M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn orbit for example you\u0027re going around 550m/s. You can pull off a landing around 600m/s dV but a bit more is healthy, seem to remember dV charts say 640m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at your lander you have way too many engines, the poodle alone is almost overkill for both Moho and Duna. And yeah that huge RCS tank is just dead weight. And you\u0027d be better off using a 3 man pod that stays in orbit and landing with a landercan mk2, which could be unpopulated at liftoff and then discarded before return to Kerbin. You\u0027re really just dragging extra mass around. You could potentially design a 3man pod lander than then uses the interplanetary return stage (or just gets refuelled for return) to get back to Kerbin, so you don\u0027t need the landercan mk2, but with double up on the pods yeah you\u0027re dragging heaps of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterplanetary stage shouldn\u0027t need that much RCS, as previous posters have mentioned already. And yeah, with just 2 nuclear drives you\u0027re looking at a 34 minute burn, for 1800 dV. Burn time doesn\u0027t really matter if you have patience for it, dV is the really important part. You\u0027ll need around 4000 dV for the optimal trip to Moho orbit, 1400 dV to land and 1400 dV to return to orbit. Then nearly 2000 dV to return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I personally design interplanetary trips, and which I can recommend as an easy \u0027foolproof\u0027 starting point, start from the opposite end and work your way back to the start;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Figure out what you want to return to Kerbin: reentry pod with chutes, docking port, bit of RCS for corrections, fuel and engine. As lightweight as possible with enough dV to get from your location\u0027s orbit back to Kerbin (for aerobraking/direct atmospheric descent entry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Figure out what you need to land: Landercan Mk1, Mk2, multiple Mk1s or even just external seat(s). Docking port, bit of RCS for corrections and docking, fuel, engine(s) with TWR around 1.5-2. Again as lightweight as possible with enough dV to land and return to orbit, potentially in multiple stages if necessary/desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Once your return craft and lander are done, start building your interplanetary stage below them. Alternatively if you\u0027re doing several launches and docking up in orbit before your trip, just check their masses and simulate above your interplanetary stage with a dummy weight, fuel tanks for example. Build your interplanetary stage with enough dV to take you from Kerbin orbit to stable orbit around your target location, a bit of extra dV is always good for corrections and mishaps. If you don\u0027t have the patience for long burns add enough engines so that your total burntime is sensible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Of course add power, batteries, probecores and lights etc as needed, a single RTG and battery keeps everything running so you don\u0027t have to rely on solar power, if you\u0027re not against a bit of radiation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope some of that helps, I\u0027ll leave you with an inspirational picture from one of my own interplanetary trips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManned Eeloo landing mission, with rover (which had surface experiment packages as well), a polar orbit satellite and a unmanned lander probe as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b46lCUi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b46lCUi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T12:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etry one nuclear engine. takes longer to do the burn, but its more efficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaybe use a 2 stage lander?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunless you are trying to get six kerbs to moho, you dont need two Mk12 command pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eless monopropellant, or practice docking more. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat said, I am impressed you got that into orbit with full tanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T16:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wasmic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wasmic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENEVER use solid rocket boosters in space, they have way too low I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E.

The weight exceeds offset of its efficiency. Is the price for control. Poodles would work better for that but who knows. In my mind, there is more to it than just dV. I never calculated it ever.
