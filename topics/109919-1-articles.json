Does anyone know if it possible to make a fuel cell powered harvester, and if so what ratio of drills to fuel cells I would need to make it run with no other power input? I would be willing to use a few RTGs if it gave me a positive fuel flow at nigh on the mun. Is there a percentage of ore that is needed to make this work, or is it impossible to do for any sane craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T03:30:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 03:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lucusloc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T06:47:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible, but it depends on how efficiently you mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drills always output the same amount of ore per second, but their power usage varies with the concentration of ore. You will consume far more power when you land in a poor spot, and thus you won\u0027t be able to run at a surplus with fuel cells. On the other hand, in a high concentration spot, you can likely do it no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnergy efficiency on drills is also improved if you have an Engineer Kerbal on the craft.

Next question: What is the highest ore rate on the mun? From my scans the bet I can find is just shy of 6%. 4% ore is way more common though so lets try that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.04/20 = .002, *25 = .05, *10 (drills) = .5 (for optimum processing efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 (drills) * 15 (drill power) \u002B 30 (Converter power) = 180\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuels Cell arrays generate 18 power, so you need 10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel output = L .45, Ox .55\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel consumption = L .2025, Ox .2475\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENet Gain on 4% ore = L .2475, Ox .3025\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course 10 drills is a lot of drills. If you can find 5% concentration you only need 8 drills, and at 6% you only need 7 (well, 6 and a third, so you will have extra ore with 7). With less drills you of course need less Fuel Cells, so your net gains obviously go up. Either way that *25 boost is absolutely necessary. Looks like all my fuel processing tugs are going to be manned. Thanks for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
