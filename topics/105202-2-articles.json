Did see a lot of \u0022Why not harder?\u0022 and related drama.\n\nRover, since you\u0027re good at frameworks, why not make this mod a configurable framework as well?\n\nThe config for USI-LS would consist of a single file, setup like a resource converter definition.\n\nResource- Name of the resource to track.\n\nAmount- Amount of the resource 1 kerbal consumes in 1 kerbal day.\n\nWaste- Resource produced, converted with mass conservation. (optional)\n\nSurvivaltime- Amount of seconds before the penalty is applied after the resource runs out.\n\nPenalty- Which penalty to apply once the resource runs out.\n\nSurvival timer is reduced from current timer amount (limited to the max time) back to 0 in reverse when supplies are restored, or in the case of partial generation will increment by partial amounts. So say you generate half the amount of resources needed, the timer will go twice as long before fully running out.\n\nThis way enabling/disabling resource flow for life support doesn\u0027t instantly reset the counter. If you went 12 days out of 15 without supplies then gave them more, it would take 12 days of letting them use supplies before the counter was fully reset.\n\nPenalties: Death, Hibernation, Temporary skill loss (skill redused to 1), Temporary skill reduction (counted as 1 skill level lower)\n\nShip with the basic config then let people who really want it make an alternate config to add whatever resources they want.\n\nExample: One simple idea someone could do to make things a little harder would be a Legroom resource. Produced in varying amounts by anything that holds crew (free production, no output resource, little storage of it), it would be tuned so you might need 1 extra empty seat per 2 kerbals to have enough Legroom for them not to go cranky and drop a skill level."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:44:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would it be possible to allow starved kerbals to EVA, but not do any special EVA functions like plant flags, etc?

E.g., 0.0001? 0.00005?\n\n3) I noticed that the Pioneer module does not have any mulch storage. Is mulch storage unnecessary for the mulcher to function properly?\n\n4) You mentioned that the Mk-IV modules will have different efficiencies for surface vs off-world.
