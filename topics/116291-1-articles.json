After a time I noticed mention of Dres-teroids. After doing a bit of reading on the wiki, apparently these dres-teroids are in orbit around dres in a ring system. As such I have to wonder if this means Dres will get a faint ring system in the future? Maybe make it more interesting to go to so one can see the rings of this out of the way dwarf world? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) What do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"BurnPrograde","CreatedById":143428,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T09:00:42Z","Content":"If the devs implemented a Saturn like ring system on Dres, it would definitely make me want to travel there more often.
