This can be structurally sound if you have enough arms supporting the ring, but large accelerations might make the split visible as the unconnected ends wobble independently. The loose ends can be clipped through each other to hide the split if you\u0027re willing to risk it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Strut-connected rings: As above, but with struts to hold the split ends together such that they cannot wobble independently. As above, clipping can be used to hide the split.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Docking-port-connected rings: This approach will create a structurally complete ring with no splits and no clipping required, but it is very hard to build because you have to get the docking ports facing each other perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you\u0027re building a large ring or a small one, the best approach is to actually build the entire ring in the VAB.
