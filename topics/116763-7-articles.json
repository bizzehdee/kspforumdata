But we can go further: A lot of mines for rutile, ilmenite, and leucoxene (the main ores for titanium) are not used, because the purity is so low that it is cheaper to import than to mine. But if you have no other sources and you really want titanium, you could mine it and get more expensive titanium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there are further minerals containing titanium, which are not mined, because it is harder to get it out, which would be too expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all the USA could also increase there production to their consumption. Expensive, but possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is the very reason, why no country is self sustaining, because it is cheaper not to be. But they could if they did not had the cheap imports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe do not produce ourselves, because someone else does it cheaper. It is the same with countries as with persons: I do not wash my dishes, I put them in the machine, because this is more time efficient, including the work to afford the machine.

Years ago much more countries used to produce cars, but they do not do now. They do not have forgotten how to produce cars, the others could do it cheaper, so they stopped car production.

But forced to do so, a lot of colonies would have survived (gotten self sustained).

First, when I say that it\u0027ll happen or it won\u0027t, I mean now and the near future. The thing is, we literal wouldn\u0027t be able to see it coming. So if some alien race were to find us and decide to wipe us out this way, there is nothing we can do.

But we have some things in our favor. First, we\u0027re still far from developing relativistic vehicles, so if there is a way of detecting those, we can\u0027t be found yet. If we\u0027re afraid of relativistic missiles, then we should launch more Kepler space telescopes to find indications of planets and stars being inexplicably being destroyed. There\u0027s a lot of stars in space, so we\u0027ll need a big network of them. Then we need to detect the signs or effects of objects travelling at relativistic speeds. Not so that we can see one coming (we can\u0027t), but to try to figure out where such vehicles are being launched from, where they are going, and what happens to the destinations. But that\u0027s something I\u0027m not sure is possible, even in theory. Instead, if we develop relativistic vehicles, we should sent a colony to another solar system almost as soon as we have the first vehicle. That way, some of humanity will still survive, and possible avenge against such rude neighbours. And that\u0027s all I have to say about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, back to the topic.

Are they pulp-era super villains?\u003Cp\u003EYes, I agree that humans don\u0027t always do what\u0027s best for humanity in the long-term. But you see, human development rarely ever came about \u0027for the good of mankind\u0027 to begin with. Each inventor, each researcher had their own reasons for their part, some of which never even knew that they\u0027d done anything more than just found an answer to a single question. I would love to just say that space is the reason itself to go there, but most people here agree that it isn\u0027t nearly a good enough reason. So we need better reasons. We must appeal to self-interest for small benefit of the whole if that\u0027s what it takes to create the whole in the first place. If we can sell whisky to rich snobs to get greater investment in space, how is that wrong? If we are selling to a market of the current six people on the ISS, is it not the start of a mining industry? People have travelled the length and breadth of this planet, on long and difficult journeys and at great personal risk, for lesser things which likely as not didn\u0027t exist. But their efforts helped map the world you live on. Should they not have done that? Would you rather not know? I\u0027ve stuck to things that we know exist because we\u0027re all too educated to buy that the fountain of eternal youth is on Venus and I\u0027d rather not just create more lies on the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying the space will ever be easy, or cheap, or very simple. What makes you think that it would need to be in the first place? You\u0027re unlikely to get there with that attitude. I want to know if the benefits are there, that the spirit that sent people out to the frontiers, where the maps said there were dragons, still has a place in humanity. If it doesn\u0027t, then what does it matter if the moon landing was faked? I have every reason to believe that it wasn\u0027t. But if we\u0027ve no reason to send people out past LEO again, or even to LEO, then it would as well have been faked. If space needs to make money to get the ball rolling, then that\u0027s a step we should take. But I want to believe that humanity can go further, they just need a few good reasons.
