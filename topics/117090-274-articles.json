Like [@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/) the I like the LC tanks.  They are awesome for their intended use... and SOO usable in other situations (small looking tanks of large volume for space station comes to mind.     I just love them.   Truth be told, they are probably the 2nd most used part from SSTU in my campaigns (the first being your awesome looking but not broken docking-ports.)  \n\nSecond most important.:   Dragon.    However a request.  I assume the folding docking port cover would be used.   While real life has a 90 degree opening.   ASSUMING you model the part, could it be made to open 90 and then with a second click open to what ever the maximum angle to JUST clear the Dragon capsule (to allow more flexibility in docking.)   If that is to be a jettisoned part than please move along from these comments... as these comments are not the comments you are looking for.... \\*HAN SHOT FIRST!\\*\n\nThird most important would be the Boeing CTS...    Although, admittedly, this is almost an ancillary/dark horse type of capsule since most \u0022Commercial\u0022 ventures are leaning towards Dragon (besides DRAGON-RIDER sounds soo much more cooler than CTS mission pilot! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022))\n\nBottom of the barrel in my opinion is the Mc-D ships.   3 reasons.  \n\n1. Of all of the real world produced space ships, Mercury and Gemini are in 3rd and 4th place across many mods for being built by my count.   Apollo is in 1st place. Soyuz appears to be second\n2. Of all these capsules mentioned Mercury and Gemini are only useful in a total conversion of the game\n3. as much as I love the Mc-D space craft, you have already mentioned in earlier posts that bringing them to full fruition (Gemini family) might be a bridge too far other than basic capsule that flew the R/W Gemini missions.... this also reduces effectiveness of the capsule.\n\n  I will be honest here.  I don\u0027t share your opinion on Stock-alike textures. BUT I understand your view on this subject.   You already mentioned re-skinning existing models via patch and additional texture files as being an option.   Might I suggest grabbing onto an existing mod that is UNDER DEVELOPMENT (please not a nearly dead necro mod for this.) for said re-texturing to your standard for textures on the Mc-D birds?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-01T13:22:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 29-9-2017 at 2:10 PM, Drakenex said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To keep it short, Like you\u0027ve said, there a lot of the others, but an SSTU Dragon2 could be awesome.\n\u003E \n\nDragon 2 will never fly, haven\u0027t you been keeping up ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)   It\u0027s the BFR junior now.
