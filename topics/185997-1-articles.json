I want to say for carbon nanotubes or graphine that number is around 6500 km. That means a radius of around 1000km is the largest ringworld possible. At 1g, that\u0027s 33 minutes per rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a giant ringworld, as your example, I think no one would notice anything odd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-02T06:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mean a ring around Mars that\u2019s 100 km above the surface?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u2019t forget that to get 1g\u00A0in this ring you\u2019d need to cancel out the Martian gravitational acceleration, meaning you\u2019d need 1 Earth gravity plus roughly 1 Mars gravity, though it\u2019d be a tad less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome people are inherently more sensitive to rotation than others, but the common accepted value for comfort is 2 rpm. However there is evidence to suggest 4 rpm can be comfortable with suitable acclimation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for lower rpm valuee, there\u2019s a diminising return effect. That is, you can double the radius but the rpm value doesn\u2019t go down as much. What this means is that there may be an optimal radius that optimizes everything from materials, energy cost, and human comfort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-02T06:20:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2019 06:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Bill Phil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
