Thus it was only possible to dock the Ranger and the Landers to the docking ports, but impossible to transfer fuel, connect electric lines and establish a connection between the Ranger and the Endurance ring module. Someone was supposed to detach the Ranger on their side. Though it is a mystery why CASE couldn\u0027t do that. Possibly because he was in command of the main Endurance part, and for Brand it was impossible to control such a wreck of a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd once again, it was admitted by Kip Thorne that some things had to be made impossible or seemingly impossible for the sake of the plot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend reading his book, \u0022The Science of Interstellar\u0022, it explains a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cydonian Monk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cydonian Monk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis. \u003Cp\u003EI came away from Interstellar thinking it had a wonderful little story that was wrapped up in too much movie. They clearly wanted to tell some relativistic Father-Daughter story, but in the process forgot about editing. It was a very pretty movie, and easy for me to forgive the minor nuances and plot oddities that didn\u0027t make much sense on the surface, but it was just too long... and far too clean at the end. In a way it reminded me of a Phillip K. ....* ending - I was wondering the whole time if it was real, if MM had actually made it back at all at the end, or if the whole business from the moment he jumped ship to the end of the movie wasn\u0027t just a massive hallucination as he tumbled down the gravity well / rabbit hole. I feel the cleanness of the ending only strengthens that argument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* [Wow, such auto-censorship there.
