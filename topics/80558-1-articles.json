Here\u0027s what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi59.tinypic.com/2dtdlpi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222dtdlpi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ship (the U.K.S. \u003Cem\u003EStargazer\u003C/em\u003E) entered orbit, going retrograde to take advantage of the Oberth effect. Once I had circularized at 110km, I deployed my lander (the \u003Cem\u003ESolstice\u003C/em\u003E) and its three-Kerbal crew to make a landing. The touchdown was a success, a flag was planted, and the team collected enough science to keep the scientists busy for months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi61.tinypic.com/2n8rabp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222n8rabp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I looked at the fuel readout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESolstice\u003C/em\u003E had less than 20% of its fuel left. Enough to lift off, but nowhere near enough to circularize even if I tapped into the monopropellant supply (most of which I\u0027d still need to return to the \u003Cem\u003EStargazer\u003C/em\u003E). Fortunately, thanks to the magic of quicksaving, I was able to determine that if I launched straight up, I\u0027d be able to get the lander to an apoapsis of 40km before burning out, followed by an eight-minute fall back to Eeloo. I then had the (unmanned) \u003Cem\u003EStargazer\u003C/em\u003E lower its orbit to 40km, and waited until a fly-over was four minutes away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I quicksaved. And then I launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESolstice\u003C/em\u003E blasted into space with all the power its Poodle engine could provide. It burned out at 40km, exactly as planned, and then I switched to \u003Cem\u003EStargazer\u003C/em\u003E and fine-tuned the encounter (by now about three minutes left) to get within 100m. I managed to do it, killed relative velocity, and immediately quicksaved. That\u0027s the terrible mistake referred to in the title: there is no going back, one way or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now both ships are tumbling toward Eeloo with less than four minutes to rendezvous, dock, and burn back into orbit. The \u003Cem\u003EStargazer\u003C/em\u003E has no command pod, and therefore no way to store science if two Kerbals decided to make heroic sacrifices while the third escaped. And on top of all that, \u003Cem\u003ESolstice\u003C/em\u003E has a very limited supply of monopropellant remaining. So using tons of it to close those 100m nice and fast is not an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I pull this off? Or are my Kerbals doomed to die far from home?
