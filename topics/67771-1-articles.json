Therefore, I will provide a recap of what has already been discussed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I would also like to add the disclaimer that I love the developers of ksp and DO NOT want this to be taken as overly critical of them)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, we were discussing the way that new releases are currently put together. Currently, as an update gets close to release the ksp media team is given access to the build to help squad test it and to get the community hyped for the new release. While some people are fine with this, it sort of rubs me the wrong way. See, the thing is that ksp is listed on steam as an early access game. The idea behind this is that we can test the game and provide feedback to help shape development as the game is made. So basically we are alpha/beta testers. This system works great as a whole, except for when squad begin to show info about a new update. Then we all get antsy and want the next update. Then the ksp media team gets to play with it and make videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where I take issue. If we are the alpha/beta testers, then why should we not be able to have access to these builds. I understand that squad doesn\u0027t feel that they are stable enough to release to the public, but they look stable enough to play in the videos that are released. So what I\u0027d like to propose is a new system for update releases. I think that ksp should do something similar to the way \u003Cem\u003Ethat other game\u003C/em\u003E and several other new early access games on steam have begun to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell, the way that \u003Cem\u003Ethat other game\u003C/em\u003E handles it\u0027s releases (for those who do not know) is by allowing the user to decide whether they want to play the most recent stable release, or whether they would rather play a weekly \u0022snapshot\u0022 build, one that is updated almost every week and which allows everyone to glimpse the new features that are coming up and to give the developer feedback on the new features before they have invested a ton of time doing bug fixing and stuff. These builds are often buggy, but they are still reasonably stable. They are great for those of us with update fever who can\u0027t stand to wait another 2 weeks for an update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR : KSP should adopt minecraft\u0027s snapshot system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poryy","CreatedById":81075,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T01:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*Claps*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Runs*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAAAAFFFFTTTTEEEERRRRRBUUUURRRRNNNNEEERRRRR!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MineAheadTV","CreatedById":70231,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T01:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E... ???

Prior to that, there was no such thing as the QA Team, or the Experimentals team... every update had some small testing with the devs themselves to try to make sure it was stable enough for public release, then it was basically a free-for-all, with each update there were at least 3-5 hotfixes required to restore the previous stability of the game.

So, first came the Experimentals team, and then came the QA Team. And with each addition, everything seemed to be working somewhat better.

This development method is generally known as \u0022agile\u0022 and allows quick prototyping, along with early testing/feedback gathering.
