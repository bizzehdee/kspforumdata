When you load a game, you just expect it to work until you\u0027re done playing it, and crashes should be few and far between... they should be out of the ordinary. I mean, people have actually built entire mods to help you predict when you\u0027re going to crash next, so you can save your game before that point, so this isn\u0027t just an OS X issue, but we seem to be hardest hit by it.
