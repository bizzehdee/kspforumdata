I\u0027m still disheartened by the lack of acknowledgement of OS X issues, and it would be nice if we could get even something along the lines of \u0022We know the OS X version has major issues. We\u0027re working on it.\u0022 I wouldn\u0027t say I\u0027m a huge gamer by any stretch, but of the games I do play from time to time, none of them involve anticipating crashes as part of gameplay. When you load a game, you just expect it to work until you\u0027re done playing it, and crashes should be few and far between... they should be out of the ordinary. I mean, people have actually built entire mods to help you predict when you\u0027re going to crash next, so you can save your game before that point, so this isn\u0027t just an OS X issue, but we seem to be hardest hit by it. If I were Squad, dealing with that issue would be first and foremost. \n\nThat being said, I think I agree with the general consensus... as long as KSP for PS4 doesn\u0027t do to KSP what Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel did to that franchise, then best of luck with it."},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T17:41:37Z","Content":"Just read harvesters post.
