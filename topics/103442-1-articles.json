Modern OSes are very smart about caching disk contents to RAM, when you allocate RAM to a RAM disk you are essentially saying \u0022I know that the files here are more important to keep in RAM than what the OS thinks\u0022, and any free space on the RAM disk is not able to be put to use by the OS as well. There\u0027s also the penalty of loading all the contents to the RAM disk at each boot, and writing them back out before shutdown (as well as losing any progress if that write out is not completed before power is cut).
