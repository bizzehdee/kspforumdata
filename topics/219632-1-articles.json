I\u2019ve set up a new KSP install (fresh, copied straight from Steam) on v1.8.1. I added an exceedingly large pile of mods since I just built myself a new computer, and after getting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E to play nice, I figured everything else would be fine, since I installed everything with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E except \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Exploration to stop it from hanging at loading the sciences. I fixed it by installing the mod manually. Anyway, at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, everything was totally black. Like, pitch dark, absolutely nothing. The buildings were still interactive, but the tracking station seemed to have disappeared. Zooming in or out does nothing.

I may not be able to provide it though, as I am currently away from my computer and expect to be until Thursday morning. I\u2019m typing this on my phone only because I just remembered the issue and figured it\u2019d be better to type this before I forget and do it earlier. Thanks!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
