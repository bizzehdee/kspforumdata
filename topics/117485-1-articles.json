For example, I have two missions scheduled to get back from Minmus. In both cases I wrote down time of Kerbin apoapsis. One event scheduled at UT (As visible from either the tracking station or the space center) 18 days 8 hours 57 minutes, and another at 18 days 7 hours 40 minutes. I started a Mun mission, which involved launching it at around 14 days 5 hours, doing the initial transfer burn, and adjusting it, which involved messing with maneuver nodes, doing burns, and time-warping for under an hour total. I was being careful because I had another event scheduled for 14 7 19 (Munar periapsis).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is now 15 days 0 hours in my game, and one of the previous events is going to happen at 19 4 57 and the other one at 19 1 40.
