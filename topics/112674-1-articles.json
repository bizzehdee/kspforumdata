Don\u0027t worry about leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI (Mun and Minmus are fine) until you\u0027re well past upgrading your R\u0026D the first time\n\n2. Satellite contracts can be huge moneymakers, along with tourism contracts. If you can combine the two (include a small satellite that you can detach from your tourism lifter and move to orbit - 1 launch, multiple contracts), all the better.\n\n3. Make sure that when you\u0027re taking a contract, your ship costs less than the contract pays, otherwise you\u0027re just losing money (unless you can recover enough of your ship to make it worth it...see #4)\n\n4. Get the StageRecovery mod (if you are not against mods/modding). This mod will allow you to recover spent stages if you have enough parachutes or fuel left to make a powered landing. This helps keep your funds up a bit, as you won\u0027t lose expensive parts (such as engines) on your Launch stages.\n\nRE: Grindy ~ Yeah, KSP can be a bit grindy in career. If you don\u0027t want those grindy requirements, Science mode is available and basically just career w/out the funds limitations.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I guess I should mention that I play with no quick save, no reverts, and no respawns.\n\nIf I may, I would suggest at least keeping Quick Saves available. KSP has been fairly well known to be buggy and occasionally crash-prone. It\u0027s really frustrating to get a mission nearly finished and have the game crash and lose it all... I have seen even the most veteran KSP\u0027ers use Quick Save and not use Quick Load unless they run into a bug. If they crash or have a RUD (Rapid Unplanned Disassembly) they won\u0027t Quick Load, only on bugs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T16:41:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ignath**\n  \nQuick Save/Load stuff I forgot."},{"CreatedByName":"Plume \u0026amp; Akakak","CreatedById":142955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:35:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E (...)

I built a successful craft that could get me to Minmus and land. And have enough to get back. So, now, whenever a Minmus contract comes up like plant a flag, I take it and increase my money. I\u0027m probably not as efficient as others, but it makes me money. Also, I try and get two or three missions at a time to Minmus, thereby maximizing revenue. \n\nCombine missions, like \u0022Science from around Kerbin\u0022 \u002B \u0022Plant Flag on Minmus\u0022. And you don\u0027\u0027t have to actually get science from running the experiment. Even if you get 0 Science, running the experiment gets you the success.\n\nthat being said, I have yet to leave Kerbin SOI except for one unmanned probe to Dune and Ike, and I am up to the 550 level of science and still going."},{"CreatedByName":"Archgeek","CreatedById":116048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T17:57:27Z","Content":"Just to add to what\u0027s already been said, it does not in fact need to be a grind. Need more cash, sure, you test parts, but why *just* test parts when you can incorperate part tests into your missions? Some part tests are convenient and ask you test a part when you\u0027d be using it anyway, like testing a booster when landed on Kerbin. Others give you temporary access to parts you haven\u0027t even unlocked yet, and if they fit your mission profile, can help simplify a mission you were doing anyway. For instance, I\u0027ll often combine part tests with a rescue mission, making dreadbank and getting free crew member."},{"CreatedByName":"Random Hooded Stranger","CreatedById":139766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T14:50:45Z","Content":"These are some great tips guys ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) my new iron man career save is actually going pretty well.

Especially related to the weight to carry into orbit or to a moon.\n\nSome mods also helps, and KSP should include those tools at some point. For example, Kerbal Engineer Redux is very useful in order to understand how to optimize your stages. I also like to watch Scott Manley\u0027s videos on YouTube. I\u0027ve learned a lot from him.\n\nIn my career mode I still didn\u0027t unlock all the 90 points tier tech bits, nonetheless I can easily manage touristic contracts that want me to fly by moons. And that\u0027s easy money :-p\n\nps. Also, installing probe and parachutes to your second or third stages help in retrieving them for reuse.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T20:21:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 08:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by carlorizzante**"}]}
