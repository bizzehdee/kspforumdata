I really like the legs RoverDude made for the MKS hub, and since he licenses the parts CC Attribution Sharealike, so I took the legs from his file and added an adapter. The part looks good in blender, but the animation does not play correctly when I import it into Unity (instead of the mirrored leg behaviour, both legs traverse the same direction, which is obviously broken). I am probably doing something really stupid, but I cannot figure out what; if anyone, looking at the file, could give me a way forward, I would appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4icgpkuyxjlufz7/legsandcylinder.blend?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4icgpkuyxjlufz7/legsandcylinder.blend?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the FBX: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/okunh2dzmavmh1s/legsandcylinder_export.fbx?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/okunh2dzmavmh1s/legsandcylinder_export.fbx?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sQZfsni.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sQZfsni.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T19:52:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by larkvi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T14:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t have blender right now to look into your file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you are mirroring items by copy/rotate - you should have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) LOCAL (not GLOBAL!) animations for anything that will be mirrored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Empty object to host mirrored parts which should be copied/rotated with them instead of just copying rotating the parts themself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen local animations will be animated properly in any position and angle you put their hosting empty object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the least painful method.
