Notice this is with changed settings but it was the same with best guess. 30-60secs as you suggested, plus using the turn start and speed I usually use. I played with the sensitivity but that didn\u0027t change much. The end result was this launch being quite efficient but still marginally more expensive than my usual launch, and very accurate to 100km which I like very much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKER is telling me that my launch stage atmo.TWR is 1.6 and IMO that is not *underpowered* that is more than enough to get the craft off the ground and as I have demonstrated into orbit reasonably efficiently with a payload. Every piece of advice I have read has said anything around 1.5 is fine and much more than that is a waste and that reentry effects are caused by excessive loss due to atmo drag. I have gotten the best efficiency in my style of ascent from that advice. I don\u0027t need to touch the throttle, I barely need to touch the controls at all once I set the turn at 50m/s other than to keep the inclination right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what to say, I\u0027m definitely not trying to nitpick, or enter into a liquiding competition about this, or prove you wrong in any way.

\u00A0Specifically, when it thinks it will be behind the target position for more than 20 seconds, it will pitch upwards a bit as allowed by dynamic pressure. \u00A0So in your case and in the other guy\u0027s case where you won\u0027t hit the initial desired AP time for well over a minute, the mod is scrambling to catch up to where it thinks you want to be. \u00A0There are a number of different ways to address this in the settings that will all have different effects on the overall outcome. \u00A0This behavior has great benefits later on in the launch when your hyper-efficient\u00A00.5TWR upper stage ends up not crashing into the planet, but takes some adjustment for a slightly lethargic lower stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upcoming version (\u003Ca

general it iterates towards horrifyingly fireball-like ascents, because those are the most efficient, and this is the desired behavior that I will keep. \u00A0I am working on making it quit while it\u0027s ahead and learn when to stop instead of going just one launch too far. \u00A0With my 1.25m test rocket, the second guess launch had improved over the first by 60m/s, the next another 40. \u00A0If your rocket is not currently engulfed in flame during ascent, then your improvements will probably be more dramatic. \u00A0Let me repeat that this is still in development, and while it does

handling low-TWR designs. \u00A0Specifically, when it thinks it will be behind the target position for more than 20 seconds, it will pitch upwards a bit as allowed by dynamic pressure. \u00A0So in your case and in the other guy\u0027s case where you won\u0027t hit the initial desired AP time for well over a minute, the mod is scrambling to catch up to where it thinks you want to be. \u00A0There are a number of different ways to address this in the settings that will all have different effects on the overall outcome. \u00A0This behavior has great benefits later on in the launch when your hyper-efficient\u00A00.5TWR upper stage ends up not crashing into the planet, but takes some adjustment for a slightly lethargic lower stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe upcoming version (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/johnfink8/GravityTurn/tree/dev/GameData/GravityTurn/Plugins\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecurrently available in the dev branch on Github\u003C/a\u003E) will \u0022learn\u0022 from previous launches and make more/less aggressive settings based on the previous best result. \u00A0This is done per ship name, and it excludes the default \u0022Untitled Space Craft\u0022 name since that would cause a lot of unwanted guesses. \u00A0This has a lot of serious implications in a lot of cases, like occasionally burning your ship up on ascent. \u00A0In general it iterates towards horrifyingly fireball-like ascents, because those are the most efficient, and this is the desired behavior that I will keep. \u00A0I am working on making it quit while it\u0027s ahead and learn when to stop instead of going just one launch too far. \u00A0With my 1.25m test rocket, the second guess launch had improved over the first by 60m/s, the next another 40. \u00A0If your rocket is not currently engulfed in flame during ascent, then your improvements will probably be more dramatic. \u00A0Let me repeat that this is still in development, and while it does seem to work pretty well, you still have to hold its hand a bit or you\u0027ll end up catching a bit too much fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe below image
