If you can do that at a decent distance (which I accept will not be easy with a craft which is hard to control) then you can just edge in slowly, keeping the prograde vector on top of the target vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the prograde vector starts to move off the target vector, aim to the opposite side of the target vector and accelerate very slowly (maybe just RCS, depends on distance). This will drag your prograde vector back onto the target vector. If you\u0027ve turned around to slow down, then you need to \u0027push\u0027 your retrograde vector onto that of the target, which means you have to be on the opposite side of the retrograde vector from the target\u0027s retrograde vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you \u0027pull\u0027 a prograde vector onto a target, and you \u0027push\u0027 a retrograde vector.
