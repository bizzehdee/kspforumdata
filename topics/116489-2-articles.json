Target orbit is 100km, but it may be able to go higher - anyone able to get it to orbit may be able to confirm based on what fuel is still available. If I was continuing the test flights myself, I would probably aim for an initial orbit around 85km to allow a margin of safety/error. The payload fitted in the provided craft file is 730 kg and there is room in the cargo bay for 2 of those, so round that up and say payload capacity of 1500kg should be about right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first few test flights I did were to tweak the aerodynamics to get it to fly reasonably well and were kept local to the KSC. The penultimate flight was to test high altitude speed gain and transition from atmospheric to rocket engines. That\u0027s when I decided to change to Rapiers, and the final test flight was a repeat of the previous one to make the same checks using the Rapiers. I have just done another flight like this last one, which lasted 25 mins to a maximum altitude of 31000m and returned to KSC, and represents the flight that would have had the highest costs due to the amount of fuel used. The cost of that flight was 3100.

Reentry was a little harry due to actually deorbiting a little too sharpy(my bad) but the craft took it without flinching and soaked up the heat like a champ. Used both the airbrakes and pitched the nose up 30 degrees to slow the craft down quickly.

This was all with the airbrakes still deployed, I was going fast... 2200m/s at reentry... nosing down didn\u0027t cause any troubles, the craft simply pulled its own nose back up once it dug deeper into the atmosphere.

It flew smooth and stable all the way up to orbit. I was able to achieve a 70Km x 70Km(barely) orbit with this craft. It has a bit too fine of a fuel load, in the hands of a Novice like me, to really get much higher then that. I didn\u0027t have the most efficient flight profile... I did have 4 Kerbal passangers on board during the flight though. But, since I\u0027m lacking a space station to dock with, and the fact that I was unable to maneuver the craft enough to reach a station once in orbit, I had to content myself with a 4 Kerbal joy ride. The reentry took a long time really. I Only had enough fuel to retroburn into a 47Km reentry orbit, and I judged the entry position wrong too boot... I had the airbrakes deployed by 60Km and once again pitched the nose up 20 degrees(probably too shallow... should of gone steeper, in hind sight), but this, along with the entry angle, ment the parts were exposed to excessive heating far longer then needed. Many of the parts on the craft were glowing red hot by the time I got it down into the thicker parts of the atmosphere. At this point, I double check my fuel levels, yep, completely tapped out... Not a drop of liquid fuel or oxidizer left in the tanks. Looks like it\u0027s a dead stick flight from here on out. Time to nose down to level and deactivate the airbrakes and hope she holds up to the additional heating from not slowing down anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remembered to close the air intakes at about 20Km, hopefully to buy me a few extra Km of glide.

This at least meant I\u0027d get good distance since I wouldn\u0027t be flaring the wings by accident. I tried to extend the glide as far as possible, but my bad judgment in orbit ment I was going to be short of the runway. She remained stable all the way down to the deck and down to speeds of only 90m/s. And looming in front of me were the mountains just west of the KSC... Thankfully, I\u0027ve gotten quite skilled at making mountain landings thanks to my little Drifter series of science aircraft. The landing ended up being rather easy with the crafts wheels touching down in the rolling hills just before the mountain range.

At that point the prograde vector was about 10 degrees and the nose of the craft was a few degrees higher, lined up with the top of the prograde circle.

Every time, pitch excursions leading to an unrecoverable inverted flat spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just plain too tail-heavy and too draggy in front. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to get it to orbit by unloading the farthest- aft tank and handling it very carefully until it built up speed. It seems to stabilize after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Of course, that means you have to slog on the single nuc to orbit because the RAPIERS give out early, but it *is* doable.
