Without getting bogged down in math and details...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity slingshots are based on your approacing and departing trajectories from a body. The craft basically steals some of the planet\u0027s (or moon\u0027s) momentum to gain speed (or leaves momentum to lose speed). As such, slingshots only require dV to set up, but need none to execute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOberth is a byproduct of expending fuel. A craft always steals kinetic energy from engine exhaust. However, because of how the physics works, the higher the craft speed, the more kinetic energy the craft can steal. Your orbital speed is faster when you are closer to the planet/moon than when further away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo efficiency here isn\u0027t necessarily directly comparable because they are using different effects. However, there is generally only so much dV you can steal from slingshotting. So if you need more than that, you have to burn an engine.

It costs about 1000-1100m/s to get from LKO to Duna. IOW, going to Mun costs you about 80-90% of what it costs to go to Duna without touching Mun\u0027s SOI. Therefore, if you can derive any benefit at all from passing by Mun on the way to Duna, it be no more than 10-20% of what you\u0027d spend otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the issue of having to wait for the proper day when Mun is in just the right position to sling you straight into Duna. I have no idea when this day would happen, and there\u0027s nothing says it has to be on the same day that the Duna transfer window opens. The transfer window is when it costs the least to get to Duna, so if Mun isn\u0027t in the right place that day, waiting on Mun would mean the base trip to Duna would be more expensive than it needs to be, so any savings from Mun would be even less than on an optimal day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are folks who do things the other way around, though. Use Kerbin instead of Mun for the slingshot by starting at Minmus. They say the dive back down from Minmus to Kerbin gives them enough extra starting speed at LKO altitude that they save about 500-600m/s on the transfer burn. HOWEVER, first you have to get to Minmus, which is ~900-1000m/s from Kerbin, so you actually end up spending about 1500m/s in total to get to Duna this way, which is more than if you just left from LKO. The reason for doing this, however, is that it allows for smaller interplanetary ships and/or faster interplanetary burns. Instead of having a big, slow-burning transfer stage, you have big boosters that get you to Minmus. There, you refuel if necessary from a kethane establishment, and your ship effectively has already done 500m/\u0027s of the transfer burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T15:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wasmic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wasmic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe most efficient way to do it would be to get a gravity assist from Mun, with a burn at Mun periapsis if needed.

I was merely pointing out that if he really wanted to slingshot out from Kerbin, he should use Kerbin, not Mun.

It used a nuke and took over an eight minute burn for the entire fuel load. Setting up the elliptical orbit netted a gain of around 200 dV for a roughly 3000dV burn (the entire fuel load). So actually not a bad gain.
