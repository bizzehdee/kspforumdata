If that so-called medusa cascade were to unleash a type of particle or energy to destroy all matter in all parallel universes, then in accordance with one of the multiverse theories wouldn\u0027t there be another \u0022bubble\u0022 universe with different laws of physics that render said particles useless? Would there be an unintentional creation effect, sparking new universes into existence as the old ones perish, these new universes being built off of the particle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what about the law of thermodynamics? Energy can be neither created nor destroyed. Matter can be annihilated by antimatter, but that resulting energy released is immense. So, would this act as a secondary \u0022Big Bang\u0022, annihilating all matter in the universe and converting it into energy, an expanding cloud of energy that begins cooling over countless billions of years, until hydrogen (or an equivalent) eventually begins to show up... And as the energy cools, more hydrogen starts showing up, clumping together as per gravitational attraction. And eventually begins fusing. This results in a new set of first-generation stars, creation of heavier elements, star deaths and births of subsequent generations. Until eventually terrestrial objects begin to form, and around one star, the building blocks of life are set in motion, leading to the rise of one of the oldest, smartest species in the universe...
