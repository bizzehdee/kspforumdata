Well, I\u0027ve sort of figured out the best way to do the sub-orbital is to go straight up (ish) and coast to 70,000m. The coasting gives me about a minute or so to plan my maneuvre node accordingly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m encountering another problem. I\u0027ve aimed at the blue cross and fired up the required seconds (usually have about 5-10dv remaining before the blue cross runs off somewhere else and I spend 30s hunting it again). Without fail, I fall short of the target island - is that due to the planet\u0027s rotation (and I should therefore aim further) or am I just rubbish at maneuvering?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T12:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know nodes calculation do not take atmospheric drag (slow down) into account.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BananaLee","CreatedById":73706,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T12:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, that definitely makes sense.
