That being said there is rarely an instance where you dont have the option to change inclination before to circularize or climb into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as a rule of thumb, when entering a new system, its always best to perform your inclination changes as soon as (or even before) you enter the SOI, and if I\u0027m making a targeted landing at laythe or duna I\u0027ll do a light aerobrake maneuver until my apo just drops into SOI and then once at apo i\u0027ll perform my plane changes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-26T08:55:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2014 08:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FREEFALL1984\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T07:37:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know that orbit reversals are most efficient at the very edge of the sphere of influence.

Then I used a small lander to just go harvest science. As the lander was designed as minimal as possible for deorbit, science, back to orbit, dock and clean instruments, it lacks the dV to visit the poles. The stations/fuel Depots have a LV-N, so they are mobile under their own power and actually have quite a bit of dV when full (I guess you could call them ships, but they weren\u0027t really intened as such) now I want to move my stations to a polar orbit so I can get the last of the biomes.

For inclination changes you are not changing your orbit\u0027s specific energy, just the direction. It is best to do so when moving as slowly as possible, in fact it usually works out to be most efficient to raise your apoapsis as high as possible, burn the inclination change there, then recircularize at periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
