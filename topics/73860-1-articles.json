On stock KSP, the top speed of a car is defined mainly by the torque curve, and the straight-line performance of a car is based only on the number of powered wheels compared to the mass of the car (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, the acceleration of a car is defined mainly by the power-to-mass ratio, and the top speed is on the point in which the drag force and wheel force are equal. In stock KSP, the power of a car is defined by the number of powered wheels, and mass and drag are the same thing, so the mass of the car compared to number of wheels is the only thing that matters for acceleration, and for top speed, you will be limited only by the torque curve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, to win a racing challenge with stock KSP, you must make the lightest car possible with the maximal amount of powered wheels allowed, while trying to make the car very low, wide and short, to assist in cornering.

Seems to be exactly what i need though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also trying to find a way to access the WheelCollider of a rover wheel, so i can make a telemetry mod. That would help a lot with the development of Rover Wheels when i start making a realistic engine simulation. But i may decide to not use the stock ModuleWheel, and instead use from another mod or create my own, as that would give me a lot more freedom. I still want to make the telemetry mod though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T23:06:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats on the release!

The engine simulation will be on the core, with the pistons serving only for determining the power of the engine. The core will be the part that creates (and stores) EnginePower, and also the part that consumes LiquidFuel. Later, RPM simulation will be done on the core too, and transmission on a separate part (a \u0022gearbox\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings the (technical) benefits of having things centralized on one part, while still with the benefits of versatility for the user, as the number of pistons is customizable. It also does not allow the player to just put pistons all across the vehicle at impossible places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking for an alternative to stock KSP ModuleWheels, because it would allow for a lot more freedom.
