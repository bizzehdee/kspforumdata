Today I made a decent \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E that can cary about 50 tons into orbit with the drag from the engines and radial parts occluded. However the cargo bay that is closed doesn\u2019t get it\u2019s drag removed and produces the most amount of drag. Any way to combat this and or reduce most of it?
