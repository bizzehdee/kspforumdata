So in a classic vertical stack up the attach node of the bottom part must have its Zaxis pointing UP and the attach node of the top part must have its Zaxis point DOWN. The Xaxis and Yaxis do not appear to have any significance in how the two parts attach so it doesn\u0027t matter how they align in relation to one another as long as the Zaxis are anti-aligned (point in opposite directions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if the above is an absolute answer. You might be able to get away with pointing the attach node of the bottom part DOWN and the attach point of the top part UP.
