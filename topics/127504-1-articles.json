I have personally landed some of my more stable planes on a broken runway, but when I start to use large planes with less stability, I get explosions. Also, I\u00A0think of it a lot like landing in the rockier areas of Kerbin. When I land in rocky areas, I need to land slow, so my breaks can kick in and I stop quickly. That is the same with landing on a broken runway. Also, as is true for any landing, wheel positioning is important, and wider wheels near COM really help.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo paraphrase, I have landed on the KSP runway when it was broken, but only with a slow landing speed, and a stable plane\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T14:46:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCall me crazy but wouldn\u0027t it be easier to just land over in the grass?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr are we just doing it for the sheer challenge it presents?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve always reverted whenever I damaged the runway so I\u0027ve never tried honestly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barrrrry","CreatedById":154823,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T14:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222318042\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127504\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449845216\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154640\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rocket In My Pocket\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Rocket In My Pocket said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCall me crazy but wouldn\u0027t it be easier to just land over in the grass?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr are we just doing it for the sheer challenge it presents?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve always reverted whenever I damaged the runway so I\u0027ve never tried honestly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah its way easier to land on the grass, but were assuming that if we land on the grass, we\u00A0will die.
