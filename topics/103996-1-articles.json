I hope so, otherwise this could be hard to understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo right from day 1, I bet you have been told to be yourself, and that nothing else is more important. Well, that\u0027s true! Being yourself is the #1 key to loving the \u0022you\u0022 that you are now. That view may change in a few years, but by then, the \u0022you\u0022 would have changed as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe definition of you: The construct of your life so far, your interests, beliefs, religion, accomplishments, morals, ect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMorals is probably the most important, because it can dictate whether or not the \u0022you\u0022 that you are now is...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so that half-statement kinda brought in a whole new topic, so to clear it up now: The \u0022you\u0022 that you want to be is perfectly fine, but if that \u0022you\u0022 entails the harm and/or suffering of others, than that image of \u0022you\u0022 should change for the better. You may not like it, but it is the right thing to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that out of the way, the best [and moral] \u0022you\u0022 is always the way to go. That\u0027s what everyone wanted from the start, right? Well... no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor you to become the \u0022you\u0022 of image isn\u0027t what people want. What was meant by \u0022yourself\u0022 means the \u0022you\u0022 that they saw, not you. Think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn school, were you often sick of doing the same thing over and over again, all because someone didn\u0027t quite understand, forcing everyone to be set back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you still do it? If no, because YOU don\u0027t want to, that\u0027s the wiser choice, because it exercises your independence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf yes, why? Why would you subject your mind to unnecessary stresses? Why go with the mold just to create more work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think that\u0027s too theoretical of an analogy, try this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are at war. You are currently resting at camp, after exchanging weapons fire for days with your enemies. Enemies that have killed your friends in front of your own eyes. At night, you hear a moan of pain nearby. You slip out, and find it to be one of your enemies. Unarmed, dying, and in a lot of pain. You report to your commander for instructions. Say that you wanted the decision to kill him, since he\u0027s your enemy, and was among those that killed your allies, and wouldn\u0027t hesitate to shoot you on sight. You want to end his life, but your commander gives orders to rescue, and treat him. What would you do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComply with his orders, and save him? Or stick to your morals, and disobey orders? Disobey orders, and you are confined, all for exercising your rights as an individual. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to be an individual is to be punished for exercising it? To not be an individual is to be rewarded for blind compliance? If you\u0027re not supposed to be independent of the collective, why are you told it\u0027s a good thing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T22:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the laws of warfare you can\u0027t kill him.
