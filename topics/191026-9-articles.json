Or maybe if the sedan is much closer to me than the motorcycle then I will swerve left, knowing that the motorcyclist is more vulnerable but deciding that I\u0027m less likely to hit him at all.

The timeline is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Truck starts decelerating from 30 m/s. Typical semis stop in ~160m. Cars are more like 65m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

Cars already stop in less than half the distance of trucks, so there is no trolley problem, the car simply slows behind the truck (and is more likely to be hit from behind probably).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the bike left speeds off at highway speed, as does the sedan. The self-driving car now has to decide if it can change lanes to avoid the car BEHIND IT hitting it. That\u0027s a more likely case. Now there\u0027s a motorcycle in one lane, a car in another, can it bang either of those to not be rear ended?
