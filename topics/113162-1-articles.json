Then I got to wondering how this idea came about. Thinking some more, I came to the idea that a person could probably take a clear glass bowl, mark the angle from the bottom up to 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, then fill the bowl to the 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 line.

Remember that one degree of error in latitude is roughly 100 km. You\u0027ll have a hard time measuring anything to within a degree. And even if you\u0027re lost in the wilderness, you probably know your position within plus/minus 100 km anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy comparison, my sextant\u0027s worm gear and vernier allows measurements to within 1/600th of a degree (0.1 minutes). In practice, that type of accuracy isn\u0027t practical. Waves on the horizon and atmospheric refraction introduce larger errors than that. Errors due to height of the eye above the ocean surface (dip) are also significant, as are errors in time as small as 4 or 5 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy carefully judging the location of the true horizon between the waves, compensating for atmospheric refraction and dip using lookup tables and accounting for known drift rates in my chronometer, I can fix a position within a few nautical miles of my GPS position, but it takes careful attention to detail. That\u0027s close enough to find the lights, but it also puts the achievements of guys like Frank Worsley into perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have a good horizon due to fog, haze or some other obstruction, you can use a tray of water as an artificial horizon, but you need to have previously measured how far below the true horizon your pan of water is, for some fixed relative position. It won\u0027t work on a moving boat though. You can also use a special scope on your sextant that has a built-in bubble level. Aircraft sextants have these because it is almost impossible to see a sharp horizon from up high.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T04:33:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarified a couple of sentences\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T19:03:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linkxsc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022linkxsc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, a bowl with water, or a sphere half full (probably better) ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if said sphere was half empty?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T22:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d wait for the day, looking true N/S, getting some rough latitude by the height of Sun at transit...

The shadow length and time of the resulting curve\u0027s lowest point can then be used to calculate latitude and longitude. As I mentioned in my earlier post, the resulting fix isn\u0027t very accurate though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a sextant on the other hand, each measurement yeilds a line of position. (It is actually a circle on the Earth\u0027s surface, but it looks like a line on the scale of most charts for all but the highest objects in the sky.) Take measurements of two different objects and you get two lines of position. Where the two lines of position cross is where you are located. And while the two lines actually cross at two locations, the second will usually be off the chart. It is also possible to shoot the same object (like the Sun) twice to get two lines of position, but you need to wait at least an hour or two between shots. Then if you\u0027re moving during that time, you have to offset one or the other of those lines of position based on your ded reckoning. This is called a running fix. Adding a third shot for a third line of position yeilds a triangle near your true position. It is traditional to plot the centre of that triangle as your celestial fix. It is possible to calculate a position within a few miles of your actual position using these methids, and you don\u0027t need to wait for a noon day sight to do it. You just need more complex math.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T04:00:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 04:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T06:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...

As you know, one can calculate latitude without knowing the time but an accurate timepiece (chronometer) is vital to all practical methods of determining longitude at sea.

Prior to Harrison\u0027s invention of the chronometer, time was calculated by measuring the distance between the moon and other fixed objects in the sky. This took a lot of math and wasn\u0027t easy to do while at sea. Another method was to reference transits of Jupiter\u0027s moons using a telescope but, again, it wasn\u0027t practical to do this while at sea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
