However, I encountered a number of problems after I attached the CLAW that you see on one of the extensions. I experienced some form of phantom force, cause my neat 88-by-87km orbit suddenly became a 41-132. I eventually managed to pull the periapse out of atmo (no small feat to shift 106 tons with only two usable thrusters on an unbalanced station) but a problem persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HUWu7JK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HUWu7JK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I activate time warp, something pulls the two... lets call them \u0022outside sections\u0022 (the ones with orange tank and Lab unit and the one with all the RCS), backwards (Opposite direction of the Cupola) with such force that it rips the statio apart. Seen here (the girder segments bend them inward and cause the explosion):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KdXrMIr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KdXrMIr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/46MTNt7.png\u0022 alt=\u002246MTNt7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only that, but I discovered that this happens even when they are disconnected from the middle section first.

I have to go to space center in order to timewarp it, and it makes it very difficult for me to continue construction on it if this continues. The station was painstakingly put together by ferrying every piece into orbit on an SSTO spaceplane, so I\u0027d rather not have to loose it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only use the Stock Rebalance mod, and all it does is change the stats of some parts, of which none are on the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the persistence file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/gsmsmnaidgo93ji/persistent.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/gsmsmnaidgo93ji/persistent.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is appreciated\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-18T17:26:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2014 05:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SofusRud\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T17:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like the problem is caused by to many control systems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurn off torque on every SAS and probe module you have on that thing see if that fixes your problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause your unit that is in control is fighting EVERY other SAS equipped module on that station causing it to do some funky stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T17:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks like the problem is caused by to many control systems. \u003Cp\u003ETurn off torque on every SAS and probe module you have on that thing see if that fixes your problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause your unit that is in control is fighting EVERY other SAS equipped module on that station causing it to do some funky stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat worked, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T17:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cp\u003EBecause your unit that is in control is fighting EVERY other SAS equipped module on that station causing it to do some funky stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommon misconception!
