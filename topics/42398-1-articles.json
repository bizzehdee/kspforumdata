A little back ground information about my modding experience, I have modded several games in several ways but simcity 4 being my biggest. I have modeled many things and textured them all, most of the time making custom textures. I used google sketchup and GMAX to model everything so I have NO experience in Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut from my understanding you can create in other programs and export into unity, and just do a couple things then export out of there? Someone please correct me on it if I am wrong! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the idea that I mentioned earlier. A converter such as the Kethane converter found in the Kethane mod. The difference being this converter is avaliable in 1.25 meter and 2 meter versions and takes Xenon gas, and MASSIVE amounts of power to convert a small amount of liquid fuel and oxidizer. Now I say massive amounts of power because I have seen many many people making extremely large space stations that have many batteries and are capable of stores thousands upon thousands of units of electricty and solar panels being able to replenish that rather quickly. I have always thought that the power in the game is unbalacned and needs a use which is why I say lots of power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I know that in real life there would be no way of converting a gas into rocket fuel using a converter and electricty... This is a game that is LOOSELY based on real life situations so it is perfectly acceptable. Because of the ration of Xenon gas, and power to the amount of rocket fuel you get will be around a 10 in = 0.5 out it does add a challenge but at the same time a little bit easier for interplanetary missions. I just need some help and clarifacation if anyone would be willing I would greatly greatly appreciate it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E7499275\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T01:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat needs to be done in Unity really depends on the complexity of the part you are making. A simple fuel tank just needs the KSP part tools added and colliders set...done. Anything more complex will require you to do more. Engines and rcs and intakes require extra game objects set up as transforms. Any animated parts need the animation set up in Unity as well.
