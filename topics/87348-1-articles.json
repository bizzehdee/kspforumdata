According to the configs the small control surfaces have the same surface area as the larger ones, but they produce less drag.....I\u0027m wondering whether this was an oversight, or perhaps the surface area parameter doesn\u0027t actually do anything? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, since I couldn\u0027t find much to work with using stock .cfgs, is anyone able to explain the proper approach to ballpark-scaling of wing/control surface parameters, and the relationship between dragCoeff \u0026amp; deflectionLiftCoeff? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
