It\u0027s worth noting that his mother was a hatter who followed the old ways of manufacture, and was suffering from acute chisso poisoning. Young Malachai, who, even at that age was displaying the signs of full-blown madness, took this story quite literally, and continued to be an obsession as he grew up into fine young crazy man. When his mother died, he lost his only support system, and began living on the streets. Every night he would curse at the Mun, demanding that it share its riches with the rest of Kerbin, siting obscure socio-economic theories that passer-byes were astounded he knew. Alas, the Mun remained stoic and silent as ever.\u003Cp\u003EOne day, Malachai was outside of town burying a sandwich, when he was blown back by a great geyser of clear, slightly oily fluid that flowed up from the very ground he tread on. It smelled awful, but in a moment of rare lucidity, he bottled as much as he could, retrieved his sandwich, and returned to his shack in town. Meanwhile, several engineers from the Kerbal Space Program were having a boys\u0027 night out. As they stumbled out of the pub, a familiar stench filled their nostrils: fuel. At the time, the KSP was still in its nascency, and fuel was in short supply. Knowing they would be promoted if they found a new source of fuel, they followed their smell-receptors to the source. They found a ramshackle shack, knocked on the door, and a scraggly man answered the door. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Malachai\u0027s mother, while mad, still taught her son to be a good host, so he invited the strange men in and offered what little he had. What little he had happened to be a half-eaten sandwich that reeked of liquid propellant. The strange men respectfully declined. After some polite small-talk, Malachai\u0027s guests asked why he smelled of rocket fuel. Malachai told them of the strange geyser that he found when he was trying to hid his sandwich from \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthose accursed mermen.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He then produced a large jar of the fluid, and his guests began to rejoice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe very next day Malachai was brought to KSP headquarters, where he, much to the surprise of everyone involved, shrewdly negotiated drilling rights. Using the money he earned in government contracts, he searched for more research, and he quickly became the largest rocket fuel tycoon on Kerbin. He was no longer \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMalachai, that smelly crazy guy who screams at the Mun,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 but \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CH. Malachai Kerminstein, that eccentric billionaire who happens to scream at the Mun.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 With his huge fortune, he began his lifelong quest to wrest the Mun-King\u0027s treasure out of his hands, and share it with the people of Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that time, the Kerbal Space Program was in dire straits, financially. Malachai seized this opportunity, and began a hostile takeover of KSP. When the dust had settled, the space program had become another division of Malachai Heavy Industries. He assured the public that nothing would change. And he was good as his word. An unmanned rover was sent to Duna, and the public was captivated. But Malachai refused to let his Mun-King theory go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When he shared his plan with his top scientists in a two-hour rant, they were skeptical, but used to this sort of thing. They sent out probes to the Mun, and discovered the previously theoretical chemical compound known as kethane lay just beneath the rocky crust. Realizing that kethane could fuel the entire space division, a huge drilling operation was launched. When questioned on the scale of operation, Malachai screamed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThink big! No matter the consequences!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 This design philosophy inspired the engineers. As for Malachai, there are many other kings out in space who hoard their riches, a fact that just does not sit well with him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T04:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Malachai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Malachai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince flags were announced for the upcoming update, I\u0027ve been thinking about logos and flags for my private space corporation, Malachai Heavy Industries (not the most creative name, but whatever).
