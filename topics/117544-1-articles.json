What\u0027s going on is that a Kerbal holding onto a ladder is considered \u0022flying\u0022, something that is commonly exploited to get extra science reports. And an object that is flying low enough in the atmosphere, below about 22 km on Kerbin, is liable to be deleted when it passes out of physics range which includes when you go back to the Space Centre screen. Recovering the ship the Kerbal was holding onto was irrelevant except that it takes you back to the space centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a bug \u003Cem\u003Eper se\u003C/em\u003E, it\u0027s an expected if unwanted consequence of how the game handles vessels in atmosphere outside physics range.
