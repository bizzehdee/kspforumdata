How do people do this in videos (ive seen plenty of people use BDArmory, or even stock unguided crap against a drone they werent controlling, and both were in mid air simultaneously). \n\nAnyways, is there some mod that lets you have a craft that say flies in a circle around KSP or something at a set altitude? And then you can engage it, or is there some other way to do it? How do they bypass the limitation that KSP deletes craft past 2.3km or so, as ive seen the vids show multiple craft flying around upwards of 20km away.\n\nFinally, is this just a DMP server or something (where each one is manned technically but flown by separate people), or is there an actual mod that allows such things as combat test drones to be flown around KSC as you get on its 6 and attempt to take it out?"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T05:18:24Z","Content":"Possibly mechjeb/ kOS.

It probably wouldn\u0027t fly right though (it would have to have SAS and probably a remote guidance unit).\n\n***EDIT: Oops, I skipped the beginning of the video.
