Heat is your new main enemy in this game when it comes to space-planes or so it seems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain thing seems to be to not go too fast in the 15-20 km altitude region. If your craft starts glowing, it\u0027s time to throttle back. Glowing is a prelude to exploding. Also, I\u0027ve found that I consume a lot more rocketfuel nowadays \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I am by no means an expert at this yet.
