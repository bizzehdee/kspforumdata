I stumbled on this years ago and can\u0027t find it anywhere now. A very deep discussion about behavior in adults vs. children came up recently and I remembered reading about this bit of musing by a famous psychiatrist. I \u0027thought\u0027 it was Carl Jung, but the most I can find from him about the subject is the \u0022Divine Child\u0022 (Peter Pan Syndrome) personality archetype and I seriously doubt that\u0027s what I was remembering. I also find nothing about him speculating on humanity\u0027s future. Does any of this ring a bell to anyone in or out of the field? Maybe I just credited it to the wrong person?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T00:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarl Jung didn\u0027t speculate about humanity\u0027s future.
