The problem is the value of the contracts you get depends a great deal on what technologies you\u0027ve chosen. I do find I have to be careful to pick technologies that will unlock lucrative contracts, because if you just focus on the techs you want you can find yourself grinding because you\u0027re getting mostly garbage contracts, i.e. testing a stack separator for 600, or long distance \u0022do a crew report at X altitude\u0022 before you have turbojets.

In many cases, grinding for funds is not an attractive solution. It often makes more sense to find ways to get around limitations than grind unprofitable contracts to pay for an upgrade. I then use the profits from those contracts to pay for the upgrade further down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good example is the Tracking Station. I learned how to perform regular flights to the Mun and Minmus and back without patched conics, because it was less of an inconvenience to do that than it was to try to find the money to buy the upgrade. Once I had access to Kerbin\u0027s moons, I could start spamming survey contracts from polar orbit.
