It was assembled around Laythe with 13 disctinct flight from Kerbin. \n\nPayloads\n\n- Space station core\n\n- Return vehicle\n\n- 6 Orange tanks\n\n- 1 RCS tank \u002B station Tug\n\n- 2 light SSTO landers (Bop \u002B POL)\n\n- 1 Laythe SSTO lander \u002B 1 Val SSTO lander\n\n- 1 SSTO Tylo lander \u002B Tug\n\n- 1 staged Tylo lander \u002B Tug\n\nI managed to get on each moon twice \u002B an additionnal flyby of each one for science. I only used 3 orange tanks and 1/3 of the RCS reserves. (PS : SSTO aren\u0027t planes and weight around 15T)\n\nSome tricks\n\n- BEWARE of part count. You can get a 200 parts into orbit without lag. but when you assemble them, you get a 400 part station than can lag. Mine had 900... I had to do some fixing by removing parts with KAS mod...\n\n- I recommend you create a station core you can extend. With the new Aero, you can\u0027t send to orbit very large structure anymore. \n\n- You need docking ports. prefer to have only one type so you can change where you put stuff. Don\u0027t cramp docking ports too close. \n\n- For the ship docking area, don\u0027t forget to light it so you can see easily where to go. Even day time isn\u0027t so bright... \n\n- Having a small tug to move stuff around isn\u0027t a bad idea. Prefer to have multiple docking rings on you parts (at least 2)\n\nIf you\u0027re going to put a station far away, test it around Kerbin first. Some test can even been done on launch pad (by preassemble them to see if parts fits).\n\nHere i (was) my space station (click to enlarge)\n\n[![f5faacc7-588f-4fed-9d20-424f28a030b2.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview2/f5faacc7-588f-4fed-9d20-424f28a030b2.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/f5faacc7-588f-4fed-9d20-424f28a030b2.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T11:50:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T12:18:29Z","Content":"I might be wrong but the stock Drill-o-matic (Advanced science tech) can mine ore from asteroids, which can be converted into fuel.\n\nSo basically find a suitable asteroid, lock onto it with your Clam-o-Tron (Actuators), haul the asteroid into orbit around kerbin, drill -\u003E hydrolysis -\u003E lots of fuel being produced in space.

This is a very good plot. But mining stuff is quite end-game, sadly. As you can create some fuel, it\u0027s efficient to orbit empty payload and refill. If you can\u0027t, I\u0027m not sure this is so usefull because you still have to launch the fuel.\n\nNow that I think, I\u0027ve some more insight\n\n- Always deactivate the engines of ships docked at the station. It\u0027s even better to shutdown them during the final docking approach (when you only use RCS). If you activate them by mistake you can break parts or change you fine tweacked orbit.\n\n- Don\u0027t forget it\u0027s quite hard to move a space station when assembled. My old station core didn\u0027t had any engines nor RCS.\n\n- If you build a station to go form below to higher orbit, it\u0027s best to put it as low as possible. If you build a station to go from higher orbit to higer orbit, it doesn\u0027t matter, higher orbit seems intuitive but you loose oberth effect (acceleration on high speed orbit is more efficient).\n\n- To go to a station, you have 2 separate phases : the rendez-vous and the docking. Rendez-vous is quite hard and technical. I fail to do the final close approach. Don\u0027t hesitate to use MechJeb. The final docking is easier an quite fun : you gently use RCS to close to the docking port. Some mods can help."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelvf","CreatedById":21146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T12:56:02Z","Content":"Yeah I actually did the tutorial on docking - took me at least 2-3 hours to get through it and succeed in the docking ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). From now on I use mechJeb for that. \n\nI think I will try to see if I can build some sort of center consisting of just a center module and docking ports and get that up first - Then go for some some exentions and THEN some large fuel tanks (Which is what I need). I guess fuel doesnt \u0022flow\u0022 through the entire station but that I have to dock somewhere close to the fuel to refuel?"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:20:51Z","Content":"Yes you can fill a tank with another tank anywhere in the station, even through decouplers. You don\u0027t have to dock near the fuel tank. \n\nAdvice put you tank on one side of the station and you ship docking ring on the other side. It\u0027s better to identify where to go. Beware or solar panels they don\u0027t respond well to accidents.\n\nFinally, if you can\u0027t move your station, you can turn/rotate it (slowly, though). Place it in a \u0022logic\u0022 position. I oriented my station top-down so I did know that the docking ship section was on the bottom and the fuel had to go in the middle."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelvf","CreatedById":21146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:23:37Z","Content":"Thanks for the advice again - Looking forward to launching big unwieldy constructions into orbit..."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:28:29Z","Content":"Consider setting your lights to different hues to help keep track of which port it is you\u0027re targeting."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:45:07Z","Content":"But don\u0027t add to much lights, it causing lag problems. Keep the station simple and minimal, but that\u0027s not always easy.\n\nTo reduce part number, you should avoir to do what I did : make most of the parts self propelled. It\u0027s better to let the orbiting stage to the approach of the station, then cut loos the payload and deorbit/terminate. The part left \u00C3\u0192\u00C2  100m of the station is a debris. Then get you station tug, dock to the debris/payload and dock it to the station. You part count should be lower. You may not be able to remove RCS package though or you\u0027ll have a hard time docking your debris/payload to the station.\n\nStations are fun and nice, even if they aren\u0027t that usefull.\n\nBut sometimes it can have some unexpected usage. After returning from my Jool mission, I wanted to use on of my landers to go to the Mun. I designed a quick and dirty orbit stage able to launch an unfuelled Vall lander to the space station to refuel and go to the Mun. I did that, went to the Mun and when I came back I noticed I had no chute on the lander (it was designed to go for Laythe space station to Vall). No sweat, I docked the lander to the station and used the return pod of the station to get back on the ground with Jeb and science."},{"CreatedByName":"plotz","CreatedById":140852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:59:24Z","Content":"I usually try to assemble my first station during a \u0022build a new manned station in orbit around Kerbin\u0022 and in 1.0.2 \u0022rendezvous...\u0022 or \u0022dock two vessels in orbit around Kerbin\u0022 missions. \n\nRequired tech:\n\n- RCS (not required for station core, but to attach future expansions)\n\n- Docking ports (resource transfer)\n\n- Electricity (solar panels to keep the station going)\n\n- The OCTO drone core is imho a good asset (gives you SAS to prevent rotation of the station)\n\nThat\u0027s the bare minimum for a working station.\n\nHints:\n\n- I like to start out with a small core (can be around 3-4t) that has at least 3 docking ports for expansion but as few parts as possible. \n\n- To reduce junk, separate your circularizing stage after the burn. If you include a probe core with that, you can crash it to Kerbin, adding chutes also allows for recovery and reusability. This prevents unnecessary debris (de-orbit) and reduces part count (separation of final stage). Later launches can be equipped with a single drone core BELOW the payload. So you only have to maintain a single one at the station (again: fewer parts).\n\n- Fuel supply can be ensured by bringing up e.g. a big orange tank later and refuelling it with Spaceplanes or couriers that are only docked temporarily.\n\n- More advanced designs may feature a few return capsules (one-off use) and a single transfer vehicle for Munar/Minmus missions (reusable). As this doesn\u0027t require any chutes, heat shields,... it can be much lighter.\n\nCore checklist:\n\nMust: \n\n- Batteries\n\n- Solar Panels (I use at least 4 of them, slightly angled in every direction to prevent blackouts). Alternately use a single solar sail\n\n- Docking ports\n\n- Antenna (for missions; nice 2 have if you want to EVA kerbals and do reports \u0022in space just above [biome]\u0022\n\n- Drone core\n\nNice to have:\n\n- Habitation or a lab for kerbals\n\n- RCS tanks (depending on the station\u0027s initial purpose)\n\n- Fuel tanks (depending on the station\u0027s initial purpose)\n\n- Return capsules\n\n- Lighting to illuminate the station and especially it\u0027s docking ports --\u003E easier docking\n\nIf you want me to, I can post one or two very easy and basic designs that are also quite lightweight, thus easy to get into orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"SpeedDaemon","CreatedById":38448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:42:28Z","Content":"Regarding altitude - keep time acceleration in mind. I like 130km, because 120km is the cutoff for 100x, which makes rendezvous faster (and for a useful station, you\u0027ll be doing that a LOT). It also gives you some room between the orbit and atmosphere so that you can lower your PE to catch up if you end up a little behind it.\n\nI would also recommend the Quantum Struts Continued or KAS (once it\u0027s updated for the current version) mods, which both allow strutting modules in place after docking them to reduce wet-noodlyness.\n\nKIS (Kerbal Inventory System) is also a good complement to a station, since it allows EVA Kerbals to add and remove parts (forget to add a solar panel or docking port? Just hand Bill a screwdriver and put him to work). It also allows you to keep an inventory of misc small parts like solar panels, science experiments, batteries, and stuff that allow you to fix minor oversights on other craft you launch.\n\nModular Fuel Tanks will let you add monoprop and xenon to LFO tanks, reducing part count.\n\nOther misc tips:\n\n- When launching large fuel tank modules, add fuel lines to burn the fuel in they payload tank during launch instead of trying to get a full large tank to orbit. You can always top it off later.\n\n- Overbuilding the orbital insertion stages of craft that are going to be docking to the station anyway, then transferring extra fuel to the station can be a good way to top off fuel depots without a bunch of boring \u0022milk runs.\u0022\n\n- Always have lights to illuminate your docking ports, because the Law of Inconvenient Rendezvous Timing states that \u0022You will always be docking in the dark.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokmonkey","CreatedById":9319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:02:47Z","Content":"As far as oribtal assembly goes, I changed from the \u0022oribtal tug\u0022 method, and instead I build my orbital stage, and then optimize RCS layout using the payload and orbiter together.

Then you can put RCS down on the end on the other side of the combined CoM. It also means the station bits might be able to do without RCS parts entirely (reduced part count!).\n\nLots of reaction wheels and MechJeb\u0027s PAR\u002B/- attitude hold can work, too."}]}
