It\u0027s even better to shutdown them during the final docking approach (when you only use RCS).

If you build a station to go from higher orbit to higer orbit, it doesn\u0027t matter, higher orbit seems intuitive but you loose oberth effect (acceleration on high speed orbit is more efficient).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To go to a station, you have 2 separate phases : the rendez-vous and the docking. Rendez-vous is quite hard and technical. I fail to do the final close approach. Don\u0027t hesitate to use MechJeb. The final docking is easier an quite fun : you gently use RCS to close to the docking port.

Keep the station simple and minimal, but that\u0027s not always easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reduce part number, you should avoir to do what I did : make most of the parts self propelled.

After returning from my Jool mission, I wanted to use on of my landers to go to the Mun. I designed a quick and dirty orbit stage able to launch an unfuelled Vall lander to the space station to refuel and go to the Mun. I did that, went to the Mun and when I came back I noticed I had no chute on the lander (it was designed to go for Laythe space station to Vall). No sweat, I docked the lander to the station and used the return pod of the station to get back on the ground with Jeb and science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"plotz","CreatedById":140852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually try to assemble my first station during a \u0022build a new manned station in orbit around Kerbin\u0022 and in 1.0.2 \u0022rendezvous...\u0022 or \u0022dock two vessels in orbit around Kerbin\u0022 missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequired tech:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RCS (not required for station core, but to attach future expansions)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Docking ports (resource transfer)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Electricity (solar panels to keep the station going)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The OCTO drone core is imho a good asset (gives you SAS to prevent rotation of the station)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the bare minimum for a working station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHints:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I like to start out with a small core (can be around 3-4t) that has at least 3 docking ports for expansion but as few parts as possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To reduce junk, separate your circularizing stage after the burn. If you include a probe core with that, you can crash it to Kerbin, adding chutes also allows for recovery and reusability. This prevents unnecessary debris (de-orbit) and reduces part count (separation of final stage). Later launches can be equipped with a single drone core BELOW the payload. So you only have to maintain a single one at the station (again: fewer parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fuel supply can be ensured by bringing up e.g. a big orange tank later and refuelling it with Spaceplanes or couriers that are only docked temporarily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More advanced designs may feature a few return capsules (one-off use) and a single transfer vehicle for Munar/Minmus missions (reusable).

I like 130km, because 120km is the cutoff for 100x, which makes rendezvous faster (and for a useful station, you\u0027ll be doing that a LOT).
