The question being, if I were to launch a space shuttle replica, would MJ know to roll over onto the shuttle\u0027s back so that the thrust is correct? Or will it just pitch over and let the shuttle fall back because the thrust is towards the ground and not the sky (inverted launch(shuttle on top))?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T21:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can set a \u0022force roll\u0022 option.

It\u0027s possible to force it to work, but it\u0027s more hassle than just flying it up yourself (and I say this as a Mechjeb fanboy). If you absolutely must use Mechjeb to do it, use the Surf setting and manually enter your heading and adjust it little by little as you climb.
