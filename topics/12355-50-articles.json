I target Duna, then use the maneuver planner to set a Hohmann transfer to target. I don\u0027t really care about this node -- it\u0027s basically just a placeholder for the eventual final transfer node. What it does, though, is provide a node in the future at roughly the proper time for a transfer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I fire up the helpful warp helper. I go to \u0022warp to next maneuver node\u0022... and set the lead time to be an hour. Then, warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I do two things. First, you DELETE the transfer node. You don\u0027t need or want it. Then, you launch into your desired orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in your desired Kerbin orbit, bring up the maneuver planner (make sure you\u0027re still targeting Duna or whatever planet you\u0027re transferring to), and set a new Hohmann transfer to target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVoila, your time to the node should be some number less than an hour. (For me, it\u0027s usually been about 45 minutes or so.) Which takes far less time to warp to at 50x. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is basically like using Protractor to wait until the theta is right; you\u0027re just letting MechJeb do all the work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hohmann transfer to target\u0022 doesn\u0027t work between planets, only between a planet and its moon? At least if I try to use a Hohmann transfer to get to, say, Dres (as I write this I have a probe warping its way to the transfer node in 90 days or so), MechJeb 2.0.7 reports \u0022not in same sphere of influence\u0022 (paraphrasing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the rest of this method is, in principal, correct... If you are able to launch your probe in a single launch. If you need to assemble your probe in orbit (like I do, I don\u0027t have heavy launch capability yet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E), then you can\u0027t warp your way from the pad. I guess now, as I am in a 300km parking orbit, it allows warp up to x100 (I think, might be x1000), but 90 days warping takes forever. Guess I could get my probe to plot the original 90 odd day plan, go to space centre, and then put something on the pad, set Kerbal Alarm Clock, warp, go back to my probe on the alarm, and have MechJeb replot the transfer... But, when I did this in the past, it plot the new transfer some distance in the future (even if I went back to the probe with an hour before the original plotted course), so I was never able to make this work. Very frustrating. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reported this previously in this thread, but it would be nice if the interplanetary transfers would use the same calculation used by Kerbal Alarm Clock; MechJeb doesn\u0027t agree with KAC, or Protractor, or \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E ...
