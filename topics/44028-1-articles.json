We\u0027re just not there yet. It might be a very low priority especially right now \u0027cause they\u0027re focusing really heavily on career mode stuffs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for sounds and things...I\u0027d like it if they implemented a customizable system just like chatterer into the game. That would be awesome. They could record their own radio chatter in backwards spanish and it would be awesome. Or just use real-life radio chatter and things like that as chatterer does \u0027cause that sounds great on its own. Either way, being able to customize the frequency of those things would be very important, I think \u0027cause some people just don\u0027t want to hear too much when they\u0027re playing a game. Others like the immersion Chatterer brings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to control panels and internal lights and things...I\u0022m not entirely sure what they\u0027ve got planned for that. I mean, we\u0027ve already got a lot of buttons and things to play with, though I admit that it\u0027d be nice to see action groups somewhere in command pod IVAs, among other things.
