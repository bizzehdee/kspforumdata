I have a constructed an interplanetary vessel in orbit, that will hopefully be capable of reaching Jool. It\u0027s held together by Clamp O Tron Sr\u0027s, apart from an attachment node thingy in the middle where there are four regular clamp O trons, in which I hope to add a small lander, a resource extraction system, and a couple of other bits and bobs. However, the vessel wobbles terribly when I try to move it, and this is without the extra things on it. Any help is appreciated, as I\u0027d like to get Jool done and over with, so I can restart my Career in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank\u0027s in advance,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelum\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-16T18:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy reflex answer is we need pics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, I\u0027ve had decent luck in reducing wobble with autostrut to grandparent\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stelum","CreatedById":166516,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-16T19:21:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh yes!
