If you enjoy managing the aspects of a Kerbal Space Program station but wish there was more to it such as... Building a custom crew, doing SCIENCE!!! Controling the atmosphere on the station, making sure your crew is healthy, this is for you. I\u0027m curious though, does anyone else out there play? Willing to share their tips and tricks and secerts as I\u0027m still learning to play.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-11T12:47:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2013 12:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 7499275\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
