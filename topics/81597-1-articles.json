When staging solid boosters (from the RT-10 to the S1 SRB) I always include a few sepatrons to get a nice and clean staging, but it seems that since the latest update the ejection force is higher and it also looks like a rotational force is introduced. Especially the rotation is a nuicance as sometimes it makes the sepatrons push the boosters into the core.
