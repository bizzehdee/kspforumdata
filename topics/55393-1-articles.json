This makes perfect sense. I am unsure, however, if this applies to things like bacteria, or only macroscopic extraterrestrials. Perhaps, if a planet is capable of sustaining a microbiome, like Kerbin and (possibly) Laythe, would have a hidden map of the integrity of the microbiome. so, if you land a craft or EVA that is not properly sterilized, it would damage the integrity of the microbiome in that area, which would do little besides lowering the value of microbial experiments and, perhaps, surface samples. The microbiome would repair itself after a while, but it would take some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
