Using performance CPU governor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame runs at 30-80% of nominal speed even in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (Time control mod readout), depending on amount of visible terrain and (obviously) by quantity of parts in physics bubble. But it never reaches 100% even in ideal conditions (minimum partcount ship in space, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E scene without flights.

Changing scenes or loading a save does not revert this once it happens. No events reported in console when it happens. I once thought \u0022Increased PQ Cache\u0022 messages may be related, but it happened without them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis event seems to have some affinity to a point near splashdown, but may also happen at any time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the game is perfectly capable of running smooth, but it does not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there some way to see resource usage by tasks inside KSP?

My graphics card got very hot when i started playing because the fans took a while to spin up. This meant that the performance was throttled back to prevent over heating. After a few minutes though the fans got fast enough to cool it down and everything went back to normal. Maybe you could have a similar problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-05T19:19:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt it. Fan reaction time on my laptop is pretty short, recent cleaning dropped operational temperatures pretty significantly, but the issue was unaffected.
