Stop the burn when your Ap is at the target orbit height as seen in Map View.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Now... your ejection angle will be wrong, as expected, because your burn was not instant. So now use an onscreen protractor to measure how much. This will save you a lot or trial/error/quickload. To be clear, the angle you are measuring here is between your escape trajectory, and the orbital path of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Quickload. Now do the burn again factoring in the error. So lets say you measure about 8 degrees, and this is a Duna burn from 100Kn up, that is stated as 150.91 degrees. You should now do the burn earlier at 158.91 degrees instead. Note that you probably will not be 100% correct still, but whatever error you have now will probably be less than a degree, just guess it for the next attempt... or get the onscreen protractor out again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a given craft, orbit altitude, and target planet, the above only needs to be done once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
