Given that 3D printing is fast becoming more affordable, I\u0027d like to know if there\u0027s a legally OK/SQUAD approved set of files for such that I could hand to someone with a 3D printer and ask \u0027em to tun out the figures in green plastic for me? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEsme\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T23:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have a shapeways store, and there\u0027s quite a few models already on thingiverse if you want to print your own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Esme","CreatedById":107436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T16:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAye but the Shapeways models are far too large for what I want, and I wanted to be sure that if produced from anywhere else that they\u0027re legally OK to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T07:11:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d really like to see is bags or tubs of little plastic kerbalnauts--somewhere around the size, quality, and (ideally) price of the classic \u0022little green army men.\u0022 Or, y\u0027know, somewhat higher quality (and price); that\u0027d be good too.
