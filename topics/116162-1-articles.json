My issue now is the following... If you check the MB page you see that I have the option to install 8GB of DDR2 or 4GB of DDR3 so for this price I have the option to use 4GB of DDR3-1066 or 8GB of DDR2-800.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy indecision is obviously about higher bandwidth with lower capacity vs lower bandwidth and higher capacity. I also posted this question on one of FB\u0027s KSP pages and people seem to prefer 8GB of DDR2 and pointed me to this\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/dWgzA2C61z4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003EI totally forgot about.\u003Cp\u003ESo what is your opinion? 4GB clocking at 8533MB/s or 8GB with just 6400MB/s?

Especially if you use mods you should take 8 GB. If you have only 4 GB operating system and other softwares take something and KSP is not able to use maximum amount of 32 bit program (practically about 3.8 GB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend also Linux and 64 bit KSP if you want to use many mods, especially graphical ones.
