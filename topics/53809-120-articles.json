If your computer is overheating, I\u0027d suggest that you look into your thermal design. I assume you built your rig? You need to look at the specs for the processor, get the thermal wattage at full power, and use that as the basis for your cooling design. Your heatsink is probably undersized if you are worried about killing your CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note: CPUs have thermal protection in them. They will automatically shutdown once they cross a certain threshold.

When I encode video my processor will run at 100% for 4hrs straight, never missing a beat. Also, the reason rbray kept indicating his first post is that it explains the first run through will potentially take a very long time. It also states that it may crash a couple times. By way of example; my first three or four loads crashed. The final one took about 1.5 hours.
