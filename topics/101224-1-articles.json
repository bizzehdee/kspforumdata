I know that MechJeb does something like this for active vessels, but the issue that I imagine an inactive-vessel mover would have is the \u0022in-between\u0022 stuff -- either the vehicle has to be poofed to its destination (maybe with some time delay) or it needs to find and follow a good path between A and B (and refuse to budge if it can\u0027t). The latter is less impossible in KSP than in the real world, as the environment is almost completely known, but even so, I don\u0027t think pathfinding is possible in general without human intervention (and peeking at MechJeb\u0027s rover autopilot code, it seems to me that it\u0027s basically a waypoint follower, depending on the user to set the path and monitor the situation for problems).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo poofing will probably be required, but what would be the difference between that and HyperEdit? I think something like ESLD Jump Beacons is the answer -- require an investment in some infrastructure (e.g. a vessel with a beacon at the destination) and place limitations on how the transfer can happen (e.g. limit distance based on beacon type, limit to areas with low ground slope). The Hangar mod offers what I think is the best kind of infrastructure to handle this stuff, so I\u0027ve asked allista about it, but if allista\u0027s not interested in bringing it into Hangar, I might just make it a standalone addon myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T04:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about strapping some rockets on it and put it on ballistic orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T04:28:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027s even possible.

Some mods change the loading distance, but only by a small amount. A 100km loading distance is probably not going to be doable because of how the main stock game itself works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big reason there has to be a loading distance limit is because of how floating point numbers in computers store values. Small values near zero can be very precise, but the farther you get from zero the less precise they become. Trying to track the position of two ships that are fully operational with all the physics interactions going, that are located far apart from each other, means that they can\u0027t both be using small numbers. At least one of the ships has to be performing its position and velocity calculations using imprecise larger magnitude floating point numbers. The SQUAD devs found that when they tried to run the part versus part interactions (detecting collisions) on parts using numbers that big which cannot be precise, the system kept miscalculating the magnitude of their interactions due to the impossibility of storing their positions accurately with those big floating point numbers. Thus the parts kept being calculated as having \u0022collided\u0022 with each other and your ship would explode very unfairly for no apparent reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what everyone\u0027s talking about with the \u0022space Kraken\u0022 - its the mysterious monster that explodes your craft if you stray to far away from the origin of the frame of reference of the mathematics of your universe. SQUAD fixed it by recentering the universe origin to always be near your craft, not on the sun as was originally designed. But if there\u0027s two different vessels both loaded that are not near each other, then you can\u0027t have them BOTH be near the center of the universe, thus the loading limit being so small by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s problem 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith rovers specifically, there\u0027s a second problem - terrain polygons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are near the ground you see the terrain as being made up of polygons in a giant surface mesh. Each polygon being about 3 to 10 meters across (depending on your graphics detail settings). Now, imagine viewing the surface from space, high up - seeing entire continents in view. Try calculating how many polygons that is if each one is only covering 10 x 10 meters. Even a very modern high end graphics card would be choking to death on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore terrain that is far away from the camera isn\u0027t *really* there - in the sense that those polygons aren\u0027t loaded. What you\u0027re looking at once the terrain is far from the camera is essentially a hologram with no physics on it *that objects would just pass right through*, made up of a proprietary mathematical heightmap algorithm SQUAD has for each planet. When you get closer to the ground, KSP takes sample points from that math algorithm and uses then to create the ground polygons based on calculating where the vertexes should be in the heightmap. When you leave the area, those polygons go away again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ground only really exists within about 7km of the camera. Those mountains off in the distance? They\u0027re not really there. They\u0027re holograms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s a second problem with driving a rover that\u0027s 100km away from the camera. Not only is the rover itself not loaded, but even if it was, the ground on which it\u0027s sitting isn\u0027t loaded.
