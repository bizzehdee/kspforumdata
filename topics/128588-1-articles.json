One sale price, for the whole two weeks, on every sale item. This makes choosing a time to buy a little easier, but also makes searching for good deals harder - because the search functionality leaves a lot to be desired. And with more than 10,000 sale items just looking for random good deals is darn near worthless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, we need to make suggestions to help each other out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll start:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is again 40% off ($24)\u003Cbr\u003E\nTerraria is $3.40.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll the Lego games are on sale too.
