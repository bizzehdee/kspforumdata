In multiplayer, I can see a bigger case for warfare, since battling vehicles you\u0027ve designed yourself would be fun, though part of the challenge of a KSP battle would be how unfit-for-purpose the hardware is and dedicated military mods may detract from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The current situation is ideal, at least for single player - a civilian space program, where it is in the hands of the player to decide whether they want to build an F-15 with an A-SAT missile to remove outdated communication satellites, or just de-orbit them with a small probe or onboard engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EI\u0027d also make a distinction somewhere between \u0022weapons\u0022 that exist purely to destroy automated equipment, and ones that pose a risk to Kerbalkind, but I can\u0027t think of a way to fit that into everything else I\u0027ve written.
