If you plug in your mouse and keyboard and they are not working at all, you need to ensure the mouse and keyboard are plugged in prior to starting the title. If the mouse and keyboard are plugged in or unplugged while the title is running, they will not work again until the system is restarted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving forward, If the default controller preset isn\u0027t quite comfortable for you, there are three different presets that players are able to switch between at any time during play: Simplified, Cursor, and Radial. You have the ability to choose the controller preset that fits your playstyle the most, and you can switch them at any time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can read the specifics about each preset here:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/168797684564/kerbal-space-program-enhanced-edition-new\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/168797684564/kerbal-space-program-enhanced-edition-new\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I have already raised this to the team and hopefully, they would be able to fully implement the use of the keyboard and mouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, I have no ETA on this or have any visuals of the progress that the team has made on this feature.
