The look on Jeb\u0027s face, of course, helps this feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought I\u0027d share in my delight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ojtSg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJust over 4000km flown.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-12T23:54:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2013 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by gslarmour\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T23:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know that feeling well.

Just now I managed to get my Moho transfer stage into orbit, with 300 deltaV to spare. Sounds like alot, but when I want the droptanks to stay on I can\u0027t rely on Mechjeb to calculate deltaV for me. So it was a frustrating mess of constandly almost getting it, than trying again, than throwing the 3th Kerbal out of the cockpit, than repeat the same thing. Over and over and over. Next on the list: 5 launches to refuel the damn thing. Than dock it to the lander. Than send up the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
