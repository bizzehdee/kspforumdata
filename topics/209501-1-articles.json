Which of the four buttons in the top-left is highlighted when you select a part to add to the craft? Can you actually attach the parts OK or is there something preventing that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my brief testing in KSP 1.12.3 with no mods, selecting any part from the list will automatically set it to \u0022place\u0022 mode and set the symmetry mode to \u0022parent\u0022, while in many cases it seems to play the click sound twice with a very short delay between the two clicks. I\u0027ve noticed this apparent double click in heavily modded copies of the game where it can take a couple of seconds between clicking the part and the part actually appearing, it\u0027s completely harmless and you can safely ignore it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
