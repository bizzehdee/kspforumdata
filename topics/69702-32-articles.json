Or is this mod dependent on changing planet terrains and the size of the solar system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I have no desire to change the soundtrack of the game and see many mentions of removing this to save memory. But I don\u0027t see any kind of soundtrack editor in the download pack either. What am I looking for exactly ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-02T03:39:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2014 03:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T03:40:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hevak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hevak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi. This mod looks interesting and I\u0027m thinking of giving it a try. I am very thankful for all the hard work modders do, but I really wish you would explain more why I am installing certain mods with this pack. And if and why things could be excluded. \u003Cp\u003EParticularly I\u0027m curious as to why I need kittopiatech ingame terraforming editor installed? What is it doing and is it possible to remove and what would be affected? It seems like something for me to change the physical structure and terrain of planets which I really have no desire to do. I want all planets to be the same as stock except with the visual eye candy, no terrain changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext why the need to have RSS? I have no desire to play with a life size real world analogue solar system. I really don\u0027t want to have missions take longer than they already do in game. I\u0027m just fine with the size of the original kerbal system as it is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is it possible to simply have a better looking stock game with the standard planet terrains and positions with this mod? Or is this mod dependent on changing planet terrains and the size of the solar system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKittopiatech is for the sun particles and Jool\u0027s rings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERSS is ONLY to change the atmosphere and sunlight color. It does NOT re-size the planets, it just removes the ugly white of the atmosphere to make it more beautiful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
