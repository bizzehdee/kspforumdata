When I follow the link provided in the confirmation email and enter my order #, it says \u0022order not found.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, right now, I\u0027ve been charged 40 bucks for nothing. If I want to play the game, I apparently have to risk losing another $40, and it will probably error again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI submitted a request to technical support, but something tells me this is going to take a while to resolve.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHas anyone else had this problem? What else can I do?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNgl, I\u0027m more than a little liquided. Sitting here looking at my bank account, and at my Kerbal account, and the latter claims I never made a purchase while the former says I\u0027ve been charged. If tech support doesn\u0027t give me back my money or provide me with a download, I\u0027ll take this to the fraud department at my bank.
