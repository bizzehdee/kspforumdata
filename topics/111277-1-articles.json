At the moment, you\u0027ve got a Mun TWR of 9.202...far above what you really need. You\u0027d benefit in many, many, MANY different ways by swapping out those Thuds for something else. Hell, a Terrier would give you the thrust you need easily. Scale it down from 24 tonnes with 3 Thuds to a single Terrier; your new mass becomes 21.8 tonnes, your Isp increases to 345, your Mun TWR is 1.689 - and you suddenly have 2700 m/s of delta-V. Your cross section decreases in the process - and you\u0027re a lot less draggy as a result. 2700 is a bit low for a Mun transfer, landing, launch and return but it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid the math on a trio of Sparks; the mass savings isn\u0027t worth it in this case on account of the lower Isp of Sparks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then you go through Temstar\u0027s asparagus design process for 21.8 tonnes; 15% payload fraction, so assume your rocket will have a final mass of around 145 tonnes. 1.5 launch TWR these days - you want in the ballpark of 2131.5 kN of thrust at launch. 22% of that in the core = 468.93 kN; you want a Skipper in the core. The rest distributed to six boosters = 277.095 kN - Skippers, or to eight boosters = 207.82 - \u003Cstrong\u003EReliants\u003C/strong\u003E. Let\u0027s say you go with eight Reliants and a Skipper - you have 13 tonnes of engines and 21.8 tonnes of payload... leaving 110.2 tonnes, which works out to a little over 12 tonnes per stack. In the center, use a X200-16 and X200-8 tank with the Skipper. For the boosters, try two FL-T800s and one FL-T400 per stack.

I\u0027ve found that the addition of the nosecones and fins usually lowers things down to the 3500 regime though, so it\u0027s still a valid method of building good asparagus. The only problems with 1.0.x asparagus is A) asparagus staging is generally more costly unless you play with a mod like StageRecovery (which is awesome, BTW) and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E you have to be careful to keep things to where most of the mass stays closer to the nose, or you\u0027re going to tumble out of control.

So at 24 tonnes, you need 39.12 kN of thrust for a 1.0 Munar TWR, 58.68 kN for a 1.5 Munar TWR. That\u0027s really all the more thrust you need this thing to have. At the moment, you\u0027ve got a Mun TWR of 9.202...far above what you really need. You\u0027d benefit in many, many, MANY different ways by swapping out those Thuds for something else. Hell, a Terrier would give you the thrust you need easily. Scale it down from 24 tonnes with 3 Thuds to a single Terrier; your new mass becomes 21.8 tonnes, your Isp increases to 345, your Mun TWR is 1.689 - and you suddenly have 2700 m/s of delta-V. Your cross section decreases in the process - and you\u0027re a lot less draggy as a result. 2700 is a bit low for a Mun transfer, landing, launch and return but it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E doable.\u003Cp\u003EDid the math on a trio of Sparks; the mass savings isn\u0027t worth it in this case on account of the lower Isp of Sparks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then you go through Temstar\u0027s asparagus design process for 21.8 tonnes; 15% payload fraction, so assume your rocket will have a final mass of around 145 tonnes. 1.5 launch TWR these days - you want in the ballpark of 2131.5 kN of thrust at launch. 22% of that in the core = 468.93 kN; you want a Skipper in the core. The rest distributed to six boosters = 277.095 kN - Skippers, or to eight boosters = 207.82 - \u003Cstrong\u003EReliants\u003C/strong\u003E. Let\u0027s say you go with eight Reliants and a Skipper - you have 13 tonnes of engines and 21.8 tonnes of payload... leaving 110.2 tonnes, which works out to a little over 12 tonnes per stack. In the center, use a X200-16 and X200-8 tank with the Skipper. For the boosters, try two FL-T800s and one FL-T400 per stack. Adjust the thrust of the boosters as necessary to give you your ~1.5 with each stage. Take any mass saved by my rounding errors here and use it for nosecones, fins, adapters and decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, Temstar\u0027s method was for KSP 0.20, and produced a rocket with 4500 m/s of delta-V as a rule. I\u0027ve found that the addition of the nosecones and fins usually lowers things down to the 3500 regime though, so it\u0027s still a valid method of building good asparagus.

It has earned me thousands of science points by surface samples etc. with no trouble. When returning from Minmus I can even retro-burn for ~1k m/s upon aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower stages are simple - Mainsail*1, Skipper*1, Poddle*1 (Rockomax has a great product line!), finally 909*1 (the lander, tanks in 4-way symmetry)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enkiel","CreatedById":145063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T00:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think i can say i\u0027ve reach much better efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my new one ; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i88.photobucket.com/albums/k189/ankhiel/Kerbal/220200_screenshots_2015-05-31_00002_zps5wwodk82.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022220200_screenshots_2015-05-31_00002_zps5wwodk82.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8000 delta V, 213t and 79k $.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecompared to my old one ; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8550 delta V, 378t and 133k $\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far i landed on the mun without any issue, and did a pass by on minmus.
