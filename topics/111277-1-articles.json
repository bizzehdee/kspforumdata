At the moment, you\u0027ve got a Mun TWR of 9.202...far above what you really need. You\u0027d benefit in many, many, MANY different ways by swapping out those Thuds for something else. Hell, a Terrier would give you the thrust you need easily. Scale it down from 24 tonnes with 3 Thuds to a single Terrier; your new mass becomes 21.8 tonnes, your Isp increases to 345, your Mun TWR is 1.689 - and you suddenly have 2700 m/s of delta-V.

The rest distributed to six boosters = 277.095 kN - Skippers, or to eight boosters = 207.82 - **Reliants**. Let\u0027s say you go with eight Reliants and a Skipper - you have 13 tonnes of engines and 21.8 tonnes of payload... leaving 110.2 tonnes, which works out to a little over 12 tonnes per stack. In the center, use a X200-16 and X200-8 tank with the Skipper. For the boosters, try two FL-T800s and one FL-T400 per stack. Adjust the thrust of the boosters as necessary to give you your ~1.5 with each stage. Take any mass saved by my rounding errors here and use it for nosecones, fins, adapters and decouplers.\n\nYes, Temstar\u0027s method was for KSP 0.20, and produced a rocket with 4500 m/s of delta-V as a rule. I\u0027ve found that the addition of the nosecones and fins usually lowers things down to the 3500 regime though, so it\u0027s still a valid method of building good asparagus. The only problems with 1.0.x asparagus is A) asparagus staging is generally more costly unless you play with a mod like StageRecovery (which is awesome, BTW) and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) you have to be careful to keep things to where most of the mass stays closer to the nose, or you\u0027re going to tumble out of control. I usually achieve this these days by keeping the core stage up higher than the boosters as much as I possibly can; that way by the time you\u0027re flying on the core alone the drag is too low to flip you around.\n\nStart with those design changes and see what happens to your craft.

I know that real one had it, but i dunno, seems like it was good at first, now, i\u0027m less inclined to use them. I\u0027ll try the Skipper in the middle to see what it does with my middle tank... should that one be running during the aspartagus stages?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Here is a quick version of the ship. The price is a bit under 100,000 funds.\n\u003E [http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/example_ship.jpeg](http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/example_ship.jpeg)\n\u003E \n\u003E The design principle was \u0022don\u0027t touch the payload\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E You were apparently using the Thuds for landing at Kerbin, as a single parachute isn\u0027t enough for a safe landing. It\u0027s more efficient to use Terriers instead of Thuds, and replace the nosecones of the engine nacelles with parachutes. It also turned out that you get more delta-v from the entire rocket with two engine nacelles instead of three, so I removed one of them. Finally I removed the unnecessary monopropellant from the pod.\n\u003E \n\u003E The launch vehicle is a simple 2.5-stage rocket. The upper/transfer stage uses a Poodle, the lower stage uses a Skipper, and the boosters use Mainsails. The adapter/nosecone combinations look ugly, but they generate less drag than 2.5 m nosecones.\n\nWow, that\u0027s kind of what i\u0027m thinking... maybe i\u0027m overdoing this and just end up weighting more and adding more power to compensate? I\u0027m trying to find the middle between single craft that just goes in the air, and big thing that is too big for its own good.\n\nI really like the simple design of this ship, but its a case of \u0022i\u0027m scared to flip it\u0022...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nEDIT : \n\ni just tested, and the poodle is too long for the current legs i have....\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nEDIT 2 : \n\nwith the poodle tho, i\u0027m down to 16 t, after removing the hitchhiker and the side tank replaced with a x-200 that gives me the same delta V."},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T01:46:31Z","Content":"You\u0027re definitely using Skippers in the lower stages -- your craft size is 380T, 9 skippers provide 5850 kN of thrust for a TWR of about 1.5 or so.\n\nAnd yes, you can drop the first two stages (for 5 orange tanks) and still have enough delta-V. In fact, you can drop the first two stages, make it to the Mun, land, get back into orbit, transfer to Minmus, land there, and then get back to Kerbin.\n\nUse this delta-V map: [http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png](http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png) (the only difference is that now, you only need ~3500 m/s to get into orbit instead of 4500 m/s).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T01:48:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Enkiel","CreatedById":145063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T02:24:05Z","Content":"oh yeah, i always have it in hands... i think its a bit on the \u0022too close\u0022 range, but gives a good idea....\n\nfor the record, i tried the same setup with skipper, and didnt improve anything.
