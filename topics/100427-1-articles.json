The clock starts ticking the moment they are built.\n\n- RTGs cannot be reloaded or serviced. The radioisotopes are often fused in ceramics and structurally integrated in the generators.\n\n- RTGs provide power which decays exponentially with the half-life of their radioisotopes and the degradation of their electrical components.\n\nVarious posts covering the modification of RTGs within the MKS/OKS mod have led to the need to separate those discussions from the main MKS/OKS dev and release threads.\n\nA quick recaps follows:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, on the consumable RTG conversion, I wonder if there should be a separate thread for that alone, but RD did say he would handle it.\n\u003E I don\u0027t know how long it takes, as I\u0027ve never been there, but I do know that Eeloo was mentioned. I think that that would be a good benchmark. A probe equipped with one RTG should be able to just make it too Eeloo and send back some data with energy from it\u0027s RTG. I also don\u0027t know how these things work in real life, but if it could be set to not \u0022start reacting\u0022 or what ever, so that they can be \u0022fired in sequence\u0022, that would greatly increase their effectiveness again. I just feel like it would make them a little broken again. If it were possible in real life, I wouldn\u0027t have anything to say about it, but if not, I\u0027d rather not see this feature. I feel like if you want an RTG to reliably last longer then a voyage to Eeloo; then you need to build it closer to Eeloo (we should all be using EL here...)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s not how RTG\u0027s work. Unlike a nuclear reactor where the release of energy is triggered by neutrons hitting nuclei, and can be throttled by inserting/removing control rods that absorb neutrons, RTG\u0027s rely on nuclear decay which is a purely random process internal to the nucleus. Half of the nuclei in a sample of Pu-238 will decay in every 87.7 year period. Half of the nuclei in a sample of strontium-90 will decay in 28.8 years. There\u0027s no starter. There\u0027s no throttle. They\u0027re less controllable than SRB\u0027s -- SRB\u0027s don\u0027t have an off switch. RTG\u0027s don\u0027t even have an on switch. There\u0027s no point in carrying a can of Pu-238 or Sr-90 with you to refuel, as it will decay at the same rate -- just bring 2 RTG\u0027s.\n\u003E IMHO a physically plausible RTG factory module would involve a nuclear reactor (which could also provide power/heat/etc.) and an immediately adjacent chemical reprocessing module or three that would generate RTG\u0027s, xenon, and other products.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just for the record, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are still up and running with their RTGs, after nearly 40 years out there... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E It\u0027s not just a question of \u0022depleting\u0022 the RTG, it\u0027s that the output from it goes down exponentially, faster at first and then slower. There is also metallurgical issues with the thermocouples, but a simple exponential curve would do... 1/2 the power output every 400 days, for example. That means your deep space probe can still do stuff, just not all at once or you need batteries to cope with higher loads (this is what New Horizon has done, the RTG provides baseload power, high power capacitors provide power for peak transient loads).\n\u003E \n\u003E A quick module keeping track of RTG initialization game time and calculate the power at current time could easily set the proper energy output from the RTG. Americum 241 is the best candidate for realworld replacement of Plutonium 238 (which is getting scarce) but it has a quite a long halflife. For gaming purposes, the best realworld candidate is Polonium 210 (of [Litvinenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko) fame...), with a halflife of 138 *days*.\n\u003E \n\u003E [Some reading material.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator#241Am) \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, I wouldn\u0027t use EnrichedUranium in an RTG, the most appropriate in-game resource would be DepletedUranium, if you want to stick to MKS/OKS resources, or Actinides, if you come from the KSPIverse... So if you build a probe using an EL launchpad, you could always use up the DepletedUranium in your PDUs to fuel the probe\u0027s RTGs. However, the proper way would be, to stay coherant with MKS/OKS resource flow, would be to separate ***ThermalIsotopes*** from *DepletedUranium* in the *Lab module*. Then you could put fresh ThermalIsotopes in your RTG, and the moment you hit the \u0022Activate\u0022 switch, the clock of power decay would start. To provide easy feedback on how much power the RTG can put out, deplete the ThermalIsotopes exponentially and calculate the power output linearly based on the level of resource left.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A half-life of 900-1200 days would be about right for KSP with a standard sized solar system. For the various 6.4x and 3.2x sizes, you might need something more in the 2500-3500 day range.\n\u003E Optimal transfer from Kerbin to Eeloo is 4y 184d of transit time. Jool is about 3y 263d of transit time.\n\u003E \n\u003E 4y 184d is almost 1900 days.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I propose the fuel for RTGs should be \u0022***Eeloonium***\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Removes any \u0022real-world\u0022 discrepancies from actual physical properties of existing isotopes for obsessive-compulsive people (like me ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)), yet serves a clear purpose without falling in the way too complex situation of having the full periodic table of the elements in our resource manager display. We have Karborundum and Karbonite after all... \n\u003E In other news, I\u0027m thinking of writing a Kerbalized periodic table of the elements. Would be hillarious to see what Kerbals have to say about Francium.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve already been fiddling with adding conversions to the OKS/MKS Lab modules to process the DepletedUranium to extract [RareMetals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesis_of_precious_metals) from the EnrichedUranium/Recyclables path the lab\u0027s reprocessing function provides. Xenon gas is already removed at the reactor source by internal filters. So if we can have a consensus on fueling RTGs with Eeloonium (or Whateverium), I can integrate it in the revised lab reprocessing I\u0027ve been working on...\n\u003E \n\u003E As it stands right now:\n\u003E \n\u003E  - The Lab\u0027s Centrifuge function takes Uraninite and turns it into EnrichedUranium plus some Recyclables. \n\u003E \n\u003E  - EnrichedUranium goes into the MKS/OKS PDUs and undergoes fission. Fission yields XenonGas and DepletedUranium.\n\u003E \n\u003E  - DepletedUranium goes back in the lab and the Breeder conversion turns that back in half EnrichedUranium / Recyclables. \n\u003E \n\u003E All we need to do to produce RTG-specific isotopes is tweak the RecipeInputs and RecipeOutputs so that now the Breeder does this:\n\u003E \n\u003E  \\* DepletedUranium \u002B (copious amounts of ) Water \u002B Chemicals -\u003E Breeder -\u003E [EnrichedUranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUREX) \u002B [RareMetals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesis_of_precious_metals) \u002B Eeloonium \u002B [WasteWater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoremediation).\n\u003E \n\u003E Explanation: The DepletedUranium is our proxy for the depleted nuclear fuel, with fission products. The water needed is to keep things cool, along with the chemicals needed to perform the extraction of the various isotopes from the waste. You end up with EnrichedUranium and Eeloonium (my proposed one-size-fits-all fictitious thermal radioisotope) from the [PUREX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUREX) method of Uranium / Plutonium extraction from spent fuel, along with some precious and rare metals. You also have tons of waste water to treat, but fear not, the existing Aeroponics module can grow plants to [absorb and sequester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoremediation) the dangerous radioactive and heavy metals with the existing Purify function."},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T14:13:58Z","Content":"Due to reliance on USI parts for this process, perhaps this should be made as an \u0022extension\u0022 to the USI mods?

There used to be this special \u0022MEP\u0022 type resource. There were three actually. They represented the specialized machinery that would be required to actually make each module serve a different function, the idea being that each module starts out as an identical shell with different decals. You needed one or two different types I think, in certain modules, some didn\u0027t need it, and the amounts were really low, but it had to be there to make the module function. \n\nSomewhat unrelated, but similar. I never got around to messing with EL and MKS together back then, so I don\u0027t remember how that worked, but I assume you would have to go fully closed loop, produce the MEP required, and fill on site after building with EL. The same would be the procedure here, except it would be \u0022refining\u0022 or what ever the correct verb for making radioisotopes is, rather then MEP production line.\n\nEDIT: If an EL can fill any tank, couldn\u0027t we just give the RTGs a none pump-able tank/make Eeloonium none pump-able? That way if a user is playing with EL and builds a vessel with EL, we could generate a warning somewhere to remind him to fill his RTGs.\n\nEDIT2: I just realized, doesn\u0027t this understanding of how an RTG functions preclude the the way the PDU actually functions in-game? It is described as a large RTG and a large Battery.
