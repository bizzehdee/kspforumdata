Unlike a nuclear reactor where the release of energy is triggered by neutrons hitting nuclei, and can be throttled by inserting/removing control rods that absorb neutrons, RTG\u0027s rely on nuclear decay which is a purely random process internal to the nucleus. Half of the nuclei in a sample of Pu-238 will decay in every 87.7 year period. Half of the nuclei in a sample of strontium-90 will decay in 28.8 years. There\u0027s no starter. There\u0027s no throttle. They\u0027re less controllable than SRB\u0027s -- SRB\u0027s don\u0027t have an off switch. RTG\u0027s don\u0027t even have an on switch. There\u0027s no point in carrying a can of Pu-238 or Sr-90 with you to refuel, as it will decay at the same rate -- just bring 2 RTG\u0027s.\u003Cp\u003EIMHO a physically plausible RTG factory module would involve a nuclear reactor (which could also provide power/heat/etc.) and an immediately adjacent chemical reprocessing module or three that would generate RTG\u0027s, xenon, and other products.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cairan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cairan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust for the record, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are still up and running with their RTGs, after nearly 40 years out there... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just a question of \u0022depleting\u0022 the RTG, it\u0027s that the output from it goes down exponentially, faster at first and then slower.
