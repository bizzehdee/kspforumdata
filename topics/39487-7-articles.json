I think it was with Mu and he said that he had some pretty significant part count-based improvements, and I think he said that RAM usage was improved too. A few weeks later C7 said that some of that might not make it into 0.22.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat release thread is the only source that I\u0027m aware of for the change log. It doesn\u0027t mention performance improvements, so I wasn\u0027t surprised when I saw that 0.22 was about the same as 0.21.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scene change and SOI transition improvements are nice, but those are really bug fixes; they just got us back to where we were before the 0.21.1 patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the touchscreen, drag is definitely an issue. I think different devices have different methods for implementing the grab-and-hold function, but they don\u0027t all work very well. For the Surface it\u0027s pretty easy to, for instance, resize a window on the desktop, or move an icon around. But KSP doesn\u0027t seem to recognize this function very well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Surface Pro has a really nifty stylus though. It can be recognized from about an inch above the screen. So for KSP you can touch the screen to select a part, lift the stylus up a little, drag the part to where you want it, and touch the screen again to release (it sounds a little odd when I type it out, but it works really well). Precise placement is a little tricky, but otherwise the VAB is well suited to touch. The real problem is the camera, it doesn\u0027t seem to recognize any scrolling gestures so the camera is basically fixed in place without a keyboard. Alt-click is also an issue, but that could be fixed with a simple button alongside the symmetry and snap-to buttons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour plugin works pretty well for flight though. The screen recognizes a long touch as a right click (though I think this can be changed), so it\u0027s a little tricky to continually hold on a button, but otherwise it\u0027s ok.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T19:49:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@DMagic: Thanks for the feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is what I was worried about on the drag issue, I\u0027m thinking I\u0027ll need to add an \u0022edit last piece\u0022 window that allows you to move it around somehow, but that is going to be a pain to code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the long-touch = right click, that\u0027s new.

These are interesting results. If you look at the comparison on the first page you\u0027ll see that your CPU performs much lower than other AMD CPUs at the beginning of the test, but then jumps ahead of them later on. I would say that being GPU limited could cause this, but that doesn\u0027t seem to be the case.

You can see how uneven KSPs performance is, and it gets much worse at relatively high framerates. But those really slow frames seem consistent throughout the run, I\u0027ve seen in mentioned before that these slow frames are related to the stuttering sound that you sometimes hear. V-sync can smooth out the extreme variance in frametimes to some degree, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be much you can do about those slow frames. It will be interesting to see if the performance improvements they\u0027re working on for 0.23 have any effect on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nullreference\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nullreference\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a Phenom II x4 955 overclocked to 3.85GHz and I am getting below-par performance (9fps) during launch with the test rocket\u003Cp\u003ECould mods like FAR be the cause?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to say for sure what kind of performance you should expect. 9 FPS might be a little low for the benchmark numbers you would expect from that CPU, but then AMD CPUs tend to underperform compared to Intel CPUs based on their benchmark numbers. On the other hand, 9 FPS isn\u0027t that bad, it\u0027s around the same range as most of the Intel Core 2 Quad CPUs. The only CPUs that really break 15 FPS during the early stages are the newer Intel Core parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods can have an effect, anything that changes or increases CPU usage could lower performance, but it\u0027s hard to say for sure without comparing it to a stock installation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T07:10:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust got new PC, and before i start to OC it i wanted to have stock values benchmarked for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently i have everything on stock settings (i5 4670K 3,4GHz, 8Gb of 2133MHz CL9 G.Skill ram, crappy GTX660OC from gigabyte, on a gigabyte Z87X UD3H board)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost 20 FPS at launch, must say the Haswell i5 is pretty awesome for single threaded applications.

I put a small probe into a 300km equatorial orbit around Kerbin then replaced that with a slightly modified version of my test rocket. I pointed the camera away from the planet then launched, I stopped around stage 7. Because the ISPs are higher some of the burn times are longer, but the staging order is still the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying this on my desktop I saw a bit of improvement throughout the test.

This test was a little better, in that it was a mostly clean install of KSP and the graphics settings are unchanged from what I used for previous testing. As you can see performance is a little bit better on the early stages but drops off later on, this is strange and might be due to the camera position. I\u0027ll need to do further testing on this too to make sure that I have a good comparison. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also need to try some runs with the graphics settings intentionally set too high to see how much of a difference I can find. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/CPU%20Test/spacevsground.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022spacevsground.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T01:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I did some more thorough testing on this whole launchpad vs. space thing.

Performance remains identical throughout the first four stages, but from there it diverges. The Kerbin orbit tests (orange and grey) show a fairly significant drop in performance from this point on, and there is little diffenence between LKO and HKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next test, in LSO (yellow), is between in performance, and the last test, in HSO (blue), is almost at the same level as the launchpad test (burn times are longer because of the ISP difference).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the next two tests I put all the settings back on max. AA was set to 2X and I moved the light/shadow sliders back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launchpad test (green) was essentially identical to the previous test at slightly lower settings. The HSO test (dark blue) was a little bit slower, maybe 1 to 3 FPS slower towards to the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea why testing in space would result in lower performance than on the launchpad, or why being in Kerbin orbit would make it worse, but that seems to be the case, at least for this test. Kerbin and the sun were both out of frame for all of these tests (keeping Kerbin out of frame during the launchpad test definitely does make a difference, but that\u0027s not what I\u0027m looking at here), it was just the starry background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard surface launch still seems to be a good test.
