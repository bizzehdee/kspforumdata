This is a good game for it since you can hypothetically do something about it. And even if you didn\u0027t you could use it as a way to produce more science. Say even if the asteroid doesn\u0027t strike physically you could similate it by making a crater with extra science if you study the crater. And there could be even more science if you stop it(assuming you can) and study it in orbit. Or other benefits could exist in place of or on top of science like using it for some other purpose like a fueling station if you do stop it(assuming which way you use to stop it. capture/deflection/destruction/etc if possible. I would assume you would need mods for destruction unless you hurl it into the sun, which is technically deflection.).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T18:25:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 06:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
