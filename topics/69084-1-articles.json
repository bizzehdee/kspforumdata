It would work just like a normal timewarp but would automatically go back to 1x time when the sun reaches the right position. This would make it much easier to swap between day and night for launches which I believe is the main purpose of having time warp on that screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-12T06:22:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2014 06:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KaBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kriger","CreatedById":107995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T06:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with you, having the ability to warp right to certain times during the day would be really helpful.
