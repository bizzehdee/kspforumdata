Very lightweight, small, negligible recoil, and with a very high rate of fire, the Mg-13 machine gun will expel bullets at a high velocity (if it doesnt just go buy a new one, and dont tell anyone that only 3% of our guns pass the firing test without exploding or not working at all!). Its major drawback is very low firepower, barely enough to damage a exposed fuel tank, but still enough to take down anything that is not armored such as probes and small fighters. All in all, the perfect weapon for being a royal pain in the butt, annoying, fun, spammy, and best of all guaranteed to increase the amount of rage quitting, swearing, arguing, and general hate towards whoever dares use such a device. At least the bullet\u0027s velocity is very high making hitting things that are moving (lets face it, in space objects have a tendency to be in motion) somewhat easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E// attachment rules: stack, srfAttach, allowStack, allowSrfAttach, allowCollision\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EattachRules = 1,1,1,1,0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E// --- standard part parameters ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emass = 0.15\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdragModelType = default\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaximum_drag = 0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eminimum_drag = 0.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EangularDrag = 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EcrashTolerance = 6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EbreakingForce = 50000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EbreakingTorque = 50000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EmaxTemp = 3400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ename = AKSKineticEnergyWeapon //change to \u0022dyjmachinegun\u0022 if using DYJ\u0027s plugin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProjectileType = bullet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EkeyFire = f\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EkeyFirealt = [0]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBulletMass = 0.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBulletDrag = 0.02\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBulletPower = 35\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocketPower = 35\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erecoilreductionfactor = 0.005\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EfireRate = 0.08\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E//lackofkrakensbanontrailrendererscompensation = 0.1 //nolonger used with AKS plugin, uncomment when using DYJ\u0027s original plugin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ErotationSpeed = 300\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanimatedlinkfeed = true //replace with original isGatling cvar if uring DYJ\u0027s plugin, renamed to a more appropriate term given some guns have animated ammunition belts that move while firing and it doesnt make sense to rotate the barrel of a single barrel cannon? or at least the marketing department keeps complaining about customers feeling uneasy around moving parts, so we try to keep this to a bare minimum\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eshellejection = false //new cvar to designate if a gunpod will eject shells when firing, set to false if you want a small FPS boost or dislike the effect of shells ejecting from a gunpod (note: some gunpods arent designed for this, so setting it to true if it was originally false can have side effects like shells coming out of weird places, or spawning in mid air 20 meters behind the ship, or even not spawning in the 1st place, you have been warned)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EheatProduction = 500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuzzlesize = 0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ename = ModuleAnimateHeat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermalAnim = Thermalanim\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dawa1147","CreatedById":106481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T17:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know, but still this bug is wierd\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DebatedNothing","CreatedById":79974,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T12:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo the guns have a limited range?
