I can do the final\u00A0editing Just need someone to animate for me. I was listening to the song \u0022How do you like me now\u0022 by Toby Keith and got this image in my head of Either Qrow singing it to Winter or Jaune singing it to Weiss. (For those non-RWBY nerds google Jaune Arc, Weiss Schnee, Winter Schnee, and Qrow Branwen) With Ruby and Yang playing guitar. No reason just because I thought it would be hilarious. either reply to the thread or message if you would be interested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
