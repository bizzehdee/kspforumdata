After that, I ask Congress is they\u0027ll let NASA have its Apollo-level funding back and if it could cooperate with DARPA to get to the moon in six years.\u003Cp\u003ESit back, relax, and watch the fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the United States makes it to the Moon with a manned lander, I\u0027ll step in and intervene, saying that we shouldn\u0027t go after the alien space terrorists unless we have a stable foothold on the Moon, and then ask Congress to rush construction of a four-man lunar outpost (They can\u0027t refuse, there is oil at stake!). Once that is complete, I begin red-taping and bogging down every EVA as much as possible in paperwork, and would continuously ask Congress to extend funding until said base has a sizable population of around ten and can sustain itself. Then, out of nowhere, the scandal begins. First, I discreetly release the truth, that there never was secret space aliens on the moon, then maneuver out of the way to place the blame on the President, Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and the Department of Defense. Once the President and Vice President and the Speaker of the House is impeached, I bribe Congress to amend the Constitution to make me President.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing me being sworn in as President, I pass the \u0022Space Science Resolution\u0022, which forces schools to teach at least one course of space science to students along with offering more classes. Classes in orbital mechanics will be required, which ensures that even your average joe knows how to do a Hohmann transfer orbit to Mars. Further expansion of the Executive powers will be made, along with limits to the First Amendment that bans the Flat Earth Society. The most prominent moon landing hoaxers will be transported to the Moon, were they have their helmets smashed (As in summary execution) onto the remains of the Apollo 11 lower stage as a crude (But ironic) joke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad is hired to take over much of the Department of Education, and the Moon is colonized along with Mars\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I wish. I\u0027ve watched one too many a episode of \u0022House of Cards\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good idea, threaten them with ALL THE THINGS they\u0027re paranoid about *evil laugh*\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
