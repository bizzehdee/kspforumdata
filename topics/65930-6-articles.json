The BH drive is producing EM which generations N per 300MJ of Energy. If the wormhole is initially 1/2 the ships weight, and E = mc2 the 0.5*9E16 = 4.5E16 joules. The average accel mass is ~0.8 and average decel mass is 0.6 which means we use\u00A0 2.6E16J per starting ship mass on accel leg and 1.9 on the decel leg. Therefore on the accel leg you can produce 86666667N per starting mass over and average relative to starting mass of 0.8 which ends up begin 108333333 or 0.36C and deceleration at 105555556 0.35C. That assumes that all radiation is perfectly radiated backwards behind the ship. Assuming the perfect angle is theta and the average radiation vector is 45\u0027 then the cosine of 45 is the efficiency which at 0.707 is going to set that theoretical maximum at 0.25c. Some of the radiation will be used by the ship, and wasted. Also as the blackhole shrinks it eventually becomes unstable and has to be ejected, so at best you are probably looking at 0.2c. \u003Cstrong\u003E0.8 or 0.9c is a mindless fantasy\u003C/strong\u003E.

The argument is given the current limitations what is the most feasible, this is it, K2 as you note abdicated on his responsibility to tell us how he was going to produce a black hole at 10\u003Csup\u003E-19\u003C/sup\u003E meters in diameter. Everyone else has methods that are fail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond on a ship that is .32 km in diameter there is ample enough room to grow food, to build factorys that can build fusion reactors, store dueterium and hydrogen (tritium cannot be store because it has a half life of only 12 years) or whatever the ship needs. One assumes that the ship is dominated by multitasking robots, that the supplies of raw materials are stocked on board, In addition in the center of the ship one could have a rotating habitation area capable of producing 1g for the inhabitants to work out or do other gravity requiring tasks (again at 0.32 km, this is not a particular problem).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, given a fusion power reactor capable of producing 100 MW of power, you have a power supply that can potentially last generations, therefore all you need is a capacity to produce LEDs in the red and blue spectrum and you have food and oxygen. Fusion power gets its fuel from hydrogen, very little hydrogen is needed and potentially can be extracted from space using a collector at the front of the vessel, or could be carried on board. Product Helium would be used for impulse production. Again on a ship of 0.32 kilometers you can have several of these, so if one reactor goes down you have back ups.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForth, since current energy requirement prevent speed of light, most you are going to see for a start/stop (which BTW even optimistically is impossibility) of 0.1C the collisions even a grain of sand or space dust in space, would be catastrophic. E = 1/2mv\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003Eour dust weighs .0000001 kg = 45000000 Joules. A 50 calibre car killing rifle bullet is 18,050 Joules, In other words you have 2500 times the amount of energy hitting 1/1000 th amount of space. The RML 8 inch howitzer (The type of artillary that can tear down a 12 inch concrete wall) produces a 26900100 is only half the amount of energy as that piece of space dust. So, yeah, fractional c has a big impact problem. At a million meters per second, that is 1/300th of C (1/30th of 0.1c) the relative kinetic energy of impacts is 0.1% so instead of that grain of dust hitting with a force of 2 howizter bullets it hits with about three times the energy as a a 50 calibre bullet, A covering of solid titanium about an inch thick can stop this. Somewhere around 5 million meters velocity relative to intergalactic medium is the practical safe limit of space travel, everything faster is risking almost certain catastrophe.

Yes at so high speed plasma might not get dispersed enough however during cruise you could even have the shield flying free in front of you, the shield would be made of empty fuel tanks and similar. it will take damage and would need repair by robots on it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is problems but far simpler than using over ten times as long traveling and keeping everything running for so long.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow far forward do the shield need to be, how much of it will vaporize on impact guess effect here is heat radiation from the impact, how thick does it need to be.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote that you will have an extra shield closer and finally the front armor or impact zone, empty fuel tanks mostly.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLasers, magnetic fields and cold plasma is also solutions to this, probably in an combination.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are traveling about 0.01 c you can basically assume that the first atom/atom impact with begin a cascade (since this atom will smash into other atoms, passing around most but occasionally hitting a few) Electrons create repulsion, so if the electrons do not have time to create charge density in front of the atom, you can look at the frequency of electrons is particular orbitals, in the time interaction begins until the time two atoms might collide you get an atom smashing event, even at 0.8 to 0.9 c. Most of these will be elastic (non-nuclear) some will produce radioactivity. You can control this by using certain kinds of material in the hull, but you can\u0027t control the constituants of space, and unstable nuclei might just relieve themselves of a neutron. As you approach C the impactors atoms appear more massive, and so on impact they would have a tendency to do more damage. So the atoms first line of defense is the electron shield this shield covers the crosssectional area of the atom as two atoms collide, if the atom is going fast enough the reaction time of electrons is too slow or the repulsive force is too weak. In either case electrons get stripped of their outer shell electons and this results in highly increases chemical reactivity and heat generation. The next point of elasticity are the nuclei, the nuclei are essentially around 10E-15 across about 1/100000 the diameter of an atom, so its cross sectional area is 10E-10 of the entire atom. However, alpha particles do not have enough energy to penetrate to the center so the effective 1/1000000 the size of an atom from a scattering point of view. We can do some calculations, if we assume that a ship is going about 0.01C and an atom is about 10-10 thick, then how far does an atom have to travel before it is scattered by another atom. The answer is 1000000 x 10E-10 or 10-4 meter or about 0.1 mm. This means at this speed just about all atoms not repelled by electrostactic forces will undergo deep nuclear interactions. As speed increases the thickness at which this occurs decreases so that around 0.06c you can go deeper about a millimeter, before this type of scattering is observed, but at this speed nuclei are beginning to actually penetrate the nucleus itself. Rutherford showed that at about 0.01 C the collision of alpha particles with protons is elastic, the charged particles repulse each other, however even before this charged particles repulse each others. The level of scattering is far greater.\u00A0 Once you get over 5 MeV per charge the nuclie can\u00A0 slip into the nucleus itself which places its speed at about 0.06 C. So basically thats the speed limit that you don\u0027t want to cross, but again that is for certain nuclei, in which case its much lower, an atom like tritium that has three nuetrons per proton and hydrogen would have more momentum per charge. So at 0.06 C on average whatever type of shield material you have, it will not behave as a shield anymore and the atoms within the shield will begin behaving, when struck, like small atomic weapons. The critical feature is that they will increase temperature and pressure on surrounding materials making for alot of unwanted physics. By increasing the heat and pressure it becomes more likely that surrounding atoms of both ship and impactor begin interact, for example increasing the density of nuclei at the impact point, scattering nuclei, increase the path through the ship that they travel, increasing the level of positive charge, therefore increasing the likelihood that an impactor atom will change course and finally increasing the likelihood that a nuclear reaction takes place. Of course some of the surrounding metal will just vaporize into space, a good thing, but the underlying metal almost certainly deforms, thins or cracks. This is a problem as you increase speed even more, because eventually those nuclei no start interacting with the pressure hull of the ship, this does not mean it collapses or explodes, but the strength of the metal will decrease and eventually fail. Thin layering is not necessarily protective since solid/gas phase transition between the layers can cause them to separate and opening up huge areas to higher risk, just like a poly-wall tire that overheats due to stress and overheating.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/STFC/16plus/partich1pg3.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/STFC/16plus/partich1pg3.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, space is very thin, but alot of the stuff in space are plasma, good because the electrons will simply travel over the hull of the ship, bad because the dissociated nuclei have no outershell electrons to prevent them from bombarding the shield proton.

The BH drive is producing EM which generations N per 300MJ of Energy. If the wormhole is initially 1/2 the ships weight, and E = mc2 the 0.5*9E16 = 4.5E16 joules. The average accel mass is ~0.8 and average decel mass is 0.6 which means we use\u00A0 2.6E16J per starting ship mass on accel leg and 1.9 on the decel leg. Therefore on the accel leg you can produce 86666667N per starting mass over and average relative to starting mass of 0.8 which ends up begin 108333333 or 0.36C and deceleration at 105555556 0.35C. That assumes that all radiation is perfectly radiated backwards behind the ship. Assuming the perfect angle is theta and the average radiation vector is 45\u0027 then the cosine of 45 is the efficiency which at 0.707 is going to set that theoretical maximum at 0.25c. Some of the radiation will be used by the ship, and wasted. Also as the blackhole shrinks it eventually becomes unstable and has to be ejected, so at best you are probably looking at 0.2c.\u00A00.8 or 0.9c is a mindless fantasy.

Of course as we read on in the paper we find that this source of information is less than credible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A high-efficiency square solar panel a few hundred km on each side, in a circular orbit about the sun at a distance of 1,000,000 km, would absorb enough energy in a year to produce one such BH\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n(the paper you idolize) Err....... unfortunately solar panels have to be tilted at sharp angles within 60,000,000 km of the sun, that would simply vaporize at that distance. At 150,000,000 km the sun produces 1.3 kW per meter of power, most panels if cooled in some fashion can handle up to 50kW per meter. The amount of power on panel a milion km from the sun is going to be 30375 kW per meter. that is roughly 600 times what a solar panel in atmosphere can tolerate, and many times more than a panel in space can tolerate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A radius of 1 attometer corresponds to the wavelength of a gamma ray with an energy of about 1.24 TeV. Since the wavelength of the Hawking radiation is 8 \u03C02 times the radius of the BH, the Hawking temperature of a BH with this radius is on the order of 16 GeV, within the limit of what we could hope to achieve technologically.\u0022\u00A0 Errr....above 5 MeV gamma rays in close proximity result in pair production, this would cause scattering of the incident ray resulting in any beam used to create a black hole significantly scattering before reaching the center of the sphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now the idea that the wavelength of the radiation should match the radius of the BH created is very likely pessimistic.\u0022 No duh. Aside from the fact that Heisenberg uncertainty inhibits the focusing of a beam of light to 1 attometer, that this has to be done all at the same moment, and that photons that get in close proximity prior to reaching the BH site are likely to undergo pair production and scatter . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Although a laser-powered black hole generator presents huge engineering challenges, the concept appears to be physically sound according to classical general relativity. The Vaidya-Papapetrou metric shows that an imploding spherically symmetric shell of \u201Cnull dust\u201D can form a black hole\u0022 Oki-doki, this is what I call the classic psuedoscience if and if and if argument. Yes we have lasers, but no lasers that can produce 16GeV photons, \u0027technically impossible\u0027 unless that laser were traveling in the direction of the black hole at nearly light speed. In essence to seed a laser that produces such high wavelengths you need a nuclear decay that produces the photon and a similar material in the laser that can be excited, its hard to imagine a laser composed of materials that an electron decays from an excited state producing 16GeV, it has to be the result of nuclear decay. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is in the high energy gamma range\u003C/strong\u003E, the types of energies produced by machines such as hadron colliders and are not generally possible in small compact equipment of the type required to create a spherical shell. Laser is the production of a beam of light from a column in which atoms are excited in unison, the beam has to be contained, which takes space and there has to be an energy source to excite, which means we have energy density and heat, which ultimately limiting the energy density of laser light created per unit space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if we assume that a black hole is being formed of 600,000,000 kg = E/c\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E therefore E = 5.4 x 10\u003Csup\u003E25\u003C/sup\u003E joules. Now lets say that this all has to be done within a wavelength of 1 attometer. That is to say within t = 10\u003Csup\u003E-18\u003C/sup\u003E/3 x 10\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003E m/sec = 3.33 x 10\u003Csup\u003E-26\u003C/sup\u003E seconds, therefore the E/sec = 1.62 x 10\u003Csup\u003E51\u003C/sup\u003EKW. If we assume that a laser with a face of 10 cubic centimeters can maximally produce 1 KW (a very generous assumption) then we can produce .. . . Oh screw logic, lets just say they got to within a 1000th of the speed of light blue-shifting the lasers energy 1000 fold so that we have a MW per 10 cubic centimeter (that means these spaceships have a cross sectional face of 10 cm). OK so thats 1 x 10\u003Csup\u003E9\u003C/sup\u003E watt/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E.

ROFLMAO. Huge engineering challenge is a very fluffy way of saying its about as likely as well god (insert benevolent alien race) giving us a black hole. So Angel have you bothered to even think what uncertainty is going to do with the theta of emitted photons at such distances, are they going to be \u002B/- kilometers, 10s of kilometers, 100s of kilometers from their target? Lets say we can form a black hole over say a month, sure we reduce the shell but by how much you are still in the 10 x 10\u003Csup\u003E10\u003C/sup\u003E radius range, still not close enough to even get close to an attometer. The reality here is that 100 KeV \u003Cem\u003Enuclear laser\u003C/em\u003E needs to be moving toward the black hole at about 99,999c/100,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis paper just gets\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003Ebetter and better,\u00A0 \u003C/em\u003Eany one can publish anything in this journal, do the referees even know how to do arithmetic?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Since a nuclear laser can convert on the order of 10\u003Csup\u003E-3\u003C/sup\u003Eof its rest mass to radiation, we would need a lasing mass of order 10\u003Csup\u003E9\u003C/sup\u003E tonnes to produce the pulse. This should correspond to a mass of order 10\u003Csup\u003E10 \u003C/sup\u003Etonnes for the whole structure (the size of a small asteroid).\u0022 Great but \u003Cem\u003Enuclear lasers \u003C/em\u003Eproduce hv in the KeV range, a million times lower than what they are proposing. Second an asteroid is a block of rock not necessarily radioactive (in fact very little radioactivity), and finally those lasers are going to have to be spread over a considerable area. If that 10\u003Csup\u003E13\u003C/sup\u003E kg is made into a shell, the thin shell is fed into the laser then that shell would occupy a very large area, remember the pulse has to be very fast and you cannot pulse a meter thickness of asteroid/\u003Cem\u003Efissile product\u003C/em\u003E through a \u003Cem\u003Enuclear laser\u003C/em\u003E. the amount of material fed into the laser would be on the order of pico to femtomoles of fissile material per pulse. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pumped_laser\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pumped_laser - \u003C/a\u003Epoints out that the closest we have gotten to a X-ray laser is 21nm and relies on reaction based.

First, what is the minimum sized radius that they can produce, if their limit is 16 GeV then a smaller radius would not absorbe all of the radiation (even if they could target it) and thus to form a black hole they would have to feed all of 16 GeV at that space at once. If they could feed TeV they might be able to pulse the black hole over a month or so to form it. But what is the limit? How small can a black hole be and how long would it last, if you could pulse say a million times a second would a millionth of a second the black hole decay.\u00A0 Integral R\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E to 0, c\u003Csup\u003E4.\u003C/sup\u003ER\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E/ 2\u003Csup\u003E.\u003C/sup\u003EG\u003Csup\u003E.\u003C/sup\u003Ea\u003Csup\u003E.\u003C/sup\u003EF(t) dR\u00A0 c = speed of light, R = black hole radius, G = universal gravitational contant, \u003Cem\u003Ea\u003C/em\u003E is their constant, apparent the published value of 10\u003Csup\u003E-22 \u003C/sup\u003Ewas to low so they are using 10\u003Csup\u003E-20 \u003C/sup\u003EF(t) = function (time) of all the various energy particles produced use 100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on this equation you could have a BH of size 10\u003Csup\u003E-21\u003C/sup\u003E stable for a millionth of a second but to build it you would need to pulse it with 16TeV at say 1/1000000 the of the total energy required but in a smaller area, even at millionth of that energy they are still looking at targeting the black hole from a distance of 10 ly, which is nearly impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-19T12:32:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2016 12:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T05:00:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222415574\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002265930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455743422\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107380\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn February 17, 2016 at 1:10 PM, PB666 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I don\u0027t use movies as a judge of what is and what is not possible, and second with regard to your physicist claim that is at 0.8 or 0.9c, since we do not have a method of reaching that velocity we have to consider the potency to catastrophic impacts at lower speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we ignore reaction mass, the very best you can do (c2/2) = 0.707c, That is not accounting for the mass on board to slow the ship down. The BH drive is producing EM which generations N per 300MJ of Energy. If the wormhole is initially 1/2 the ships weight, and E = mc2 the 0.5*9E16 = 4.5E16 joules. The average accel mass is ~0.8 and average decel mass is 0.6 which means we use\u00A0 2.6E16J per starting ship mass on accel leg and 1.9 on the decel leg. Therefore on the accel leg you can produce 86666667N per starting mass over and average relative to starting mass of 0.8 which ends up begin 108333333 or 0.36C and deceleration at 105555556 0.35C. That assumes that all radiation is perfectly radiated backwards behind the ship. Assuming the perfect angle is theta and the average radiation vector is 45\u0027 then the cosine of 45 is the efficiency which at 0.707 is going to set that theoretical maximum at 0.25c. Some of the radiation will be used by the ship, and wasted. Also as the blackhole shrinks it eventually becomes unstable and has to be ejected, so at best you are probably looking at 0.2c. \u003Cstrong\u003E0.8 or 0.9c is a mindless fantasy\u003C/strong\u003E.

Its peak speed of 1.75 million is close to limit of IS risk. In this vessel 1/4th of the mass is fuel (the vessel mass was increased to 2 million tonnes) but I now only need to take around 200 individuals on board. I still think this is too fast for safe interstellar space travel. ISPg = 1250000 sec (Xenon needs to be ejected at 12,400,000 m/s) The vessel produces 2kN of thrust but this is devided across 2000 starting tonnes.

Right so that the power density I was using for each reactor is actually a major handwave at fusion, 276MW per 10 diameter reactor is probably a far reach, originally I used 100MW which seamed more reasonable. [JUXT] But in shrinking my ship to one tenth scale I forgot to shrink power to 1/1000th of the original so now my FR are producing at 2760 a sensible power density. I should have used a full sized reactor, which is fine, but it means the unit cell is larger, which means I can put fewer reactors back there instead of 45 its more going to be like 15 cutting power output to 1/3rd. Ok so the trip takes 2100 years. [Massive] 15 reactors weighing 50 tonnes each, that is 750 tonnes so I need to increase also the weight of my ship by 700 from 2000 to 2700 this further extends our trip and the number of inhabitants. Adding bulk to the back of the ship allows the 30 addition reactors to be added, but at the cost of 1400 tonnes so we can get our ship now double in mass and down to 1400\u00A0 years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for he handwaving parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. I am assuming 100% efficiency on all electrical processes, it is unclear how efficient an 12400000 ISP would be\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. right now the practical power density for ION drives is around 100kW per meter, this means that in order to generate this amount of thrust I would need 124000 square meters a backward facing surface, this is much more than my pi\u003Csup\u003E.\u003C/sup\u003E32\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003E= 3216 m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0 ship back provide and probably requires much larger radiator fins. On a ship 10 times the size the\u003Csup\u003E\u003C/sup\u003Eproblem is considerably worse, much more fin would be needed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. the 45 @ 276 MW reactors would have to either produce 1000 times more power per unit or I would need a 1000 times more of them. If they are spread 80 m apart occupying a space of 1600 m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E each then I would need to get them to occupy at least 1.6 m\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003Eeach which is impossible, so that the fins would have to have both fusion reactors and ion drives on them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. All those are managable issues to some degree (compared to FTL or BH drives), this is where the hands wave\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNucelar fission releases 4.2 MeV of energy per 4 atomic units (2 deuterium).\u00A0 So we have several ION drives solely devoted to the acceleration of helium-4. So this is not a problem, and we can partition are fuel tanks so that some do not hold xenon but hold dueterium or hydrogen or neutrons, whatever.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[PROBLEM #2] the deuterium is about 3600 MeV of energy and if we are only getting 4.2 out then we are only getting 0.1% of the total energy within the deuterium. Lets say that 20% of the fuel is Dueterium (obviously we can breed deuterium with Neutrons released), that means we have on board 100,000 kg of deuterium gas. If then 0.1% of that is energy then its 100kg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n100*c\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003E= 9 x 10\u003Csup\u003E18 \u003C/sup\u003EJ, OK so spread over the 162 years to accelerate/decelerate that amounts to 0.176 GW of power, ouch, well OK we simply remove xenon and replace it with deuterium (we have super new tanks and we can pressurize D into a solid of amazing density). So increasing D by 5 then gets us up to 8.8GW, OK so we need more fuel. 704.505 should do in a perfect world. But we have to reduce the rest of the ships mass. Since we are traveling faster we need fewer humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so where did I finally end up.

Starting ship Mass 4000000000 kg (4 million tonnes), Fuel mass 704,505 tonnes (majically stored deuterium), Power output 12.4 TW, spread over 45,000 [wheezing] 0.000276 TW fusion reactors. Note I did not add any additional energy for our unlucky humans (who will spend all their lives a few hundred meters from neutron heaven), that is because when we increased the fuel we can lower the ISP to 890000 and decreasing the power needed for drive.

Right so that the power density I was using for each reactor is actually a major handwave at fusion, 276MW per 10 diameter reactor is probably a far reach, originally I used 100MW which seamed more reasonable. [JUXT] But in shrinking my ship to one tenth scale I forgot to shrink power to 1/1000th of the original so now my FR are producing at 2760 a sensible power density. I should have used a full sized reactor, which is fine, but it means the unit cell is larger, which means I can put fewer reactors back there instead of 45 its more going to be like 15 cutting power output to 1/3rd. Ok so the trip takes 2100 years. [Massive] 15 reactors weighing 50 tonnes each, that is 750 tonnes so I need to increase also the weight of my ship by 700 from 2000 to 2700 this further extends our trip and the number of inhabitants. Adding bulk to the back of the ship allows the 30 addition reactors to be added, but at the cost of 1400 tonnes so we can get our ship now double in mass and down to 1400\u00A0 years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for he handwaving parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. I am assuming 100% efficiency on all electrical processes, it is unclear how efficient an 12400000 ISP would be\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. right now the practical power density for ION drives is around 100kW per meter, this means that in order to generate this amount of thrust I would need 124000 square meters a backward facing surface, this is much more than my pi\u003Csup\u003E.\u003C/sup\u003E32\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003E= 3216 m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0 ship back provide and probably requires much larger radiator fins. On a ship 10 times the size theproblem is considerably worse, much more fin would be needed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. the 45 @ 276 MW reactors would have to either produce 1000 times more power per unit or I would need a 1000 times more of them. If they are spread 80 m apart occupying a space of 1600 m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E each then I would need to get them to occupy at least 1.6 m\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003Eeach which is impossible, so that the fins would have to have both fusion reactors and ion drives on them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. All those are managable issues to some degree (compared to FTL or BH drives), this is where the hands wave\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNucelar fission releases 4.2 MeV of energy per 4 atomic units (2 deuterium).\u00A0 So we have several ION drives solely devoted to the acceleration of helium-4. So this is not a problem, and we can partition are fuel tanks so that some do not hold xenon but hold dueterium or hydrogen or neutrons, whatever.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[PROBLEM #2] the deuterium is about 3600 MeV of energy and if we are only getting 4.2 out then we are only getting 0.1% of the total energy within the deuterium. Lets say that 20% of the fuel is Dueterium (obviously we can breed deuterium with Neutrons released), that means we have on board 100,000 kg of deuterium gas. If then 0.1% of that is energy then its 100kg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n100*c\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003E= 9 x 10\u003Csup\u003E18 \u003C/sup\u003EJ, OK so spread over the 162 years to accelerate/decelerate that amounts to 0.176 GW of power, ouch, well OK we simply remove xenon and replace it with deuterium (we have super new tanks and we can pressurize D into a solid of amazing density). So increasing D by 5 then gets us up to 8.8GW, OK so we need more fuel. 704.505 should do in a perfect world. But we have to reduce the rest of the ships mass. Since we are traveling faster we need fewer humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so where did I finally end up. Ship \u003Cs\u003E320\u003C/s\u003E meters (800 m) in radius about \u003Cs\u003E640\u003C/s\u003E meters (800m) in height, speed =\u00A0 0.003 c, time to proxima 1400 years. Number of colonizers 400. Starting ship Mass 4000000000 kg (4 million tonnes), Fuel mass 704,505 tonnes (majically stored deuterium), Power output 12.4 TW, spread over 45,000 [wheezing] 0.000276 TW fusion reactors. Note I did not add any additional energy for our unlucky humans (who will spend all their lives a few hundred meters from neutron heaven), that is because when we increased the fuel we can lower the ISP to 890000 and decreasing the power needed for drive. Percent of ship devoted to Fusion reactors and cooling, about 70%, percent devoted to fuel (starting) 17%, percent of fuel mass remaining 13% for superstructure and humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately the dimensions of the ship are two big for the launch pad so\u00A0 . . . . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk. \u00A0now your colonizers number increase, your travel time double, its crear that you dont see any problem with that last...\u003Cbr\u003E\nForgetting that crazy factor.. \u00A0yeah the ship design seems fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut I see wrong some things.. \u00A0you dont have stages to release cargo that you would not need.

We have a load, lets say the load is 1/3rd of the total vehicle its nature does not matter, the only quality of load that we care about is that any hv or particles traveling in the -y direction are either reflected or emmitted in the xz, that is no hv or particles travel with a velocity vector relative to the ship of -y.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. We have a device which defines the power plant of the ship. It performs several functions\u003Cbr\u003E\na. I positions the black hole (how this can be done is beyond the scope of this presentation)\u003Cbr\u003E\nb. It reflects the black holes radiation\u003Cbr\u003E\nc. It insulates the ship from the black holes radiation\u003Cbr\u003E\nd. It transmits non-inertial forces from the back of the ship to the payload\u003Cbr\u003E\ne. It wastes energy by allowing some hv to escape in the xz directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe amount of waste energy is defined as the Power vectors xz that is to say the accumulation of all radiant vectors (sqrt(Sq(TotalPower)\u002Bsq(Power-y)). The blackholes radiation vectors present as a shere of power, its essentially powerdensity at 1 meter radius. If we then take the Y (thrust vector) and ignore -y that comes to about 27%, the -y has to be dealt with separately. For all vectors that have a \u002By component about 23% have energy that is wasted. If we forget about acceleration and set the reference frame of the powerplant, and set the blackhole as a point light source. The further the the mean distance of the surfaces relative to the source, and the smaller their profile, the less light will be reflected\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase 1 is microscopic efficiency.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn this case the power plant is far behind the source, the red dot in the image is off to the right, only a few photons strike the power plant and the force exherted on the device is almost zero. since the -y and y vector component of photon bearing cancel each other out the net efficiency is zero. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase 2. wide flat perfectly reflective surface. About half the photons are reflect off the surface, the other half radiate into space. Assuming the origin to be the center of the source basically we can determine these X2 \u002B y2 \u002B Z2 = 1 and this can be used to determine the proportion of y vector and not-y vector. the mean y vector is ~.55, it can be split into -y and y, y radiates into space and -y reflects and radiates in the y direction. In this case the amount of waste is 1 - 0.55 or about 45%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase 3. We have a wide flat perfectly opaque surface. In this case half of the 0.55 or about .275 component is in the y direction.\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe -y directed photons are perfectly absorbed by the power plant, some are radiated backwards and some are radiated to the side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase 4. I we have a hyperbolic mirror that reflects the photons in which case we can convert all the directions to y and this is 100%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDealing with -y photons.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically the types of photons that the black hole is emitting is the high energy stuff, we can\u0027t see it. IN fact the frequency of radiation in a 1 attometer black hole is in the TeV range, which is well about the gamma for more radioactive decay.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/reflecting-gamma-rays.515289/.\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.physicsforums.com/threads/reflecting-gamma-rays.515289/.\u003C/a\u003E These photons will be absorbed, and on absorption they impart much of their momentum, however they will also generate radiant heat which will dissipate in many directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically we can think of a black hole devise as case number 3, our minimun efficiency is 0.275, and we can assume that we can get 0.25 by absorbption, but the remainder depends on how heat is channeled through the power plant. As I progress through the post we can see that this is not completely subject to theoretical. Just like creating a black hole, redirection -y momentum is full of technical challenges that may not be solvable, at least not for a bh of the 1 attometer - 0.01 attometer size range).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECreating as Filght\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets be generous and say that we get 66% efficiency. Not withstanding that a blackhole will eventually blow up into a gamma-ray burst of immense power, we are going to assume that its power output is constant. But this is not true and the only real measure of energy available is via mass energy equivelance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext thing we need to do is plan our trip. Most trips will involve starting and stopping. Rarely would you just happen to accelerated to catch a planet that just happened to be whizzing by the sun at 0.Xc (x = your dV potential, lorentz transformed of course), but anyway lets see what X might be, lets suppose that a black hole has is half the weight of a 1212000000kg ship, to keep it simple our unit is 1u = 606000 tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso ship weighs 1 and black hole weighs 1. Over the course of the journey it burns its weight, and we found a way to keep it from exploding and blowing us to smitherines. 1 unit is 606000000 x c\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E = 5.545E23 joules, since we are 66% efficient then we can produce how many newtons? 5.54E23 * 0.66/ c, so essentially is mass x c times * efficiency = 1.2 x 10\u003Csup\u003E17\u003C/sup\u003E N since we are not losing most of our mass we can sloppily set the mass at 1.5u and divide to get dV. In this case dV = 1.32 x 10\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003E which when divided by c\u00A0 =\u00A0 0.44C (more like 0.42c because of dilation)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can we be confident in our results. We know how much energy is there, the mass energy equivilence tells us that E = mass * square of speed of light, we can\u0027t ever have more than that we know that momentum imparted on the ship is going to be roughly equivilent to that. We can get the number up, but then we have to get rid of some of both power plant and payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EA stop and start flight\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo next we want to stop and start. Basically SM/MidMass = MidMass/EM MidMass = 0.707 Starting Mass. Therefore we burn 0.586u over an sloppy average mass of 1.707u this means that we can reach a speed of 1.03 x 10\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003E m/s or 0.34c\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that is a rational examination of speed, given of course an irrationally produced black hole, a handwaving procedure for grapling it and accelerating it in step with the ship. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe fairy-tail flight (the interstellar equivalent of 39 days to Mars and back again)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo lets now say that we created completely non-massive energy beings and our power-plants is crafted from a new material (Otherwise known as wee fairy-dust) that has stronger bonds than carbon and is lighter than hydrogen it perfectly reflects any em, no matter how powerful and its equally good at reflecting cosmic radiation and other unexpected black hole emissions. . In this scenario we cut our ship down now to 0.1u and the black hole 1, total weight is 1.1, the efficiency remains the same. 0.66%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo our new equation has 1.2 10\u003Csup\u003E17\u003C/sup\u003E N but now we have to get the weight, we can use the rocket equation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a twist, take mass lost (606 kilotonnes) and devide by Newtons/dMass = 1.98 x 10\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003E which just happens to be c * our efficiency (imagine that). If we then go back and use this we find out that our maximum speed here is ln(11)*0.66c = 1.54c.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith speed above 0.5c one needs to do a transformation resulting 0.84c. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWee fairy-dusted start stop trip\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.1/midmass =\u00A0 midmass/0.1 This tells us that we can burn down to about 0.33 during the acceleration phase, that is a change of 0.77u or 4.668E8 Mass. we can get our friend the equivilancy equation and the photon/force equivilancy to give us the total number of unwasted Newtons, 9.26E16N. With this we can calculate the acceleration phase to be 0.62c.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is strictly theoretical, however a starting Load \u002B Powerplant(w/o BH has theoretical limitations)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EReality of the powerplant.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the problems is this. If we recall that particles tend to be stimulated according their frequency, and everything has a frequency. It is call the Compton wavelength. Why am I bring this up, it has to do with reflection. When we see light reflected from a mirror the reflected light is almost perfectly redirected, thus it is an elastic process. Light can be reflected, including UV and X-rays to some degree. But this is not true for high energy X-rays, gamma rays and particularly high energy gamma rays. As stated above the size of the black hole is directly proportional to its mass (the black hole being the sphere is space were no light can escape). A .9E-18 BH therefore has a wavelength, and the particles emmitted would also have a wavelength. Over the course of our trip our black hole is converting mass to ever shorter wavelengths. The low limit is 16GeV and would rise to the TeV range before a catastrophic loss of the hole. m = h/wavelength * c. So if the average wavelength is say 0.45E-18*2*pi = 2.9E-18, so this has a mass range it would like to dance with, around 8 x 10-25 kg. Protons have a mass of 1.67E10\u221227 kg. So basically this gamma can kick the butt of anything with atomic weight of 267, essentially it would knock these particles up to c. But this would not happen in the metal of the power plant, because it would obliterate the surrounding structures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the arguments could be, well we simply use light atoms like aluminum, and the wavelengths just zip right through. OK if hv zips right through unaffected, you basically sacrifice your thrust, because without reflection or scattering, the -y and y vectors cancel each other out. So it is a requirement of the Powerplant that it must absorb or reflect, since no known material reflects these high energy things then is must absorb bh hv. So if it is absorbing it also means that the nuclei within are being scattered as they scatter this light. And overriding principle of any thruster is that we should not tabulate values of thrust associated with the destruction of the craft, this makes both of the above scenarios acceptable as a valid powerplant and thruster. Simply stated there is no certainty that these would survive until a full deceleration occurred, in which case if the power plant fails, then all the payload is essentially wasted. Therefore to make this work we have to split the powerplant into its superstructure and its ablator\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESo how big should the ablator be?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we have the issue that the BH is shooting \u0026gt;50% of its energy at a structure that is designed to protect the material in front of it, primarily absorbing that mass, but in the process sacrificing itself as ejecta. Lets say they are ejecting the matter on the back of the ablater at 0.46c and that this accounts for 25% of the Energy of the BH. 0.25 * c\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E = 1.36 x 10\u003Csup\u003E25\u003C/sup\u003E joules\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.36 x 10\u003Csup\u003E25\u003C/sup\u003E = 1/2 X (1.5 x 10\u003Csup\u003E8\u003C/sup\u003E)\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E that comes to a mass of 1.2 x 10\u003Csup\u003E9\u003C/sup\u003E so basically our powerplant needs to be twice the size of our black hole. And if we want (need) in the end that there be some mass to protect the payload, then the powerplant needs to be some safety factor larger, consequently that mass should be \u0026gt;2.2 times the size of the blackhole. In addition we want to steer those particles which means it should have shape, this means that shape will also have mass. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we go by this u (BH) \u002B 2.5u(P) \u002B 0.5u(L) = 4u. This complicates our thrust argument, we know we have 25% efficiency, but now what is thrust, this has to change in flight because the ability of the power plant to absorb and redirect heat changes with the ablation of the powerplant. The ablation of the powerplant increases as the black hole shrinks. We know we cannot reflect hv anymore, and we have much less ability to control radiation and limited ability to direct ablation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf we assume the flat plat position the we have a given efficiency of 27%, and then we can add maybe another 25% in the form of ejected mass, which has momentum and can accelerate. I won\u0027t add this together, but I can reduce the mass separately. In addition at 0.1u the black hole is unmanagable and is ejected.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo do this we are going to break the trip up into 4 legs. So lets say that for each amount of energy 0.52% we eject 3.0u of mass during the course. So basically ISPv = 0.52 * c * ln(4/1.1) = 0.68c (not transformed) which means for each leg we have 0.34c. This another thing to be considered, if the output of the black hole is 3.5 years then its acceleration is going to be g/year * total dV/life = 0.194g or 1.96 meters per second. So in this model a trip = 2*1/2at\u003Csup\u003E2 \u003C/sup\u003E= 1.96 * (1.75 years) = 1.6 light years, and you did not make the trip to centauri, instead you have created a brand spanking new graveyard in interstellar space. Maybe Nemesis will rescue you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBottom Line\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom line is this, we have done several methods, starting with a simple model, then tested a fairy-tail model, and then finally a model compensated for the destructive forces of the drive. With the exception of the fairy-tail model, all models come in below 0.5c, the last model may not go far enough, since the full potential of the wormhole might not be available, and, in fact 606 kilotonnes for the bh may be too small and too unstable. I final and most important factor is this, acceleration. The problem here is that the black hole dies over 3.5 years as claimed the ship is accelerating to 0.39c which means its average speed is 0.2c across the duration of the trip. Then its not going to get there in 3.5 years but E-AC 4ly/0.2 = 20 years. Therefore the black hole is way too small, it needs to be larger. This is good because larger means less destructive radiation, but it also means more mass and slower acceleration. Its more or less the dog chasing its tail. If you get the black hole big enough that it only emits X-rays then you can perfectly reflect the radiation and efficiency goes close to 95%. How big is an X-ray black hole. So lets say we use 20KeV instead of 20GeV, in this case we have a radius 1000 times as large and a mass also 1000 times as large. Now our ablater can be rather small in size but we are now carrying around 250 times the load. The good news is that acceleration is constant and we can make a return trip, the bad news is that we would better off with fusion power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA critical arguement here is going for smallest possible black hole is not so smart becaues weight of ablater needs to be added, going for a bigger black hole is not smart because acceleration goes down.
