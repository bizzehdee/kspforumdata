The question must then be asked, how has this hurt extreme EVAing? in .22 it was possible to go land on minmus and return to orbit with just the EVA pack. Bop, Gilly, Pol, and Minmus were all able to do this (Eeloo too?). So where can and can\u0027t you still do this?

The fuel is tight but it can be done. I did this all in 0.23 when I discovered that ground-to-orbit only doesn\u0027t count as extreme EVA and I had been wearing the ribbon in error. Well I feel it still wasn\u0027t a very difficult challenge, even with tight fuel margins, because the TWR of a Kerbal in EVA on Minmus is really high. You just have to know what you are doing and not waste fuel. I\u0027m sure if done perfectly, one could perform a landing and orbital rendezvous with over 10% fuel remaining. I didn\u0027t fly very accurately, I just used a basic Scott Manley style landing and take-off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
