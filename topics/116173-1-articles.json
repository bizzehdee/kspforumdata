Just send a probe, no fancy bases nor mods. Simply a little probe to check things out. Heck, you could bring along a resource scanner if you want, in preparation for future missions which might want to refuel on the planet\u0027s surface. Then, after you\u0027ve launched and completed the mission successfully, think to yourself what you want to find out more about Duna. Do you want to explore its surface a bit more? Send a rover.

Last round by the OreRunner, after this the expedition will be fully fuelled up. Next stop for OreRunner after that is Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, instead of launching some half-assed \u0022get there, land, pick samples, return\u0022 I\u0027m making something vastly overengineered. There\u0027s the lander which I *hope* could be multi-use, but just in case it can dump spare fuel tanks and return in half the required weight. There\u0027s the laboratory and ISRU, tucked together in a large cargo bay along with some spare ore tanks. There\u0027s the crew/reentry module. And the OreRunner, a lander with drills for landing legs. Oh, and three ore scanner probes, one for Duna, one for Ike and one... uh, a backup I guess. And there\u0027s the propulsion module, the largest LF tank with quad nukes at the end. Everything bound in a half-kilometer long train. And I seriously consider adding a pair of rovers before they depart Minmus en route to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...during the refuelling the craft gained the crew/reentry module because it would allow me to keep the lander in orbit and fetch more crew, then there was a stranded Kerbal on Minmus, and the lander went there to pick her up, and currently she\u0027s with the crew to visit Duna before return to Kerbin, then there was the fun of the first ore run - as I assembled it in LKO, the segments would be brought unfuelled to orbit and get only as much fuel as was left in the SSTO launch module after bringing a segment to the orbit (minus what was needed for reentry of the launch module), I landed in Minmus orbit with bare scraps of fuel. I picked every last drop including the Oscar-B tanks of the three probes to fuel up the OreRunner. It had to dump 1/3 the ore it picked because it would never make it back, and even then it arrived with less than 10 units of LF left. The ore it brought was barely enough to fill the OreRunner tank But luckily - unlike before, actually *fill* it instead of getting it 1/3 full, and it didn\u0027t need to dump any ore on return and didn\u0027t arrive with empty fuel tanks either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and once I had to load, because I\u0027m too good with my maneuvers. I launched the OreRunner from the surface, as the Mission was flying just above, picked the right direction for encounter, burned for the encounter without even trying to first make an orbit - like 300m from the launch point, then checked the map, yeah, a neat 0.1km encounter in like a minute or so. I corrected the course to make it even better, then began slowly turning around for a retrograde burn relative to target, without RCS not to spoil the encounter, and.... boom, 27 tons of ore at 70m/s right into the quad nukes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint?
