I had no space in capsule itself for my 2 scientist so i built a rescue rocket and saved them. So the question is do they still apply that 110% bonus science if they changed the ship? Not like it was very important because i got over 10k science with one trip with lab, but you know knowledge is power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-20T08:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir bonus still applies, regardless if it\u0027s the same ship or not.
