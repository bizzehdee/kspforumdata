My late 1.01 craft with 12 turbojets and 45000\u002B fuel capacity would have been capable of 5 or 6 laps but as fate would have it, pilot error claimed its maiden voyage and the beating drum of progress (version 1.02, released the following morning) would mean mean there would be no take two, as its capabilities were diminished to where 3 laps would have been a stretch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never gave up on the dream.

Carrying about 25000 fuel, it was able to reach a cruising speed around 1530-1540 on 8 rapiers and complete full speed laps with about 3000-4000 fuel. But the sheer weight along with the inevitable mid-flight balance changes made climbing difficult, requiring 2-3 speed dives during ascent through some very lawn-dart-ish flight characteristics, meaning that reaching supercruise took 9000-12000 fuel, leaving me with just enough enough for 4 laps in most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I looked back and I looked small. I took inspiration from the first plane I entered in this thread: Simplicity. NAmed for its design philosophy, it turned in a respectable 51 minute flight on a single turbojet. From it was born the Elaboration. I traded mk1 nosecone c-pit for a mk1 inline c-pit carrying a shock cone intake. The pre-cooler was swapped for a standard jet fuel fuselage, and an additional jet fuel fuselage section was added. The small gear were traded for a medium set on the hopes that the braking might be better. I took it out last night and fell about half a turn short. Realized I only need about 200 more fuel so a set of big s strakes along with a slight adjustment of the wing angle (aesthetics are important) and the addition of chutes and we have what I present below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/cOjay\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Radial drogues did very well for me. Mount them close to where your COM will be when your fuel is just about all burnt off.

Then, come in low, level, and hot. Drogues can survive up to about 550 m/s. But it\u0027s hard to keep a clean approach much over 300 IMO, so the radial standard chutes work fine, too.

On some of my faster crafts, I used big s elevons and elevon 5\u0027s as primary lifting surfaces (often with smaller elevons as canards). They get a bit tricky to fly, though, since they pretty much go from neutral to full deflection with any input (any slight adjustment can easily turn into 15\u002B g aerobatics. =D). The drag reduction wasn\u0027t always woth it. Having a small wing surface plus an elevon doesn\u0027t seem to lose much speed versus having none and just an elevon and you can see on my latest velocity attempt, I opted for a rather full wing surface (C? maybe... it\u0027s the large rectangular wing connector). If I were to do it again, I\u0027d probably try the small delta wings or maybe a swept wing variant. My gut feeling is that it\u0027s more important to minimize the level flight angle of attack at speed, and that takes a very careful balance of lift and mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T05:07:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 05:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExaltedDuck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lemon1324","CreatedById":1232,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T09:37:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, It\u0027s done at last! \u003Cstrong\u003EThree full circumnavigations, all done using only basic jets\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlown in the \u003Cem\u003EIcarus IV\u003C/em\u003E with Jeb commanding, and Bill in the co-pilot\u0027s seat.

Proof no kOS stuff was done other than listing data, and there\u0027s also the raw datalogs of the flight, containing lat-lng at 15 sec intervals if you need more proof. Unfortunately I accidentally turned kOS off about 200m up and on final for landing. Oops. It\u0027s not technically a complete log, but close enough.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPilot Assistant is the only mod used that affects flight controls, and honestly this is theoretically possible but practically impossible without it. MechJeb was used only to put a marker on the navball for landing. The actual landing was flown with pilot assistant, using keys to update setpoint. Telemachus was installed so I could check progress on my phone, but doesn\u0027t alter aerodynamics.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few notes on the aircraft design:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFor range, I want my wing loading as low as possible. Since the big wings can hold fuel, max out on those first, and have two sets of them. Both wings are lifting, so no additional drag because of a stabilizer generating negative lift.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll else being equal, with a turbofan (real-life too) to maximize range you want to go as fast as possible. Real commercial airplanes are limited by the drag-divergence Mach number. KSP doesn\u0027t model this in stock (FAR does!), but there\u0027s \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003EmachLimit = 0.75\u003C/span\u003E in the engine .cfg, and some velocity curve which I didn\u0027t actually plot. Experimentally, I found efficiency is maximized at about Mach 0.65. For a given speed, one engine is better (again, experimentally in KSP). Since I can\u0027t push enough fuel through the air at Mach 0.65 because drag, use two engines. Most of the time, I\u0027m at around 90% throttle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFlying due east, I\u0027m never going to turn. Use airbrakes as yaw spoilers to avoid having a vertical tail. I\u0027m not totally sure this reduces drag, since I can\u0027t seem to get the debug menu to let me right-click on aerodynamic surfaces to get their aero forces, only on non-aero parts. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022\u003E On the other hand, it looks cool, and makes sense on a real airplane so it stays. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe design choices did mean tuning PA was surprisingly tricky. At once point I managed to get the pitch controller to excite the bending mode of the fuselage, resulting in pretty crazy flutter on the control surfaces. Also, I didn\u0027t realize until pretty far into testing that the yaw became unstable at very low fuel and high altitude. Once tuned though, the airplane flies rock-solid.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTiny drag matters since I\u0027m flying nearly three Kerbin days. Originally I flew this with medium landing gear and didn\u0027t make it; I had to land on the next continent to the west. Then I did a test flight and found that the small gear have less than half the drag! Switched gear, and made it with 266 fuel left. (of 5640). These end up being too short, so the rear ones are on the engines. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022\u003E Likewise, the Telemachus antenna was making a surprisingly large amount of drag, so I set just that part\u0027s drag model to none in the cfg. With the spirit of the rules, I\u0027d argue, since it\u0027s doing nothing to actually make the airplane flyable, just means I don\u0027t have to be at my desk to know how it\u0027s going. Also, the ladder was making significant drag even when stowed, so I ditched it. Thus, no beauty shot with the pilots post-flight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe flight profile was actually optimized. I flew around for about an hour each at full and empty fuel, finding optimal altitude and speed, then calculated climb rate for the cruise-climb. Ideally the climb would be nonlinear, but since I set-and-forget for the entire cruise, it\u0027s linear between the two optimal points. It turns out good enough though.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSide effect of using all these wings: when empty, the stall speed is about 30 m/s! It might be even lower still; that\u0027s just the speed I rotated when taking off for the empty-fuel test flight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdvanced canard winglets: originally to look cool, then adjusted their angle to trim the airplane for the cruise climb at neutral elevator (not how you\u0027d do it on a real airplane, but I couldn\u0027t adjust wing incidence precisely enough).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-02T01:22:33Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2015 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lemon1324\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEmphasize needing to restart KSP mid flight :0.0: / Update imgur embed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T09:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou...
