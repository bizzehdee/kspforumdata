I was wondering if there are any ways to get this debris out of orbit; I\\\u0027ve tried sending a really basic craft full of flammable items into space while the debris is directly overhead, but it\\\u0027s EXTREMELY difficult to crash into the debris that only consists of a fuel pod and a liquid engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mogadishu","CreatedById":4041,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-21T23:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDouble click on the engine while flying another ship (in map mode) and click \u0027End Flight\u0027.
