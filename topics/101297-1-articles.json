GPWS means \u0022ground proximity warning system\u0022, a terrain awareness and alerting system. I also add TCAS (\u0022traffic collision avoidance system\u0022) warning.\n\n![t980Na2.png](http://i.imgur.com/t980Na2.png)\n\n**How to Use**\n\n\\* For planes:\n\nFly an aircraft with landing gear(s). (It should have a ModuleWheelDeployment \u0026\u0026 ModuleWheelBrakes, or FSwheel module.) If you enabled system in GPWS Settings, You should hear sounds when you are landing/crashing.\n\nYou can edit GPWS.cfg to add more types of landing gear.\n\n\\* For Landers:\n\nIt will warn you if it thinks you are crashing.\n\nThis mod adds a button on blizzy78\u0027s toolbar / applaunch toolbar. Click it to open GUI to edit settings or view current warning status. You are free to turn off warnings you don\u0027t want to hear.\n\nYou can edit settings.cfg for more accurate adjustment.\n\nP.S.1. This mod uses feet for plane altitude.\n\nP.S.2. Change \u0022Descent Rate Factor\u0022 to allow faster/slower sink rate. (Set to 2 means you are allowed to sink 2 times faster than default.)\n\n**Supported Warning List**\n\n\\*Plane:\n\n- sink rate\n\n- sink rate, whoop whoop pull up\n\n- terrain, terrain\n\n- terrain, terrain, whoop whoop pull up\n\n- don\u0027t sink\n\n- too low gear\n\n- too low terrain\n\n- bank angle\n\n- altitude callout (1000, 500, approaching minimus, minimus, 100, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10)(use feet by default)\n\n- (reduce thrust)\n\n- traffic\n\n- v1, rotate\n\n- gear up\n\n- (stall) (joystick vibration tested on x1 controller) (I don\u0027t think it will work on linux or osx)\n\n\\*Lander\n\n- sink rate\n\n- horiontal speed\n\n- altitude callout (1000, 500, 100, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10)(use meter by default)\n\n- (reduce thrust)\n\n**Download**\n\n[https://github.com/bssthu/KSP_GPWS/releases](https://github.com/bssthu/KSP_GPWS/releases)\n\n**Installation**\n\nJust copy the contents of the archive to KSP\u0027s root folder.\n\nXInputInterface.dll is needed for joystick shake. You can get it from addon \u0022Advanced Fly-By-Wire\u0022.\n\n~~You need ModuleManager to make it work.~~\n\n**Source**\n\n[https://github.com/bssthu/KSP_GPWS](https://github.com/bssthu/KSP_GPWS)\n\n**ChangeList**\n\n\\*v0.3.9\n\n- Recompile for KSP v1.4.4  \n\n- fix joystick shake\u0027s bug  \n\n- improve TOO\\_LOW\\_TERRAIN warning\n\n(more at github release page)\n\n**TODO List** (maybe)\n\n- Add warnings for overspeed, windshear\n\n- Not shake joystick when using keyboard\n\n- Draw curves in game\n\n**License**\n\n![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
