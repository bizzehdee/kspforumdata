It could lose a little mass, maybe produce some blue or black smoke for a while or even burn. This way CoM remains roughly the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samhuk","CreatedById":221604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T15:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea Azimech, I think it has been on lots of people\u0027s minds to improve the FX. I have posted some threads before along this road, about increasing the game\u0027s FX and \u0027immersive\u0027 feelings. However, I got flamed for everything, so ever since I feel the need to inform/bring to reality these kind of suggestions...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid to say this is what KSP development is and most likely always will be, getting bogged down with more low-level aspects, and just implementing a barely-working, placeholder high-level systems (aerodynamic system, engine FX, entire game, etc.). FX and other surface features like your idea, they have always been placeholders holding a place for nothing to come. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short, I doubt no-one will give two seconds with engine FX I\u0027m afraid.
