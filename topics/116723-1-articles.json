Is this issue a bug in the game, the kraken thing, or part of the game? It has not only destroyed my current mission vessel, but anything that I was targeting to or what was targeted to it as well. Anyone else have similar issues?![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T14:09:33Z","Content":"There are times when gigantic ships with enormous part counts and complicated, unstable, wobbly structure will simply implode when switching focus to it, because physics suddenly gets applied to it all in one frame. The solution is to not build such monstrosities, or use the Kerbal Join Reinforcement (KJR) mod."},{"CreatedByName":"MrWolf83","CreatedById":141199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T14:14:43Z","Content":"The few times this has happened to me it involved mainly the Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port. So, I\u0027m thinking there\u0027s something in the programming with that particular part, but that\u0027s just me using deductive reasoning, cause my few ships that this happened to haven\u0027t been that large or complicated."}]}
