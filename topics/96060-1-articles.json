OKAY, i thought, cant be THAT difficult, but i cant manage to actually orbit kerbit once i reached space because if i place radial mounted engines above the booster, all i\u0027m able to achieve is spinning my rocket wildly around... so maybe anyone has a good idea for me how i can lift that big boy up? thanks in advance for your time!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-09T00:07:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2015 12:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Armarnis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T23:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what the difficulty is.
