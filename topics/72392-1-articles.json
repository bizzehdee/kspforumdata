It gives career mode many more possibilities for a player. It also opens up a whole new realm of mods and add-ons players can add. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReputation and funds will be more limiting factors along the line of the tech tree and science. Now here is where my prediction really takes off, as what i have said so far is general and almost promised simply by each parts name. (contracts bring contracts, budgets brings some sort of funds etc etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Contracts- will become a semi-optional \u0022quest like\u0022 system.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts should be varied and optional. But their rewards should be beyond functional. The rewards are the main reason why .24 is being held back according to the Devs. Without budgets(the main resource IMO) Contracts have little weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVariations of contract rewards should include: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting Extra funds, getting extra science, and getting extra reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wont go into detail of what i feel the contracts should look like, as they really can look like anything. This is why The contract system is very important to career mode. It opens A LOT of doors simultaneously to KSP career mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have come to a realization that Contracts could also phase out the current way of getting science. Instead of direct experiment - to science transfer, contracts could act as a middle man. That would act as a guide to getting science. Grab a contract to do an experiment in a certain biome on the mun, and get reputation and science for it. Its a perfect way to make more sense of unlocking science currently, add visible goals to complete and give repercussions for failed expectations in missions. The only issue is there are a huge number of experiments possible, and it may be to much or to limiting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Reputation- will be a repercussion resource\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far we know Reputation will impact the game enough that you can LOSE your career mode because your reputation is so bad. (no more killing kerbals for fun!) Beyond that, reputation could impact gameplay very little, to a lot. Little changes could be not meeting contract deadlines or specifics. Big changes could mean removal of revert flight buttons and or quick save options (then missions will have REAL REALLY impactful repercussions!, i doubt this would occur)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, its integration with the contract system should also mean there are ways to utilize contracts to gain or lose more reputation. Such as successful completion of a contract grants more reputations, failure grants negative rep etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Budgets- will be the primary resource for missions themselves\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBudgets will be the strength behind scientific research. Whats the use of getting a new engine if you can\u0027t afford to utilize it often because its to expensive for every launch? Budget implications can range from single launch requirements(budget for a single mission contract) to an all encompassing program. Where every launch takes funds from your program. Regardless of how far the budgets reach, funds will force missions to be smaller and more efficient. No longer should you be able to build the biggest asparagus staging in the first few launches to go to other planets. Such builds would be easy to get tech wise, but be a costly and inefficient endeavor financially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf budgets are all encompassing (the most interesting option IMO) Contracts are going to provide income for the space program. Which will be the rewards the dev\u0027s talked about for their reason on holding back the .24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eupdate. This goes back to how Contracts will be a semi-optional system. Launches can still be done for \u0022fun\u0022 or larger goals than a direct contract to mission system (a contract applies to a single launch) such as a multi launch mission to duna. But in the end your missions must make up for their costs somehow, by being useful in a contract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe addition of Budgets to .24 will bring the biggest portion of Career mode to the game in one go at one time. The withholding of the update until the addition of budgets is a smart move by the development team. As they said, contracts with only science and reputation to play around with doesn\u0027t seem very rewarding. There are repercussions (reputation) and rewards (more science) but without budgets not taking contracts at all still is easily possible. With Budgets, contracts hold rewards, and launches for science hold costs. This could mean .24 could easily be the defining career mode update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be th first update that will create a true space program in career mode. Rather than a space simulator/sandbox game with a tech tree, Career will present a player with the challenge of running a Space Program with funding and goals to be meet. That is after jeb takes his new rocket for a ride into the side of the VAB ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.24 should hold great things, and should bring some of the most impact changes to career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS. I also predict that the said changes will \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT MAKE THE GAME MUCH HARDER\u003C/strong\u003E rather it will make it a little more challenging. But things such as the size of budgets will probably be forgiving and the reward for contract completion will be very satisfying. As the game is not fun if it is to much of a grind. The Semi-optional design of contracts should allow plenty of fun and failure missions to still exist in career mode as they already do in sandbox. Maybe in the future a difficulty setting could be added to change the resource makeup, as having a smaller budget and harsher repercussions for failure could create a very difficult game without changing anything more than starting money. (very much in the way of a tycoon game) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet still allow a casual player to play without to much worry he is going to lose the game in a few launches because he doesn\u0027t know what he is doing.

If you get full value for the cost of parts then fuel will be \u0022free\u0022 as you are not actually re-using an SSTO/jet, but fully recovering what you launched then re-launching that set of parts.

The fuel is not free, but it represents less than the 10% of the rockets cost; reusable first stages will lead to a launch cost of an order of magnitude less than nowadays cost. So, what I mean is that free fuel isn\u0027t a bad approximation at all, although personally I\u0027d prefer that it costed something (but if you get an orange tank back, if you are going to use it again you just pay for the fuel, not the whole orange tank...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T19:34:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ToTheMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ToTheMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf your parts cost though the budgets system, could you make reusable crafts and/or parachute the parts back to kerbin to sort of get your money back for bringing the part back down in one piece?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could, but with the current system landing stuff you would have to litterally watch the thing the whole way down to earth. Otherwise past the rez limit, the part would go back on rails. When it hits the surface it would be deleted parachutes or not. So reusing things with parachutes is totally plausable, its kind of annoying to do with the current system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Regex- middle of the tech SSTO shuttles are pretty easy to build. Its only when you start talking about payloads things get a little fuzzy. Getting kerbals into orbit may seem like a feat, but what would they do up there that would progress your career mode? Not really much, which is why it they shouldn\u0027t really cost anything, since they give you nothing in return. Now there could totally be a \u0022space tourism\u0022 contract where you bring civilian kerbals to space or something (sounds freaken cool!) which could be abused with free fuel and SSTO\u0027s, but otherwise its again more of a niche roll with or without fuel costs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving fuel costs is a minor detail. It would only make sense for it to cost something to pay for fuel. I just don\u0027t know if such a detail is worth building a whole section of the budget calculation around. Even with the fuel costs SSTO\u0027s wouldn\u0027t be hindered very much, especially if they are small. A small jet tank couldn\u0027t cost much otherwise rocket costs would be astronomical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@armchairgravy - i read your post and thought this was going to be the answer haha. Until i relized this could be sidesteped by just never recovering the craft in the first place. Land it, use the claw or a hard to aim docking port and dump new fuel into the old ship. Gameplay wise it would work, and it shouldn\u0027t cost any more than the average system(you recover maybe a cheaper system of a mobile fuel tank with claw) but it would just be more of a pain to do, which isnt exactly what we want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T20:39:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStreetwind suggested on this discussion \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79060-The-Career-Mode-Triangle-%28TM%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79060-The-Career-Mode-Triangle-%28TM%29\u003C/a\u003E that there may be a difference between \u0022budgets\u0022 and \u0022currency\u0022. Currency is what most people (including myself) expect - some number of credits that goes down when you buy stuff and up when you accomplish something. A \u0022budget\u0022 on the other hand would be a fixed limit every time you launch a spacecraft. There could be long term and short term ways to increase a particular launches budget but there would not be a running total to worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this budget idea solves some problems in a clever way, a career wouldn\u0027t sink because you blew your entire bank account on a launch that failed. It would also prevent several forms of reusable OCD - it doesn\u0027t matter if you parachute return each and every stage because your next launch will have its own budget and it will not be dependent on how thrifty the current launch is. Similarly, SSTO\u0027s would not be the end-all-be-all due to stinginess, though you might find motivation for SSTO\u0027s via contracts (\u0022do x, y, z, and return safely without decouplers\u0022 or something similar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope Streetwind is correct, that we get some clever budget system and not just a bank account. Even though it is not the most obvious path, I can see it feeling very natural and solving a lot of concerns people have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
