But recently, a friend gave me a Mcrosoft Surface 2 Pro that he no longer wanted (thanks, John!), so while testing it out I installed KSP 1.0.5 (which I hadn\u0027t even bothered with during my hiatus). Wow... you can forget a lot about how to play KSP if you don\u0027t touch it for six months! Now what was the key shortcut for that thing again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlaying KSP wasn\u0027t particularly impressive on the Surface, but this got me to finally install version 1.0.5 on my main computer (which is a Mac), and I was having fun again. After messing around a while, I decided to dig out the old Save game and test a few ships that I had been working on in 1.0.4, as well as let the 1.0 hammer hit my universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing I wanted to do in version 1.0 was try to fly a plane (because the aerodynamics were supposed to change radically from version 0.90). So in 0.90 I built the C724, a 24-passenger airliner that I practiced with and could land reliably. Let\u0027s see how the landing went for Kerbin Airlines veterans Pilot Billbo Kerman and Co-pilot Bobo Kerman, bringing flight KAL 100 in for an early morning landing at KSC, as the 1.0 hammer hits:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fyY3a1j.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fyY3a1j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBobo: \u0022Whoa!

And KAL flight 033 from South City did not make it, having to ditch into the sea not far from KSC when it ran out of fuel. Hotshot pilot Valentina Kerman took out a Mallard (one of my seaplane designs) to check out the crash site, but when she tried to land the Mallard near the crash site, her plane also crashed into the sea.

Only noticeable for certain reactions at high temperatures...but it\u0027s a problem for the NERV engines. We aren\u0027t going to be able to run oxidizer through them anymore. Even the commercial power plants had to shut down until they can make enough coolant that is free of contaminants that are now causing corrosion problems.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nKurt: \u0022So what does that do to the nuclear tugs that are supposed to be our ride home?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob: \u0022The engineers are already modeling advanced versions of the tugs that carry only liquid fuel. For the older tugs, we will have to dump the oxidizer and take the big delta-V hit. Plus, with only the liquid fuel, tests are showing severe overheating problems can occur. We are working on control software changes...but the old tugs may just have to be used at less than full throttle. Even worse...the changes in the physics may not have settled down yet.

But the changes in turbulent mixing physics has a big effect on rocket motor injector design. The 48-7S Spark engine, in particular, has taken a big Isp hit.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nKurt: \u0022That\u0027s one of our most important engines.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob: \u0022I know...and we are uploading control software changes so they won\u0027t explode on you...but they will be much less effective. Your Duna Fidos, for example, are NOT going to be able to hop back to orbit...or very far at all. Basically, they\u0027re only going to be useable as surface rovers wherever you land them. Also, they will have to rest more often while roving because all solar panels are now less effective.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nKurt: \u0022What\u0027s the problem with the solar panels?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob: \u0022Well, you know how solar panles work, right?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nHellou: \u0022They generate electricity by both the Photovoltaic and Energy Harvester effects.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob: \u0022Right. Except the Harvester effect has vanished. The physics is just gone.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nHellou: \u0022Gone? But...then the panel energy output will drop off with the square of the distance from the Sun...\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob: \u0022Yes. And if you think that\u0027s bad for you, think about how it\u0027s going to affect the guys on Laythe. But the upshot is that your DunaDog planes are effectively useless.

Your EVA suits appear to be fine, and the surface driving features of the rovers appear to work, so you\u0027ll probably be able to continue your surface exploration plans. We think your Duna Base ships can still reach orbit, so you aren\u0027t trapped there. But for a while longer...yes, you are effectively on vacation.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nHellou: \u0022Arrgh.

We may have to skip a launch window to get all of it to you. Plus, the guys on Laythe are going to need redesigned equipment, too.

And when I made a new version that worked, later fractional updates killed those (again, because of further degrading of the jet-engine performance of the RAPIERs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT...with the simple application of MOAR BOOSTERS (or, more RAPIERs in this case), and a cutting of mass and fine balancing of fuel loads, I present to you: SSTO Crew Carrier 9e:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dALq7J0.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dALq7J0.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Crew Carrier 9e can carry four passengers to Kerbin orbit with delta-V to spare for orbital operations. Also, the craft is fully reusable and can return its crew safely to Kerbin. Note that the propellant levels in some of the tanks must be changed as shown above. The Mk2 Rocket Fuel Fuselage needs to contain only liquid fuel (the forward tank is full of \u00A0fuel and oxidizer), and the six FL-T400 tanks need to have oxidizer reduced to 154 units each. Without these changes, the ship boosts too slowly and is too aerodynamically unstable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Crew Carrier lifts off with all six RAPIERs in air-breathing mode at 100% throttle (see below).

Below we see it pitched to 45 degrees at about 3000 meters, and its on its way to a pitch angle of about 20 degrees above horizontal -- the pitch is held about there for most of the ascent. When doing the pitch down, don\u0027t stray too far from the prograde marker on the NavBall, especially during the transonic region between 300-400 m/s, or the ship could flip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cr6kxVX.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cr6kxVX.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225uwWi40.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5uwWi40.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings get hot fast with six RAPIERS shoving the ship along on this flat trajectory, but nothing gets hot enough to explode at standard 1.0.5 settings...and you need the flat trajectory to give the RAPIERS longer time to burn its fuel using that sweet, sweet oxygen from the atmosphere. A somewhat-more-vertical ascent can work, but it isn\u0027t as efficient and you\u0027ll have less delta-V remaining in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RAPIERs will begin to flag at around 24,000 meters, but just watch the speed indicator to see when it stops increasing.

If necessary, the boosters can land just fine in the grass area north of the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK! Heavy lifter confirmed! And, in the real world where all the rocket parts could be tracked and controlled separately, we would have 100% reusability of the launch vehicle. In practice, of course, I will only follow the sustainer during a normal launch, happy in the \u0027knowledge\u0027 that my boosters can make it back to KSC on their own and not get dunked into the sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also tested the FUBARR with a 6.5-meter diameter aerodynamic payload fairing in place (since I\u0027m building all of my new Duna equipment to fit inside that size fairing, just for giggles), and it worked fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:28px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECockpit Calamity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile messing around on Duna, I quickly found a problem with version 1.0.5 and my old ships: The new Mark 1 Cockpit \u0022upgrade\u0022 makes many of my old vehicles unusable. See the Duna Fido rover below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZfP0xGv.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZfP0xGv.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is the relocated entry hatch of the new cockpit. The kerbalnaut can no longer exit the hatch (because it is blocked in its new location). In this case, I was able to get Kurt out of the ship by having him \u0022transfer\u0022 to the rear cabin module, and exit from there. But I have lots of rovers that use the Mk1 Cockpit (because of its high crash tolerance for safety), and some of them (the ones on Laythe, for example) don\u0027t have extra cabins to allow kerbalnaut entrance and egress. Bugger. Not only that, but all of my BirdDog planes and Laythe Spaceplanes and DunaDog planes have wings, canards, or intakes that have problems with the new hatch location. Double bugger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat to do, what to do. I\u0027ve heard people in the past say \u0022If you don\u0027t like some new part, just add the old part back in so you can keep it, too.\u0022 OK... I haven\u0027t liked the idea of retaining old parts before, but I can\u0027t see any other way around the problem. So I tried putting the old Mk1 Cockpit (from 1.0.4) into version 1.0.5 ...but I\u0027m apparently not doing something right. (see below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MVCPoGk.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MVCPoGk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI changed all the names of Mark1 Cockpits in my old save file to Mark1a Cockpits, and tried to change all the references from 1 to 1a in the Part Config file that I brought over from 1.0.4 and renamed 1a (and brought over the old internal Space as well)... but I ended up with the all-white cockpit seen above. Also...Kerbals can go into the white cockpit, but their pictures don\u0027t show up down in the corner of the screen. So I guess I have more work to do. Or, if you are wise in the ways of saving old parts, maybe you can clue me in on what I\u0027m doing wrong. Oh...and I see I have a flat tire that needs to be fixed, too (that probably happened when Kurt and Hellou drove down from the top of the Duna Pyramid).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:28px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuture Fido\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with the new Mk1 Cockpit inspired me to re-work the Duna Fido 3 rovers that I was going to send out with the next armada to Duna. These will be simpler rovers because they wouldn\u0027t have the \u0022hop back to orbit\u0022 capability of the previous Duna Fido...they would be cheaper surface-driving-only rovers that could be dropped onto Duna at various locations as the explorers needed them. But the design I had previously made for the new rovers had the same hatch access problem with the Mk1 Cockpit (which really isn\u0027t suited for rover use in its new form).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, since the new Mk1 Inline Cockpit now has an internal view (finally) and top canopy access, I redesigned the Duna Fido 3 to use that cockpit. It still has very good crash safety tolerance, and it has an even better IVA with a great view of the surrounding terrain. As long as I was at it, I removed the girder truss-work that formed much of the structure of my older Fidos (I think that truss work contributes to lag). I aso removed the solar panels and went solely with RTG power (all the best red planet rovers use RTG power!). Below we see the new Duna Fido (without its detachable landing hardware) being tested at the KSC. It still has room for a crew of two (who can take turns in the comfy rear cabin), and a Granny Klampett chair on top for better visibility of the landscape. Plus, lots of Science instruments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aLKU1Nf.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aLKU1Nf.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are wondering about the unusual wheel arrangement, that is because a stack of these rovers is designed to fit inside a 6.5-meter fairing on top of a FUBARR. Yes, there is clipping and offset involved in the structure of the rover...but in real life engineers would cut the appropriate slots in those plates as needed. It is quite stable in driving tests, and I like the new cockpit. Hmm... maybe I should change all the old Mark 1 Cockpits in my save game to Mark 1 Inline Cockpits... No. That might work fine for rovers, but not for planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZePhYMh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZePhYMh.jpg\u0022\u003E \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOoooo...wait, wait, wait! A new inline crew cabin...fits two kerbals. But if I only use one kerbal in there at a time, I can use that as the mini-hab/lab for the new Fido. The advantage? I never did like the very low crash tolerance of the lander cabin...it was even safer to have the second kerbal riding in the chair on top of the rover instead of being in the cabin. But the Mk1 Inline Crew Cabin has a great impact tolerance. Safety first, kiddies! Pardon me while I re-make a rover in the middle of writing this report....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...annnnd, back!

And stick a ladder under the hatch. Hmmm...I could leave off the front nose cone and use the hatch on the front of the Mk1 Inline Cockpit (with a ladder) to let the kerbal get in the cockpit from the surface...but on Duna, the kerbal can just fly up on top to the canopy entrance, or transfer from the rear hab...and I\u0027ve gotten used to the look of the nose cone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat wraps it up for now!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-20T19:51:04Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2016 07:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
