With wind power, we would have to erect millions of windmills worldwide to satisfy power demands, which would cause changes in weather patterns and affect wildlife and environments. Solar is inefficient and would require covering up huge tracts of land with panels, which would greatly impact the environment, and possibly affect weather and world temperatures.

We could either have massive solar plants orbiting earth, or orbiting the sun. The moon is a possibility, but we would have to build sites all the way around its circumference because the 14 day night period would leave us high and dry each fortnight. The main difficulty in this idea is delivering the power from space to earth. The most common idea is microwaves but that would require a receiver on earth to be several km in diameter to be able to produce about the amount of a nuclear power plant. I have a feeling lasers might work in someway, but I don\u0027t think many people would like the idea of any government having a massive laser traversing the earth a dozen times per day, and there are other problems as well, like losses to superheated atmosphere.
