You could very well be after a big amount of rocket delta-v for other reasons, like using it for interplanetary travel. But just to clarify, yes, that design I posted is clipped as hell (I basically hid all the intakes inside the fuselage1), but you can see (and click!) all the tanks, and its not a two-kerbal design... the middle body is a hitchhiker module, so you can get by on a really tiny amount of fuel (one FL-T400\u002B45l of liquid fuel per engine!). To lift the three-kerbal tin can, I actually have another design much more like the one Scott uses, only resized for an unmodded kerbin (the mod of his that limits performance the most is interstellar, which makes jet engines overheat when going fast, that\u0027s why he needs so much rocket fuel, and therefore so many engines to lift off). Which means half the engines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/0OTTgd6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0OTTgd6.png\u0022 alt=\u00220OTTgd6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I put it there mostly so you can see the intake trick. They are stacked with part clipping to a column of cubic struts. It looks cool, and it\u0027s the best way to emulate B9\u0027s intakes with stock parts I\u0027ve seen, both in looks and performance. Plenty of excess delta-v in that design, BTW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. Chutes are entirely optional, of course... in fact they usually only guarantee the survival of the pilots if you don\u0027t have fuel to slow down before they fully open, the heavy RAPIERS have a tendency to pull everything else not directly connected to the chutes much faster to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T21:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI might do something like this...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
