Problems modding.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA long Early Access roadmap is not good news for modders. As features are added, changed, and deleted from KSP 2, mods are going to be constantly rendered incompatible or obsolete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re buying into EA. That\u0027s literally an expectation that mods can and will break. There\u0027s no avoiding it. Even outside of EA, mods will continue to break with updates. Incompatible mods are something that can\u0027t be avoided and shouldn\u0027t be worried about as the modders here are quite passionate about their mods and will fix them. As for obsolete mods, that\u0027s not a bad thing, that\u0027s actually a good thing! If a feature becomes stock, and it\u0027s done really well to the point that the mod is not needed, then that is a good thing IMO. Modders fill \u0027holes\u0027 in the game. If the hole is filled by the devs, then that\u0027s good. Yes, it sucks that the modder\u0027s mod is not useless, or at least not needed, but that doesn\u0027t mean the modder will stop necessarily. The stock version of the mod might have done something differently that people didn\u0027t like and so they\u0027ll stick with the mod. KSP 1 for instance. The stock robotics are kind of a joke. That\u0027s why people stick with IR.

I personally think the EA process is really smart and breaking off and layering in each major system seems like a really good way to get concerted, somewhat focused feedback and is probably the best way to achieve a good game. Most of the build-order on the roadmap seems pretty logical and obvious, but there were a couple of things that stood out to me--science not being part of the initial release and resources coming so late. I think I know why they\u0027ve planned it that way but there are pros and cons.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Science waiting till the 1st update: This one is not terribly surprising. I fully expect there to be a huge batch of first-day bugs (there always are) and for things to be a bit shaky as the first few hot-fixes roll out to patch them. This might even take a couple of months. At the same time thats happening I expect there\u0027s going to be a wealth of feedback on core systems, ideas for how to improve UI, basic to advanced flight information and how its presented, overall engine balance and visual improvements, aerodynamic issues--all that. I imagine the thinking is they\u0027d rather just get the base foundation of the game as tight as it can be before introducing science and tech trees because it means more players will have time to test everything the game has to offer more quickly. The drawback, as pointed out in the Hype thread, is that for new players the best place to start is probably Science mode, at least initially, so they can learn the game without being completely overwhelmed by hundreds of parts out of the gate. I think that just can\u0027t be helped, but hopefully within a few months science mode will be out and (hopefully) the base game will be running more or less smoothly and we\u0027re off to the races.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Resources coming after Colonies and Interstellar: This one was particularly surprising to me when it was announced. Again in some ways I think it kind of can\u0027t be helped. You\u0027re certainly going to need colonies before resources have a place to be processed, but the plan is to wait until the \u003Cem\u003Esecond star system is introduced\u003C/em\u003E to build in probably the most complex system in the game. Again, I think the primary motivation is to allow the largest possible number of players really stretch their legs, check and test most every colony and engine system at no cost before they noodle into the incredibly difficult process of balancing resource abundance, distribution, and harvesting and processing rates. They\u0027ll have a much better idea how easy or difficult it should be to produce He3 and huge interstellar engines once they see the kind of vessels players typically build.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain though, this does come with drawbacks. The biggest Im guessing is that the resource update may more or less require players to start a new save for all the systems to work properly. Presumably before resource harvesting exists reactors won\u0027t require fuel, because where would it come from? Likewise if (as many of us hope) there is a simple LS/Snacks system with greenhouses as soon as you install the resources update these will be lacking inputs all across your game. With no resource cost for colonies players are likely to go hog wild building huge cities that they have no way to support. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s bad that resources will probably mean players start a new save, after all if you\u0027ve been playing Sandbox EA you\u0027ll need to start a new save to experience the science system as well. Near the beginning and near the end are probably the best two times to nudge players into starting anew so they can really experience everything in full. But, it will make other systems like science difficult to balance through most of the EA process because right at the end there\u0027s going to be huge new host of resource scanning, mining, and processing tech to unlock that won\u0027t be accounted for in the balance. This probably means running science a bit hot through most of EA, hoping that the excess is soaked up when players have a bunch of drills and factories to unlock.\u00A0The other thing that occurs to me is that if there is a simple LS system its probably best introduced with resources because that will be a natural kind of break for players to start over anyway.

As features are added, changed, and deleted from KSP 2, mods are going to be constantly rendered incompatible or obsolete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCitation needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/profile/Snark\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emy experience creating mods for the original KSP\u003C/a\u003E for the past 8 years or so, \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffff00;\u0022\u003Emy expectation is precisely the opposite\u003C/span\u003E.\u00A0 I expect modding KSP2 to be great, and I don\u0027t expect mods to be breaking all the time, and I look forward to making new mods as we progress through the roadmap and new features become available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy rationale:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I first started modding KSP, the game was still on 1.0.x.\u00A0 Now we\u0027re on 1.12.x. During that time, they\u0027ve added \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etons\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of stuff to the game, including pretty big sweeping architectural changes such as when they made everything localizable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you know what?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a modder, it\u0027s been an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eincredibly seamless experience\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Whenever a new major KSP release came out... my mods almost never broke, at all, even across multiple major KSP releases.\u00A0 As in, I didn\u0027t need to touch one line of code, or even recompile.\u00A0 The same darn zip file just continued to work.\u00A0 And on the (very) few occasions where I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edid\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E need to make an update-- such as when KSP shifted the major version of the .NET platform it used-- the amount of work I needed to do to get the mods going again was trivially lightweight, and I was back up and running with a new published version of the mod within a day or two, at most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short:\u00A0 KSP version updates did not inconvenience me as a modder, and did not inconvenience the users of my mods, either.\u00A0 They didn\u0027t break.\u00A0 They just kept working.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I did occasionally have a mod here and there that became \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eobsolete\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, because I wrote the mod to address some shortcoming in the game, and then those rascally devs went and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efixed the game\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E so that my mod was no longer necessary, but I view that as a good sort of \u0022problem\u0022 to have.)\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, AFAICT, this was true of almost \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeveryone\u0027s\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E mods, not just my own:\u00A0 I use other people\u0027s mods too, and those generally kept working after a KSP update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason for that is that the new updates mostly \u003Cstrong\u003Eadded new stuff\u003C/strong\u003E rather than changing how old stuff worked, and the engineers-- who are competent-- made a reasonable good-faith effort not to hork all the mods.\u00A0 Because they know mods are important, and they know lots of users use them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact:\u00A0 having a deep roadmap for KSP2, with big additions planned, makes me \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emore\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E confident about the stability of modding rather than less.\u00A0 Why?\u00A0 Because if the engineers \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eknow\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E ahead of time that they\u0027re going to be making great big major additions to the game, they have a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of incentive to architect it in a way that is not going to force a complete rewrite of the architecture every time.\u00A0 They don\u0027t want to rewrite all their code any more than modders do.\u00A0\u00A0 (Source:\u00A0 have been working as a professional software engineer for 25 years.)\u00A0 This gives them a reason to plow effort into cleanly modular separation of code.\u00A0 If \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethey\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E don\u0027t have to rewrite their code, it makes it less likely that modders will, either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn summary:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me to assume that KSP2 is going to be a rougher ride than KSP1 was in that regard, I would have to grant \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of the following assumptions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThat the KSP2 team doesn\u0027t care about modding.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThat the KSP2 team hasn\u0027t learned any useful lessons from observing the KSP1 experience.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThat the KSP2 engineers are not good at their jobs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe none of those to be the case.\u00A0 I believe that they really \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eget it\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E when it comes to modding.\u00A0 I believe that the team gets it, and I believe that Nate Simpson gets it.\u00A0 I mean, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E gets it.\u00A0 I\u0027ve met the guy in person and had a chance to interview him one-on-one for half an hour, back in the day, and he\u0027s one of the few people I\u0027ve ever met who\u0027s more of a raving KSP fanboi than \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EI\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E am-- he loves this game so much it\u0027s palpable, he practically \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Evibrates\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E when he talks about it, and this does not strike me as someone who\u0027s going to drop the ball.\u00A0 I asked pointed questions about modding, and it was clear that they want the KSP2 modding experience to be even more amazing than KSP1, and I believe them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could be wrong, of course-- I don\u0027t \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E what the future holds any more than you do.\u00A0 But \u0022it\u0027ll be fine\u0022 feels to me like a pretty confident assumption, based on having been there and done that with modding KSP1 over most of the past decade, and nothing I\u0027ve seen or heard from the KSP2 team has shaken that confidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo anyway, those are my reasons for thinking that.\u00A0 Out of curiosity, what are your reasons for thinking it\u0027ll be problematic?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-04T02:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread closed by \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
