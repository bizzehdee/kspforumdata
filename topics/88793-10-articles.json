The current stockpile (with both a Dragon and a Progress having just left the station in the past week) is at the high end, and even if the new Progress had failed and the December Dragon launch was scrubbed, the crew could stay aboard into March or April without any further resupplies.

So why build big structures to protect props that will not be needed untill the next launch, or if you can just keep dangerous stuff off site? I wonder if any of those tanks contained anything.
