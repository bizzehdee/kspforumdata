Only a moment after the lock bolt slid home, her composure failed, and she fled to the towering not-glass case in the next room. For an instant, reason itself failed her, and she reached out for the scepter...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe jolt threw her across the room.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer bustle absorbed most of the impact as she hit the floor and slid to a rough stop against the far wall. She sat there, slumped, shoulders fluttering, not sure if she was crying or laughing. She cradled one hand, hoary frost clinging to her fingertips where they had touched the glass that wasn\u0027t glass. It trailed down her fingers, and along her palm, in wandering, jagged lines that belied the nerves beneath her skin, before disappearing into the long sleeve of her gown. She didn\u0027t need to look to know the same jagged lines wound their way up her arm, to the gold-set M\u00FCnstone around her neck. Nor did she need to touch her fingers to it to feel the cold, but did so out of habit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was a foolish thing to do, she \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that, but a forgivable lapse of reason. She was, after all, only Kerbal, like anyone else. There was no point in scourging herself over it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old goats would see to \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E, she thought with a huff. They, of course, had felt it too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSighing, she pulled herself to her feet and smoothed her skirts. She walked back to the case once more, and touched her fingers to it lightly, the frost already melted. She felt the familiar thrumming run up her arm, felt the M\u00FCnstone again turn to ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutposts on the M\u00FCn. Waystations in space. Concoctions of metal and electronics traversing the abyss of space to other planets. And driving all of it, chemistry, and physics, and \u003Cem\u003Eequations\u003C/em\u003E. They were creations of Kermanity, yet her own mind struggled to comprehend those equations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for that, she was glad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt gave her humility. And understanding. Her eyes, as always, fell upon the golden scepter. The same brilliant minds who wielded those equations would struggle to comprehend what was within these layers of gold, as much as she, herself, struggled to comprehend their equations. She withdrew her hand, flexing it slightly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose who had crafted what was within that scepter, and the other things... they had understood the equations, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the transcendent. From that, their power had been beyond imagination. They had done wondrous things. Wondrous... and terrible. To even \u003Cem\u003Econtemplate\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0their works, she was as an ape before the equations. But apes \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0quite intelligent, and they \u003Cem\u003Elearn\u003C/em\u003E. And now, an ape not much different than herself had found \u003Cem\u003EIlamnedi\u00FAan\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA chill not at all related to the freezing M\u00FCnstone at her neck ran down her spine. The Empress left the case, and walked to her window overlooking the bustling city below. Whoever the poor creature was, her heart broke for him. Or her. \u003Cem\u003EIlamnedi\u00FAan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0would grant them power, of a sort... and suffering beyond words. It had taken her long, \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0long, to piece the puzzle together out of scraps of information from Roland and her other sources.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis poor soul, this \u003Cem\u003EAdversary\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0who now held the token had been working for years, chided on by its whispers. And now, by its design three more poor souls had been to the \u003Cem\u003EDal d\u0027Shadarn\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0on the M\u00FCn, and were no doubt tainted by the Corruption. But \u003Cem\u003Ewhich\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0ones?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...there is another...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe hugged herself against the far more powerful shudder that now wracked her. If \u003Cem\u003Ehe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0were tainted...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, that was an outcome far too horrible for even her to consider, and beyond insurmountable. It must be the injured one. And likely the third. She had failed to see the Adversary\u0027s plans until it was too late, and now the Shadows of the Kraken would shortly be free to stalk the world. Kraken. Such a silly name, but as good as any other, she supposed. Outside, past the edge of the grand city, the last light of sunset fled the sky, as if perceiving what was to come. Two stars hung low above the horizon, one bright, and one dim. Eve, and Moho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...only the darkest heart can bear the Crown of Worms...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fate of the world now rested on the girl... and the boy. She was \u003Cem\u003Eso\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0strong, but still shackled by doubt. And even now, so innocent. To know the truth, even a \u003Cem\u003Efraction\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of it, would tear her open. Could she bear that?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...only the wounded soul can wield the Dominion Rod...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe boy... if he was tainted... by even the smallest measure...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSqueezing her eyes shut for a moment, to steady herself, the Empress turned back towards the case. Had she really become so hardened? If she had the power, would she really reach out and smite the tiny capsule from the sky for the sake of all the world? Her hand rose to the golden chain around her neck. It was a pointless inquest. Those old goats, \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0had all the power, the power of generations of her line... \u003Cem\u003Eand they had no idea how to use it\u003C/em\u003E... or what else lay beneath their beards.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe steeled herself. Already, she could sense their approach, but that was of no consequence. The ordeal to come, that was all that mattered. The Adversary would work from the shadows, as was his way. She would have to fight it on \u003Cem\u003Eits\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0terms, at least for now. Cat and mouse, move and countermove. It would move for Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then what? This truly was the dilemma of madness. If the Adversary found the prison there, and freed the \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0called Kraken, this world, this \u003Cem\u003Eexistence\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0would not end, but be inverted, into a pandemonium of insanity and unfathomable torment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in doing so, protect all the others.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-06T06:52:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2017 06:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-12T13:41:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n. . . . ?

The third planet of this remarkable star was home to curious beings, which was not \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0remarkable, and even \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0had begun to notice that something about their little corner of existence was just a bit... off. The thermonuclear furnace at the center of this star fused hydrogen into helium, which was not \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0remarkable, sending heat and light and energy out into its stellar system. The planets, asteroids, and assorted dust motes of this system followed logical, predictable orbits, which was also thoroughly unremarkable, and the denizens of the third planet, the most clever ones, at least, had taken note of this, and remarkably transcribed it into unremarkable equations describing the motions of the heavens.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is where the problems began.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese inquisitive and observant creatures had recently begun observing the billions of other stars sharing their galaxy, charting their motion, estimating their mass, predicting their courses. At first puzzled, they soon realized that all these other unremarkable stars needed a completely \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0set of equations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seemed their own star, called Kerbol by some, was entirely too large, while its planets were entirely too small.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to the physical laws of the rest of the observable universe, Kerbol and its motley collection of space rocks shouldn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ework\u003C/em\u003E. It shouldn\u0027t work at \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E. According the the equations, the densities were all wrong. If the Kerbol system suddenly began following the same laws that everyone else did, the result would be \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0remarkable, and also, extremely \u003Cem\u003Ebrief\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while this endlessly befuddled those who sat around discussing it, they could not deny the empirical evidence that they were, in fact, sitting around discussing it, and therefore, it must, in fact, work. So, like so many other things in their lives, they simply accepted it, without further questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestioning such things often had... unpleasant consequences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresently, from the edge of the photosphere of this remarkable nucleosynthetic furnace, a single, \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0unremarkable photon that had been blundering about inside for the last few dozen million years burst forth. It raced away from its birthplace at a speed that was both unremarkable and \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0remarkable, streaking, for no particular reason, in the direction of the closest planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrown and withered, itself a child of an unimaginable release of energy, Moho baked in the heat of that remarkable star. The photon whizzed past, its encounter lasting only a few seconds, oblivious to deep, dark pit it shot across at the planet\u0027s north pole. It smashed into a \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0unremarkable rock on a hill, and, in the way of photons, bounced off, now going in an entirely different direction at roughly the same speed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn just minutes more, it was charging toward the massive, bizarrely twisted world of Eve, forever shrouded in her royal veil. The photon penetrated only a small way into the soup-like atmosphere, unaware of the strangely shifting shadows far below, before hitting a molecule of purplonium and once more ricocheting off in a much different direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack across the not-quite-that-empty void of space, passing dust grains and errant hydrogen atoms and discarded rocket parts, toward a distant blue jewel. Not to be confused with the distant green Jool. The small planet swelled rapidly, clouds and oceans and landforms resolving themselves, and the photon might have wound up as a part of one of these, had it not crossed paths with a drifting satellite.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt hit a solar array first, but was one of the few not absorbed. It rebounded off the glass, glanced off a reflective gold foil thermal blanket, then found its way inside through an open inspection cover. Here, it bounced around randomly a few billion times before a last nudge from an out-of-place, tumbling, absolutely unremarkable bolt sent it through a plexiglass faceplate. It passed a cornea, was nudged again by a lense, and finally ended its long, mildly remarkable journey in the retina of Valentina Kermanova, who was, of course, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0remarkable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got you!\u0022 She huffed as her gloved hand closed around that wandering bolt, \u0022you uncooperative \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flash of static, \u0022ah, One, this is an open channel, mind the language, please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EHaah... haah\u003C/em\u003E... copy control,\u0022 she panted back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One, your heart rate is becoming a concern, please confirm you\u0027ve secured the object?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Confirmed, I have it,\u0022 puff, gasp, \u0022I am ok.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy, One.

Valentina kept a firm grip on the bolt as she was gently pulled backward out of the bowels of the satellite, her head threatening to start spinning in a way not at all related to the lack of gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Comrade Captain!\u0022 Said the new voice, \u0022you have-- oh, my...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Two, control, we didn\u0027t like that tone...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, Two, Comrade Captain\u0027s faceplate is completely fogged!

Your vitals are still of some concern. The Flight Surgeon is requesting you take a few minutes rest.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, I am all right to continue,\u0022 she rasped with a tongue that felt like sandpaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It was not a matter for discussion, One.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVasily clapped her shoulder in the slow, awkward way of spacewalkers, \u0022it is no trouble, Comrade Captain! You have done the hard part, take a moment to regroup, I will complete the repair.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina thought of arguing, but in all... she really could use a break, \u0022copy, control,\u0022 she said finally. She clapped Vasily back, then pushed off lightly. The tether running from the \u003Cem\u003EZarya\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0capsule nearby stopped her before she went far. Moving by feel, and from years of practiced muscle memory, she activated the stabilization routine on her suit controls and allowed herself to drift. Her arms stuck out to the sides from the stiff space suit, looking like a ridiculous impression of a bird trying to fly. That had always bothered her. Why not make the suits so the arms were \u003Cem\u003Eforward\u003C/em\u003E, where most of the work was done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe cocked her head, took a couple of gulps of water from the tube in her helmet, and just let herself drift in the moment of no obligations. Even for her, easily the most experienced Kerbonaut in the world, now, this was quite the rarity. Long ago, she\u0027d passed the point where she could no longer quite remember how many missions she\u0027d been on. Half a dozen six-month tours on TINKAN space stations, a week here or two there flying bioscience platforms, and an \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0long half-year excursion to deep space above Kerbin\u0027s orbit with Lujorie. The shorter ones... no, she had no idea how many, any more. What she always did remember, and never got tired of, was the view.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fans were gradually clearing the mist from her faceplate, and already she could see the endless ice sheets of the north polar cap far below. Looked to be a frightful storm blowing across the ice, too. No, Valentina certainly never got tired of \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E. She\u0027d often spent long hours watching, from whatever passed as her quarters at that moment, when she was supposed to be sleeping. Oddly, that had never bothered her. She never felt like she needed to sleep in space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two spacecraft and their pair of tethered spacewalkers drifted sedately southward, roughly following the terminator line far below. Mind drifting as well, Valentina\u0027s eyes traced the line of her own tether back to \u003Cem\u003EZarya 84\u003C/em\u003E. It floated in the void, exactly 10 meters from the malfunctioning weather satellite. Occasionally, she would see the faintest puff of exhaust from an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E nozzle, maintaining the position. She frowned.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t seem like that long ago, that \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0mission had to have a pilot. \u003Cem\u003ESome\u003C/em\u003Eone had to fly the ship, after all, just common sense. It was also common sense that such left only a single seat open for a scientist or engineer. As missions became longer and more complex, the trouble with this arrangement became clear. Now, there were very few pilots left, when they once made up a third of the Kerbonaut ranks, and they only flew on the rare launches of the larger \u003Cem\u003EKrasniyy Zarya\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0spacecraft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina was, as usual, the outlier. She had managed to earn an engineering degree to keep herself technically relevant, and her world-wide fame made it advantageous for the apparatchiks and kommissars to keep her on the active roster. She scowled down at her ship with a grudging respect.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechIVAN had fulfilled every promise of its designers, and well beyond. She didn\u0027t really have to \u0027fly\u0027 at all, anymore. Just push a few buttons, and the odd little box with the unblinking green light executed maneuvers with a precision and economy not even she could match. She never \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0been able to shake the feeling that light was staring at her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe collection of space vessels continued its southerly course, passing beyond the ice and over the turbulent green Northern Sea. The shadows of night were slowly creeping across Ryemnarg as they passed. In the distance, Valentina could just see the familiar shape of Kerfrica coming into view, and the tiny spit of land that held the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Foreigners. Once more the ebb and flow of relations between the Union and its... counterparts, had swung to the negative. The Gulf of Edinkurgh incident, the recognition of South Erakonia, the nuclear-powered rocket that didn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0make orbit. Tensions ran high again, over silly things that could be resolved with a conversation and copious consumption of surplus rocket fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t seem like that long ago Valentina had swung open the hatch at the end of a \u003Cem\u003EZarya\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0docking tunnel, reached through and shaken Chadvey Kerman\u0027s hand. The four Kerbonauts, not this-countrians or that-countrians, but simply \u003Cem\u003EKerbonauts\u003C/em\u003E, had spent thee days performing joint experiments, regaling each other with tall tales, and showing off what goodies they\u0027d managed to sneak on board without the Flight Directors noticing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings had seemed so full of promise, then. The small orbital module and docking adapter the KSA\u0027s Mule had brought was left in space, to be the keystone of a future cooperative station. Months later, a Mule with a full crew of three visited TINKAN 4, setting a shared record for the most people together in space that lasted a long time. Not long after, plans began to form for Valentina to return to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and fly on a fourth, extra mission to the Foreigners\u0027 Highlab station before it was retired. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then it all went to \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlans were delayed and budgets exceeded. Bureaucrats bureaucratized and apparatchiks apparatchiked. She never went to their station. Eventually, the module\u0027s orbit decayed and a half-full tank of toxic hydrazine survived re-entry and crashed into a village in Eduacor. The Union blamed the KSA. The KSA blamed the Union. Plans for cooperation evaporated. After a while the KSA used the resources they\u0027d allocated to build their \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0space station, grander than anything the Union had flown by then. Attitudes when back and forth, back and forth, friends one day, adversaries the next. Valentina didn\u0027t understand \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, things were as bad as she ever remembered. Two years ago, there was some sort of... incident, at the Foreigner\u0027s ill-conceived M\u00FCnbase. She\u0027d never understood \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E, either, why anyone would want to go to the M\u00FCn. The Union had never bothered, just a probe here or there, instead they focused on incremental improvement of long-term space endurance through space stations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe never heard what \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0happened up there. No one would talk about it. An odd measure of secrecy, especially for the KSA. Some said it was an equipment failure, like on that new space station two years before. Others said one of the crew, or all of the crew, couldn\u0027t handle the isolation and went mad. Still others said they found... something. Something they shouldn\u0027t have. And still others said they never really went there at all, that it was all just a grand hoax to shame the Ussari Union, which of course was really to benefit the shadow government that \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0ran the world at the behest of some ancient demigod from beyond reality.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever the truth was, diplomacy had only grown colder since then. Politics. Bah! Politics, politics, and \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0politics! She \u003Cem\u003Ehated\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0poli--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat on Kerbin is \u003Cem\u003Ethat?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Vasily... Vasily, do you see that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022See what, Comrade Captain?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just there,\u0022 she pointed, then realized how ridiculous that was from her position, \u0022equatorial orbit, just passing over the tip of Gednalna, toward the terminator.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm, I do not see anything, Comrade, but you have much better eyes than I.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, One, do you copy this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One, control... what is it you see? It it a collision threat?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. No, but... are you tracking anything large in KSA orbit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Negative, One. It\u0027s probably just their horrible space station. Pay it no mind.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No... no, I do not think so... it is too \u003Cem\u003Ebig!\u003C/em\u003E You really are not tracking anything?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have no uncatalogued contacts, One. What exactly are you seeing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It has form... It is not just a point of light. It looks like a string. I would guess, two hundred, maybe three hundred meters in length,\u0022 she strained her eyes until they ached, \u0022I can almost see more, like, spheres... Bah, it is too far away.\u0022 She watched it go, now backed by orbital night. How could Vasily not see something so bright? How could Mission Control? Something that size must be lighting up every radar screen in the hemisphere! And why was control taking so long to--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One, control. The Flight Surgeon has cleared you to return to your work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But, control, what about--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You ask many questions, One.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina scowled to herself. She knew that tone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You are no doubt fatigued after you great exertion, your eyes must be playing tricks. Return to your position, please.
