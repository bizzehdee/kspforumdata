If they had gone ahead with the normal launch then they risked a malfunction on route to Mars or even on the surface that could shut down the entire mission but delaying this mission by 26 months leaves this mission exposed to the bureaucracy back here on Earth. For one the director of this mission said that they had almost spent all their money already and were not sure whether or not they will be able to continue to fund if for the next 2 years.

If the mission is canceled, there are no additional costs associated with it and almost $150M in future InSight costs are avoided. Five proposed missions are currently being evaluated for selection in approximately nine months. NASA\u0027s managers have stated that they would like to select two of those missions if they possibly can. If InSight is canceled, then NASA has additional funds to apply to the next next mission or missions selected next September.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf NASA decides not to cancel InSight, then the space agency will have new costs associated with the storage and later recommissioning of the spacecraft and possibly higher costs for the launch. In addition, the costs of operating the mission will be pushed forward into 2018 to 2020 when the peak funding for the development of the next Discovery missions is required. (NASA can\u0027t simply bank the money it would have spent on InSight from 2016 to 2018. That money would either need to be spent on other missions or returned to the general federal budget. The federal government works on a spend-as-you-go basis.) The likely result is that NASA would be able to select just one new Discovery mission this coming September. One of my correspondents tells me that just last week NASA\u0027s manager for its planetary program, Jim Green, said at a scientific conference that he hoped to select two Discovery missions in September unless InSight is delayed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo matter how you look at it, InSight\u0027s problems seem likely to cause NASA to fly one fewer Discovery mission. \u003Cstrong\u003EEither InSight is canceled or NASA selects just one Discovery mission from the current competition\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T04:04:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell maybe two years more they can add some experiments, maybe more cameras at least!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T04:06:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222335948\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128436\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451016262\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259540\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, RuBisCO said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell maybe two years more they can add some experiments, maybe more cameras at least!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, the design is already complete.
