Under this reasoning, I would say use more legs or switch to a larger size. That being said, it doesn\u0027t make sense that the problem goes away if you launch from the SPH. Another thing that comes to mind is that the surface of the launchpad can sometimes be buggy, with parts getting stuck into it. Maybe that\u0027s the problem you\u0027re having. To test this, use the debug menu to hack gravity, fly your craft a little off the launchpad and then turn off hack gravity to land (or just use parachutes instead of hacking the gravity, whatever suits you best).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THobson","CreatedById":97709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T18:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI looks like a bug on the launch pad.
