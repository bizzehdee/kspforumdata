A brand new Aerospace company now producing both Air and space craft! Its true, we are brand new, but we take an uncomprimising approach to building and operating our aircraft that allows us to come up with many new and unique approaches to many of today\u0027s major aviation and space flight problems! To show you what we mean, let us introduce our first aircraft ever, the prototype NSA-001A \u0022Salamander\u0022 VTOL craft. now ready for both Commercial, Millitary and Private testing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LAh6U.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LAh6U.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/63mTm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002263mTm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NQER3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NQER3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this and more you can expect along with quality engineering and intelligent design.
