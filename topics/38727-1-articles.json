While still on jet engines and going about 700m/s at about 13km it begins to flip and I don\u0027t know why. I think it might be because the thrust is too far forward, or because the thrust is not aligned with the center of mass but I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m trying to keep it minimal; with similar designs it flew better but the LVT-30 wasn\u0027t powerful enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/vvptojdat/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s10.postimg.org/vvptojdat/Skylark.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Skylark.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe file is here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://m.uploadedit.com/b018/1374747452804.txt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://m.uploadedit.com/b018/1374747452804.txt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust rename it to .craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AnalogAddict","CreatedById":59758,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T12:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere might be folks who have placed engines below the CoM like you have and gotten it to orbit, however, I\u0027ve noted this as a big no-no.

If they\u0027re clipping other parts then I think they\u0027ll break them off as soon as they become separate from the main craft. I\u0027d have to move the canards forward which would move the center of lift too far forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a design like this but with more wing surfaces and engine nacelles behind the intakes, and the jets were further back where the rocket engine is. It was almost perfectly symmetrical but when I switched to the rocket at flame-out altitude the ship would slow down and there wasn\u0027t enough fuel overall. On this design I haven\u0027t had a chance to try the rocket, it\u0027s why I\u0027m trying to have as few parts as possible. I tried adding more fuel and engines but then I couldn\u0027t get it above 10km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m finding the whole spaceplane thing very hit and miss right now.
