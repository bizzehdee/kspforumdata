They serve to refill the silos as well as slowly refuel large or part heavy craft which either have a fuel lack too large for use in the Silos or a part count too high to dock with the mothership.\n\n![5oKTQyo.png](http://i.imgur.com/5oKTQyo.png)\n\n![goa91Bb.png](http://i.imgur.com/goa91Bb.png)\n\nThe mother-ship should be emptied and by the end you should have an infrastructure capable of supporting any fleet.\n\n![DPUrw3v.png](http://i.imgur.com/DPUrw3v.png)\n\n![3L9fp8R.png](http://i.imgur.com/3L9fp8R.png)\n\nAll craft but the scanner, lander, and miner require the movers to change orbit. While the Atlas class is capable of reaching any body it can not land and return from Duna(apparently, I believe something is up with that map, IMMA check), Kerbin, Eve, Lathe, or Tylo. The Atlas was originally an invasion carrier under the name of Spatha, numerous updates and changes in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E behaviour made the Spatha function badly, preventing it from serving. The Atlas class has a standard crew of 8 and is roughly 700 parts fully loaded.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-08T16:04:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2017 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Spartwo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T23:30:40Z","Content":"I\u0027m surprised nobody commented yet- can the scanning sat be smaller?"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T00:21:15Z","Content":"Smaller would be less effective.
