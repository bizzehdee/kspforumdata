That would be strictly for the transfer burn; you\u0027d still have to factor in delta-V to get into orbit at the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could be completely wrong about this, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2500 from Jool to Pol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2430 from Jool to Bop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2190 from Jool to Tylo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1970 from Jool to Vall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1600 from Jool to Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeff Bird","CreatedById":59988,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T19:43:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to try something to see what happens.
