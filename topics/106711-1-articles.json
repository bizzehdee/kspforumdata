Im not saying it is impossible to actually SSTO, heck i have a working craft right now, but it feels that 1.0 has truly killed any viability in SSTOs, with the new drag increases. I know that its most likely more realistic, but common, i think even FAR is easier to work with now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow im not questioning whether its realistic or not, thats a discussion for another thread, but is it actually more fun this way? SSTOs were already exponentially harder to make once 1.0 hit, and now it just doesnt feel enjoyable anymore to try to engineer something that just lags, flies liek a pig, and barely manages to bring any useful payload when i can make a basic rocket in 3 minutes and have whatever payload i wanted to get in jool orbit much faster then before. Now to get to anywhere you need insane part counts and weight, and things like laythe roundtrips are as good as dead, despite managing to pull it off under 1.0\u0027s drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm still going to enjoy this game, but it seems that SSTOs have been excessively hard hit by the recent updates, to the point of loosing almost all practicality over rockets. Or at least thats my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, does anyone think its even remotely possible (without using exploits and bugs) to get to laythe and back without any refueling or IRSU useage? I used to make many SSTOs with an excess of 5K dV, now it seems that there is no way to make a long range SSTO, as small sized craft dont have the fuel to burn to orbit, and larger craft arent really my thing. Is it even possible to get a SSTO thats under 10t to the mun and back, as thats what im trying to pull off, but it doesnt look very promising?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117164-Arkingthaad-in-1-0?p=1872848#post1872848\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhackjob threw together an SSTO that could almost land on the mun\u003C/a\u003E in 1.0, im fairly certain it can still make orbit in 1.0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep the faith and persevere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell my mk2 spaceplane still works in 1.02, it has about 25% payload fraction.

I dont think its doable anymore, that is without exploits like massless batteries\u002Bion cluster (which is nolonger doable as massless parts actually have mass, they just dont shift the CoG as much). The absolute max dV assuming that half your craft (5t) is rocket fuel, would be around 2000, this is nowhere near adequate for the mission id like to do. Even if you had 4 tons dry mass, 6 tons fuel (not achieveable realistically for a 10t max limit), you STILL wont be able to pull it off as the dV for the rapier would be 2700, perhaps doable, but since you arent ever going to get this without refueling in orbit, i pretty much consider SSTOs to other planets or even the mun (which are ALSO lightweight) done!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:40:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you know why you can\u0027t get to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s simple: the rules have changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a player who wants to make an SSTO, it is your job to figure out the new rules because it\u0027s pretty obvious the old ones don\u0027t apply \u003Cstrong\u003Eat all\u003C/strong\u003E.
