I\u0027m not 100% sure how I feel about the format in this one though. The way the current rules work is that you create a 3D model of your base, then get it printed out on current printers no smaller than 8x8x8 (inches) and no larger than 14x14x14 (inches), as well as a load of other data about where you\u0027d choose to position this base, why, etc, etc. They will then judge/score your entry and the top 30 teams will be allowed to compete in the next 2 stages. Stage 1 is basically tech demonstration and show how you intend to produce the main structural members of the structure. Stage 2 is actually printing off a full scale environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally the environment in question needs at minimum 1,000 square feet of livable space, plus some extra space for environmental systems (and their backups).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor informational purposes, the difference between the SRR and this competition is that you never needed to \u0027earn\u0027 your way into level 1. That said, 30 teams is a LOT of teams, even the SRR only has 20 competing and I think like 26 that originally signed up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T07:20:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere was something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100523-The-3D-printing-of-Lunar-Base-Shackelton\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100523-The-3D-printing-of-Lunar-Base-Shackelton\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand how they want you to use 3D printing in the actual implementation of the base, it makes little sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:32:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECollect Martian dust, combine it with water or some other binding chemical to produce a cement-like substance, cover an inflatable habitat with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t understand how they want you to use 3D printing in the actual implementation of the base, it makes little sense.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing I\u0027ve come to realize about the Centennial Challenges, is that if you want to know what the challenge is really about, don\u0027t ask what the challenge is, ask what the challenge is doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Sample Retrieval Robot was secretly just about algorithm development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is about automated construction technologies.
