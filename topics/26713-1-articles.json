I was wondering if there is some way of searching or listing available particle effects, namely the fx_exhaustFlame files, that doesn\u0027t involve looking through other part.cfg files to discover them. In addition, I\u0027ve been having more specific issues with one particular part, a \u0022propeller\u0022 powered by electricity alone. No matter how small I set the ratio for propellant consumption, I get flameouts due to being deprived of electrical power. If I use the debug menu to set infinite fuel, it works fine, which makes me think it\u0027s consuming insanely large amounts of power for some reason, despite the tiny ratio (which I suppose makes sense, as there isn\u0027t any other fuel to compare ratios with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone could help me out, or point me at some good documentation, I would be very grateful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T20:08:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that is a unity thing....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satcharna","CreatedById":61549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T20:12:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich one? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T21:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might be able to find all of the particle effects using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EResources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll\u003C/a\u003E in a plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the propeller you\u0027ll need to specify which module you\u0027re using.
