Gets straight to grips with the original request and challenges us to clarify our thinking. The answer is of course. When it is not a wing. What the OP is driving at is he does not have wings. He has structures made out of parts. So all discussions on wing aerodynamics are irrelevant here. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E As feedback to this idea, I don\u0027t think it is a sensible thing to do.

So although it might be possible. It is kind of an ugly way to get the finished result. Which is a fancy nose cone that does not create lift. A better idea would be to create a brand new part instead of modding existing ones. It is cleaner and less prone to introducing bugs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T14:28:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nobodyhasthis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T00:52:37Z","Content":"It IS a sensible thing to do.

Most wings are also build slightly angled to deflect air downward, which we know by Newton\u0027s third law, will produce a force pushing the plane up. so you could have completely flat wings as long as they are angled to deflect air down.

It\u0027s totally possible and actually incredibly easy to do.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But realistically how could a wing have no lift ?\n\nBecause of multiple reasons, but the one that\u0027s relevant is that the OP doesn\u0027t want to use the piece as a wing, but as a structural element. This is still a video game, so that logic is in the realm of the possible.\n\nAlso, if I took a wing in real life and attached it flat against a fuselage, it would function wholly differently than when it\u0027s attached as a classical wing.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E snip...\n\u003E There\u0027s also the issue of procedurally generated drag that will be a result of removing the lift module. (lift modules handle their own drag internally, I think)\n\nWell, drag from lift is produced internal to the lift module (and based on the lift rating vice the part shape like everything else). However, there is also a drag model setting which needs to be flipped if you\u0027re going to turn off (delete) the lift module.\n\nBeware that a wing acting as a \u0022flat plate\u0022 structural element will generate more drag than a wing acting as a wing (in KSP), because of the shape (the wing models are fairly thick). Also, a nose cone made out of wings will NOT occlude parts behind it in the same way as a nose cone piece.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, 1.0.X models aerodynamics more correctly, so even structural panels should generate lift if used correctly. Some real aircraft us wings that have symmetric airfoil, like a small cessna, so to generate lift they need some angle of attack.

This means that they do produce lift at zero angle of attack.\n\nAll wing pieces in KSP are symmetric airfoils. That means they do not create lift at zero angle of attack. From a gameplay standpoint, this is primarily for practical considerations. If the wing components did create lift at zero angle of attack, that would be really bad for rocket design.\n\nAlso, cambered airfoils can also generate lift at negative angles of attack. Although there will be some negative angle of attack where lift is zero.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A flat panel does not really provide lift, just a lot of drag so it\u0027s mistaken for lift i.e. lift/drag ratio. Or do you think sticking your hand out the window while driving in a car an following the air stream means your hand is a wing\n\nThat\u0027s not entirely true. Symmetric airfoils are essentially very aerodynamic flat plates. A \u0022wing\u0022 does not require camber to generate lift. Just because a flat body can generate lift doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s a wing. So no, I don\u0027t think my hand is a wing. But if I ram it at the right angle into an airflow fast enough, it\u0027s going to generate lift (and a lot of drag). That lift is the product of deflecting air downward in the same manner as for a symmetric airfoil.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-26T08:35:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2015 08:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T13:09:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A flat panel does not really provide lift, just a lot of drag so it\u0027s mistaken for lift i.e. lift/drag ratio.

The hand out the window is creating lift if its shape or angle of attack makes it create a force with a component perpendicular to the airflow, period. \n\nFlat panels can absolutely create lift, how else do paper airplanes fly? Recall that drag only applies parallel to the direction of airflow."},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T13:36:02Z","Content":"What we\u0027re having here is that KSP uses a part system that explicitly says \u0027this is a wing, so it has X lift\u0027 for wing parts. Without the ModuleLiftingSurface, you will only have a flat structural panel.\n\nIn real life, wings are generating lift because of their shape and angle of attack, which is not entirely true in KSP. In KSP, a wing performs equally well when it\u0027s mounted upside down or with the leading edge on the back, as opposed to being mounted the right way up. The only difference is made when you camber it, generating an angle of attack even with zero pitch attitude.\n\nI see the point in wanting to use wings as structural panels or as cosmetic pieces. You can remove the ModuleLiftingSurface from the part config if you want, but I suspect a better option would be to make the lift ratio a tweakable factor between zero and the maximum value for the stock part.\n\nThat would also open opportunities for lift-enhancing and lift-inhibiting devices such as flaps and spoilers. Kick in a notch of flaps and your wings will have 1,2 times their stock lift rating, meaning more lift but also more drag."}]}
