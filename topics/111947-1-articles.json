How does it rotates ?\n\nThe front part (I call the pipe) undocks, drives up to the desired fuel tank, then brake, use SAS torque to rotate (so that it\u0027s basically doing a stationary wheelie like in the screenshot) and vary the height of the docking port on the pipe until it mates. Then drive the bark part up (I call the tank), and re-dock with the pipe. Since the radius of the docking port jr that connects to the tank is small and the parts have a bit of give, it doesn\u0027t matter that the tank has a fixed docking port height. But if the pipe was rotated too much and it couldn\u0027t re-dock with the tank, you could just use a second pipe, to add complete freedom to the height of the docking port on the pipe that connects to the tank."},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T11:40:11Z","Content":"\\*mindblown\\* Have rep."},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T18:09:00Z","Content":"Why don\u0027t you just use the Claw?

Yes, but they can usually be avoided pretty easily, and so do normal docking ports ;P"},{"CreatedByName":"Bug_","CreatedById":140851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T00:25:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Why don\u0027t you just use the Claw?

The claw does work, personally I don\u0027t think the concept is very realistic because you can even transfer fuel from one ship, through the claw into an asteroid, out of the asteroid through another claw, and into another ship latched onto the asteroid. I would actually prefer fuel transfer to not be possible through a claw. But the concept I came up with is merely to solve the problem of docking extremely heavy objects on the surface using docking ports."}]}
