Neither one presents much of a challenge, however. Venus\u0027 atmosphere is ~90x as thick as Earth\u0027s, while Mars\u0027 is ~0.7% as thick. If Eve had an atmosphere that thick, it would make flight very awkward, and parachuting tedious (might not be too difficult to pull off lithobraking)--but imagine trying to take off from that... And if Duna\u0027s atmosphere were thin like Mars\u0027, it would be quite a challenge to land on it. You could treat it like a non-atmospheric body, but some intrepid explorers would attempt winged descent for a greater challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll-in-all I think making these planets\u0027 atmosphere thickness more different from Kerbin\u0027s would make the game more interesting. It doesn\u0027t have to be quite like Venus and Mars. If Eve\u0027s atmosphere were, say, 15x as thick as Kerbin\u0027s, it would be a tremendous challenge to launch a rocket from the surface...but it would be possible. Of course people can also find other methods, such as balloons or maybe a jet engine that can breathe Eve\u0027s air somehow (is it even combustible?) And if Duna\u0027s atmosphere were 5% as thick as Kerbin\u0027s, the atmosphere tickness woould be very significant still--you wouldn\u0027t be going orbital velocity when you reach the groound but you\u0027d still need more than just wings or parachutes to stop yourself (or lots of wings/parachutes perhaps?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould also be cool to see Eve and/or other planets with a harsh environment requiring special protection to visit it. Perhaps only armored command modules could withstand the pressure without imploding, and the player would have to equip the Kerbals with a researched heavy environment suit to be able to go outside on EVE safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T07:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be great to be able to land a probe Venera-style using a drag plate and a crush ring because parachutes are just too damn slow, but IIRC the guys doing the Real Solar System mod ran into problems with atmospheres that dense in the game. There is something wrong with KSP\u0027s atmospheric model that makes a true Venusian hell impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, supported on the off chance this can be solved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T08:31:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d imagine that the problems with dense atmospheres end up something like some of the glitches you can see on Jool sometimes. Attempt to land on Jool the wrong way or with some weird angle (might even vary from ship to ship) and you can have your craft fly apart, slip into Nullspace, be flung out at lightspeed (or higher) and so forth... and if not, you might find your craft semi-floating in the atmosphere in some odd fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yargnit","CreatedById":57535,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T10:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically what regex said. Both crazy dense and crazy light atmospheres have trouble in KSP. I did a lot of the testing for Real Solar System, 5% and 15x would work technically (though both wouldn\u0027t really be much fun to play in) but going much farther toward the extremes such as what Venus and Mars have would be unplayable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Venus like atmosphere would be like trying to descend/ascend through oatmeal. You\u0027re literally talking so think (especially with how KSP makes atmospheres soupy atm) that your terminal velocity would be low enough that landing gear would almost have enough cushion for you to land w/o a parachute. On the other hand, ascent would be completely impossible because the atmosphere would be be so think it\u0027d be impossible to get through it before you ran out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the other end of the spectrum, KSP\u0027s parachutes physically won\u0027t deploy at all at Mars\u0027s atmospheric levels. you basically need to double the atmosphere of Mars at minimum, and even then drogue chutes only stage open about 5km above the surface, and standard chutes around 2km. Basically you\u0027re stuck with the negatives of an atmosphere (being limited to physical warp as opposed to regular) without the benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir current atmospheric levels (1/5th and 5x) are basically at the limits of what\u0027s fun to play in. A bit less or a bit more would still be playable, but just wouldn\u0027t be any fun. (Also heavy atmospheres have an engine issue where you run into a harsh edge where you go from significant atmosphere to none instantly because of how it does the calculations. (Nathan is going to have to write a completely new atmosphere model to fix it)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T12:10:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d settle for thicker clouds and higher temperatures.
