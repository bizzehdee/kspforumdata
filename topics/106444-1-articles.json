I know some mods use stock textures, is it permissible to use a stock model for a \u0022new\u0022 part if I\u0027m not actually redistributing that model, simply calling it up in a part config file? I would be altering it\u0027s dimensions, also via the cfg file."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:10:02Z","Content":"As I understand it referencing Squad assets from config files is fine, I believe several mods do this already.\n\n(I\u0027m not a lawyer, nor am I a Squad employee.)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:13:25Z","Content":"Pretty sure there was a thread about this about a week ago, actually. You\u0027re free to reuse and make derivative works using the assets in the GameData folder. With the power of MM, you don\u0027t even need to distribute the files (though if you want to distribute modified models/textures, that\u0027s ok too)."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:26:58Z","Content":"Thanks!"}]}
