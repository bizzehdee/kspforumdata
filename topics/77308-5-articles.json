In short there are all these finicky things how the mod tracks the mission the player is flying and what the consequences are for the mission which can be ordered after tracking. If you have used the mod yourself you have probably been in the situation where you decided to redo a tracking flight of a particular mission, say your station resupply mission, because the mission you can order based on your first tracking of this mission type did not exactly gave you the options you wanted. Maybe it didn\u0027t give the you an automatic return options because you undocked from the station without engaging the tracking for the return mission, maybe the mission requires a minimum crew of three even though its vehicle can fly unmanned. When flying to Kerbin orbit this is, I suspect, all reasonably acceptable. This is a mission a player would be flying on a regular basis even if the player didn\u0027t have this mod, so flying it a second time after learning by trial and error how the mission is tracked isn\u0027t an issue. For interplanetary missions however things will likely be a little different and this mod in my opinion cannot deliver what a player would reasonably expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have done for the next version is make an option available in a config file where you could expand the list of enabled planets at your own discretion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T17:03:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might be interested in this mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you track a mission, then launch a Routine Mission, will you be able to switch to the new craft and watch it repeat your movements, or will it just teleport to the final position?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrivateFlip","CreatedById":68273,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T17:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lperkin1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lperkin1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am kinda new here, but I can\u0027t tell if your mod works with the stage recovery mod.
