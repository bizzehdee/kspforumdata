I\u0027ve done some in the past, but they were just fun little projects, nothing quite as daunting as a tutorial series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to ask for input on how best I could cover it. Of course, things can be rearranged, but here are some basic notes I\u0027ve compiled:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETopics\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBasic Construction (what rockets need, the extreme basic to land Kerbals alive)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETerminology (Delta-V, TWR, orbital mechanics lingo)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHow to Pilot Crafts (using hotkeys for thrust, how pitch/yaw/roll work)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHow to Pilot Spacecrafts/ Orbital Mechanics (same as above, but in space)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdvanced Construction (Fuel lines, struts, difference of engines)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdvanced Advanced Construction (Root/offset/angle buttons, fairings)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHow to Land Stuff (Landing on the Mun, primarily)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is the list I have so far, and I do plan on adding variants on these videos to make rovers and spaceplanes and stuff like that. Maybe even SSTOs once I figure the blasted things out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think so far? I\u0027m aiming to have videos under 15 minutes in length so people aren\u0027t watching them forever. Should some of the list be compressed, broken apart?
