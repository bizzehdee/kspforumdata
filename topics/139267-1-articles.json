There is a lot of work being associated with that but we\u0027ve at least shown a path forward(end of KSP shot) on how you can design test and analyse these types of structures at a very high level of fidelity. Cut Schene: woman starts talking: The NESC is working on many ways to make NASA safer. And as is the norm with NASA, often this safety that is highlighted for NASA trickles down into products that can be used by the general public as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a warning sign from NASA engineers screaming for help that they are all going to die?

Also, NasaX looks to be a part of NASA\u0027s public relations arm, probably best to expect things to be presented in a public friendly way.
