Now the first import to the game worked fine, but a bit rough on the animation. I animated using blender, imported using unity. I went back to smooth the animation out, and re imported into the game, and now no matter what I do, the turret appears in the middle of the vehicle, still animated of course, but nothing I seem to do relocates it to the outer top hull. Even purposely moved it wayout in unity, re imported and still nothing. Still in the middle, anyone seen this issue before? And the fix would be?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePyrateCaptain","CreatedById":57208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T22:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMOderator?
