Not for any reasons of ill-will or argument, nothing like that at all. I\u0027ve enjoyed every moment I\u0027ve spent in this forum. It\u0027s just that as a person with a very limited time budget, I found myself wasting time in unnecessary conversations online; taking me away from more important matters. (Which is probably the most important value of the Internet when you get right down to it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to web-forum principles; it is nothing for a member to simply stop posting; but in Human\u00A0terms it would be rude to leave without a thank-you and a tip of the hat, so please let me say that for the brief time I was with you, I enjoyed the fun and camaraderie of our association. The problem is that my time is very limited, and I have to draw the line somewhere so I will thank you kindly and back out with a smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have a great, fun forum filled with wonderful, interesting people. Perhaps I\u0027ll have the opportunity to rejoin you one day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks folks - a toast to you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T04:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was nice meeting you Devo, and best of luck with the book!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T08:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, shiver me timbers.
