MMI.S has some really nice small accordion-style panels that provide enough power to keep the pretty satellites that come with it humming along smoothly. Kosmos\u0027 solar panels are freaking huge; great for large ships/structures. I\u0027m thinking of slapping some on to a DSM explorer vessel and using them as a power source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you install the Kosmos parts pack (any of them), be sure to remove the PowerTech and MuTech plugins from the archives before installing, or you\u0027re liable to overwrite your more recent versions. That will result in a \u0022part not available in this version of KSP\u0022 error for any part using PowerTech, and will revert MechJeb back to a previous version (I think the Kosmos SSPP is packed with v1.9.0 of MuMech; it\u0027s on 1.9.2 with a 1.9.3 beta).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Werwolf","CreatedById":38001,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T05:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESoyuz solar panels are really nice\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
