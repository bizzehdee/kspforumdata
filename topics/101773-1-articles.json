But if the car spins around, it is actually shaped like a lifting airfoil. So in a crash the cars would spin backward, then lift up. After that, all sorts of bad things happen. By putting those roof flaps on there, when the car spins around backward the flaps open, acting as spoilers. That breaks up the airflow over the car so it doesn\u0027t develop lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I couldn\u0027t find a better way to describe it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-26T22:24:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2016 10:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DarkOwl57\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T06:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, that looks like a normal F1 concept to me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cuky","CreatedById":111755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T14:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222825562\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022101773\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477549581\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022132560\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RCgothic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, RCgothic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, that looks like a normal F1 concept to me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat isn\u0027t F1 concept, it was Honda\u0027s aero kit in 2015 for IndyCar teams that were supplied by them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Marco-Andretti-Honda-IndyCar.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022666\u0022 src=\u0022http://blog.caranddriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Marco-Andretti-Honda-IndyCar.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was simplified for later stages of 2015 due to those little winglets on front wing falling off evene when there was no contact with other car or the wall.
