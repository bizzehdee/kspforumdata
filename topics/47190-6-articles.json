Bitmaps can usually have at most four channels (though there\u0027s no reason you couldn\u0027t have an arbitrary number of channels), and the channels are usually 8bits each (though there are 16bit/channel formats). Alpha in games is usually used for transparency, but really it\u0027s just used so you can pack more into a single texture. So you can read color \u002B transparency from a texture, or color \u002B height, or color \u002B specular, or color \u002B emissive/self-illumination...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecular maps tell a shader, basically, how \u0022shiny\u0022 to make the object. Emissive maps controls whether the object is self-illuminated, i.e. is bright without light hitting it. (In the best of worlds, it would control the object actually emitting light, but usually it just means \u0022count the object as self-illuminated\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA brief detour re: lighting models and shaders. How these all combine is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet the color of the pixel from the color map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet the normal at the pixel by averaging the vertex normals and then modifying by the normal map (if there is one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalculate the light hitting the pixel by calculating diffuse factor and specular factor (dot product of light incidence and normal, basically, with a power for the specular factor). Multiply diffuse by light, multiply specular color (or diffuse color or white, if no specular color) by specular factor and by that pixel (0=0.0, 255=1.0) in the specular map (if there is one). Add them up, in each (R/G/B) channel, that\u0027s your pixel\u0027s color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet alpha from alpha map. Instead of just writing the pixel, if alpha \u0026lt; 1, blend it with what\u0027s under it, by the alpha factor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T20:35:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll ask a lot of modders and get a lot of different opinions. For my 2 cents, norma/shadow maps shouldn\u0027t need to be very large, maybe 512 max. All else should be relative to the actual size of the object in game or the level of fine detail you want to preserve. Until Squad makes some kind of dynamic texture quality loading, I would also suggest you release a hi-rez and low-rez pack for your users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.png\u0027s are actually fine, but you need to remember that the file size for .png is does not reflect properly what the RAM usage will be. The size on your hard drive is just an illusion. The game bases things on pixel dimensions when it re-constitutes the graphics files, so 512x512 is about 750k-1mb regardless of the .png file size, for example. In my next update, I\u0027ll try running things through the .png converter before I shrink them to see if I get better results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother note is consolidation of textures using the MODEL command. This is helpful, but not as much as you want to believe. It does cut down on initial load times and a little on your RAM footprint (and HD space)...until you make a space ship with 20 - 30 copies of the same part. Then, that lower texture size starts to look real nice, as the next lower size knocks off 75% off the total load for that craft. This is the reason why B9 still ran like a pig on some systems even though the creator did a very good job on using MODEL for consolidation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t think of where I did reduce the texture detail of the main \u0022inner\u0022 piece for the cockpits, all the detail should still be there. I did reduce some shadow maps, and ripped out an alpha channel, but LOD should still be very much intact. Not all cockpits have a \u0022main piece\u0022 though, and are very much just a collection of little bits. You can still see your Kerbal family photos and read the sticky notes just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting a few thing around this i should share a part in the next day: (just need to fix a few anims and nodes wich is a bit painfull cause i m new to blender and unity and shortcuts knowledge miss me xD)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI splitted/merged/overlaped the UvMap/objectsFaces with some specific pattern/transform amongst the layers: so some different faces(even if there own geometry are different) that don\u0027t require detail use the same small 1x1 monocolor texture mid detail use 128x128 or 256x256 and higher detail use a few 512x512.
