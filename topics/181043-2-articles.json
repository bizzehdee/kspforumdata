If nutrition was well understood, then we\u0027d know what was nonsense and what wasn\u0027t, but the sad reality is that even so-called experts setting official guidelines in many (most?) cases have literally no idea what they are talking about, which makes other fad diets look reasonable in comparison (because they\u0027re all equally nonsense).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExercise is obviously important (taking the stairs, etc), but for the morbidly obese, that\u0027s not going to drop their weight, they can\u0027t possibly exercise enough (few can, they\u0027d need to be running marathons daily or something to burn enough)---they need to eat less, a lot less. The US dietary guidelines are very carbohydrate heavy, and the federal guidelines are in fact as evidence-free as any other dietary fad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople who eat a balanced diet of meat and vegetables, with smaller amounts of everything else are generally healthy. They are also generally not \u003Cem\u003Ehungry\u003C/em\u003E. Too many people eat overly processed food in the US, I think. What happened with the diet guidelines from the government is that they said fat was bad, and all the food companies dutifully eliminated fat. In order to make their food taste good, they then changed the recipes, and likely added sugar, etc, to make up for the lack of fat. \u0022Low fat\u0022 foods tend to be terrible, IMO, we don\u0027t buy them. Look at all the sugar people \u003Cem\u003Edrink\u003C/em\u003E. My coffee has coffee in it (espresso, a little water). My first cup had a tiny splash of heavy cream. If I was drinking \u0022lattes\u0022 each coffee, I\u0027d end up drinking a liter of lowfat milk,. Better to have a small glass of real milk. When I was a kid, juice at breakfast came in a small glass, looks like a shot glass compared to now. Soda sizes are huge (and there are people who actually drink that every day, last time I had a coke was at Disneyland). I remember we were at a local New Mexican place (Sadie\u0027s) when the kids were \u003Cem\u003Etoddlers\u003C/em\u003E, and the waitress offered them coke. To put in a sippy cup. You want fat kids?

His research and experience had indicated to him that ancient people probably didn\u0027t spend any more time in deep caves than we do today, so when art is found deep inside caves it was probably left there by young people exploring the caves as a lark. With the exception of there being no written words, ancient cave art does kind of look like stuff you would find drawn on a bathroom stall.

So while we might have evolved to eat marrow from scavenged kills, plus whatever vegetable matter we could forage, plus bugs, and things we might kill, that\u0027s certainly not all we can eat.

That doesn\u0027t mean people generally need to switch to a cave man diet, or go full keto and try and eat nearly zero carbs, but it does mean that perhaps the relative balance of what people eat should change. It\u0027s also important to notice that getting food means walking into the market, and buying whatever we feel like. Back in the day, you\u0027d eat what you found/hunted, and some days you might not eat at all (there are apparently health benefits to intermittent fasting from what I have read). In addition, we can now eat, well, constantly. Live someplace without electricity for a while, you find yourself hitting the sack at sundown, and getting up at dawn.
