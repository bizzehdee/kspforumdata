While the new Space center looked really slick, and I looked forward to the rewritten SAS, I didn\u0027t think any of the new aspects would be game changing or really cool, like docking, rovers, or re-entry visuals had been. Now, I\u0027ve been around since 0.17 and like to think of myself as quite competent,but up until now, I was never able to spend more than 20 minutes working on a plane without ragequitting. I couldn\u0027t even get the stock vessels off of the runway. However; with the new SAS I decided to give it a try yesterday. I\u0027m in love. Not only can I fly fairly well now, I\u0027ve entered a part of the game were I am able to tread my own paths. (I was introduced to Kerbal by the kurtjmac videos, so I was able to get into orbit with my second rocket \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E). Now after two nights with little sleep and bleary eyes, I\u0027ve succeeded in getting a plane into Space!!!.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Plane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe A2 Dutchman uses two Turbojet engines with 300L of fuel each. Each is fed by two radial intakes and a RAM intake. The cockpit and systems section of the plane sit in front of the main fuselage that consists of a Rockomax BACC SRB. The use of an SRB was first tested in the A1 Dutchman using a RT-10. While the BACC has less Dv than the RT-10, the longer thrust curve prevents excess energy being wasted fighting the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/994548_560479420679524_1550360901_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022994548_560479420679524_1550360901_n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Flight Plan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA previous flight of the A2 Dutchman had succeeded in reaching an altitude of 69.3 km. This time the A2 was fighted with 6 Sepratron Is to provide a bit of additional kick. Also the Jet engine tanks were drained to 262L of fuel to lower weight. Both of these measures should help the A2 successfuly clear the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sphotos-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/581705_560479430679523_1716954143_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022581705_560479430679523_1716954143_n.jpg\u0022\u003E Draining fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman had just returned from a successful space trip and was quickly picked to fly this historic mission. The takeoff time was set at dawn. At the given time, the SAS was booted up, the brakes released and the jet engines throttled up. Takeoff was nominal and the plane gently flew to 5kM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sphotos-b-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/999395_560479487346184_1532349647_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022999395_560479487346184_1532349647_n.jpg\u0022\u003E Takeoff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 5km, the plane increased it\u0027s flight angle dramatically, rapidly gaining speed and altitude. When the intakes provided only 0,1 U of air, the Turbojets cut off and the BACC engine was ignited. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/993653_560479540679512_595634565_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022993653_560479540679512_595634565_n.jpg\u0022\u003E SRB burn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter SRB cut off the A2 was on a trajectory up to 79.1km, easily out of the atmosphere. The A2 was on a suborbital trajectory with 102 seconds outside of the atmosphere. Reentry was nominal, and the A2 regained level flight at 7.5km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/1013545_560479880679478_349288801_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221013545_560479880679478_349288801_n.jpg\u0022\u003E Re-entry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe A2 turned back westward, and after two low altitude sub-orbital hops prepared to land. The landing approach proceeded well. After a rapid decent the engines where cut and the incredible gliding prowess of the A2 became noticeable. To prevent floating over the runway, the Plane nosed down and landed somewhat hard, but landed without breaking off any wings or engines. (A first for the Dutchman planes) A short taxi to the SPH allowed KSP to get some publicity shots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1010872_560480124012787_617230105_n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221010872_560480124012787_617230105_n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter venting fuel the Sepratrons were unnecessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP would like to take a moment to thank and honor the Six Kerbals that gave their lives during the Dutchman program (Revert really means that Bill and Mumbert have each died a handful of times but are still in play)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgress Goals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtend extra-atmospheric flight time to 5 minutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelope a HTOL with liquid rocket engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelope a HTOL capable of reaching a stable orbit with an average altitude of 100km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelope a vessel that can reac\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
