After running benchmarks for a few hours you may be able to determine that you have gained like 2% or so. Translate that into any metric you care about: will you ever notice when the frame rate has gone from 60-\u0026gt;61, or if your personal tolerable part count has increased from 140 to 144?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMO, that\u0027s not worth spending any money on. Even if I found that RAM sitting by the side of the road, I probably wouldn\u0027t bother opening my box.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
