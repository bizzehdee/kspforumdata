I especially like how they mention non-critical things like if a docking port is being used as a decoupler for a nose cone. Stuff that doesn\u0027t have to be pointed out, but if you\u0027re being stoopid might be worth looking at before you launch. \n\nWell, I can be pretty stoopid at times - especially in KSP it would seem. I just launched my second rocket with the wrong sized docking port. See? I told you I can be stoopid. The problem is they look so similar in certain situations, especially for newer players. Especially considering the icon in the parts list makes the Jr. look bigger than the regular one.\n\nSo my suggestion is: the engineer reports point out that you are using docking ports of a certain size. That\u0027s it: just a little sentence that says: \u0022Clamp-o-Tron Jr. in use.\u0022 In case you didn\u0027t notice what size you put on. \n\nNow before the flames start, I\u0027d just like to point out that this is one of those really easy to do suggestions with really no downside (at least that I can see).

When you put a junior on a 2.5m piece thinking it is a standard port, it is much less obvious, especially to a new player. In that scenario (which is the scenario that happened to me) even the standard port only covers up 25% of the area of the 2.5 m part. Even the standard looks small in that situation, so if you put a junior on, it looks small, but you were expecting the standard one to look small, so it is easy to overlook. \n\nBut even if it should be obvious to everyone, is that really a reason not to do this? Shouldn\u0027t it also be obvious when you don\u0027t put a parachute on your ship? All you have to do is open your eyes and look. So should we get rid of parachute reports?
