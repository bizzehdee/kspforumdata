It\u0027s not that we literally don\u0027t know how to play the game. I for one, have at least 1,000 hours playing it. 700 on Steam and at least several hundred undocumented hours in \u0022offline\u0022 play and earlier versions. Most of this time was broadcast on Twitch as well. I\u0027m quite familiar with the game and its mechanics and have been an active, if somewhat irregular part of this community for years--just not on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy criticism isn\u0027t leveled at \u0022Oh, woe is me, I have to redesign my fleet of rockets because of the new Aero or Ore Tank changes.\u0022 If I may put on my monocle: That feat is done easily enough for someone at my skill level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy criticism is that I have to. The game is no longer Early Access. Release builds of the game should no longer be treated as mass testing or gameplay balancing versions. The game should be stable both in terms of software bugs and gameplay practices. For the Record: No software is going to be bug free...but at least for me, that\u0027s not the issue in my criticism of the process since 1.0 hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to go back to my card game analogy for these changes. KSP has always been a game about flying rockets to space. Poker has always been a game about having a stronger hand. However, when one changes the aerodynamics model on a week to week basis, which is well before many of us can complete a career play through, it\u0027s like going from Poker to Texas Holdem while still playing the same round. They are both undeniably similar games, but also undeniably different. How are we supposed to play when the rules keep changing so drastically?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a direct result of Squad failing to use their chief advantage of having a game in Early Access: the sheer amount of people willing to test the game. It\u0027s why I bought the game in Early Access. I understand the need to have a smaller team test the game to make sure the product pushed to Steam isn\u0027t all regression, no progression. But once a build gets to that point, it should be provided to the Early Access community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to recall a poll on this very forum asking this community if KSP should go from .90 to 1.0. And the poll was decidedly against that. By several hundred votes. The issues we are seeing now with the game aren\u0027t the result of Q\u0026amp;A or Testers, but of a failure by the developers to leverage the advantage of having an Early Access community. They should have released components of what eventually became 1.0 to the wider Early Access community gradually over several builds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could have critiqued the game over the past several months constructively and had a 1.0 version that doesn\u0027t change rules or core mechanics from week to week. Early Access builds of any product are supposed to change rules and core mechanics--and frequently. If people were to complain, that\u0027s too bad for them, because they don\u0027t understand Early Access. We have now had more updates in a single week than we did in the past four months. These updates change the way you have to play the game. These are not bug fix releases--they are core changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is now in a different phase of its life. It\u0027s supposed to be \u0022done.\u0022 And its gameplay and underlying systems should not be revised as drastically as they have in the past week. These revisions are necessary...but they are the result of not doing Early Access properly. It makes it difficult to play the game, not because the game gets harder or easier...but because we don\u0027t know if we are doing Poker rules or Texas Holdem rules. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this juncture, Squad needs to pick one and stick with it--and also tell the community not to expect an update to the mechanics in question for a significant amount of time so that we know it\u0027s \u0022clear\u0022 to start a serious long-term play through of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T16:32:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scourge013\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded the \u0026quot;For the Record..\u0026quot; bit\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hawk_za","CreatedById":59433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:54:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scourge013\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scourge013\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt this juncture, Squad needs to pick one and stick with it--and also tell the community not to expect an update to the mechanics in question for a significant amount of time so that we know it\u0027s \u0022clear\u0022 to start a serious long-term play through of the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat is insane if a game mechanic is not working correctly it should be fixed REGRDLESS of version number \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto that point we all know squad is working on multiplayer for post 1.0 that\u0027s a core aspect of the gameplay but he our software has a 1.0 tag so in the words of tatu you aint goanna get it (heheh) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI defiantly feel there has just been an self justified overreaction here over what a version no \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is getting insane now\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:46:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Ethis is getting insane now\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, its getting sane now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat was totally insane was to introduce entire new classes of gameplay without testing.
