of in the middle of modeling one my pi tablet side controllers. when i built my pi tablet i included several hard points for external addons, and this project puts one of them to use, the right side.\u00A0the electronics side is mostly complete, i got 4\u00A0high end keyswitches, the kind used in mechanical keyboards, a joystick module from an old xbox controller i found in a dumpster,\u00A0a small slide pot to act as a throttle axis, a blackberry trackball breakout board, a custom 3d printed hall effect rotary encoder that will serve as a mouse wheel, and there is an extra adc channel which i havent decded on what to do with. easiest would be just to stick a trim wheel somewhere. everything works over an i2c bus. its all built on a home made pcb (a couple actually).\u00A0ive already tested it and verified the data coming off of the outputs. i already wrote a linux driver for the prototype, and expanding it to work with more functions should not be an issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut it needs some ergonomic casement. i think ive extracted the secret sauce for a good gamepad using various salvaged controllers. figured the correct proportions between the distances between the various interfaces. comparing the dual shock ps2 controller with an xbox controller ive determined that the angle of the grips seems to correspond to the placement of the shoulder buttons. like the steep grip on the ps2 seems to promote more comfortable use of the high triggers while the flatter design from the xbox controller seems to want lowered triggers. my pad takes the shallow approach\u00A0with a mostly flat controller, in order to support the 4 rather large shoulder buttons. they will need to be mounted at an angle so as to allow\u00A0 optimal reach of all buttons.\u00A0also the distance between the stick center and the dpad/face buttons\u00A0is about the same on all sticks. ive tried to maintain it the best i can but the trackball is a tad offset, but still close to the center of where the face buttons would be on a ps2 pad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe left side will just be a pure usb controller, because thats where the ports are.\u00A0 im thinking it will keep a second joystick, and have a trim wheel in the same location as my rotary encoder on the right side. im debating replacing the dpad with a proper hat switch as well as the same shoulder button layout. i came up with a fairly good design not too long ago, and will just need to miniaturize it. it will likely also have a 4th analog control. it will just use an arduino pro micro 3.3v, so i only get four analog channels, but i might throw in some extra goodies like an ir transceiver since i will have plenty of extra io. maybe also throw in a long range radio (i got a module that can do 2 mbit out to a kilometer making it great for r/c applications) or perhaps a com port for future expansion. anything goes.\u00A0 heres some

The thing is, the wagons are made by Marklin and he has Roco track, so Marklin wheels would make a short circuit on his layout. We swapped the wheels with insulated ones, but we didn\u0027t have the nice spoked replacement so he got some classic regular wheels. I offered to give it a go and\u00A0try and insulate them when I get a chance.
