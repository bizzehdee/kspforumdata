Greenland cores would be fine too. I\u0027m mostly interested to see if northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere warm up and cool down in phase or out of phase. If it is in phase, then TSI or greenhouse effect could be the cause (but not Milankovich cycles); If it is out of phase, than Milankovich cycles can be the cause (but not TSI or greenhouse).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T08:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found one here, including some temperate region glaciers: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.climatedata.info/Proxy/Proxy/icecores.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.climatedata.info/Proxy/Proxy/icecores.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind that, whatever the reason were, it\u0027s quite hot nowadays \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaw data should be available also, probably at NOAA or so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T14:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YNM\u0022 data-cite=\u0022YNM\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI found one here, including some temperate region glaciers: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.climatedata.info/Proxy/Proxy/icecores.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.climatedata.info/Proxy/Proxy/icecores.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind that, whatever the reason were, it\u0027s quite hot nowadays \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaw data should be available also, probably at NOAA or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.climatedata.info/resources/Proxies/Ice-Cores/07-Temperature---Vostok-and-GISP2.gif\u0022 alt=\u002207-Temperature---Vostok-and-GISP2.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit hard to tell if they are in sync or not.
