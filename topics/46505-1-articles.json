Right now we can\u0027t see the whole face of it because the ring of labels around it hide the edges. That\u0027s what leads to the most frustrating situation which is where you can\u0027t see BOTH the pro-and retro- versions of a mark and so you rotate around randomly until you see one of them. Once you see one you can work out where the other one is. But you often can\u0027t see either one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DannySwish","CreatedById":57623,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T06:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have no idea how much I want this.
