I know they don\u0027t have to be exactly equidistant, but I like to be as perfect as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m proposing is a simple (I believe) tool that would allow you to set a target and then right click anywhere along that craft\u0027s orbital path to plot a point. This point would emulate the orbital parameters of the target craft at this point, meaning the point would orbit around at the same velocity as the target craft at any given position. This would allow you to then rendezvous with this plot point rather than an arbitrary distance ahead or behind the target craft, which is often difficult to do with precision, especially when the maneuver node is shaking. This ties into another request I have: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98303-Maneuver-Planner-Interface-Overhaul\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EManeuver Planner Interface Overhaul\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to manually adding points, some sort of preset configurations would be nice. So say you set the target, you could then right click the target (or have a separate UI window, whichever works best) where you can select either a degree value for a single point. So say you select \u0022180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u0022, this would plot a point on the opposite side of the orbital path to the target. Similarly \u002290\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u0022, \u0022270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u0022 or even a manually entered whole number could be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you could input a number of points to plot at equal angles from the barycenter, similar to the symmetry duplication in the VAB. This would have come in handy when I was trying to launch six equidistant LKO satellites. I managed to get them roughly in a hexagonal arrangement, but it could have been a lot more precise and far easier with a tool like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T02:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had the same thought and I think it\u0027s the FinePrint mod that adds orbit lines - just not a fake (or set of fake) targets that you could set as target. Was able to get a decent constellation by resorting to math and Mechjeb info displays but this would also be helpful when the satellites eventually drift off target (or I fat finger the wrong key during a burn).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
