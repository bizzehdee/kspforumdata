That said, you have to double your distance from Kerbin\u0027s center to halve the gradient. So, going from 100km orbit to 200km orbit does essentially nothing. With the planet\u0027s radius of 600km, you have to go from 100km to 800km to cut the drift rate in half. To reduce the drift to 25% of the LKO amount, you need a 2200km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that still only makes docking marginally easier (the rate of drift isn\u0027t usually the problem), it\u0027s simply not worth doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T01:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s a lot of food for thought, thank you.

If you click on the speed display just above the nav-ball, you switch between orbit, surface, and target (relative) speed readouts and it changes the markers on the nav-ball as well.
