Since the update it will now attach too. I noticed some people have been complaining that MJ is messing up their navball and nosediving. Mine too but I found a very easy fix. Right-click on the control pod/module and hit control from here, you will see your navball straighten up. Also the issue only showed up for me when using a Pod and Unmanned Control Unit so I don\u0027t know if this will work for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
