Sky-crane, Lander? I have only ever once got a rover down on to the mun and you\u0027ll see how hilarious it was. My early method was to strap it upside down via a decoupler to the top of a lander, then when landed tip the ship over and decouple the rover hahaha... So Obviously I need better methods! Plus I would also like to put a rover down on Duna, is it the same concept as the mun? or would it need parachutes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cupcake...","CreatedById":62843,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T00:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually use a lander I made called the Minnow which has become quite the little workhorse. It has plenty of mounting options for single or even multiple rovers.
