To follow the real SLS \u003Cem\u003Eeach\u003C/em\u003E Kickback should have around twice the thrust of a Mammoth. So if the total liftoff thrust of a KSP SLS had stayed the same, we should have had Kickbacks delivering 2000 kN each ASL, a Mammoth delivering 1000 kN, and a Vector delivering 250 kN. Then the Vector would look pretty normal, though chances are it would still beat the Skipper on vacuum Isp and TWR.\u003Cp\u003EEven if the Mammoth had been something like 2000-3000 kN (because less thrust than the Mainsail might raise eyebrows), that would still have lead to a better Kickback and a more sensible Vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you saying Mammoth\u0027s 4000 kn is overpowered?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T16:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022More Boosters\u0022 data-cite=\u0022More Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre you saying Mammoth\u0027s 4000 kn is overpowered?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say unbalanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat or the Mammoth is indeed overpowered and SRBs underpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T16:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaarst\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaarst\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d say unbalanced.\u003Cp\u003EThat or the Mammoth is indeed overpowered and SRBs underpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRBs are underpowered for sure, they cut off far too early.
