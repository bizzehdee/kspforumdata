My point was to prove that this isnt a balanceable problem. There\u0027s a serious code time investment. As Nertea said, he\u0027s a modeller by passion, a programmer by necessity. I think the amount of code time involved in updating the reactors would be more investment than allowing this to continue to exist.

You cannot reliably test the expected behavior with the setups and systematic you chose. You\u0027ll notice that I haven\u0027t done any testing myself yet, and instead asked for an official test build with proper reactor stats, and that\u0027s for a reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The reactors you tested with have no (or bogus) values for skin conductivity under 1.0.4. Therefore the reactors don\u0027t handle heat as they should; they have the wrong thermal mass and radiate the wrong amount of heat. The self-radiation in particular can make or break a stability point, and without it, you cannot reasonably conclude that a reactor stabilizes or fails to stabilize at a certain temperature. Conductivity is another factor; 1.0.2, reactors weren\u0027t very good conductors, but that may change because it\u0027s no longer necessary to keep heat confined to a single part. Or it may change the other way, making them conduct even less, because the reactors might aim for a higher nominal temperature in the future. Until these values are intentionally defined with 1.0.4 in mind, no test can give more than a rough indication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In your second test, you mounted the engine with the second-highest heat output in all of NF Propulsion. It outputs waste heat equal to some of the larger reactors, and even in 1.0.2, it would cause temperature issues for ships without additional radiators dedicated to it (just ask Darth Lazarus!). The fact that it destabilizes the equilibirium between reactor and radiators is not a problem, it is expected behavior if the radiators are sized for the reactor alone. (Also: yes, 1.0 made infinite fuel also provide infinite Ec. It was very useful during NFP testing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In your third test, with the elevated maxTemp values, you increased the reactor\u0027s heat output by 60%. Why? There\u0027s no reason to expect this value to change in any way for this update; you should have tested at default heat output. The unnecessary increase is single-handedly responsible for the test to fail. From a scientific standpoint, this is a serious systematic error and could be interpretated in... certain ways. Just saying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Nertea: since we\u0027re most discussing NF Electrical right now, do you think it would make sense to move the discussion over to the Near Future thread?

Build a part that does something novel and useful, and it requires fudging physics? Okay, may be acceptable. I eventually went with advocating fudging the physics on the DS01 Charon MPDT because it turned out that the size-0-to-size-0 bulkhead connection arbitrarily limits thermal conductivity to a huge degree. But build a part that is redundant, then fudge physics in order to justify its existence? That just feels contrived... Now of course, Nertea\u0027s parts came first and the new stock radiators merely sniped their reason to exist, so nobody can blame anyone for seeking new and novel ways to keep them relevant. I just think that fudging physics should be a last resort, not a weapon of choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps we might even get away without fudging physics. I have some vague ideas, but they\u0027re all pointless to discuss as long as I don\u0027t properly understand how NF reactors will run with stock radiators and proper skin stats. Once there is a test build available, this will certainly be the focus of my testing activities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
