If its not there, try temporarily moving all your mods out of your \u0027GameData\u0027 folder and running it again. If Eeloo is actually there, check where your probe is. Maybe its a problem related to your autopilot mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, are you actually entering Eeloo\u0027s sphere of influence? You can check this by selecting the probe in the tracking station and hitting the square \u0027I\u0027 button on the right side of your screen. If you actually just want to orbit Eeloo, simply wait untill you\u0027re a minimal distance away, then fire retrograde. If you\u0027re heading straight for the planet, you should adjust that before you get too close so you have a periapsis outside the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho\u0027s i advise to do this manually once you get closer to Eeloo since your autopilot seems to have problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome screenies would be useful :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-29T05:57:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2013 05:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spyritdragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T17:33:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmmm... have you tried restarting KSP?
