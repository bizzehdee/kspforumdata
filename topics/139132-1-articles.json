The\u00A0base is modular and was built on the surface of Mun from cca 10 independent modules. Everything went really smooth, but when I loaded the base yesterday, it started to wobble after aproximately 10 seconds. The wobbling became stronger and stronger and after a while, the base disassembled violently in a huge ball of fire and sent the poor kolonists to a suborbital trajectory. When i quickloaded the last save, the same thing happened two or three times. And the last time I tried quickloading, tha base didn\u0027t explode, but started to move across the surface at about 1 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy install isn\u0027t heavily modded - just KIS/KAS, KER and chatterer. I suspect that the landing legs are somehow at fault, but I have no idea how to fix it. I would appreciate any advice, I really like my base and a lot of time went into building it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it would help, I can post some pics when I come home from work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMichal.don\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T12:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich version do you play ? 1.1.2 ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had explosive wobbling with mun space station (well, I call it the Mun curse becaus I only had that on my Mun space stations...).
