Launching straight up will get more altitude from your stages, but you need to go sideways to reach orbit which gains velocity instead of altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-02T20:21:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen flying straight up, you are fully subject to gravity. Every second, your craft is accelerated towards the gravity well by the value of gravity. For example, on Kerbin, every second you are hovering or moving straight up and down, you add 9.8 m/s velocity in the direction of the planet\u0027s core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need engines to overcome this. If your engine also adds 9.8 m/s of velocity to your craft every second, but in the direction away from the planet\u0027s core, your craft experiences no net change in velocity - you are hovering (or rather, holding your current velocity). This is referred to as a thrust-weight-ratio (\u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022) of 1.0. If your thrust-weight ratio is greater than 1, you accelerate away from the gravity well. If it is less, you are pulled down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity changes slowly with altitude. If you are gaining altitude, that means that gravity is decreasing, which means less velocity is added in the direction of the gravity well, which means that the same amount of engine power will accelerate you faster. Your effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E increases with altitude. Do note, however, that whenever people talk about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, they generally do so in regards to surface gravity, so don\u0027t get confused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs your engine consumes fuel, the weight of your rocket decreases. This, again, improves your effective thrust-weight ratio, meaning that the same amount of engine power will accelerate you faster as you progress through your flight. Rockets accelerate at their hardest right before burnout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you are launching from Kerbin (or any other body with an atmosphere), the performance of your engine is diminished by atmospheric pressure. As you climb out of the atmosphere, this effect gradually disappears - the engine returns to its full power output. This again means that your effective \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E increases as you gain altitude. At the same time, the atmosphere also causes drag against the craft, which works to reduce its velocity. Atmospheric drag depends strongly on the shape of the object and its speed. As the atmosphere thins, this effect gradually disappears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, there is a large amount of factors in play, many of which are unique to each individual vessel and/or launch location. The math you need to do is almost guaranteed to involve integrals of functions over the burn time and other such shenanigans. Considering that there\u0027s no practical gameplay reason to answer that question, it\u0027s probably not worth the effort - unless you really must satisfy your curiosity.
