This way, the parts\u0027 coordinates are stored twice: once at their exact positions relative to the origin of the ship (like it is in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E), and once in the \u0022flying vessel\u0022 where they are stored as they are in-game, rotated and moved if the ship moved turned, etc. Plus, the ship\u0027s current rotation (relative to the one it has in the fixed version) is stored somewhere and updates every time the ship rotates. At every reload of the ship, a copy of the fixed version is rotated so that it has the same rotation as the ship, and the positions and rotations of all the parts of the \u0022flying\u0022 version are updated to those that are stored in the rotated copy of the fixed version. That way we don\u0027t have gaps between the parts or random rotations of the parts (due to floating-point rounding) with ships that made 57 times the journey from Jool to Kerbin (or the ones that have flown a lot of time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I\u0027m not clear, don\u0027t worry (that\u0027s normal), if you need some explanations simply reply \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-21T18:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best KSP-like is the one where I get on a rocket and go to space in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-21T19:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to The Lounge\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-22T05:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would have all the stuff I like and add in the stuff I wish it had, but wouldn\u0027t have the stuff I don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, it would be so perfect that I wouldn\u0027t have to describe what those things are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-22T06:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcedural fuel tanks, wings, engines, and anything else that it\u0027s reasonable to make procedural.
