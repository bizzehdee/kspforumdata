Just keep in mind that if you want to keep your parts on a low memory footprint, then your areas of focus should be your collision mesh and your texture. The texture on your part could probably be made a little lower-res without anyone noticing, though as long as it isn\u0027t above 128x128 - 256x256 you don\u0027t need to worry about your texture being too high detail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T14:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that would be my suggestion, is to make the teeth a little less blocky.
