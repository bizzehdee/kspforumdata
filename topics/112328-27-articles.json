I had a generator designed to one-shot generate the 3000 in a few seconds, and it\u0027s power was being dumped overboard as far as I could tell.  The same generator had worked pre-1.2.\n\u003E \n\nFound the solution to this, i.e. how to not dump the excess. The break in compatibility was probably caused by changes in resource handling in stock.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 12/30/2016 at 0:56 PM, JPLRepo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What it does do is consume EC per physics step of the amount defined in the part config by the field \u0022ChargeRate\u0022. This is defined as 30 EC units for all the DeepFreeze parts by default (of course you can change it if you so desire). As long as your vessel is generating 30 units per physics frame then it will continue to consume 30 units until the 3000 is met.\n\u003E \n\nWas able to verify that this is the case, so all is well, no issue on DF side of things.  \n\nWorth mentioning that it\u0027s a little tricky trying to work with with a rate given per physics delta time, given pretty much all other resource generation/consumption is given per second.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-19T03:38:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2017 03:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by cake\u003Epie**\n  \nphrasing"},{"CreatedByName":"Japcsali","CreatedById":148489,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-24T19:43:34Z","Content":"Hello!               \n\nIs it possible to change the settings after launching career mode?
