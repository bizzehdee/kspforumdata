Refer to picture in doubt.**\n\n**Result:** The attachements point of the radial decoupler are still red (heat overlay is still on) (see picture)\n\n**Severity:** Very low (debug menu enabled function)\n\n**Fixes/Workarounds:** Make sure the decoupler ejected section isn\u0027t destroyed\n\n**Other Notes/Pictures/Log Files:** \n\nAny decoupler does the trick. It should be a pretty obvious fix. I initially figured that out in flight, so i\u0027m assuming it\u0027s not a corner case at all.\n\n![v4Q0U4g.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/v4Q0U4g.jpg)\n\nIf the part survives, i\u0027m unable to reproduce. Makes sense. See below (ejection force was zero, and the part was placed very low).\n\n![XFPAjcd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XFPAjcd.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T19:40:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 07:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain H@dock**\n  \nExtra reproduction info (decoupler needs to blow up)"}]}
