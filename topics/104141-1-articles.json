You get your probe, Phile, and head down to the comet. You land, and bounce because of the low gravity. You land on the dark side, but you still landed. The excitement of landing on a comet for the first time! Wow, if only we had that in KSP. My request, is that someone add a comet or 2 to KSP. I\u0027d love that very much. If you can\u0027t do it, I\u0027ll do it, it\u0027ll take a few weeks though XD.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T22:40:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaking a comet is easy, but getting the tail is what\u0027s tricky.
