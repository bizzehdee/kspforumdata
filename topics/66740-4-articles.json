that he handed the source files (unity, photoshop) for the relevant b9 parts, this will greatly speed up my progress and help me make higher quality stuff because I don\u0027t need to crudely adjust a flattened version of the textures or a baked version of the model etc, though this means I want to spend a little bit of time to \u0022up-res\u0022 my work by switching from my pretty crude modifications to the actual source files, also working on re-structuring the assets etc to make it not use duplicate files etc, I didn\u0027t really plan all this out that well to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome updates:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0srvUdJ.png\u0022 alt=\u00220srvUdJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg

count version with no science equipment is 28 seats (32 -2 that would block the doors, -2 that would inside the WC), science lab version will be 8~ and have beds, at least one desk along with science gear and in general more free space and facilities for long-term space exploration while the 28 seat version is just for shorter duration A to B trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pushing to release a new version of this mod this weekend including an improved version of the Mk2 IVA (some polish), and a updated version of the S2 2m IVA to use the new window position etc and the high capacity S2 6m pictured above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext in the pipeline is the science version with 8 seats, part I\u0027m tackling after that I think is the S3 supersonic cockpit and the Mk5 cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBac9 and Tav are interested in bundling these IVAs with the next update to b9 btw, pretty sweet, part of the reason I need to clean up my assets etc to make them use less ram and make more logical sense so they can be bundled with the mod proper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry about the \u0022delay\u0022 but in the end you\u0027ll get better quality IVAs and more people get to enjoy them if they\u0027re rolled into the b9 release proper, I\u0027ll continue to improve the IVAs separate from the official b9 release cycle because I think I\u0027m going to interate on these IVAs at a higher rate than the big official releases happen, and I\u0027ll make it so you can just slot my updated version on top of the b9 install and it replaces the files as you\u0027d expect it to work, then when b9 gets updated they can just integrate my latest version.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
