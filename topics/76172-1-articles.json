The main problem here is that Jool\u0027s orbit is closer to a Jool-Eeloo transfer orbit in energy than to a Kerbin-Jool transfer orbit. That means that you have to bleed off some energy in Jool\u0027s SOI in order to get a Hohmann transfer to Eeloo.

Another way is to use one of Jool\u0027s moons to remove some speed, but that\u0027s probably even harder to plan. A third way is to just get an Eeloo encounter while on a more energetic transfer orbit, and then use multiple Eeloo flybys coupled with deep-space maneuvers to lower the orbital insertion burn.

Normally if you leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI and just coast around back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI without flying by anything else or making any deep space maneuvers then you will enter with the same speed you exited with.

The minimum speed to get to Mun is about 856m/s so potential savings are about 98m/s minus maybe a 10m/s correction budget per flyby. Enough to win a challenge if everything else is optimal.

Eventually I gave up and just ejected in whichever direction, but even if I had been able to eject radially, I would have needed to tweak the final Mun flyby to set up a Kerbin encounter 1 year in the future. Unfortunately, when you\u0027re in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you can\u0027t set it as a target, nor can you get \u0022Closest Approach\u0022 indicators one year in the future.

You can get to Eve for not much more than the cost of getting to Mun.

The first 3 flybys showed the benefit of multiple Mun flybys to adjust the Mun departure vector to be tangential to Mun\u0027s motion and thereby as efficient as possible. It looks like when he entered Kerbol orbit he was moving at 8709m/s, Kerbins Vcircular is 9284m/s so his V leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI (I\u0027ll call it VSOIK) must have been about 575m/s. This equals a V over Vcirc in a 75x75km Kerbin orbit of 985m/s, since he started with 862 the total gain from the 3 Mun flybys was 123m/s. Just 42m/s more (at the 75x75 orbit start) and that would be enough to get to Eve all by itself. Probably only a 30m/s or so gain over just doing one really low Mun flyby on the way to Eve though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The 4th flyby was much more powerful. He went from a 7:6 resonance-with-Kerbin orbit (SMA about 12.272 million km) to a Kerbin-Eve Hohmann transfer orbit (SMA 11.716 mkm). The V apoapsis of those are 8768 and 8505m/s respectively. This means he entered SOIK at 516m/s and left at 779m/s. The 4th Mun flyby gave him 263m/s VSOIK! To be fair, at a Kerbin distance of 12000km (where Mun is) the speed change (relative to Kerbin) is 878 to 1054m/s or only 176m/s but that\u0027s still a lot.
