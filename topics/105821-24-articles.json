There is also this issue with Unity:\n\nProps should not contain flat mesh colliders -- such objects when seen with a world-space camera cause Unity to spam error messages and cause a sharp drop in performance.\n\nI would also guess the pizzaoverhead IVA mod you are referring to is actually for moving the IVA cameras around, not making them visible from external/flight view.

Transparent Pods?\n\nI\u0027m looking into it currently.\n\nAlso, the new dev build should help with your lag issue (can now turn off TransparentPods for each part via the right click menu)..\n\nBut you need to make sure you specify the transparentTransforms parm in the JSITransparenPods setup so that it makes your windows opaque when you switch off the transparency. Otherwise you get an view through the part window to an empty interior.\n\nSeparately though, I\u0027ve picked up some discussions on a few other threads of lag/performance issues with TransParentPods.\n\nIn some testing I have discovered that Props cause lag with TranparentPods.. So I am looking into a potential change to JSITransparentPods to turn off Props (but not all of them, perhaps add a config file flag, as some props are large and the IVA from the outside may look silly if they are not there) when you are in flight view to try and deal with this lag issue as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-23T23:24:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2015 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T01:51:01Z","Content":"I plan on this being the last [dev build](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqhmekylfc310am/RasterPropMonitor-dev.0.23.0.zip?dl=0) prior to v0.23.0\u0027s official release.

The new feature is fairly limited, but I\u0027ve wired everything so MechJeb spaceplane guidance (glideslope and heading/altitude for hold heading) can be adjusted from RPM, as can MechJeb Ascent Autopilot goal altitude (with the right props - not included).
