Please do tell if I\u0027m missing great synergies, bargain price/performance ratios or superior options at a relatively modest amount of $ extra. You know, consumer stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve come up with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGPU:\u003C/strong\u003E R9 290- Reasoning: Good high end card, but I think the upgrade to the X isn\u0027t worth the extra cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMemory:\u003C/strong\u003E DDR3 1600Mhz 8GB. Or 16. Undecided on whether to get it 4x2, 2x4, 2x8 or 1x8.

I\u0027m going to do mostly gaming and scrypt mining (for which the cpu doesn\u0027t really matter). I want to be current and not be bottlenecked, but don\u0027t need breakneck CPU performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStorage:\u003C/strong\u003E Looking at a 240GB SSD from one of the more reputable brands which I\u0027ll supplement with my junk 5400RPM TB drive for unimportant/slow storage.

They range from 50-300 bucks and for the life of me I can\u0027t spot the difference. Apart from the obvious stuff like how many slots of which kind they have I don\u0027t know what to look for here. The 300 buck one had an NFC on-switch which is neat but not worth hundreds of extra bucks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s what I\u0027m looking at.
