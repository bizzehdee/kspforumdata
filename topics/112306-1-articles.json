Maybe this imgur album will explain better than I could in frustrated words because this is frustrating me to no end.\n\nI\u0027ve also had instances where I simply can\u0027t right click on anything when it bugs out, while everything else works.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/4eto0)\n\nModlist:\n\nBefore anybody says narrow it down, I\u0027ve TRIED, MULTIPLE TIMES. While the error does appear in stock, attempts to narrow it down have led to maybe module manager, DMagic Orbital Science (I suspect that this is actually a major culprit), several dead ends when I attempt to binary search since the error seems to reproduce sometimes and then suddenly not reproduce, even when I try to replicate conditions in a branchoff with few mods. In short, I have tried to narrow it down, but it goes in a different direction every time I try.\n\nSometimes it reproduces and sometimes it doesn\u0027t, I\u0027ve even tried near-stock craft, but the only times it seems to 100% reproduce is in the exact game environment that I\u0027m experiencing it in.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![6tKMm2i.png](http://i.imgur.com/6tKMm2i.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nOutput log: [http://sta.sh/01ycb80ehvdn](http://sta.sh/01ycb80ehvdn)\n\nEdit: Sometimes it triggers on EVA where I can\u0027t right click things and often it seems to happen after I toggle back from map view. To fix it, I have to go back to KSC and then return to the craft.\n\n\\*bump\\*\n\n\\*bump\\*\n\nHello? Anybody?\n\n100 views and nobody? I keep having this problem every time I go on EVA and do science, most every time, and it\u0027s annoying as heck.\n\nI already did, DMagic hasn\u0027t said anything about it.\n\n\\*KAPOWS IT TO THE FRONT\\*\n\nShould I assume that I\u0027m the only one seeing this?\n\nIt\u0027s still happening as of 1.0.4, can ANYBODY even help or what?
