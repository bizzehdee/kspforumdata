A printing press, a river or life?\n\nWhy should my parents need to be the same? We do not. Fire follows the natural forces in physics. Life specifically can decide differently, and is neutral to the physical interactions, but instead applies logical or computational interaction. An example of this is your PC. The game KSP is specifically neutral to (does not care about) the chemical processes on you PC. It decides on your vessel velocity based on logical processes, and decides if you reach orbit. Make the HDD out of copper or plastic (DVD), magnetic or optical, it still functions. DNA likewise is a chemically neutral ordering, that gives a specific function.\n\nFire is specific chemical interactions, life is the logical operation of a set of any mechanical interaction fitting the similarity with what we currently know to be life. Chemical or not. Life is not limited by it\u0027s chemicals, nor is it limited to any specific chemicals (as far as we know, it just performs best with the current set).\n\nThanks KerikBalm.

Yes, they are common to life, and if an entity has all seven, we would very likely all call it \u0022alive\u0022, but it\u0027s not all that is to life. Especially at smaller scales, it tends to break down. \n\nThere are three key items that, to me, define life for a given entity:\n\n1. It contains genetic information, which is passed from generation to generation\n\n2. A body of highly-similar (genetically) entities evolves its genetic information and behaviours over time (this naturally follows from point 1) \n\n3. It actively maintains homeostasis. The end of this homeostasis means the death of said entity.\n\nEntities that have merely points 1 and 2 is what I would call not alive but nevertheless biological.\n\nEspecially that third item is what I have been missing in this thread. And it is oh-so important. I have seen someone mention \u0022boundary between inside and outside\u0022 as a defining property. This forms the basis of homeostasis, but it is not the end of it. Homeostasis means that the entity keeps its internal properties (hence it needs outside/inside border) relatively stable by some means, *regardless of its surroundings*. There are many forms of homeostasis, and higher forms of live have ever more complex ones. The most simple is osmotic pressure. The concentration of salts and organic compounds (nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, etc) inside a cell tends to be widely different from that outside, and the cell actively maintains this. More complex forms of homeostasis include such things as blood pressure, blood oxygenation levels, heart rate and structural integrity. Life must spend an arduous amount of energy on maintaining this homeostasis. When it ceases to do so, it will die. E.g. a human dies if blood pressure isn\u0027t maintained, blood oxygenation levels drop, heart rate drops, salt balance (i.e. kidneys) is disrupted, you name it. \n\nAn interesting property also arises from this homeostasis: living things seem to have locally lower entropy than their surroundings. The necessarily contain and produce higher-order structures. Ironically, these same higher order structures allow for extremely efficient energy transfer (e.g. photosynthesis is much more efficient at converting light into chemical energy than the simple radiative heating of the sun on bare rocks), which in effect increases the entropy of the total system. \n\nSo some practical examples:\n\nIs fire alive? No. It doesn\u0027t convey genetic information from generation to generation (it doesn\u0027t have generations at all), and therefore also doesn\u0027t evolve. Very temporary homeostasis *might* exist for fire, but this is self-limiting, so not truly there. \n\nIs a rock alive? No. It has none of the three properties.\n\nIs a virus alive? In *most* cases no. It however is quite obviously a biological entity, in the sense that it most definitely carries genetic information and evolves. There are some viruses that skim the border, and seem to have some form of sustained homeostasis. \n\nIs a bacterium alive? In the vast majority of cases, yes. However, just as with larger-than-usual viri, there are bacteria which are so small as to entirely depend on host species to survive, so they skim the border between alive and not. \n\nAre mitochondria and chloroplasts alive? Interesting question! They do have genetic information, which they pass on from generation to the next, and also evolve. Furthermore, it is generally assumed both evolved from endosymbionts. But, AFAIK they cannot survive outside of the host cell, i.e. the host cell provides for most homeostasis purposes.\n\nAre humans alive?

In *most* cases no.\u0022\n\n\u0022Is a bacterium alive? In the vast majority of cases, yes.\u0022\n\n\u0022Are mitochondria and chloroplasts alive? Interesting question!\u0022\n\nYou also didn\u0027t address if something is alive when it is dormant, and how dormant it can be.... because there are various levels of dormancy... like a hibernating bear on one hand... and dessicated tardigrades on the other.\n\nA virus outside of a cell vs a virus inside a cell?\n\nThere are many cases of life cycles at which at some point, the life form ceases to actively maintain homeostasis, but instead relies on a durable form such as a spore.\n\nWe don\u0027t call that alive or not alive... but instead invent a new term: cryptobiosis.\n\nFWIW, I never see anyone debate what is alive or not alive in the lab or in scientific journals. These are biological entities with known properties.\n\nBeyond describing those properties, you\u0027re just talking semantics.\n\nFYI, responding to this:\n\n\u0022But, AFAIK they cannot survive outside of the host cell, i.e. the host cell provides for most homeostasis purposes.\u0022\n\nThey can remain viable for a time outside the host cell, long enough to be transplanted... but they certainly can\u0027t reproduce or be cultured.\n\nTake the human mitochondria for example... its genome encodes just 13 mRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs.\n\nIts proteome has \u003E1000 proteins.\n\nIt must import a lot of nuclear encoded proteins.... yet the RNA components for a protein translation system are fully encoded by its genome.\n\nThe neccessary ribosomal proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, many many many other enzymes, are not.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T06:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 06:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T07:10:55Z","Content":"\u0022You also didn\u0027t address if something is alive when it is dormant, and how dormant it can be....\u0022\n\nSleep = alive.
