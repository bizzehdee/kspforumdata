Secondly this play style tends to make me get bored of the game before I go out to many other planets as doing Kerbin/Mun/Minmus missions can only be entertaining for so long before the boredom starts to kick in, which is why I only end up with a couple years of Kerbin time passing before I stop playing all together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo out of curiosity, does anyone else use this play style, and regardless of that what are your opinions on this sort of play style?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T10:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need Kerbal Alarm Clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople who don\u0027t have Kerbal Alarm Clock have the exact problem you described.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CoriW","CreatedById":57866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T10:42:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022More Boosters\u0022 data-cite=\u0022More Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou need Kerbal Alarm Clock.\u003Cp\u003EPeople who don\u0027t have Kerbal Alarm Clock have the exact problem you described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh I should have mentioned I have Kerbal Alarm Clock. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I schedule it with all the transfer windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E I think part of my thing too with not getting to many other planets is because of how long it takes me to get the tech tree unlocked to a point where I have all the parts that I consider necessary for going to other planets.

Secondly this play style tends to make me get bored of the game before I go out to many other planets as doing Kerbin/Mun/Minmus missions can only be entertaining for so long before the boredom starts to kick in, which is why I only end up with a couple years of Kerbin time passing before I stop playing all together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo out of curiosity, does anyone else use this play style, and regardless of that what are your opinions on this sort of play style?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re entirely in the same boat, brother.
