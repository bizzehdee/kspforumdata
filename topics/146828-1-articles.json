I add a few mods which are realistic in my mind and 90% of them are voided as \u0022non-rp0\u0022. There\u0027s more to spaceflight than planes and rockets, NASA has been pursuing science with high altitude balloons,\u00A0ground based astronomy,\u00A0naval water research and more- so seeing the tech\u00A0tree and outside parts limited kind of puts me off. If nothing else I want it to be an open tech tree, not a closed one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy other issue is\u00A0(which this one could be opinion based debatably) that I want to start much earlier than the default 1950 tech tree. I want to start at 1900, right before the birth of modern cars, planes, and especially space flight. We must not forget that the huge initial stepping stones for spaceflight occurred in the 1930s and 1940s and I want to be a part of it!\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy last and sole issue is one where I must sadly agree with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002239636\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Veeltch\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s idea with a slightly different career mode progression :/ .

These are great mods and I love each of these mods as they are amazingly well made (not to mention the amazing support provided with them), so I do not blame them for what I\u0027ve said, if anything it\u0027s a vision thing. My ideas for what RP-0 should be are just simply different from theirs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said; If someone also feels that RP-0\u0027s progression is a bit off and has modding skills; I\u0027d love to make a new career mode!
