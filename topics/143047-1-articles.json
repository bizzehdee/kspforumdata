I built a good rover and tested it with moving tunnels, but discovered that it can\u0027t fit underneath/between the landing legs on a vertical 2.5m section (science lab, habitat, ISRU). I\u0027m going to test whether or not I can attach wheels and turn those sections into trailers that I might be able to drag to and fro. I quite enjoy the challenge, I just wish the test phases were able to be conducted more quickly....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-06T01:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other things you can land on, besides landing legs ....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Netherman555","CreatedById":165955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-06T01:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re willing to use mods, I would suggest Simple Construction or (if you\u0027re really wanting to get complicated) Extra-Planetary Launch Pads.\u00A0 These allow you to build ships anywhere in the solar system as long as you have the resources to do it.\u00A0 I think \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/32396-022-extraplanetary-launchpads-legacy-thread/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis link \u003C/a\u003Esays more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you want to do this the old fashioned and undoubtedly more fun/challenging way, I have a few suggestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nKeep it simple: there\u0027s nothing worse than creating a super-complicated structure just to find out there\u0027s a part confliction.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStandardize your height: What I normally do is use a fuel tank (normally an orange rockomax) and put the wheels for all my structures at half the height of an orange tank.\u00A0 That normally helps pretty good.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExcessive Is Always Better: I will probably be yelled at for this, but it\u0027s definitely what I do.\u00A0 If it seems like too much fuel, but it works, keep it!

The less docking you do the better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut precise landing is not that hard when you can manage landing well. Even, I though it was hard so I didn\u0027t tried until quite recently, I succeeded immediately. It was much easier than I though. I remember targeting a Mun arch and had to do a emergency burn not to hit it !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hardest thing to do is to really slightly aim above your target. The left/right errors are the easiest to get (the display is not precise enough to get \u0026lt;3km precision without one or several course corrections). So it\u0027s the hardest to fix. The vertical distance is easier to handle because you can easily burn radial (in or out) and hover very far (by wasting fuel though).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest avoiding the \u0022kill speed and drop on target\u0022. It\u0027s very expensive and not precise. The cost of a correction burn is usually high because you fall toward the ground and you don\u0027t have much time to do it. With a shallow approach, a very small burn can increase or decrease your range by few kilometres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a final tweak, you can always do a little hop toward your target. It\u0027s easy if your ship isn\u0027t too bulky and responds well to reaction wheel control..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"obney kerman","CreatedById":171373,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-29T16:48:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust send all the modules to roughly the same place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
