enough that it really makes a real difference. \u00A0I\u0027m not counting Minmus because there you just leave shortly before its AN or DN with LKO so you arrive at its DN or AN as the case may be, adjusting your Ap to get there at the same time as Minmus. \u00A0Hanging out for a few days beyond Minmus\u0027 orbit won\u0027t bust your life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as to the

all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that leaves Dres and Eeloo. \u00A0The way to get to them non-Hohmann is to do a ballistic transfer. \u00A0Here, you do the necessary plane-change as part of the transfer burn, to avoid doing a larger plane-change burn en route that the standard Hohmann requires. \u00A0To figure out how to do this, there are 2 main options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u00A0MechJeb\u003Cbr\u003E\nMJ\u0027s Maneuver Planner ap has an option called \u0022Advanced Transfer to Another Planet\u0022. \u00A0This brings up a porkchop plot. \u00A0Look for the darkest blue areas (zooming in as necessary) as these represent the lowest dV for the trip. \u00A0Click on the desired spot on the plot and select \u0022Create Node\u0022. \u00A0MJ will then create a maneuver node for a ballistic transfer. \u00A0This node will be at the proper ejection angle, at the proper point in the future, and will have a bit of normal up/down mixed in with the prograde to send you directly to the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0Doing it Manually\u003Cbr\u003E\nUse \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external

normal \u002B/- directions, and what day to leave on. \u00A0Then you have to create the node yourself at the proper time, eyeballing the ejection angle, and manually pulling its handles to give it the proper amount of dV in the required directions.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you use MJ, you might want to run the website anyway while still in the mission planning stage.

\u0022plot it\u0022 button, you get a table of numbers to the right of the plot. \u00A0Look on this table for the \u0022Ejection dV\u0022. \u00A0This is the total amount of dV for the transfer burn along the direction you\u0027ll be burning, which of course is inclined to Kerbin\u0027s equator, and is not directly useful when creating nodes. \u00A0So hit the blue button next to the \u0022Ejection dV\u0022. \u00A0This brings up a pop-up that has the total transfer burn resolved into its prograde and normal \u002B/- components. \u00A0It\u0027s those components that you actually use when creating the node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to put this into practice, it goes like this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWarp ahead until you\u0027re just barely less than 1 orbit away from your departure time (Kerbal Alarm Clock is your friend)..\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCreate a maneuver node at the ejection angle shown by the website. \u00A0You\u0027ll have to eyeball this unless you use a mod like Protractor or Launch Window Planner.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPull on the node\u0027s prograde handle until the amount of dV shown for the burn is the same as the prograde component you got from the website.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPull on the normal up or down (as told by the website) until the total dV shown for the burn is the same as the total Ejection dV from the website. \u00A0Compare the predicted trajectory to where you want to go. \u00A0Slide the node VERY SLIGHTLY forward or backwards along your orbit, or slightly tweak the burn components, as needed to get the predicted trajectory to hit the target with a Pe approximately where you want it. \u00A0This is extremely difficult to do with just the stock interface so you might want to use Precise Node or MJ\u0027s Maneuver Node Editor for this fine-tuning.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDo the burn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to really do this manually without pulling your hair out, you need several instrumentation mods to make the job of node creation easier, even possible. \u00A0Or you could just use MJ to do it all for you in 1 go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a couple of caveats either way you go, however. \u00A0First, due to floating point errors and the inevitable speedbump when leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you will still need to make a small tweak burn en route to get the encounter you set up to start with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, regardless of their inclination, all planets in the game have zero axial tilt. \u00A0This means that because you\u0027re not hitting the target at AN/DN, you will arrive with some inclination to the target\u0027s equator. \u00A0Therefore, if you want to be in an equatorial orbit at the target, you must do an inclination burn once there. \u00A0These are cheaper the further away from the planet you do them. \u00A0Thus, don\u0027t do the capture burn all at once. \u00A0Stop soon after you\u0027ve got a closed but highly elliptical orbit just barely within the target\u0027s SOI. \u00A0This will put your AN or DN with the equator as far from the target as possible. \u00A0Coast out there, fix your inclination, then come back and finish your capture burn to achieve the desired orbital altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour

most savings are for\u00A0Eeloo or Dres, where you can save\u00A0a few hundred. \u00A0For Eve, Duna, or Jool, it\u0027s rather less (a few dozen). \u00A0Again, Moho is NOT included in this because you do neither a Hohmann nor a ballistic transfer to get there, but either a bi-elliptic or a gravity brake off Eve instead. \u00A0And that\u0027s a whole \u0027nother story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that the dV savings comes in 2 flavors: \u00A0The amount needed for the plane change needed to hit the target in the 1st place, and the amount needed for any plane change at the target itself to get into an equatorial orbit there. \u00A0The longer you wait to do the en route plane change, the steeper the angle of the plane change, so the more it costs. \u00A0Then when you hit the target, you have a greater inclination so the more it costs to get into an equatorial orbit there. \u00A0So the ballistic transfer spends less on the en route part by doing it as far from the target as possible, and thus creates the least inclination upon arrival at the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best place to do a transfer burn is at the lowest possible altitude\u00A0at your departure planet. \u00A0The worst place is out near the edge of its SOI. \u00A0This is for 2 reaons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#1: \u00A0Oberth Effect\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe faster a rocket is already moving, the more efficiently its engines burn fuel. \u00A0IOW, it takes fewer units of fuel to create a given amount of dV. \u00A0The closer you are to the departure planet, the faster you\u0027re going, so the less fuel you burn to generate the dV needed to go somewhere else. \u00A0The higher your parking orbit, the slower you\u0027re going, so the more fuel you burn for a given amount of dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2: \u00A0dV Required\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have to achieve escape velocity to leave Kerbin the 1st place, much less the extra velocity needed to get to the target. \u00A0The higher your initial velocity, the smaller the difference between it and your target velocity, so the less dV you need to generate during the transfer burn. \u00A0Your initial velocity is highest when you\u0027re as close as possible to the departure planet and lower the higher your orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the lower your parking orbit, the less dV you need to generate (thanks to higher initial velocity) and the less fuel you burn creating that dV (thanks to Oberth, which is a function of higher velocity). \u00A0The higher you are, the more dV you need and the more fuel you burn creating it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, with a ballistic transfer (to anything EXCEPT Moho), the amount of normal \u002B/- dV needed is so tiny that you can do it very close to your departure planet. \u00A0Remember, it\u0027s not how close you are to the departure planet that matters, it\u0027s how close you are to the target. \u00A0And your departure planet is as far from the target as you\u0027ll ever be, so doing it there is a trivial expense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T19:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks

never just gone straight from the pad to an interplanetary transfer. \u00A0I always go into a parking orbit first because that\u0027s what all the algorithms (website, MJ, or any other source) are based on. \u00A0IOW, I make a distinction between \u0022launch window\u0022 and \u0022transfer window\u0022. \u00A0A transfer window to me is when the planets are aligned so that the transfer burn requires the least dV, which happens according to the music of the spheres regardless of whether you\u0027re on the ground or in a parking orbit. \u00A0I use \u0022launch window\u0022 strictly for the case of when to leave the ground to go directly from the ground to some target orbiting that same planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I don\u0027t think\u00A0the \u0022heading\u0022 in the pop-up on the website is the direction\u00A0to launch at. \u00A0As mentioned, the website assumes you\u0027re already in a circular, equatorial parking orbit, which means it\u0027s assuming you launch at 90^. \u00A0If you just hit \u0022Plot It\u0022 leaving all the default values in place for the 1st Duna window, the heading will be 78^, which will put you in a Kerbin orbit with 12^ inclination. \u00A0This is absurd given that Duna has only a 0.6^ inclination. \u00A0Rather, I think that \u0022heading\u0022 in the pop-up is a sanity check that you created your node correctly. \u00A0I think that when you create the node at the proper ejection angle, its marker on the navball\u00A0should be at 78^. \u00A0I THINK. \u00A0But it\u0027s definitely not your launch azimuth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, the dV maps (which do not lie) and long experience indicate that the transfer burn from Kerbin to Eve requires only 1490m/s worst case. \u00A0That\u0027s if you hit Eve when it\u0027s at its highest point above or below the ecliptic. \u00A0If you happen to hit Eve at an AN or DN, then it\u0027s only 1040, barely more than going to Minmus. \u00A0Usually, however, the transfer is about 1100-1200m/s. \u00A0So a 2700\u002B transfer burn is way off, and is probably a result of being in an overly inclined Kerbin orbit and having to drag your inclination back down to hit Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T23:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

This will usually be a higher number than if you are allowed to start from an optimally inclined orbit, but since Kerbin\u0027s surface is moving at 175m/s at the equator it will cost more to get from the KSC into a non-equatorial orbit than to launch into an equatorial orbit.\u00A0 So we come to your question about how much launching into the optimal orbit can save in the departure burn.\u00A0 Looking at the first Kerbin-Eve window,\u00A0 Alex Mun\u0027s plotter says the lowest-dv transfer (from an equatorial orbit) leaves Kerbin on Y2 D160.8 and arrives at Eve on Y2 D357.4. From an equatorial, 75x75km orbit it requires a 1072m/s ejection burn (Normal of -201.8m/s, prograde of 1052.4). Note that this would be one burn, done at 75km Kerbin altitude. It would be very inefficient to do a 2nd burn near Kerbin\u0027s SOI to correct inclination.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 I wrote Flyby Finder to compute departure burns assuming you start in the optimally inclined orbit.\u00A0 If you search the same window with it it gives the lowest dV transfer (from any inclination orbit) as leaving Kerbin on Y2 D141 and arriving at Eve on Y2 D339 and requiring a 1058m/s ejection burn (all prograde), but you have to start from an orbit that is inclined -28.3 degrees.\u00A0 I tried it and found that when launching a Kerbal X into these orbits with Mechjeb it costs me 27m/s more to get into the 28-degree 75x75km orbit than an equatorial orbit. So the equatorial is better by a little bit, unless for some reason you need to leave earlier in the window. Note that Mechjeb isn\u0027t too accurate in placing you in an exact inclination and LAN orbit, (and I\u0027m far worse trying to do it manually) so the equatorial approach is usually better in practice since that is easier to get into.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is normally\u00A0 the case, either way is pretty close to each other in total dV, so the easier equatorial wins.\u00A0 The exception is when there is no low-inclination solution in a given transfer window (which happens sometimes for the slow-moving Dres, Jool, and Eeloo) or any time you need to arrive at your destination when it is far from Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane. Then you can save up to hundreds of m/s by launching into the optimally inclined Kerbin orbit instead of an equatorial Kerbin orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd if you are using RSS, or in the real world, then all of this goes out the window since you launch from a non-equatorial site, and the Earth\u0027s equator isn\u0027t in the plane of the planet\u0027s orbits.

This will require a boost of 934m/s, and the velocity will be 26m/s at apoapsis. Because Kerbin\u0027s SOI does not go to infinity you cannot reduce this number and stay in Kerbin\u0027s SOI.
