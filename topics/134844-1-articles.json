I have noticed a rather strange thing. I am logged in to my forum account on quite a few devices (Linux Desktop, Windows Desktop, Work Desktop, Tablet, Phone, ...). However, when I log in to \u0022one too many\u0022, to me it seems that one of the other devices gets logged out. I have observed this more or less consistently, and I am sure I did not clear any cookies. I don\u0027t think they expired either, because the logins are a few days old at most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it just me or does the number of active logins seem limited? If so, is there a way to increase the limit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s quite low priority, because obviously i can just enter my password.
