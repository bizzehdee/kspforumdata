After the first two locations failed, I attempted to copy the dll to every directory within the KSP application bundle, with no success. I also attempted to place it in the KSP root directory, and in a directory named KSP_Data/Mono/, and /usr/lib/ (and some other system-level lib paths), also with no success.

I might take a deeper look at this tomorrow morning when I\u0027ve got a bit of time (though I\u0027m doubtful there is an easy resolution... and copying files into App Bundles is a bit ugly and prone to breaking anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestions at least.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralTigerclaw","CreatedById":92104,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T00:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pizzaoverhead\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pizzaoverhead\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMusic packs deserve their own threads for people to discuss them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat link IS its own thread.

No luck. Error message changed slightly: \u0022STED MP3 Import error: libmpg123-0\u0022, but that might be due to changes you\u0027ve made. The few indications I saw on the Unity forums about this particular issue (and even one on libmpg123 itself) hint that the Application Bundle needs to be rebuilt in XCode for library additions to be supported, something which is obviously beyond our grasp. I took a chance and tossed it in the antiquated \u0022KSP/Plugins\u0022 directory and GameData/SoundtrackEditor/Plugins, but that also didn\u0027t do anything useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does, however, behave properly with mp3s resident in the SoundtrackEditor/Music folders, provided the mp3 is not assigned to a scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA new issue has arrived: Setting a scene\u0027s music to \u0022none\u0022 results in a peculiar segfault that neither produces an output.log (or whatever the usual naming convention is for the crash log), and does not include anything in the main log - just a flat out crash to desktop.

There were no errors reported in the log, and I would expect it to throw something if AudioClip.Create failed. This occurred after setting the SpaceCenter scene to \u0022none\u0022. Setting both menuTheme and menuAmbience to \u0022none\u0022 also produced the crash, but not either-or, as, oddly, setting only the menuTheme scene to \u0022none\u0022 resulted in skipping the KSP Anthem. If emptytrack was null, I would expect any use of it to crash exactly like SpaceCenter, but Unity can be weird like that sometimes. Even more peculiar is settings credits to \u0022none\u0022 does not produce the fault. (The crash only occurs on accessing the scene for which the track is \u0022none\u0022 and not at load.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for looking at these issues.
