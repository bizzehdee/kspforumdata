Since i\\\u0027m assuming that everyones attempts are all on one persistence files and can see that comsats from different \\\u0027companies\\\u0027 will communicate with each other.

I don\\\u0027t really like either solution as it creates a lot of extra work for little benefit. I\\\u0027m more inclined towards an abstract solution like stating \\\u0027three sats in kerbo-synch orbit allows full kerbin coverage\\\u0027 and repeating that for each body. That way the focus will remain on craft design and the correct satellite constellation setup within the capabilites of the craft will be implied. Satellite missions are not up for another few turns, I\\\u0027ll make up my mind before then.\n\nAs for what format I prefer it doesn\\\u0027t really matter, but if you keep the following pointers in mind it\\\u0027ll make things easier for me:\n\n- Include a finance overview, including your craft, tech and contract entry costs.\n\n- Include the turn number and your (forum) name in the subject line\n\n- Include flight instructions, especially if your craft requires some funky staging or flight profile\n\n- Put your mission and contract submissions in the same e-mail\n\nGood luck with your space program!\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"robsr3v3ng3","CreatedById":18051,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T18:56:54Z","Content":"Just sent off my first submission.

Some notable events, in no particular order include\n\n-The first orbit, proudly established by **Awaras**\n\n-The first kerbal casualty, sustained by the valorous crew of **sjwt**. The brave pilot was honourably crushed by excessive G forces. The family has been compensated to the tune of 25% mission profit which happened to be a generous sum of 2400 monies.\n\n-Copious amounts research into Booster Tech, it has now reached its final low price of **3200** monies\n\n-Some new missions shooting probes and telescopes at stuff (see OP for details)\n\n-A new rule: First and Second bonuses cannot be claimed for \\\u0027lower\\\u0027 missions than the highest one claimed by you previously. Ie. if you flew the 80km mission you can\\\u0027t claim the 50km bonus. You can do the 50km mission if you like, but no bonus if it\\\u0027s still up.\n\nWith the announcements for the next turn out of the way, on to the results of this one. First up, the design contest. Four entries were submitted by **Sal\\_vager**, **Sjwt**, **Fireblade**, **Robsr3v3ng3p**. Good design efforts made by all, yet some difference in posted speeds.

Payout $1500\n\n3. **Sjwt** with a top speed of **1016** m/s. Payout $1000\n\n4. **Robsr3v3ng3** with a top speed of **994** m/s.

The only difference will be that this time the destination has to be the south pole.\n\nI\\\u0027ve given the question of how to handle powersats for unmanned missions a thought and I\\\u0027ve come up with the following: \n\n-Upon researching the unmanned pod, you can use it and give commands when within LOS of the KSC, as would be expected.\n\n-Upon researching the powersat, you gain an extra \\\u0027launch slot\\\u0027 per turn which you may utilize to launch a powersat deploying rocket. More than one powersat per rocket are allowed, but only one launch. You will have to fund these launches completely by yourself, however cooperation and cost-sharing is allowed.\n\n-The owner of the powersats can decide for himself whether or not to share the sats, however to prevent favouritism and excessive roleplaying this decision is universal and irreversible. You share your sattelites either with everybody else or with no-one, and you cannot go back on your decision to share them. It is possible to have both shared and private sattelites however.\n\n-To use somebody elses powersat you still need to have the technology researched.\n\nI realize that this makes unmanned missions that require maneuvers outside KSC LOS quite expensive, possibly prohibitively so unless you guys cooperate. I like manned missions much more than I do unmanned, and I don\\\u0027t want unmanned to be the de-facto best solution once it has been researched. Since nobody has as of yet invested in unmanned technology I feel I can make these changes without screwing anybody over.\n\nAnother thing, if you guys have ideas for missions that you\\\u0027d like to fly, feel free to submit them. They might just make it into the mission list for the next turn. \n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T06:54:08Z","Content":"I have been looking at the parts prices and I have to ask: Why exactly is the gimballed LFE more expensive than the large LFE? It is the same weight as the large with less thrust and the same fuel efficiency. The only advantage it has is that it has thrust vectoring, but the fact that everyone uses mechjeb (right?) makes that irrelevant - mechjeb can keep even the largest, most massive ships (that will probably be outside the realm of possibility in this campaign) stable without using thrust-vectoring engines.\n\nI guess what I am asking is why would anyone playing this campaign even consider using the gimballed LFE? If it was cheaper than the Large LFE, someone might use it, but as it is it is pretty useless."}]}
