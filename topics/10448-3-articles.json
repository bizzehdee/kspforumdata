The only difference will be that this time the destination has to be the south pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve given the question of how to handle powersats for unmanned missions a thought and I\\\u0027ve come up with the following: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Upon researching the unmanned pod, you can use it and give commands when within LOS of the KSC, as would be expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Upon researching the powersat, you gain an extra \\\u0027launch slot\\\u0027 per turn which you may utilize to launch a powersat deploying rocket. More than one powersat per rocket are allowed, but only one launch. You will have to fund these launches completely by yourself, however cooperation and cost-sharing is allowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The owner of the powersats can decide for himself whether or not to share the sats, however to prevent favouritism and excessive roleplaying this decision is universal and irreversible. You share your sattelites either with everybody else or with no-one, and you cannot go back on your decision to share them. It is possible to have both shared and private sattelites however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-To use somebody elses powersat you still need to have the technology researched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that this makes unmanned missions that require maneuvers outside KSC LOS quite expensive, possibly prohibitively so unless you guys cooperate. I like manned missions much more than I do unmanned, and I don\\\u0027t want unmanned to be the de-facto best solution once it has been researched. Since nobody has as of yet invested in unmanned technology I feel I can make these changes without screwing anybody over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing, if you guys have ideas for missions that you\\\u0027d like to fly, feel free to submit them.

It is the same weight as the large with less thrust and the same fuel efficiency. The only advantage it has is that it has thrust vectoring, but the fact that everyone uses mechjeb (right?) makes that irrelevant - mechjeb can keep even the largest, most massive ships (that will probably be outside the realm of possibility in this campaign) stable without using thrust-vectoring engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I am asking is why would anyone playing this campaign even consider using the gimballed LFE?
