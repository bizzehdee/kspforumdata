So if you have just one command pod on that ship, the pod\u0027s \u0027up\u0027 direction will be always the center on Navball. If you have conveniently placed docking port on that ship, you can transfer control to it using right click.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERetrograde engines are usually not needed because the ship can turn around in space. If you install them, you need to remember to install corresponding correctly oriented control point as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
