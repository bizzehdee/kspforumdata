I downloaded the RSS version that is 10 times smaller, the size of the vanilla kerbol system. But, there are no oceans at all. From map view, you can see Earth with oceans, but when you get close enough to the ground the Earth texture fades and the oceans are simply not there. It\u0027s actually quite funny; I launched a simple satellite, collected some Science, and tried to recover it by landing it in the ocean.
