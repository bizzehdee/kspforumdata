There seem to be quite a few people who would like some insight into how to the tracks are made. It\u0027s a hell of a process, and took me months to perfect, so this is about the only way to pass the info on in a concise fashion. I have yet to tackle landing gear - my plugin needs an animation update to get that going really, but I do kinda have an eye on it. Probably not this time!
