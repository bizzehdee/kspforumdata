I want to start out that if this is the wrong place to post this i\u0027m sorry, i\u0027m new here (not really, i barely ever use the forum!). But anyway, would you buy a Expansion Pack for KSP that was exactly like Realism Overhaul but not buggy and insanely laggy? Im guessing the issue with this right now is the Unity engine. But imagine what KSP would be like in Untiy 5! So many possibilities! So, imagine a DLC for KSP that would make it Realistic and make the game run using Unity 5... Clearly this would be a gift for the very long time players or the science fanatics, not something for beginners! But still, they are planning for Multiplayer DLC right now so i doubt having and expansion at all would be much of an issue! Tell me what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Again, Amazed on how close the poll is! But what i meant on \u0027Realism\u0027 i meant like, having Real Planet Scale and our real solar system, Rocket Engine Thrust, Aero dynamics, and realistic progression. Not just like... Heres a Saturn 5 rocket, now take it apart and put it back together, All i meant was have real scale and realistic mods...
