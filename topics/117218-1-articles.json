I also lurked for a long time before posting for the first time haha. As you can see from my post count I still mainly just lurk lol. My first post was an epic kethane mining colony on Minmus, something I\u0027m still pretty proud of today. Congrats on the Mun landing! I remember the first time I landed on the Mun. I failed miserably several times before finally figuring out how to kill my horizontal velocity, and probably only after watching some Scott Manley videos. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T01:14:36Z","Content":"Would be interesting in seeing it landed before rover was detached."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T01:26:13Z","Content":"You never forget your first time.\n\nWhy, I remember the first time I landed on Mun.
