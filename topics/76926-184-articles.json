Make them fire tweakable amount of flares or chaffs upon activation, from available dispensers, at tweakable RPM. Currently, if I want to have many flare dispensers just to increase total number of flares, I need to assign each pair to its own action groups, or they fire all at once, which still gives me only 42 button presses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Combatsmithen","CreatedById":146407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T14:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBaha can you give the targeting pod more zoom.
