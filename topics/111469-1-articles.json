I got this game after seeing it being played on twitch and so far I am really liking it. It seems to be lacking in real life space related stuff though, which I really enjoy. I saw a twitch user ChrisPBacon82 playing with a lot of realistic styled spacecraft and worlds and I am looking for help into getting into something similar. I really enjoy real-life spacecraft, especially old stuff from the space race, both Russian and American, manned and unmanned. I am looking where to start from experienced KSP players here on the forums. Thanks guys and hoping to be playing with cool real-style stuff soon!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T11:28:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 11:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RoadBlock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T11:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello RoadBlock. Welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know who ChrisPBacon82 is, but there are a lot of people in the community who build all sorts of things.
