If you set up your staging correctly, you can punctuate your stack separations with cool but harmless explosions, which incidentally eliminate the extra debris of the separator ring itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do this, set up your staging like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage X: Upper stage engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage X\u002B1: Separator and Septratrons mounted on lower stage X\u002B2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage X\u002B2: Lower stage engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, your lower stage burns out. You hit the spacebar to drop it, pause about 1 second, then hit spacebar to ignite the upper stage engine. When you drop the lower stage, its Sepratrons move it back a safe distance from the upper stage while the blue ring of the separator coasts with the upper stage, remaining just behind the upper stage engine nozzle. Thus, when the 2nd hit of the spacebar fires the upper stage engine (you having left the throttle on), its exhaust blows the separator ring backwards at tremendous speed. The separator ring then strikes the front end of the lower stage and explodes violently often engulfing the upper stage in the fireball. However, no damage done to the upper stage and because the separator ring is destroyed, the amount of debris is the same as if you\u0027d used a decoupler.
