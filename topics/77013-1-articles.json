For stage 1 I decided this should be 20km or just after and for stage 2 it should be once Ap is on the edge of space and the craft is nearly in orbit but low enough so stage 2 will burn up. the S-IVB should have enough fuel to raise the craft to orbit, perform a TMI using a FRT which is 872Dv and then have an option of aiming for the munar surface or deep space. I have left just under 100Dv in the S-IVB for this purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApollo 13 for example had 2200lbs of spare fuel on top of the extra fuel to guide the spent stage into the moon and some fuel for what was called three sigma adjustments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took reports from Apollo 11 as a guide for roughly how much fuel to carry. It appears the Apollo 11 was coming in to land under mechjeb, sorry Apollo Guidance Computer control and the autopilot was going to land them in a rocky area so Neil Armstrong took semi manual control and guided them to a better landing spot. They had 15 seconds of fuel left when they landed. So, to replicate that (and be able to fly the same thing if we wanted) there must be enough fuel to land from a low Pe orbit, plus hover for about 30 seconds, plus have 15 seconds of hover time left in the descent stage. This matches with other reports I have read that said there was about 60 seconds of fuel on top of the minimum to land so that another landing area could be chosen if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0060t too harsh with the descent stage fuel levels.
