I went to the hangar to build my first aircraft, and I can\u0027t figure out how to attach the air intakes. Looking at the connection points on the intakes, they seem to want to be mounted on the front of something else (a wing?), but the only plane-style parts I can find are fuselage components (which don\u0027t help me because they need to attach to the cockpit and tail) and wings (which seem to have no connection points at all).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see a similar issue with the first jet engine, but it looks like at least in theory I could put it in place of the tail, even though it would look like ass.
