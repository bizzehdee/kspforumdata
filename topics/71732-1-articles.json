Actions that a given part adds to the staging list would be a tweakable so that you would not have to have opening solar panels in the staging, but you could have that if you wanted to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t recall any parts that add something in staging that isn\u0027t available in action groups, but I know I\u0027ve seen some (could be mods, though.

I built an Eve lander which consisted of a small asparagus rocket on top of a larger one. As the lower asparagus dropped stages, the engine in the smaller rocket above would ignite to help keep the TWR up. Because those small engines were above the CoM, I had to disable gimballing on them, but it would have been nice for the gimbals to unlock when the last lower stage was dropped. Inconvenient to do by hand, as there were six engines and I didn\u0027t want to unbalance the rocket by unlocking them asymmetrically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeploying solar panels automatically when the last part of the lifter stages away would be useful, too.
