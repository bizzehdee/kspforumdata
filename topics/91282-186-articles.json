If you have a global storm situation, you\u0027re likely to have two storm systems centered on either pole, with poles themselves, or some area nearby, acting as eye of a storm with relatively quiet weather. Beyond that, hard to say. On planets with high wind speeds, excluding the quiet area very close to the poles, polar regions are very turbulent, usually with a number of vortices forming a regular polygon around the pole. (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spaceflightinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/W00077250-234_coul_hi_web.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESaturn\u0027s Hexagon\u003C/a\u003E) Closer to equator, you usually get bands of laminar and turbulent flows. Any of the laminar bands are fine to fly in, but might make it very difficult to land due to wind speeds. Whereas, ground wind speeds in turbulent areas might be reasonably low, but good luck flying in them. Some sort of transition region might exist that would allow you to approach and land, but it\u0027s hard for me to say for sure, and these are likely to be unstable, so having landed successfully, no guarantee you\u0027ll be able to take off shortly thereafter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf planet\u0027s weather is not dominated by planet\u0027s rotation, you are likely to be looking at powerful storms at the terminator region with relatively quiet weather on the day and night sides. Unfortunately, temperatures there might be a problem. If the planet is not rotating rapidly enough to generate weather across its surface, then the day side is going to be very, very hot and night side very, very cold. Whether either of these prevents landing is going to depend on specifics. If the planet is close enough to the star, maybe night side is just fine for landing, and vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-04T05:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223876584\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221604423929\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ARS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, ARS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there\u0027s a terrestrial planet with planet-wide storm (imagine Mars, but with it\u0027s global dust storm cranked up to eleven) that lasts indefinitely, assuming we have a reason to go down there and build something (doesn\u0027t have to be a colony, just an outpost or comms/sensor tower with skeleton crew is enough) where\u0027s the best region to choose in order to minimize the windspeed?
