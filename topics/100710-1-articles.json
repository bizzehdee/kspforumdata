Less than 1 and gravity wins, you aren\u0027t going to space today. Exactly 1 and a vehicle can hover or maintain its current vertical speed but not accelerate upwards (if the current vertical speed is 0, on the pad, you aren\u0027t going to space today). A launch TWR of 1.2 - 1.6 is generally considered best. More engines (thrust) or less vehicle (mass) increases TWR so keep your vehicles light. Not so important once in orbit, but a low TWR means your vehicle can\u0027t accelerate as quickly (isn\u0027t as agile).\n\nDeltaV - potential change in velocity vector = To change direction or speed in space you need to fire your engines in the opposite direction. How much a vehicle can change its speed or directon (the velocity vector) depends on i) the engines\u0027 Isp (shown in the VAB), ii) how much fuel the engines have, iii) how much the vehicle masses. Use more efficient engines (higher Isp), add extra fuel or reduce the mass of the vehicle (eg; by staging to jettison empty tanks and other used components) to increase the deltaV.\n\nThe tricky bit for launch-vehicles is that getting a high TWR usually means big, heavy and inefficient engines ... which then can\u0027t lift the amount of fuel they need to get to orbit. Using more efficient engines often means they don\u0027t have enough thrust to get off the pad in the first place. It\u0027s rocket science.

I think of dV like a currency. The dV remaining in your vessel is what\u0027s in your \u0022wallet\u0022 or \u0022purse\u0022, and the dV needed to make a maneuver is the \u0022cost\u0022. In what Bob has described, \u0022what everyone here has given\u0022 is the former, and \u0022change in velocity needed etc\u0022 is the latter. Note both \u0022kinds\u0022 of dV are in m/s, the same way both costs in a store and money in your wallet is represented in dollars or pesos or pounds or whatever.\n\nTrips from A to B, like from LKO to the surface of the Mun, can be done via multiple different paths with differing dV costs. The trick is to find a low dV cost path, and then design a vessel with sufficient dV (and TWR, but that\u0027s beyond this discussion) to fly that path. \n\nOne final note: The dV costs of the trips are independent of vessel mass, which makes it a convenient measure for discussing and comparing orbital flight paths to reach various locations."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T17:47:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV is change in velocity, and it acts as a size-independent measure of maneuver difficulty and craft performance.
