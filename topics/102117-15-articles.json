Heck, it was probably awesome enough for a release a few versions ago. But the thing that keeps it from perfection, and in fact impacts gameplay *a lot* are performance issues. \n\nEvery crash lets you with the nagging feeling that the game is unfinished and rough, in a way that no missing content you never heard about ever would. And we are talking 1.0 here! The game has to be as solid as it possibly can, and with such a sturdy base you can go about adding even moar bells and whistles on top, *after* 1.0.\n\nRune.

Definitely going to need a new demo with 1.0 as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Barefoot Friar","CreatedById":77638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T16:18:36Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been carefully going over the Dev Notes all the way back to January 27th. I\u0027ll PM my notes to anyone who wants. At any rate, taking HarvestR\u0027s list from [the Beyond Beta post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/326-Beyond-Beta), and looking at the dev notes and other announcements since then, I can see that:\n\n- The new aero system is finished\n- Re-entry heat is almost finished\n- The Engineer\u0027s report is almost finished\n- Female Kerbals are finished\n- As part of the new aero, new fairings have been implemented and they and the cargo bays have been debugged\n- Resources are in QA\n- New landing gear is finished\n- The aero stability overlay has been canned, or at least pushed back\n- Timewarp To is finished\n- New, larger wings are in\n- Tier 0 buildings are finished or close to finishing\n- Kerbal clambering is finished\n- A new sandbox demo is finished, and a career demo is under construction\n- Some new tutorials are finished\n\nThis leaves:\n\n- Bug fixes. Some have already been done (lots of them, according to one dev note), but probably no where near all of them. Consider it WIP.\n- Sound overhaul. I\u0027ve not seen anything at all about this.\n- Economic systems rebalance.\n- Parts rebalance\n- Tech tree rebalance. It\u0027s being worked on, but it\u0027s not nearing completion from what I can tell.\n- Contracts revision\n- Asteroid and interplanetary tutorials are still under construction\n\nIt\u0027s a lot, and it might be the most grindy. However, it\u0027s not going to be impossible to knock these things out in a few weeks, barring further illness or other setbacks. Given we\u0027ve seen nothing announced about a release date, and given that an announcement would have to be made a certain length of time in advance, I don\u0027t think the release will be before the middle of April -- more like the middle to end of May. To me, given how much ground they\u0027ve covered since January 27th, it looks like they can make it.\n\nExcept.\n\nExcept that there are always lots of bugs that go unnoticed. The developers likely have dream systems that run everything smoothly, or they\u0027re simply too close to the issues to see them. There is a reason why authors hire editors; people tend to overlook the problems with their creations, and having outside sources to tell them there is a problem becomes a necessity. Granted, the QA testers should be able to catch these things, but even they don\u0027t catch everything.\n\nThus, I think the wisest choice would be to do like Ubuntu does and have a 1.0-RC that comes out a week or three before the release date. This will allow the community to try to break it, and any glaring issues can be quickly fixed before the real thing ships. But even if Squad doesn\u0027t do that, I think it will still be okay. This isn\u0027t GTA V; even after 1.20 came out I still can\u0027t play that buggy mess, and that\u0027s a console game that should have been optimized to the known and reliable hardware and software requirements. Every software has some bugs upon release, but I think that most people will be able to play it. I know there are some folks who haven\u0027t been able to; I\u0027ve had games like that as well that should have played but simply for some reason refused.\n\nOverall I\u0027ve changed my mind. I think they can do it. The major feature of the new aero, coupled with the new lift system, the re-entry heat and effects, and the new wings, fairings, and cargo bays are all in. Those are the major things that should be in for 1.0, because resources can be added later and not break saves. The little things, like kerbal clambering and female kerbals are already in and (I think) finished.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T16:24:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Barefoot Friar**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T16:47:01Z","Content":"@Barefoot Friar\n\nDon\u0027t forget that ISRU/mining was also scheduled for 1.0, but we haven\u0027t really heard anything about it since the initial 1.0 roadmap."},{"CreatedByName":"Barefoot Friar","CreatedById":77638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T16:55:40Z","Content":"Ah, I forgot to mention that.

Everyone seems to think that it isn\u0027t important, but of all the features on the table at the moment, only the aero refinements rival that.\n\n Without ISRU, Engineers are near useless. Without ISRU, interplanetary travel is not indicative of the modes being proposed by ACTUAL interplanetary missions (mainly recent Lockheed and SPaceX proposals.) Without ISRU, space stations have VERY limited value. ISRU is also the big goal after mastery of the solar system. What do you do after you land on Laythe? Once you\u0027ve experimented and planted your flag, Duna is useless. Everyone thinks, naturally, \u0022Live and work there, in some way that benefits my future goals\u0022 - like pulling fuel out of the ground.\n\n Without ISRU there is no 1.0 for me, not when this is a part of the product that has been pushed since a .jpeg was released a long, long time ago. I\u0027m actually somewhat astounded that everyone else in the community is so uncaring about this feature when it ties so many parts of late-game career progression together. \n\nTL;DR ISRU is a must. I would sacrifice aero for it. And I believe strongly that a .99 update before 1.0 is a great idea. Don\u0027t worry about giving us your bugs, Squad.
