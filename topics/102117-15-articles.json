However, it\u0027s not going to be impossible to knock these things out in a few weeks, barring further illness or other setbacks. Given we\u0027ve seen nothing announced about a release date, and given that an announcement would have to be made a certain length of time in advance, I don\u0027t think the release will be before the middle of April -- more like the middle to end of May. To me, given how much ground they\u0027ve covered since January 27th, it looks like they can make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept that there are always lots of bugs that go unnoticed. The developers likely have dream systems that run everything smoothly, or they\u0027re simply too close to the issues to see them. There is a reason why authors hire editors; people tend to overlook the problems with their creations, and having outside sources to tell them there is a problem becomes a necessity. Granted, the QA testers should be able to catch these things, but even they don\u0027t catch everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I think the wisest choice would be to do like Ubuntu does and have a 1.0-RC that comes out a week or three before the release date. This will allow the community to try to break it, and any glaring issues can be quickly fixed before the real thing ships. But even if Squad doesn\u0027t do that, I think it will still be okay. This isn\u0027t GTA V; even after 1.20 came out I still can\u0027t play that buggy mess, and that\u0027s a console game that should have been optimized to the known and reliable hardware and software requirements. Every software has some bugs upon release, but I think that most people will be able to play it. I know there are some folks who haven\u0027t been able to; I\u0027ve had games like that as well that should have played but simply for some reason refused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I\u0027ve changed my mind. I think they can do it. The major feature of the new aero, coupled with the new lift system, the re-entry heat and effects, and the new wings, fairings, and cargo bays are all in. Those are the major things that should be in for 1.0, because resources can be added later and not break saves. The little things, like kerbal clambering and female kerbals are already in and (I think) finished.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T16:24:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Barefoot Friar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T16:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Barefoot Friar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget that ISRU/mining was also scheduled for 1.0, but we haven\u0027t really heard anything about it since the initial 1.0 roadmap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barefoot Friar","CreatedById":77638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T16:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I forgot to mention that.

Without ISRU, interplanetary travel is not indicative of the modes being proposed by ACTUAL interplanetary missions (mainly recent Lockheed and SPaceX proposals.)
