With a normally built ship, your thrust is aligned with the root part, so the direction marker in the center of the NavBall is also showing your thrust direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou normally want to push (or pull) the asteroid keeping its CoM exactly aligned with your thrust, therefore with the CoM in the center of the NavBall. Any deviation from true center will impart some spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven a very slight deviation, if kept during a long or powerful enough push, will impart crazy spins. What you want is to change the deviation so to apply thrust that will actually stop that spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI normally use to push asteroids (did quite a lot while testing ARM), and when pushing to the left of the CoM, the roid will spin to the right. The same opposite relation goes with any other direction. I use to angle my thrust so to apply spin to the roid towards the direction I want it to rotate, and that way I can not only avoid it spinning wildly, but even rotate where I want more speedily than with other means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf need be, I use short impulses of thrust, only applied when the CoM is deviated from my thrust direction in the correct direction (I can use whatever means, RCS, wheels to rotate my ship so that the roid CoM comes in the correct position relative to my thrust). And, since the grabbing device is not rigid, but will allow some wobble, I use that wobble to time when to apply thrust in the correct direction, so to keep the roid oriented where I need it to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T23:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAcademically, that all makes sense... but I\u0027m still not sure how it relates to the whole pivot thing.

I didn\u0027t use scenario ships, but my own (so can\u0027t and won\u0027t judge about those ships from Squad). The dimension (mass) of the roid is really of much importance, the same kind of ship I used without any trouble with Class C roids (about 100 tons) had a very hard time with a Class E (3500 tons). Those are sluggish, take a lot of time and attention to be oriented correctly, and I could only apply a fraction of thrust or the ship would go to pieces. But, even in that case, it was possible for me to bring that roid where I wanted by applying that \u0022trick\u0022 with oriented thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, if you can keep the roid lined up with your ship (so CoM and thrust aligned), it will go straight. For small roids, it is easy. It should also be easy with pulling roids, rather than pushing them (so you have to use a ship with the grabbing device in the same direction of the thrust of your engines, similar to the one shown in the video from MaxMaps), but I never went with that. But for pushing bigger roids, you can\u0027t keep the \u0022purple circle\u0022 aligned, even the slightest deviation will make for increasing torque and spin. So the only way is to reorient the ship and counter that spin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T00:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, I think I\u0027ve got it now.

What you want is to align the CoM of the roid with that marker, and that most probably means orienting the roid. If a small roid, you can orient it with RCS or wheels on the ship, keeping the grabbing device pivot fixed after having oriented the ship to be alinged with the roid CoM. But with a large roid, you\u0027ll end your monoprop and even all electricity in the effort of orienting with RCS and wheels. My suggestion is then to free the pivot and let the ship orient so to have the thrust in the opposite direction (in respect of the roid CoM) than the blue marker. Thrusting will then make the roid rotate towards the blue marker. Actually, you need to plan for stopping that spin when CoM and blue marker are aligned, and that requires to reorient the ship in advance, while the roid is rotating, with a reversed deviation than the one used to make it spin. To orient only the ship (not the roid), RCS or wheels are good, so it shouldn\u0027t require much effort (unless the spin of the roid is so fast to be out of control, but then it is best left go or it will crash the ship). If the timing is just right, the spin will be cancelled when CoM and blue marker are aligned, so what\u0027s needed is just to realign the ship\u0027s thrust with the roid\u0027s CoM. If the ship was really perfectly aligned, then thrust would be all used to achieve the maneuver as planned. But, while pushing the roid, any slight deviation will again generate spin. It is then when I use the \u0022wobble\u0022 effect, so if the roid begins a spin to the right (so the blue marker goes to the left), i wait when my thrust (NavBall center marker) has wobbled even more to the right than the CoM, and apply thrust then, with the effect to reduce or even reverse the spin and bring the roid orientation back where I want it to stay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-04T00:50:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2014 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by diomedea\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling mistakes\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Riftmann","CreatedById":101626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T02:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh I\u0027m so confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time I did it, I looked at the tracking station and one of the first asteroids I see is a Class E asteroid coming within 50 km of Kermin.
