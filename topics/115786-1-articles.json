It\u0027s been all done using 4x symmetry, and it worked fine until earlier yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it seems one of the pipes somehow switched orientation. Now one of the tiny tanks gets drained extremely fast as soon as I start the engines (and its engine dies), and meanwhile the three other engines don\u0027t pull fuel out of their own tanks or the central one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft is a little too far to just go to VAB and send another one.
