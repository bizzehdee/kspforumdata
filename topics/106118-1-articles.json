Sorry if any of the below statements bother you.\\*\n\nHello everyone! This is UpsilonAerospace.\n\nRecently, there have been quite a few little things that have been bugging me *immensely* with the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Spaceplane Hangar. If someone at SQUAD took maybe fifteen minutes to mop these up, the game would look a lot more polished and professional, in my opinion. The lack of this polish is quite worrying to me, and (with all due respect to SQUAD) it comes off as shoddy and careless.\n\nI should mention before I get any further that the Engineer\u0027s report and other features are very nice... but they don\u0027t help my frustration much.\n\n**So, here\u0027s what I dislike about the VAB/SPH.**\n\n**\u003E The Clouds.** It\u0027s adding insult to injury that we can\u0027t get clouds in 1.0, except for the ones hanging outside of the VAB/SPH. This is misleading to new players (\u0022The sky looks different in the VAB/SPH than it does in the game! Has some part of my install gone wrong?\u0022) and it\u0027s been there for far too many versions.\n\n**\u003E Part Rotation.** When you mouse over the parts arranged on the right side of the screen, there is an enlarged image of the part rotating. With some of these (the Mk2 Lander-Can), the part doesn\u0027t rotate about its center, but instead traces a wide loop: the \u0027center of revolution\u0027 appears to be the hatch. With some of these (Big ol\u0027 \u0022Mammoth\u0022 engine cluster), the part is located too high up, so that the top of it is off the little image. With some of them (the Command Seat), *there is no image of the part at all*. This is one of those things that could probably be fixed without much trouble, so it\u0027s strange that it still exists.\n\n**\u003E Part Specs.** For many engines, the basic part specifications next to the part image have a scroll bar next to them, as they are *ever-so-slightly* too large to fit on the lines provided. If the scroll bar is used, the additional information to the right of it flickers in and out precariously.\n\n**\u003E Grammar Errors.** There are some pretty serious grammar errors in part descriptions. My personal favorite is this one, in the \u0027Flea\u0027 booster\u0027s description: \u0022The RT-5 can be seen in use at many space programs, perhaps possibly because it is the only option for many space programs, but nevertheless, this small booster provides a nice kick to launch small payloads to considerable heights.\u0022 This sentence is a train wreck. Other errors that appear commonly are joining an independent clause to a dependent clause using a comma and the word \u0022and\u0022 (seen in the Mobile Processing Lab, among other places); starting or ending the description with a sentence fragment (very common); and improper lists (\u0022The \u0027Drogue\u0027 parachute is small, deploys high up, and certainly not enough to stop you smashing into the ground...\u0022 - Radial-Mount Drogue \u0027Chute). \n\n**\u003EReusing Descriptions.** This is especially true with the structural wings. Structural Wings of type B, C, and D and Swept Wings of types A and B all have the exact same, incredibly undescriptive two-sentence description. Likewise, the five types of Wing Connectors say only \u0022A vaguely wing-shaped board;\u0022 \u0022A vaguely wing-shaped board. Use at your own risk;\u0022 or \u0022Found in a trash bin next to the wing factory.\u0022 All three of the Mk3 cargo bays say the exact same bland little statements as well. Typing a description should take only a couple of minutes, so reusing descriptions strikes me as lazy (sorry). It seems as if this problem has only gotten worse as the versions progressed: the earlier parts\u0027 descriptions seem to be much more high-quality that the ones used today.\n\n**It would be** ***so easy*** **to fix these things.** Unless you know something about programming that I don\u0027t (which is definitely possible), it seems as if these little issues would take only a couple of minutes to address. And yet, they weren\u0027t addressed... for KSP\u0027s biggest release.\n\nThis is one of my top priorities in the coming hotfix. Can you please, *please* take a little while to fix these things, guys?\n\nIf you find any other errors with \u0022the little things,\u0022 please let me know. Sure, they\u0027re little, but when combined, they become much larger.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\n-Upsilon\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T22:01:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:30:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Engineer\u0027s report and other features are nice...\n\nI\u0027d rather say bugged.

It uses the phrase \u0022many space programs\u0022 twice in a row, which is a no-no. This thing isn\u0027t technically a run-on sentence, but it is quite long and thus a bit difficult to read. The last bit of the sentence would read better if it didn\u0027t have an adjective before every noun - \u0022small booster,\u0022 \u0022nice kick,\u0022 \u0022small payloads,\u0022 \u0022considerable heights\u0022 - although I\u0027m just being pedantic with that last one.

If a part has a bit of backstory followed by an explanation of its usage, that\u0027s great! If it doesn\u0027t have anything that informs players of how to use it or what it is used for, it\u0027s pointless. After all, the descriptions are written mostly for newer users why don\u0027t have a good idea of how the parts work. If the parts\u0027 descriptions are vague or contain only non-useful information, is there really a point to having a description at all?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s some heavy OCD stuff, yeah.\n\u003E Have you seen that screw on the runway?

But I would prefer that SQUAD takes some time to fix the little things that are wrong with this update before diving headlong into the bigger stuff.\n\nSQUAD has a certain internal schedule that it needs to follow, and like all game companies, it must budget its time well. Pretty much all of the things you mentioned would likely take days or even weeks to code. The stuff I\u0027m recommending (while it *is* less significant) would probably take an hour or two, tops. In other words, SQUAD could fix all of this stuff that I want to fix *and* add the stuff you wanted, no problem. Or, they could just put it off for another version, for no real reason at all.\n\nOh, and I also agree wholeheartedly with Spacepetscompany\u0027s statement:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You are [going to polish the floor] if you\u0027ve declared the building officially \u0022complete\u0022 (1.0).\n\nIf the game is supposed to have any semblance of completion, *all aspects of it need to be polished*. SQUAD has done a reasonably good job with some aspects, but it\u0027s done a poor job with others. There\u0027s really no way to say \u0022But it\u0027s not important!\u0022 when it\u0027s basically the first thing you see upon starting a new game. There\u0027s no way to say \u0022We can fix it later!\u0022 when it was already supposed to be fixed by now.\n\nAgain, though, I seem to have a different set of priorities than others. As Azimech says, I guess it\u0027s good to have diversity ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Upsilon"}]}
