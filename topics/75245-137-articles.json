It won\u0027t ever be out of contact with KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Launch 3 or 4 satellites aboard a manned vessel and release them at appropriate times to maintain contact with KSC. This is kind of like rendezvous, but backward. Launch your craft into an elliptical orbit, detach a satellite above KSC, circularize just the satellite, and wait for your craft to gain enough distance on it. Then repeat until all satellites are in place. Your craft can act as a temporary satellite too if it has any probe core on it and appropriate antennasd, however your craft must have connection with KSC for that to work, only a command station can act in place of KSC. All future networks can use this network as a backbone so only one manned mission is ever required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
