I can\u0027t wait, also, what is the maximum payload parameters? Like width, length and weight? Also, is satellite retrieval possible, what is the reentry parameters?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have zero idea at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are still brick and mortar. Meaning, we\u0027re still putting pieces together and glueing them...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZRM used stock numbers and values as well as some sample values just to test that everything worked. That doesn\u0027t mean that things are playable, and it definitely doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s usable by the average KSP gamer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t even have the KSO in my installation of KSP. That shows you how much we still have to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce it gets back to me, I\u0027m going to be testing it thoroughly while ZRM finishes up its flight model, flight numbers, engine numbers, etc. Once that is all done and good, and he\u0027s happy with it, and I\u0027m happy with it, we move on to Phase 1 release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure by then ZRM or myself will have an idea of such parameters and can be more honest on those numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was some scaling involved between me and ZRM\u0027s pipeline. So numbers I give you, may be off by a few inches/centimeters. But the Cargo bay was designed to be 1.8 (6ft) meters wide\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding why the Cockpit ended up being slightly off, and why I suspect other Cockpits made by the community have that issue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Squad has not provided a T-posed Kerbal model. If Squad wishes to have mods (or even work with 3rd parties to provide DLC type work) it is imperative that they provide a t-posed Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The problem with the Kerbals, unlike a standard character, is their limb sizes. I\u0027m a character artist by trade, but I\u0027m used to standard limb length. When I went to the Kerbal wiki and got the Kerbal size and did the math, I didn\u0027t expect their limbs to be so disproportionate. I mean they literally have no pelvis, and the thigh bones are very short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-That meant that their size is taken up by 1/3 of their head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Now that\u0027s cool and all, but it means that if you build any asset for such a character, you really should have a t-pose of the character (I can do the vertex weighting with the skin modifier to apply a biped).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I can reverse engineer a Kerbal, there are several ways to do it, the simplest way is for me to provide ZRM with a measuring cage which he sets an in-game Kerbal against. He then takes screenshots in 4 views (top, left, front, perspective) and I rebuild the kerbal in Max.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The other more elaborate method (and slightly controversial) is to use a 3D Video Card memory hook. Essentially capturing any 3D data being sent to the video card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I decided not to bog down the project by modeling a kerbal which could have taken two or more days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, because of the disproportionate limb ratios, you end up with the panel being too tall, central column too high, headrests on seats not at the right location, seats not wide enough, and so on. Hence the issue. Keep in mind I do not have the KSO project in my installation of KSP. Even if I did I wouldn\u0027t know how to update changes I make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a lot of it is like me making changes through a rear view mirror, while ZRM sends back directions through a small grey fuzzy 240p camera view...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shadowsutekh","CreatedById":55189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T21:50:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/8904-Nuka-Corp-shuttle-project-%28-and-apparently-other-stuff-D-%29?p=339742\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post339742\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/8904-Nuka-Corp-shuttle-project-%28-and-apparently-other-stuff-D-%29?p=339742\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post339742\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnariaq made a kerbal model\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZRM","CreatedById":64626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T22:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shadowsutekh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shadowsutekh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/8904-Nuka-Corp-shuttle-project-%28-and-apparently-other-stuff-D-%29?p=339742\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post339742\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/8904-Nuka-Corp-shuttle-project-%28-and-apparently-other-stuff-D-%29?p=339742\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post339742\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnariaq made a kerbal model\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, those proportions look suspect.
