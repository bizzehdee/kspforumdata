I won\u0027t be violating licenses any more, I learned my lesson. And I\u0027ve rescaled many CE parts up. And the SLS config was before he added the fuel tanks. I\u0027m also actually going to balance the parts this time around.\n\nI\u0027m not one of those 9-year-olds trying to make modpacks and planets for PFCE that has an IQ of like 10. I actually am pretty good at modding, I just can\u0027t 3d model, make textures, or code. \n\nGood grief, I haven\u0027t even posted a download! I won\u0027t make a DL until I at least get the Rodan from tygoo7, if not a 3d modeler.

I\u0027m just wondering if this is an actual effort, or you just want your name on a mod. Because these are all very nice mods, and I can\u0027t deny it would be pretty cool to see a CMES style redo of them, but this appears to be just putting them in a separate Gamedata folder, and breaking saves. Rescaling parts takes no effort at all, and is no accomplishment."},{"CreatedByName":"jefferyharrell","CreatedById":27205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T01:16:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So what can you do?\n\nMore of an idea man, I guess."},{"CreatedByName":"metalmouth7","CreatedById":72211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T01:22:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I actually am pretty good at modding, I just can\u0027t 3d model, make textures, or code.\n\nSo... you only do .cfg edits then? That\u0027s not modding, that\u0027s giving a print of the Mona Lisa a mustache and claiming it as your own because you \u0022changed it to match the style you wanted.\u0022 If you really want to make mods, learn how to model or code, and actually produce your own content. Don\u0027t just collect the work of others and change it enough to call it your own.
