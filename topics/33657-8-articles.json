You\u0027re designing things, and they seem really awesome at the time, but once you get on a building binge you start evolving the designs so fast it\u0027s hard to believe.

You\u0027ll have to get it right before you go, and that means test runs. For instance, my Grand Tour vessel did three test flights, consisting of docking with a space station in LKO, landing on Mun and drilling for Kethane, meeting up with a tanker vessel in Minmus orbit, and returning to Kerbin. On those flights, I was able to spot pretty much everything wrong with the design, so that when it was time to travel to Duna, Jool, etc. I wouldn\u0027t have any major surprises.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T20:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHehe!

It\u0027s something altogether different when you\u0027re wrong because you know you did something stupid.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen KSP on Steam. I even watched the one video that was up there for it. You know the one... the guy takes his helmet off on the Mun. I saw it, I considered it, and I discarded it out of hand. I\u0027d been burned by shallow, boring indie games before on Steam, you see. Not that that is any kind of acceptable excuse. And so I carried along, sans rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen yesterday I run afoul of a certain JREF thread. Specifically, this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://Its\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJREF\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe name recognition got me, I clicked the link to see what about this game had managed to entrall enough JREF posters to merit a multipage thread. And I saw those pictures. I read the enthusiasm people have for this game. And I reconsidered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went home that day, downloaded the demo for KSP, and took it for a spin. Specifically, a flat spin from about four kilometers up that ended in a fireball, a handful of crushed field mice, and a topsoil depth crater sufficient enough to give all the world\u0027s landscapers nightmares. I was enthused; the Kerban was dead. What I had initially took for a goofy, non-complexity based game completely devoid of realism or challenge actually concealed large measures of both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then the grief strikes. If I\u0027d only been around a few months earlier, I could\u0027ve been there, at the launch pad, with the rest of you, as this strange machine was fueling up. Instead, I have to cling meekly from the outside. Peering in through a tiny window. Wondering if you guys have coffee in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bet it\u0027s great coffee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s it. That\u0027s my failure. I relapsed to the whole judging/book/cover combo fallacy, and my lapse is now revealed to all. I am sorry. I will make amends by buying this game. I will enjoy it. I know I will; I got three hours of sleep last night because I spent my usual scheduled coma time towards building a reliable heavy lift booster system. And now I post here, full of grief and coffee. I look on it as a learning mechanism; Even the finest of brews can come from the strangest looking grounds. You do a disservice only to yourself by opting out and not at least trying it out with a bit of half and half and sugar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Whackjob\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s never too late, some coffee strains are an acquired taste, but you got there in the end \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
