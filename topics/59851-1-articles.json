So that you\u0027d just add the mass of your payload to the cargo bay part, and you\u0027d only unpack the cargo once you open the doors or jettison the fairings or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose the \u0027container\u0027 part could also assume some of the behavior of its contents - so you could for example add some batteries and small tanks to a service module part, which would update its mass and resource storage accordingly without actually adding the new parts (so like modular fuels, except even more modular).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be interested in any experienced modder\u0027s input on the feasibility of something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
