Then you use a smaller-mass shuttle to take astronauts from the surface of Kerbin or Duna and meet with the big, bulky cycler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the benefits of the cycler are lost in KSP as we don\u0027t have to worry about life support systems and whatnot. So if you can build a vehicle capable of taking astronauts from Kerbin all the way down to Duna (and back) then you don\u0027t need a separate cycler. This is entirely possible in KSP and people do it all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is that I\u0027m not sure you can really do a true cycler in KSP; I don\u0027t know if the physics engine will allow you to do a cycle without lots of extra burns to correct physics-engine errors between SoI\u0027s and such. So you would probably end up spending a lot of fuel to keep the cycler going, so much so as to negate the benefit of a cycler which is supposed to go back and forth with limited deltaV expenditure. Also, you would still have to have a ship at Duna to go up and reach the cycler and bring astronauts down to the surface or transfer them from the surface up to the cycler. This shuttle will have to refueled and unless you are using the Kethane mod, this will result in multiple launches simply to refuel the shuttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, trying to make the cycler work isn\u0027t really practical given that you can accomplish the goal of sending Kerbals to and from Duna much simpler without it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FellipeC","CreatedById":77983,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T18:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at this post: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51227-The-possiblility-of-a-Mars-Cycler-in-KSP?highlight=cycler\u002Borbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51227-The-possiblility-of-a-Mars-Cycler-in-KSP?highlight=cycler\u002Borbit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T19:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy apologies, I just learned about the existence of such an orbit and in my excitement I came and posted without using the search.
