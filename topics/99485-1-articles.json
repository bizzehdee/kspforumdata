The only problem is that I can\u0027t hold steady flight with a VTOL, when they usually only use intake air. So i\u0027d like a engine that you can put on the bottom of your ship, that will keep you at a constant height. It would also help if you could somehow link the engines to SAS, because RCS is too wimpy. This could help in space when going out of control, because engines are more powerful than Monopropellant. Please look into making a mod like this, or if you know of one like it, provide a link to their thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Icklewiwi:cool:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T17:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91706-0-90-Freight-Transport-Technologies-v0-3-1-2014-12-24\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E FTT\u003C/a\u003E.
