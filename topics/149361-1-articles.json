Many rumors and opinions have been tossed around, but not many know the facts. In this thread, I will attempt to separate fact from fiction (oh gosh that\u0027s gonna be hard) and hopefully people will comment on what they see the facts as. This is in approximately chronological order. I am defining facts as something I have seen happen myself, or saw pretty darn conclusive evidence for. I call things \u0027authoritative rumors\u0027 if I saw a lot of people agreeing, but no solid evidence either way, or evidence on both sides. It\u0027s a rumor if some agree, and some don\u0027t, but neither side has conclusive evidence.\u00A0I think it\u0027s high time we got to the bottom of this in a civilized manner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: 8 developers of KSP posted an announcement on Reddit on Tuesday, October 4th, 2016, announcing that each of them was leaving the dev team.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: Their names were: Mu, Taniwha, NathanKell, Sarbian, Romfarer, Arsonide, Porkjet, and Claw.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: They spoke highly of the development team they were with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: They did not explicitly state a reason for departure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: They did not mention working conditions as a reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: Some of the Devs who left had been working on KSP for a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: Some of the Devs who left were relatively new hires.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);\u0022\u003E\nFact: 1.3 is confirmed, there are already Devs working on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);\u0022\u003E\nFact: Squad has been looking for new Devs since June, new people are coming in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);\u0022\u003E\nFact: RoverDude (or any other team member) was not forced to make any comment about this topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);\u0022\u003E\nAuthoritative Rumor: It has recently been posited that the team actually grew in comparison to the beginning of the year, even after these departures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHighly Authoritative Rumor: It was stated by a few staff members\u00A0that each had left at different times, they just announced it all at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRumor: It is alleged that these developers left because of poor working conditions, low pay, and long hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRumor: It has been theorized that the developers were merely contractors, and left because their contracts expired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisputed Fact: Very few of these developers, if any, work or live anywhere near SQUAD headquarters in Mexico City, Mexico.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAuthoritative Rumor: Many people claim that SQUAD has often required 12\u002B hour workdays from the devs. No proof was offered, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: The post was on Reddit, not the KSP forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRumor: It has been rumored that SQUAD has been actively deleting comments on this topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: Several\u00A0moderators have said they would resign if asked to delete posts for reasons other than rule violations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRumor: It has also been said that the reason the original post was on Reddit was due to the fact that the forums are under SQUAD control, and Reddit is not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: The KSP forums are controlled by SQUAD.

The departure of the Devs remains viral, regardless of whether or not SQUAD intended to draw attention away from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: Later, SQUAD posted on the forums, confirming the departure of the Devs, thanking them for their hard work and wishing them luck in their new endeavors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: An anonymous person posted on Reddit, confirmed that the 8 developers left because of unreasonable demands, unbelievable working conditions, and terrible upper management.
