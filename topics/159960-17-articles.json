I have to admit, I was rooting for Ethan and Evelina. I know it doesn\u0027t necessarily make a lot of sense... but they had something special, I mean, few other couples (probably none) can say they had a whirlwind romance that started with watching 12 rockets launch in 12 hours, included seeing the galaxy from\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eoutside\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eof it and having a prom there...

Like I said, I\u0027ve reread this story a lot... and I\u0027ll probably be doing one more reread now that it\u0027s over, at least. Over the years, it became kind of a comfort story for me - even as the story becomes less fun escapism and more a serious story about existential threats and ends with an Outer Wilds-esque message, it\u0027s still a great story, well written too, with good characters, and just a fun time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose my one request would that it\u0027d be nice if you could post this somewhere where it\u0027d be a little easier to read, like fanfiction net or similar (or give us a PDF), since right now there\u0027s a lot of scrolling to deal with, and the forum doesn\u0027t remember your place in long text posts.

I turned 21 a few days ago! It has been quite an emotional journey. Although it might not be completely over... The idea of doing a second draft has always bounced around in my head and I did test rewrites of chapters 1 and 2 a few months ago that turned out pretty good. Unsure if I\u0027ll ever get around to this, if I do, it will be a while. Also have ideas for Galactus related spinoffs. Don\u0027t be surprised if I post short spinoffs in this thread every now and then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: Second paragraph in the spoiler. This is something that I went back and forth on a lot... Should they stay together? The decision largely came down to my growing up and my personal experiences with that kind of stuff, and the fact that I did not believe I could write a satisfying romantic conclusion... It is very validating that you enjoyed the romance parts, I did not think they were very good at the time. If it makes you feel any better, my headcanon is that they tried for a while and ended up friends for life (musical collabs in the epilogues). One version of the ending that didn\u0027t make it into the final story was that they both reached the Pluto monolith together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: Third paragraph.\u00A0 PDF/reposting to another site is on the list.

However that will likely wait for the hypothetical second draft, which I don\u0027t plan to include pictures in if it ever happens, so it should translate much better to novel form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224262676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159960\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221679317323\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207378\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022iamn00b\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/20/2023 at 8:02 AM, iamn00b said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nngl my guy I think you could try writing something for r/HFY, good job with this story!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually have written a couple things.

The worldbuilding and the technology and stuff is something I\u0027m very proud of.\u00A0 In the beginning it was just all technobabble but I eventually wrangled it into stuff that makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of which, the whole quantum spectrum stuff. A semi-canon explanation follows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuantized spectrum would be a more accurate name, but Quantum spectrum sounds cooler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main idea is that, well, the spectrum we are all familiar with, the electromagnetic spectrum, on which photons traveling at the speed of light are the carrier particle, is not the only one. By varying some variable that is admittedly still mumbo-jumbo, additional spectrums can be found on which other particles are the carrier particles. These particles may follow different rules, they may interact with normal and exotic matter differently and may travel at different speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022variable\u0022 though, is discrete and not continuous, hence the quantization of the spectrums. Every so often in this variable, another usable spectrum appears, and this pattern repeats. Starting at the electromagnetic, or zeroth quantum spectrum, if you go 1, you get the quantum spectrum, 2 for the second quantum spectrum, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever the quantization also happens in multiples of pi. So there\u0027s a 3.14 spectrum, 6.28 spectrum, and so on... The galaxy as a whole headcanonically uses tau instead of pi (2pi=tau) in everyday use, so the 6.28 spectrum would translate as the tauquantum spectrum, which is the spectrum that the tauquantum gate technology relies on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there are actually multiple \u0022variables\u0022. The second one that was discovered was just called variable 2, and a prefix was applied to any spectrum discovered - the first Diquantum spectrum, second diquantum spectrum, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs more and more variables were discovered, you get stuff like triquantum, quadquantum, pentaquantum, etc. It would make more sense to think of the spectrums as an n dimensional plot where the electromagnetic spectrum lies at (0,0,0,0,0...). There\u0027s nothing special about the electromagnetic spectrum other than that it happens to be the one that interacts with the matter that tends to form life the most, so it is the most rapidly understood by a large margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never really mentioned variations in multiple dimensions at the same time (There could theoretically be a 1-Quadquantum 4-Triquantum 17-Diquantum Tauquantum spectrum or some other wizardry) so headcanonically variation in more than one dimension at a time tends to make the resulting spectrum difficult to study and not very useful. It would also lead to half of the words in Voyage being complete mumbo jumbo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224264722\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159960\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221679627800\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022215483\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SSTO Crasher\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/23/2023 at 10:16 PM, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E Crasher said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVoyage: The final warning\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nby the New York Times bestselling author Ultimate Steve\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow that\u2019s got a ring to it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed it does!

This is without a doubt the single greatest creative work I have ever finished (despite my rocky writing skills at the beginning), and a strong contender for my greatest creative work of all time...\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eso far.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EThe only other contenders are all unfinished (2 musical pieces, 1 Minecraft build, 1 other story, and 1 physical piece are the competitors that come to mind). Without each and every one of your encouraging words and each of those like pings (\u0022YourName has liked a post in: Voyage - The Final Warning (Chapter XX)), it would have taken a lot longer, if it was ever finished at all. Every notification put a smile on my face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCome to think of it, parts of the subpar initial writing can be explained away as Ethan being the author, growing up and maturing. In that way it is incredibly authentic, as the affect of having Ethan mature in the face of existential threats was accomplished by my maturation in the face of slightly-less existential threats!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe writing of this story has coincidentally (or maybe not?) spanned almost exactly from start to finish a time in my life that I have come to call \u0022Chapter 1,\u0022 my first character arc, from disaster to recovery. Loosely from summer 2017 to spring 2023. Not a complete resolution, the war is far from over, but the long battle has been won. A lot of my writing in this story parallels that. Chapter 2 has proven to be a tough cookie so far. Who knows what it will hold, but it will doubtlessly be quite the story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m open to answering any questions you may have about the story, but be warned, there\u0027s a high chance the answer will be \u0022Because I was 16 and didn\u0027t know what I was talking about!\u0022\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you all for reading, and may the Infinities smile upon you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI totally forget to respond to this, and I\u0027m just gonna pretend it hasn\u0027t been a month!

If you don\u0027t mind, I think I might headcanon they reached the Pluto monolith together - while this version is plenty sweet, there\u0027s something about that ending that just makes me happy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have a very good point about the changes in writing being able to be explained as Ethan being the author, which is technically an explanation that works for my own Magnus Opus of a work that I\u0027ve never finished yet written over 600k words in. In fact, I published another chapter of it today, partially because I figured that if you finished Voyage, I could finish my work. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E:)\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EAs for your life, I feel that - good luck with Chapter 2!\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224269905\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159960\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221680877016\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ultimate Steve\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/7/2023 at 7:16 AM, Ultimate Steve said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two most prominent ideas both involve airships actually.
