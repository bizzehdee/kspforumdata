I\u0027m only using the Smart A.S.S and the readout panels for orbit info, surface and Delta V. Whilst getting my satellite to the Mun, I accidentally left it on Retrograde and while warping it drained my batteries. I felt kinda cheated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve been having a look at what mods or solutions I could use to prevent this happening. Ultimately the problem is that the battery charge amount is hidden under the resources and without that visible it\u0027s easy to drain power completely in a short period of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne solution that I thought was very clever was to always add one additional battery somewhere and disable it. So if you do run out of power, you can enable it as a backup reserve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose I\u0027d like something that could drop me out of warp if my battery goes below a certain percentage. Does anyone know of mod that could do this or have any better suggestions?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cubfan","CreatedById":174195,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-16T03:12:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure about mods, but I think an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.
