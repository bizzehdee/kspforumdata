If you haven\u0027t noticed, the part viewer window in the part palet shows a scale of 1 meter. Sonce the parts are drawn isometrically, no perspective, then from looking at any size 1 part it is evident that the part sizes are 1 and 2 meter, not 1.25 and 2.5 meter as previously thought, and CERTAINLY not 1 and 3 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m not mistaken, the conception that parts are based on 1.25 meters comes from when people had to size their parts to 1.25 units.
