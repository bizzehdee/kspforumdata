Is there a way to get your aircraft to automatically follow a pre-planned ascent route, like an autopilot?\n\nThe \u0022Ascent path editor\u0022 is for rocket ascent trajectories. You *might* be able to hack it to work, but MechJeb isn\u0027t great at airplanes anyway, so you\u0027d probably get poor results.\n\nOn my triple circumnavigation I used Pilot Assistant, which lets you tune the controller to match your aircraft, and with tweaking of the various output clamps you can get it to, for instance, ascend to 12000m at a climb rate of 0.1m/s, if that\u0027s the profile you want."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T22:58:26Z","Content":"I used NO MECHJEB all done BY HAND.\n\nAlso minor corrction... it is Bob not bill.\n\nDuring the flight he was screaming all the way...\n\nI for- \\*ahem\\* pestered bob to enter my craft.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-26T13:14:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2015 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Joshwoo69**"},{"CreatedByName":"MunGazer","CreatedById":141954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T00:42:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I used NO MECHJEB all done BY HAND.\n\u003E Also minor corrction... it is Bob not bill.\n\u003E \n\u003E During the flight he was screaming all the way...\n\u003E \n\u003E I for- \\*ahem\\* pestered bob to benter my craft.\n\nOh no, sorry, it may have sounded like I was implying you used an autopilot, that wasn\u0027t my intent. It really is just a genuine question - I like flight testing like the pros, you know, analyzing the data and what not. I wish I could perform 3 different precisely controlled, pre-planned ascents in an aircraft and then be able to go and graph information about those 5 minute ascents. It would just be for testing purposes. I\u0027d like to essentially develop flight manuals for my aircraft.\n\nEdit: I\u0027ll be more specific, I was speaking quite vaguely there. I\u0027d like to be able to completely automate the throttle and control surfaces for a preprogrammed takeoff sequence and ascent, and then have data on altitude and ground distance covered every, say, 15 seconds for 5 minutes. Can this be done with mech Jeb and other existing mods?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T00:50:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T01:48:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E wahhhh..

This is pretty much exactly what I needed for my expedition entry. Full post is on the previous page, but essentially I used Pilot Assistant for semiautomated piloting; to nail down my ascent trajectory I entered my desired parameters into Pilot Assistant, and then manually changed the target ascent rate at various altitude landmarks, then tried variations to optimize fuel use. \n\nFor data logging, kOS (again, the script I used available on my last entry post).

At high speeds be careful in a turn as you can rip it to pieces. With bombs it is best to have fuel tanks half empty (and pump fuel into forward tanks) before dropping them or else the center of gravity shifts too far for stable flight. It can circumnavigate kerbin once with 15 tons of ordnance instead of fuel tanks in the bomb bay.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T21:38:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RuBisCO**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T23:34:29Z","Content":"Just because it looked very neutrally stable, like a dart."},{"CreatedByName":"ExaltedDuck","CreatedById":145930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T00:04:59Z","Content":"Good flying, Rubisco.
