Has anyone ever watched the classic, \u0022Citizen Kane\u0022, supposedly one of the greatest movies ever... no you haven\u0027t! For the original celluloid tape of Citizen Kane has long since fallen to pieces and oblivion. The original Citizen Kane does not exist, what you have watched is a copy, of a copy, of a copy, usually \u0027digitally enhance\u0027 and reformatted even, this is true of just about every movie you have seen... I don\u0027t hear anyone complaining.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T00:56:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for making perfect replicates: there is perfect and than there is \u0027good enough\u0027. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think DNA does?
