I aimed the plane at the SPH and had Valentina jump out; she vaporized upon hitting the ground. But, something caused the plane to veer slightly upward, and SAS was on, so the plane kept flying, narrowly dodging a few hills. It crossed the entire KSC continent with no form of control! No probe cores, no kerbals, nothing! And halfway across the next ocean, the plane ran out of liquid fuel, and, get this, successfully landed on the water with no damage and NO CONTROL! This plane flew for 25 minutes without control and didn\u0026#39;t crash! How crazy is that?! Anyways, I can\u0026#39;t post screenshots of the event because I am now typing this on my phone, but for those of you who don\u0026#39;t believe my story, I will post screenshots as soon as I can get back on my computer.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T09:02:53Z","Content":"\nIt happens in real life too :) Behold:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornfield_Bomber[/url]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T14:19:01Z","Content":"\nI had planes fly on their own, but never this long and especially not landing without breaking apart.
