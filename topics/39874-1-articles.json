You can use existing or planned craft or make up your own. You must get at least 1 person on every Gallilean moon with enough time to gather enough samples and do enough scientific exploration to make the trip a valuable one. Your goals beyond that are optional. More detail = more points, and more points = more self-satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Scientific Moustache","CreatedById":63546,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T14:36:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell you could re-purpose habitation modules from the international space station to cut down on to orbit mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pugspaceprogram","CreatedById":57139,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T19:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a file of a realistic mission to Jupiter I made on orbiter 2010.

The only Galilean moon safe enough to do a landing and EVA on would be Callisto. All other missions would have to be robotic, and even then radiation would mess with the computers. Unless you could invent some sort of magnetic field generator like the one seen in the BBC documentary \u0022Voyage to the Planets\u0022, no people on Io, Europa, or Ganymede.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fox62","CreatedById":23673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T20:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPhase 1: Assemble VASMIR engine powered tranporter in LEO.
