From the first screen in KSP, open the \u0027Settings\u0027 menu, then the \u0027input\u0027 section. Click the button that says \u0027Staging UI\u0027 and the right side of the menu (under \u0027Axis Bindings\u0027) should now have some options. Click on the long grey bar labelled \u0027Pitch Axis\u0027, and then (very carefully) move your joystick forward or back. Now it should be bound to that axis. Do the same for other axis, including setting the little paddle to control the throttle (You\u0027re going to love how precise your throttle control is with that, by the way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have to come back to invert an axis or adjust the sensitivity or dead band (I find my self lowering the sensitivity and raising the dead zone a little). As for other buttons, you can set them however you wish, using the same method (click a grey bar, then mash the joystick button you want to assign to it). I find value in setting joystick buttons 3 \u0026amp; 4 to RCS and SAS toggle, respectively, and the trigger for temporarily toggling SAS on/off. Some handy functions for buttons down on the base are map-view, stage, abort, brakes, or whatever you find yourself using most frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T03:08:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey I got one too.

IIRC, the throttle setting of your joystick will be detected once any change to throttle has been input, in any way, during your current flight, but not before - which means, if you had your throttle-control on the stick to max at the end of your last flight and havent touched it since having switched to your current flight, hitting ctrl or shift will actually put you to full throttle, instantly. It can be a very unpleasant surprise, the more unpleasant, the longer it takes you to figure out what\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s going on.
