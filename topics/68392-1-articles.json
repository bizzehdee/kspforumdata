They show the maximum lifted mass and altitude, wherein half the mass is payload (that is, not used as fuel during the flight). The first includes the RAPIER (air mode) and the second excludes it in order to \u0022zoom in\u0022 on the remaining results, but the average is retained. No altitude results are shown for SRBs as their fuel units are at a fixed maximum. However, the maximum mass the SRBs can lift is shown. There are two aero spike results; the best result for it is with parts possessing its same diameter rather than wider fuel tanks. Mass is in metric tons, altitude is in kilometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7330/13669832575_67422cabc4_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213669832575_67422cabc4_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7329/13669831075_e7d9857361_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213669831075_e7d9857361_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-06T18:02:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2014 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Epart clarifications\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
