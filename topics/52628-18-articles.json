I absolutely love what this community has done to this game. I really don\u0027t know what took me so long to try it out. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if I have well over a thousand, if not two thousand hours into this game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to pick up realism overhaul pretty quickly, I learned most of what I needed to know to adjust to RSS scale from a very long game KSP with the 6.4x Kerbin system I have played before this. I am really enjoying the difficult. I play wil most major difficulty mods. I chose to skip Remote Tech for now, and unfortunately I had to uninstall engine ignitor because it cause massive FPS drops. I also decided the skip using EVE so I could install more parts instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just recently finished the tech tree in career mode, and I have decided that I am going to design a fleet of boosters of varying sizes to save as sub-assemblies. I usually just make a new booster for every payload in regular KSP. Usually I can make a booster in 2 or 3 minutes stock.... Realism overhaul on the other hand it taking much longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal is to design a family of fairly realistic boosters that can launch a wide variety of payloads into orbit. I plan is to only use American engines. For a long time I have wondered what NASA could have done if it had stuck with Saturn style designs instead of investing in the Space Shuttle. I am still thinking of ideas for the actual missions I will use these rockets for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the first design that I have pretty much finalized:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/mORru\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The first stage is a solid rocket booster. it burns for 160s for 4,305 m/s of dV. The second stage is powered by a RL-10B-2 engine. With 5,460 dV I usually am able to reach a 300 or 400 km orbit with about 100-300 m/s of dV remaining. The second stage has a probe core hidden in it, so it can use its remaining fuel to de-orbit. This rocket launches a MMH/NTO powered satellite that weighs about 1.6t. It is a small simple rocket, but I have been very happy with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current project is a SDHI based system to launch Kerbals into orbit. This design still has a few kinks that I am working out. The booster is a 2.5 stage design. The main stage is powered by a single RS-25D/e with 2 RL-10B-2 engines that act as vernier thrusters to give the main stage roll control. In its current configuration, it has 4 Aerojet AJ-73F SRBs that burn for 90 seconds. The main stage burns out 6 minutes and 10 seconds after launch. It\u0027s second stage is powered by 4 RL-10s, for only 2 minutes 43 seconds. Once I get better at getting into orbit in RSS, I will probably reduce the number of RL-10\u0027s it uses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/kMroM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
