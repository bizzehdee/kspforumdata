I\u0027m not saying this is inherently a bad thing. Again, I am simply asking Squad how it will impact KSP going forward. If the dev team has grown and it will be business as usual going forward, I\u0027m totally fine with that. It is what I am hoping for it, in fact. However, if it means updates are going to slow down significantly and/or stop, I\u0027d like to know that too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-06T00:20:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2016 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bandus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-06T00:15:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne product cycle is ending, and it will take a few weeks (at least) for Squad management to sort out Who can do What, and begin the next product cycle.
