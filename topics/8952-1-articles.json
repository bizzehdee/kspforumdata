So what do people think is a good mix?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m thinking Cart and MechJeb for certain, and my tweaked version of the solar panel mod, maybe C7. The bit I get stuck on is the main rocket kit, I find Skilisko Edition 2 seemed wobbly when I used it, but when I last used NovaPunch I found there was a big mix of parts that didn\\\u0027t look great together, and there were simply to many.
