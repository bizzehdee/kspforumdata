Then one day I was thumbing through the channels when I saw this epic sci fi show and was shocked to find out that this was the same Enterprise I had lost interest on a few years ago.

Incidentally, Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart) reminded me a lot of my english teacher (bold and all that - what i didnt know back then, the original voice of Stewart is not too remote from what my teacher\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s was as well) and i went from D to A within half a year (test results: D,C,B,A - the obvious tendency got me a B for the semester). Captain, my Captain... ;D So, yeah, i loved TNG and would like to watch it again, though, i suppose it has aged quite a bit, by now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETOS is something that had already aged quite a lot by the time TNG aired. So i never took it seriously, really. Always thought of Kirk as some sort of gun slinging revolver hero from the wild west transplanted into future space (and i still think this must have been the basic idea behind the show - or what the producers made of it, anyways).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDS9 annoyed me by its religious content to the point of quiting before it got cool (or so i heard). It was probably the most soap-operary as you had to follow the show to get what was going on. In that sense, it wasnt hard to get away from it: Miss half a season and you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll be lost (pun intended).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVoyager was too much \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4whatever the challange, whatever the risk, we take it, and we will succeed\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4. Need a warpcoil? No problem, lure some bork (borg?) in and steal it from them. Easy... Janeway had a muntinious crew under her, and yet, whatever suicidal plan she came up with, everyone just clacked their heels. Heck, it even had the annoying alien, otherwise trademark of the Star Wars franchise - or at least that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s what Neelix was for me. And Chekoteh considers himself to be of native american origin? Okay, ST is about visions and stuff. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s a society without money (or payment for crewmen at least). I can take that. But i find it very hard to believe, that someone in the 23rd (?) century will make a big thing out of his remote \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4indian\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 ancestry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EENT is the one going back, where it all belonged, to me. Taking the pioneering time into focus was an excellent choice over going further forward in a timeline, that VOY had basically spoiled beyond recovery and in which everything had become possible. The first two season were en par with TNG\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s episodes\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 average quality, but the series really took off in season 3 and 4 (esp. the former), telling a season-spaning story of mystery and unknown, featuring multiple conflicts, in- and outside the crew. Season 3 is the stuff, which will make you dig up your old copy of \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Starflight\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 or \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Star Control II\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, again, or send you frantically looking for anything more modern like that, for hours. \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4The ancients\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, the \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Ur-Quan masters\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 and \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4the sphere builders\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 are from the some league of awesome space-opera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe movies: IV is the worst, VIII is the best. Havent seen XII, yet. About XI (\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Star Trek\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4): I liked the action, the pacing, the visuals (the bridge looked just as outlandishly shiny and clean as in the dream i once had about \u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ADt). I didnt like the story. You know, how you can sort of link contemporary people on earth to star trak\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s races, right? So, in \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Star Trek\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 (XI), they made the vulcans the jews, and being german, i now always feel sort of guilty seeing vulcans. I dont like that at all. Aside of that, the vulcans have always been a defining thing of Star Trek, the ones that helped mankind along its first steps into deep space, and now they are sort of gone. I mean, that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s like uhem... well... uh... just Star Trek without vulcans (or a coca-cola logo that has neither white nor red in it). They were the one race, where almost all nerds would agree \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4they are better than humans - not inherently but because they deserve it, in contrast to humans\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4. And they simply blew them away, made them failed victims, sort of. Bad ego? Cant they be something unhuman to look up to?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T21:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQ is a huge asshole, but a very interesting character.
