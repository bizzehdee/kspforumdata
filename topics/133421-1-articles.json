Low cost requires high demand. High demand relies on\u00A0low cost, but also on an actual business model, that nobody has invented yet. Ultimately, investing billions in a system that only makes sense with launch rates that are 100 times higher than they are today simply doesn\u0027t work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the whole concept revolves around all of those unproven technologies meeting all the planned cost and performance requirements\u00A0as they do on paper. When was the last time any large engineering\u00A0project achieved that?\u00A0The reentry system that vaporizes hydrogen on the leading edges has never been experimented. The fuselage built around the self carrying composite tankage needs a whole need industrial infrastructure,\u00A0and again, we have no experience with any of those\u00A0materials on an actual\u00A0aircraft, let alone in space and reentry conditions.\u00A0The engines work\u00A0on paper, but we don\u0027t know anything about their\u00A0maintenance, reliability, or durability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a single one of those technologies underperforms in any way, then Skylon is not going to orbit and you have wasted billions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about the demand for autos?
