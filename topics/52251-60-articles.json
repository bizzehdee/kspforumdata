That was funny that you went back to Tylo and landed once again - I think nobody did that before! And good job with the scanner probes and the remaining orbital bases too. Maybe the only downside of the mission was the need for many refueling trips, wasn\u0027t?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was a thorough Kethane Expedition, well done! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks. It was a few too many refueling trips - in spite of the somewhat clever multi-role aspects of most of the ship, it was still a pretty brute force approach, with the lander around 100 tons fully fueled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\u0027ve had a chance to reflect, I\u0027ve made a few observations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. MechJeb laid in some pretty bad courses - I was generally much happier with my manual course plots, which arrived at the target with lower differential velocity and reduced expenditure of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. TAC fuel balancer helped a lot. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not perfect, but it helped make sure that no rocket engine ran out fuel prematurely, which was especially helpful on Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The trip back home still took over 2 years. I need to investigate ways to reduce that time frame - landed back at Kerbin with several thousand m/s delta V in reserve, so we had fuel that could have been burned to speed the return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. All the mining and refueling got a bit tiresome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I need to be much smarter in how I spend my fuel. It may be worthwhile to have a small nuclear tug to move Pooh Bear to a different moon instead of moving the whole ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. I should really look at putting a ship or a fuel depot in orbit between moons, such as between Vall and Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. It worked well to turn off MechJeb at times for landings, especially on Pol and Bop. I learned my lesson from the previous Jool challenge trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Pooh Bear probably could have been a bit smaller. Moving around a 100 ton lander used a lot of fuel, even with LV-Ns. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s probably a good 60 ton version that can be made with 4 or 6 LV-Ns and 2 LVT-30s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. I was generally pleased with the lifter design, which was fairly compact and efficient (16.9% payload mass fraction) for the size of ship being sent up. Lots of SRBs were used, since they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re very cost effective in 0.24 career mode. No thrust plates were used. Burning some of the Milne\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s engines towards the end of the ascent seemed to work well, especially since they could be refueled from the last lifter stack after a stable orbit was achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. I still had a little bit of Kessler syndrome - I forgot to add a probe core to Rabbit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s last lifter stack, so it remained in orbit around Kerbin as debris, even though it had enough fuel left to de-orbit itself. No other debris was generated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. I was proud of the footprint left in the Jool system by this single ship - five manned fuel depots, each with some science and comm gear; four kethane scanners, also with science and comm gear; and one satellite around Jool with multiple science experiments and comm gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12. It works much better if you wait for sunlight before trying to visit anomalies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13. The 8 landing struts, a late addition to Pooh Bear, provided some needed stability. The ship probably would have fallen over on Laythe and/or Pol if they weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t there. Majority of the weight was still resting on the LV-N engine bells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E All in all, an enjoyable and challenging experience. I hope people enjoy the photos and whatnot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CakeNinjaProductions","CreatedById":92225,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T19:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell.
