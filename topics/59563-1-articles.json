(I\u0027m trying to act like real life space programs) And they would just flip on their sides when they touchdown and their Parachutes cut. So can you guys get me a good .craft or a tutorial on how to land a rover on the surfaces and not have them flip over on touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure why you\u0027d need a picture so..tell me if you do for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i\u0027m thinking this is happening due to the center of mass the parachute creates, But still my question as asked is for a .craft or a tutorial.
