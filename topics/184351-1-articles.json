Well, picture this scenario:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are voting in a poll booth, and suddenly goons come out of nowhere and threaten you to vote for a particular party. Or worse, they snatch your ballot papers and mark their preferred candidates and stuff the ballot box with the bogus votes. This practice was commonplace in my country when EVMs were not a thing. In those areas, ideally, re-voting would take place... But then again, would you stand up to a guy who has tons of goons and influence at his disposal and got them to beat up the police stationed at the voting booth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you try to button smash EVMs though, it will stop registering any input.
