Send a spacecraft to the Mun, into a low equatorial orbit. Once there, try to go from the Mun to Minmus. This is mechanically identical to going from Kerbin to another planet, but it only takes a couple of days instead of a year. Transfer windows are much more frequent, and the stakes are lower, too. You can also do the opposite, and try to go from Minmus to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou just have to make sure you bring enough fuel.
