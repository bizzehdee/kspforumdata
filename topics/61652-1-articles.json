A US court has ruled against the protection of net neutrality and it is being considered in the EU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt means that ISPs will be able to prioritise traffic from certain sites over others based on how much they pay. Large corporations will be able to deliver their content faster while smaller sites will be forced to pay or be slowed down. It will also allow ISPs to restrict your access to certain sites unless you pay extra for \u0022packages\u0022 that include those sites. It will be more like cable TV and not like a freely open Internet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESites that stand up against major corps and govt could be marginalised or even blocked. It will mark the beginning of a regulated Internet and a limit on the freedom of speech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUS courts have already ruled against net neutrality but the FCC can still impose some rules to ensure a neutral net. The matter is still open in the EU so we have a chance to make our voice heard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to spread the word via a post on imgur which is going pretty well so far.
