Recently I crafted my first successful space-plane, the \u0022Hopeful - 2\u0022. Let me get straight to the point: When taking off and becoming airborne, I\u0027ve noticed the plane\u0027s tendency to continually drift upwards, almost becoming vertical. Sometimes it locked up and fell back down, and other times it flipped. The only way I can stay horizontal is to frequently kill or throttle down the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I\u0027ve added parachutes to the tope of the plane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The four engines are connected to the plane via decouplers. The largest engine is attached directly to the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas of what is going wrong and what I should change?

The huge tails on top aren\u0027t helping, either. Try putting one basic steerable winglet vertically in the back as a tail, and maybe two horizontal ones at the tail as elevators. That should help somewhat. It may actually be better to have the side winglets angled downward on the underside of the plane to counter the engines somewhat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T17:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour engines are thrusting below the center of mass, which will impart a bit of rotational force, bringing the nose up. That\u0027s actually a good thing, if it\u0027s not overly strong. You could shift some or all of those engines higher and closer to the center line, but again, you wouldn\u0027t want to lose the effect entirely. Or you could add a couple of fins with control surfaces up at the nose, where you could call upon them to help counter the torque (though HarvesteR, who should know because he makes the game, strongly advises against using canards at the front of a vehicle for stability reasons). You could shift the whole wing structure, engines still attached, further back, which would leave the nose heavier, but that might create problems while descending and landing. In short, balancing a plane is EXTREMELY finicky and tricky, so play around with it until it works. Just keep in mind that whatever configuration gets you up there also has to work on the way down, so test it both on powered ascent and unpowered descent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Extraneous","CreatedById":16940,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-05T17:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t wait until 0.17 and us getting a centre of mass indicator when making spaceplanes - will make designing them so much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it in this way - look at your plane from the side and draw a line from the centre of your main wing perpendicular to the wing\u0027s surface. If the majority of your spaceplane\u0027s weight is behind this line, it will pitch nose-up under thrust. If the majority of your plane\u0027s weight is in front of it, it will pitch nose-down.
