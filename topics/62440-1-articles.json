For example, a science log of \u0022At 80km up, Kerbin looks very round\u0022 would have the \u002280km\u0022 value always be that. With this idea, you could replace \u002280km\u0022 with \u0022\u0026amp;alt\u0022 or something, and if you were orbiting at 90km, the log would say \u0022At 90km up, Kerbin looks very round\u0022.
