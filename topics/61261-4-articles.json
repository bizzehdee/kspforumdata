Pfhhhh, rotor-propulsion can hardly lift you above 20,000 meters if you\u0027re lucky) or a 2,000 m/s velocity (their velocity curves actually reduce thrust TO ZERO thrust at 500 m/s, and only 20% thrust by 425 m/s).

The only REAL difference between this and the HELO challenge then, since ion engines can barely lift themselves on the Mun, and not at all on Kerbin, is that you can utilize wings as large as you like...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI asked for an exception there for TTJ\u0027s, but I *highly* doubt Fengist will grant it. And if he does, and takes ONE LOOK at antimatter TTJ\u0027s, with their 300 kN thrust and virtually infinite fuel-capacity at first glance (in reality, any knowledgeable KSP-I player will tell you that the real fuel is the antimatter in the reactor- which burns at quite an appreciable rate), he\u0027ll go right back to banning them. Better off to stick with fission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy are you still playing in Sandbox, with the addition of Career Mode anyways? Career Mode really does serve to make things much more involving and challenging, and will only become more so with the addition of economy in the near future. And, if you\u0027re using KSP-Interstellar, you\u0027re better off with Career Mode anyways as the mod adapted so quickly to it that it\u0027s already became a primarily Career-based mod- with more features useful for it than for Sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood old Liquid Fuel is a solid choice. Or, if you want to stick with electrics, you\u0027re basically going to throw in the towel on several of the challenges- it\u0027s simply physically impossible to achieve the Harrier Distinction with electrics (they lose all thrust at 500 m/s), and unless you utilize some GIGANTIC wings relative to the rest of the craft, get to the island flying WEST around Kerbin, and utilize stock aerodynamics (forget about it with FAR) you\u0027re never going to achieve the DARPA-X award either... Oh and the Munar mission- impossible unless you design an all-ion extremely lightweight craft (think a command chair, an OKTO2, a single Xenon tank, a minimal # of structural parts, and at least 45 stock ion engines, with a 0.625 meter KSP-I reactor\u002Bgenerator), made solely for that challenge, you\u0027re never going to get that one either...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

In Career Mode, purchasing Antimatter Power provides access to upgraded fusion reactors- and I figured you were playing Career Mode like most KSP-I players seem to now...

The VTOL engines, when swapped for their rocket variety (and the plane equipped with a number of LiquidFuel drop tanks and the main tanks switched for LFO) should be capable of making orbit. The Kerbal-capacity challenges can probably all be met by carrying a couple lawnchairs strapped to the wings, or a couple passenger fuselages dragged below on a winch like cargo (the tricky part will be getting that off the ground in VTOL mode without flipping- although the total craft weighs about 18 tons fully-fueled- so that\u0027s less than 1/18th of vessel mass, and things could be further balanced with small \u0022ballast\u0022 drop-tanks...) The cargo challenges- those will be tough (imagine dragging 7.2 tons below a Harrier- the closest real-life craft to this design!), but doable with variants stripping down the base-weight (by reducing the # of engines and swapping the main fuselage for a structural version) to a possible minimum of less than 12 tons (4.8 tons- that can be done...) And the Munar mission- even that\u0027s doable with the rocket-type VTOL engines in basically the current configuration of the jet VTOL\u0027s (though I\u0027d probably strip off all the jet engines and, if allowed, intakes- to reduce the weight I\u0027d have to haul to the Mun on a rocket...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mission this design might NOT be capable of is, ironically, the one it\u0027s closest real-life relative gives its name to: the Harrier Distinction (though, FYI, acutal Harriers don\u0027t come ANYWHERE CLOSE to making speeds of 2000 m/s- they can\u0027t even cut much above a tenth that- their max speed is around 1,100 km/h). The velocity-curves reduce even the stock turbojet engines to half-thrust by 2000 m/s, and the best plane in the Maching Bird challenge could only make 2400 m/s, with MASSIVE intake spam.

I wasn\u0027t mincing my words when I said \u0022re-entry from low-orbit.\u0022 Technically, a Low Earth Orbit, for instance, is one that passes THROUGH the thermosphere or exosphere- the uppermost layers of Earth\u0027s atmosphere. What defines it as an orbit is that it has both a periapsis and an apoapsis- not that it\u0027s stable. That\u0027s one reason why the International Space Station actually requires regular small burns to keep it \u0022orbital\u0022- because it is experiencing very small amounts of drag from the tiny amounts of air around it, as it is actually orbiting within the Earth\u0027s upper atmosphere- with a circular orbit around 420km, it never even leaves the thermosphere, and thus isn\u0027t in a 100% stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESOURCES:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_decay\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-04T16:23:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2014 04:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Swifty","CreatedById":57822,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T16:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Harrier Distinction - Have your VTOL achieve a Kerbin atmospheric speed in excess of 2,000 m/s.

And, of course, its transmitter has to be faced within 90 degrees of the craft it is powering (I usually point it towards the north pole- as most of my craft flying a tiny bit north of the equator, due to the KSC being located at 5\u0027 north of the equator), which requires a tiny bit of setup each time I use it to correct for gravity rotating the craft before I can even use the thing at all. (it was poorly designed in that it only has one transmitter, on a plane with the solar panels instead of facing at a right angle towards the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, I should try and move it to a polar orbit with a tug, now that I have some experience using KAS winches to tow things (if only in-atmosphere), which is what it is best designed for (in a polar orbit it could face its transmitter towards a relay further out which could then it turn beam power, after the additional transmission losses, to the surface.

Its main advantage would be the ability to extend the operating range of a lightweight (2-3 rotors) solar-electric circumnavigation variant of one of my (yet un-designed) LiquidFuel designs towards dawn and dusk: where the solar panels on the ground won\u0027t be producing much, but the transmitter would be in full sunlight.
