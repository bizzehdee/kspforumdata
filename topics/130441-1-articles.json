If you can link me to an old post or just supply me with the answer both would be great!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow on to my question:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Does the science lab need the science stored in the lab once it begins its processing? That is can i take it out and land it and get the science while I wait for the processing and extra science.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) If you have two scientist that are different levels what does the game do? Or should I just have the higher one and train the other up more?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T18:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) No need to keep the reports in the lab. No need to ever put the reports in the lab - they just have to be on the \u0022ship\u0022 (including anything docked/klawed to it) to be added as data to the lab. Once the data has been added, you can take the reports home with you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Not quite sure but I think each scientist gives a certain percentage per day of conversion-of-data-into-points, depending on his/her level. That means you can mix and match as you please, but obviously higher levels are always advantageous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T21:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128417-mobile-science-lab/#comment-2332641\u0022\u003Eexplanation of how it works\u003C/a\u003E, which I wrote a little while ago for someone asking much the same question... hopefully you may find it useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
