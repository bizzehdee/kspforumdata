I\u0027ve tried this two ways but encountered a problem with each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I tried setting DepletedFuel as a propellant with a negative ratio. This gave me the production rate I wanted but also made the engine think it was only getting 2/3 of the propellants and so would only give 2/3 the thrust. I could kludge it and just increase the thrust values to compensate but that bothers my OCD and I thought there must be a better way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n@MODULE[ModuleEnginesFX]\n        {\n            PROPELLANT\n            {\n                name = DepletedFuel\n                ratio = -0.000033\n                DrawGauge = False\n            }\n        }\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then tried making an Alternator that would produce DepletedFuel but for some reason KSP doesn\u0027t seem to like making alternators with values below 0.01 units/s (and I would like a production rate around 0.00001 units/s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nMODULE\n    {\n        name = ModuleAlternator\n        RESOURCE\n        {\n            name = DepletedFuel\n            rate = 0.000033\n        }\n    }\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any other ways to generate resources depending on the throttle?
