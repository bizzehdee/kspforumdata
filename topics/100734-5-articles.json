Now I will say that the general populatation of these forums appears to be somewhat more mature in the way they deal with each other than the average online community I have come accross, but it cannot be denied that there is also a certain amount of negativity whenever a big change comes along or if a decision is made that some do not agree with. Many Devnotes, for example, have replies that are extremely negative towards Squad and other users. Or when a feature is implemented in a way we don\u0027t like (such as the change to new forum software), we have a tendency to speak very unkindly about it. But then there are also some good examples of people disagreeing with each other but being very polite about it. The *Positive Forum Movement* has been around for a while now, and it\u0027s good to see how some people are actively looking for ways to change, not the *opinions*, but the *attitudes* of others.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m sure most of us would like the forum to be even more positive, so what can we do about it? Telling negative people not to be negative is unlikely to help, but there is a way that just might. Here are a few simple things we can keep in mind, which - little by little - can make a difference.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - If someone attacks you (or someone else) for your opinion, spelling, design or anything else, don\u0027t tell them off. Instead, make it your goal to cheer them up. Try asking for suggestions on how to improve\n\u003E - If someone picks at you for something small and insignificant they don\u0027t like you doing, something that\u0027s not even against the rules; tell them you\u0027re thankful for the suggestion and you will try to think of it next time you post. Be careful not to sound patronizing or sarcastic; it must be sincere.\n\u003E - If you feel strongly about something, don\u0027t give others the feeling that you think your opinion is more important than theirs. Instead, calmly explain how you feel and why you feel that way - others will be more likely to take your opinion seriously that way\n\u003E - If you see someone \u0022put out a fire\u0022 by replying well to a provocative comment, **click the \u0022Like this\u0022 button for that post** and tell them in a private message why - it will encourage them to do it again\n\u003E - Most importantly, no matter how you are treated by someone else, treat them the way you believe they would like to be treated.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E None of this means we should just be quiet and accept things we don\u0027t like. It just means that there is a better way of getting our point accross than being negative or writing harsh words about it. Constructive criticism can actually come accross as very positive if we put some thought into it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To sum it up, be the person you would like others to be.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Will it work? No doubt about it. Even if a single person does this just one time, it will make a difference.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2/25/2015 at 2:24 PM, Deddly said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E None of this means we should just be quiet and accept things we don\u0027t like.

Within those that I keep in touch with, there are some form South America, Europe, and then, a little more specific, the United States and Canada. I enjoy the fellowship over what we have in common - the love of Kerbal Space Program. I also enjoy learning of the differences in cultures, ideas, and approaches to handling problems that come up in the game. For the most part, the experience on the forum has been positive.\n\nHowever, since the console users have joined the forum, there seems to be a lot of snipping between PC/MAC and console users of the game. Unfortunately, these actions soon spread like wildfire and has expanded beyond those two groups of KSP users. I\u0027ve even seen a few forum members try to bring their personal problems onto the forum, then get offended when others bash them for their negativity. My biggest problem is that I normally attempt to intercede in moments like that - mainly because It\u0027s not easy when forum users feel that they don\u0027t matter to the general forum population. \n\nI\u0027ve got a simple rule that I do... if you\u0027re nice enough to follow me (and you actually believe I am all that...), then I will reciprocate and follow you. It\u0027s only fair and in my opinion, right. If you need a friend to listen, just as I do in real life, I offer my ear to those that need it. A long time ago, I added a simple prayer to my daily life - \u0022God, if there is going to be change in this world, then let it begin with me...\u0022  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-15T14:30:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2016 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970**"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-12T18:25:45Z","Content":"It\u0027s that time of the year again, when this thread needs a friendly bump.\n\nHey, everyone! 1.2.2 came out.

I\u0027ve mentioned this before; I think having a dual variant family of the 1.25m FL-T (or even 1.875m tanks if we were getting really ambitious) in gold mylar would be interesting for building vacuum-only ships or landers.  Beyond just the visual appeal of having gold mylar-wrapped tank vessels lacking the rigid black-and-white rocket hulls, you could adjust the stats of each variant to make it a calculated trade off during \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E assembly.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E When compared to an existing FL-T400, a 1.25m diameter gold-wrapped cylinder with rounded ends (like the R-11 Baguette) would have lower mass, but also lower impact and heat tolerance, while occupying the same length and diameter space of the FL-T400.\n\u003E \n\n[@Raptor9](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/67915-raptor9/) did a great job with this one.

This is a good example.\n\nSo this is what I mean when I talk about Constructive Criticism.

It means treating others the way we want others to treat us.\n\nThere have been times I have had to \\***gently remind**\\* other forum members, usually through private messages, it\u0027s ok to disagree with a mod maker\u0027s concept, or a fan fic author\u0027s work, or some general statement about an offhanded post or two. But it is never okay to take one\u0027s disagreement to the level of being a personal attack. It just makes for bad forum mojo. The moderators work hard to keep this forum a happy place and overly critical and personally mean statements simply don\u0027t achieve those results. And there\u0027s so few moderators and so many of us non-moderators... we can help the moderators do their job if we just take a bit of effort to really consider what we are posting and the effect it may have on someone else. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"}]}
