If you want to return science data to Kerbin, you need to make long ladder from the bottom to the top of craft with no parts placed in the main ascent vehicle (all details should be trowed away before ascent). And ladders at the bottom of craft should be covered by some way, because ladders very like to melt in time of aerobraking. It is not very complex, but time locust task and i am too lazy for it ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"boxley","CreatedById":111449,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T03:38:21Z","Content":"its actually that easy to escape eve now? \n\nin the past year or two ive not so much as touched eve with any manned missions because i thought returning was impossible, but ya just need that?\n\nim really glad aerodynamics are updated.."},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T03:46:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E its actually that easy to escape eve now? \n\u003E in the past year or two ive not so much as touched eve with any manned missions because i thought returning was impossible, but ya just need that?\n\u003E \n\u003E im really glad aerodynamics are updated..\n\nGuess it takes someone like Valentina to do the risk LD"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T06:30:15Z","Content":"So, was this done with FAR?
