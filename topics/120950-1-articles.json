If no one responds to this I think im going to re post in un-modded section to get more coverage of this issue im having. Its now been 30 min of mindboggling slowness. It took 5 hours real time to get the class E out, praying that I would not get the same lag problem again. It happens, I check my post I made 10 days ago when i first ejected something out of the solar system, and still zero response. I just cant believe no one has had this issue. its like the game is frozen; literately a frame every 10-60 seconds, and I have a high end rig and 99.99% of the 2000 hours ive played this game Ive had zero lag.
