Something I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve noticed playing in career mode as it has been introduced is that you can get pretty far fast. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not talking about those 2000 science in your first mission stunts, I mean that you can run your first dozen missions and still not even be through the first week or even the first day of the in game clock. I honestly think that the game does need some \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153feel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 of the space program unfolding over a tangible period of time, instead of your entire Mercury program happening in a single afternoon of in game time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that budget could fill that in. The administrative building, which is currently unused, could be used to display your space program\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s budget, its current monetary balance and funding, and finally completed and incomplete goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space program\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s budget is a number representing the maximum amount you can spend on a single launch. The guys in the admin building aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t going to let you risk it all on a single giant rocket that could explode on the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe monetary balance is the actual amount of money you have in the bank and ready to spend. While you can design a rocket within your program\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s per-launch budget, you may not be able to actually assemble it and take it to the pad until enough money has been accumulated. The rate at which you accumulate money is your funding and later on it can help space out launchs and encourage cheaper ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe per-launch budget and the funding rate are both determined by the goals your program has completed. Goals are basically one time achievements for completing certain science objectives that are already in the game. For example an early goal is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Recover a spacecraft that has flown in the space near Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. Each time a goal is completed your budget and funding is increased proportional to that goals difficulty, and multiple goals can be completed in the same mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompleting goals also exposes new ones \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 getting to Kerbin orbit exposes goals for getting to the Mun and Minmus, while getting there exposes more specific goals for those bodies. That doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mean you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get credit for achieving a goal that wasn\u0027t revealed yet (completing a future goal will immediately reveal it) it just keeps the number of goals visible to the player at one time to a manageable level. This provides a guide to new players on what they should be trying to do if they want to get science and push forward. They start out with a single goal \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 recover a spacecraft that has flown on Kerbin (you know, flight between 0-18km) which when completed reveals several other goals \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 recover a goo container that has flown on Kerbin, file a crew report from the space near Kerbin (orbit), recover a ship which been in the space near Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe limited budget per launch could help new players to get a grasp on what they should build. For example their first launch should really just be a pod, a parachute, a fuel tank or 2 and an engine, so the initial per-launch budget could be tailored to not allow much more then that (with a nice pile of money so they can quickly try out ideas early on). Later on the limited budget challenges players to do more with less, creating better rockets. The monetary amount and funding over time is there to help space out launches and also to help encourage players to go under budget \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 launching a cheaper rocket means less time waiting for more funding to come in for the next one. This way there is still some challenge and use for new parts in building small ships even after a budget increase \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 for example a basic crew transport would still be small to save money for the interplanetary ship they will be ferried up to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
