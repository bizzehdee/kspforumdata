Yet he did not realize his dream of going to space until he was 17 years old. He knew in order to do that he must learn about what is out there. His father owned a construction firm and a junkyard. Yet I cannot start a story partway through. We must go back to the beginning, or rather, back 12 years.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ETomul was only 5 when he discovered his passion for aircraft, and by his 6th year he could name nearly every single aircraft in the United Nations of Kerbin\u2019s arsenal and all the United Kerbline\u2019s fleet by merely listening to their engines. He had mastered the art and science of how aircraft worked, and had put up detailed drawings of many different aircraft. He took hours a day envisioning the next big aircraft, and even submitted designs to major firms like the KPMC, or Kerbal Plane Making Corporation, who was the leader in USK aircraft design. The CEO of KPMC called his parents one day asking if he could use the blueprints to manufacture scale models of some of his designs, to which they happily accepted, and KPMC even helped Tomul get a patent for his works. At 7, he had his first scale model flown, quite successfully, no thanks to the amazingly accurate blueprints he provided. By 10, he had made himself known at KPMC, who were practically begging him to work for them when he finished school.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EFast forward another 5 years, he was finishing up his final mandatory schooling year, and after, he planned to enlist in UNK\u2019s Air Force. KPMC was still requesting that he join them when he finished school. But he wanted to fly and to see the subject he so dearly loved go beyond where it was, and the best way to do that was to be a test pilot. Tomul had already shown his amazing reflexes in school, as well as his overall knowledge about any subject you asked him about, especially engineering and science.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EAfter the final grades came out, and the smartest kids were revealed, Tomul was at the top of his class, but he wasn\u2019t a brainiac like most others, he was smart, no doubt, but he played it cool, loved to be outdoors or working out. He had lied to his classmates about his intellect so that he wouldn\u2019t be an outcast, but people saw right through the tough guy who didn\u2019t care about grades.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EHe immediately went to the USKAF recruiting office, handed the recruiter his paperwork, and got a crazed look. A perfect score student wanted to be an enlisted person, so the recruiter happily helped him fill out the application for the USKAF\u2019s Academy, which was an advanced level school that was for officers. He was accepted into the Academy later that week, and immediately went to Korado Sprigs where the academy was based.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ENow, two years later he was fulfilling his plan of becoming a prominent test pilot, with over four thousand hours flight time in experimental aircraft, and a little over 3k in regular aircraft in service. He flew in notable aircraft like the Sounder, which was the first aircraft to reach past Kach 5 (Kerbin Mach) at a mere 10K altitude. The only other altitude this had been done at was at 30K feet with an unmanned drone that was liquid fuel powered. His aircraft was specially built with a heat shield at the front, and parachutes for an emergency situation and for landing, as his only way to slow down was friction and drag.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ETomul was called into the 466th FTS briefing room where he found none other than the squadron CO, Chuck Kerman, as well as two men in suits, one named Gene and the other named Mortimer.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u201CGood morning Tomul, I am Gene Kerman, and this is my associate Mortimer, we are with the USK Space Agency.
