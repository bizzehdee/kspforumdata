The point is practicing knowing that the risk is real. This is literally the entire point of the early Apollo program. Apollo 10 was literally just the landing, without the landing. They didn\u2019t need to launch that mission. They could\u2019ve just fully fueled the LM and called it day but they didn\u2019t because they wanted to prove that the machinery functioned and operated safely in the environment it would be used. And to experience failures and faults in the real environment- a situation that cannot be replicated by any sim and won\u2019t be fully explored playing it overtly safe\u00A0in LEO.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u2019re right- it would take multiple launches, and as you said they can\u2019t do rapid launches. So, clearly the alternative is they stockpile. Build 2 SLS\u2019 and roll them out one after the other. Just sacrifice a year\u2019s launch and put the two needed launches together. That is, if NASA doesn\u2019t want to spend a month or two analyzing the vehicle as is their tendency first. A practice that would only help with SLS\u2019 slow launch rates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe shuttle still achieved the most of any American launched spacecraft to date. Whether it\u2019s liked or despised, that\u2019s just the realistic perspective. Apollo accomplished a bigger task but the shuttle DID more. I already said that I acknowledge it could\u2019ve done more, but again, even Apollo could\u2019ve done more. So it\u2019s hogwash to say that it was entirely a failure. Not even the cost side is a fair argument as again, Apollo blew up in costs. Time to launch? We were tasked to launch before the end of the decade and only managed to achieve 1 goal 6 months before the goal was missed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the transport version of STS was innovative but frankly we weren\u2019t ready for it- the engineering was sound but we were barely ready for the moon in 1970, much less intending to expand on the moon or go to Mars. Thinking that we were ready was wishful thinking. We struggled to get probes successfully to Mars, much less the far more complicated task of crew or larger payloads. As I said before Apollo worked because the US threw money\u00A0at the technical problems until they were solved. There \u00A0was no practical efficiency in anything the US did, and even assuming that Congress suddenly become inspired by Carl Sagan and von Braun, there was still a huge gap in experience. As you said yourself, we needed multiple launches in a year and we peaked at 4 manned launches in 1969. With two of those missions nearly ending in disaster and the first mission of 1970 literally being mere breaths away from being the first fatalities in space! We weren\u2019t ready. Simple fact is if we tried to commit to 1965-STS, we would\u2019ve killed crews as we burned our way to get the system to work. The program no doubt was what we could\u2019ve\u00A0done- but it\u2019s a good thing we didn\u2019t as we weren\u2019t\u00A0ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI totally understand why those who have been waiting and watching are so irritated but there\u2019s some simple facts; we weren\u2019t ready for moon bases (hell we\u2019re\u00A0only barely ready TODAY much less 40 years ago), we didn\u2019t WANT to go to the moon anymore (I say as a whole nation), and we couldn\u2019t afford to. As I said before, the entire Apollo program was just a case of dumping more and more cash to get it to work by a set time- there was no practical plan to get anything to work long term. So having lost our need to go to space, but holding onto the general approval of space, we stayed in low earth orbit. A place where we could learn how to work and live in space. Tasks we\u2019d be expected to do on the moon. Only without the potential dangers of another Apollo 13 on route or a Apollo 11 where crews could be stranded without a way home. And undoubtedly the only reason we didn\u2019t lose crew on the moon is the fact we called it quits early. We would\u2019ve killed a crew, trying to continue without at the time adhoc technology. Technology that was sound, but not practical long term. With each AGC\u2019s programming literally being woven by hand, the more times it\u2019s created, the increased chance there is for failure- and it only takes 1 failure in the right place in the code to end up with the computer aborting the mission in a black zone during lunar descent and kill the crew as the ascent stage cannot decelerate in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I can understand why you\u2019re frustrated- but that doesn\u2019t change that sometimes things end up working out for the best, even serendipitously; maybe even\u00A0if not readily apparent. And I certainly do feel that our withdrawal from Apollo was the right thing to do. The shuttle\u2019s final form was not perfect, but it was a sight better than no manned spacecraft at all, which, during the recession of the 70s and with growing pains in the nation, I\u2019m certain was a serious consideration.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, for all the \u201C\u003Cstrong\u003Ewe\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0should\u2019ve done\u201D, it\u2019s strange how no one else has stepped up to the plate instead. Not Russia, China, Japan or any other major world economy, and not even a corporate entity could until only very recently. Perhaps this is because the technology was still so new and our understanding of how or why they worked, were still too primitive for them to be solved, economically. The problems instead had to be solved by those who had deep enough pockets to learn from failure and use seemingly brute force and inefficient designs to get the job done.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I refer to a comment I made a while back about the fact that there hasn\u2019t been a single spacecraft that hasn\u2019t been affected by government interests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-03T08:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it\u0027s true we weren\u0027t ready to build bases on the moon immediately post Apollo.
