Currently having an issue with blank (white) textures on a few specific parts when running the 3-6 and 3-7 x86 Basic releases. The textures seem fine when running the 3-5 release.\u003Cp\u003EFor me, this is affecting the PackRat parts from USI but others have reported issues with the, I think, the science lab in interstellar and that it\u0027s something to do with TGA textures in KSP/Unity.
