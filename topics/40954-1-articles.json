Currently on the Mun I have 1 small lander for Kethane drilling (drill and a tank), and another one for converting (a tank and converter). I\u0027ve connected them using a horizontal winch, to connector, to connection port on the other ship. My problem is, in \u0027undocked\u0027 mode I can\u0027t transfer anything, and in \u0027docked\u0027 mode the ships lift up, start drifting/rotating and all sorts of bad things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this how I\u0027m supposed to transfer using KAS (without the need of physically clamping the ships using ports) or am I doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone knows what I should be doing or any good tutorials/documentation please let me know \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EmissionGeneration","CreatedById":71859,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T09:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to be in Docked Mode with the Connectors, but it shouldn\u0027t be lifting anything up, so sounds like yours is bugging out.
