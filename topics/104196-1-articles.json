I think kerbinside had one.\n\nAlthough if Kerbin had a canyon added , it should be in a mesa like area. Maybe they could add one north of KSC, where the Sahara desert would be on Africa (lets face it, KSC\u0027s continent is so similar to Africa that you can use one as a location reference for the other)\n\nEdit: looking at a map, I think the sandy coastal area in southwest of KSC\u0027s continent (we need some names for these places!)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T19:11:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by temporalExile**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T19:18:22Z","Content":"HyperEdit would work.\n\nOr if you don\u0027t want the cheaty option you could consider [**KerbinSide**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785).

A canyon system would be much better - twisting back and forth at high speeds, multiple paths you can take... I\u0027d fly through it until I run out of fuel or throw up from vertigo... either option is fine with me, lol."}]}
