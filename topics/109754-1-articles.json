I know it wouldn\u0027t be very useful, im not planning to make an actual elevator, just a tower, but I just wanted to know if it was possible before I wasted my time trying it. I also read on the wiki that synchronous orbit for Gilly is 42.14 km, which i think is too far, but do you need to be at a synchronous orbit for a space elevator to work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T04:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor it to be a true space elevator it would have to be a synchronous orbit, but that\u0027s because the concept use a flexible cable, if the top is too high or low the cable wraps around the planet.
