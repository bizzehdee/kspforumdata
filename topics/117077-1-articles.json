This lead to the discovery that if you observe the sunrise on the same day one year apart, the sun rises 42 seconds earlier on the second year than it did on the first. I then decided to observe the rising times of identifiable stars. In this case I observed that a reference star rises about 37 seconds earlier than it did one year earlier.  \n\nTo refine these numbers I warped ahead 10 years and found that sunrise differed by 421 seconds, or 42.1 s/yr, and the stars differed by 374 seconds, or 37.4 s/yr. I estimate my accuracy on the accumulative totals to be about \u00B11 s on both measurements.  \n\nFrom this we can compute the actual length of Kerbin\u0027s sidereal rotation period and its solar day:  \n\nSidereal day = (426 \\* 21600 - 37.4) / 426 = 21599.9122 \u00B10.00024 seconds  \n\nSolar day = (426 \\* 21600 - 42.1) / 425 = 21650.7245 \u00B10.00024 seconds  \n\nUsing these numbers we can compute the length of Kerbin\u0027s sidereal year:  \n\nSidereal year = (-21599.9122 \\* 21650.7245) / (21599.9122 - 21650.7245) = 9,203,554 \u00B185 seconds  \n\nThe generally accepted duration of Kerbin\u0027s sidereal year is 9,203,545 seconds, which is very close to my computation and clearly within the margin of error. The math matches the observations, so I feel quite confident in my results.  \n\nOf course Kerbin\u0027s calendar day remains 21,600 seconds regardless.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-03T14:38:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2017 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T16:08:14Z","Content":"You have earned 1.6 science points."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T16:25:03Z","Content":"Are you sure you took into account everything?\n\nUsing only sunrise is a bit of a bias, you need to also measure sunset."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T16:27:13Z","Content":"The above numbers are what the wiki says.

The sunsets show the same 42-second year-to-year difference as observed with the sunrises.  \n\nBecause of the internal consistency of the numbers, I feel pretty confident that my observations and computations are correct. For instance, the calculation of the length of the sidereal year from the observations is extremely sensitive to error. You can see that just a \u00B11\u0022 error in the measurements over a ten year period results in a \u00B185\u0022 error in the sidereal year. That fact that my sidereal year calculation is just 9 seconds off from the accepted value I believe is very strong corroboration.

This would synchronize the motion of the sun with the length of the day so that the sun rises and sets at the same time each day. As it is now, the sun rises about 50.7 seconds later each day. If the sun rises at 0:00 on the first day of the year, by mid-year it is rising at 3:00. That\u0027s screwed up and would really mess with schedules, work hours, etc.\n\nThe length of Kerbin calendar day should be 21650.7245 seconds, which would make the year 425 days long rather than 426. This would make the calendar year 1987 seconds shorter than the actually sidereal year. Reconciling this would require the addition of 10 leap days every 109 years (there would still have to be some periodic minor adjustments to keep perfectly in sync).\n\nOf course a 21650.7245-second day dosen\u0027t work very well with our earthly units of measure.
