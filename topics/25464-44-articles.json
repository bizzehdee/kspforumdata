The BirdDog can still fly at KSC, but it\u0027s not balanced well (needs to have its CoM and CoL positions tweaked). Also, the severe hammering the Basic Jet engine received means that it won\u0027t be able to go as high or fast, and the higher fuel consumption rate will reduce its range. Also, I worry about how well it can drive around on the ground as a rover now because solar cells now obey 1/r\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, so power for the wheels will be much more limited out in the Jool system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EBasic Jet:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Isp doesn\u0027t seem to change at all anywhere within the altitude at which it works so you no longer need to get as high as possible to stretch fuel. Range is therefore dependent on speed. For a small, single-engine plane, the top speed of about 230m/s seems to occur about 3/4 of the way up to its operational ceiling (say 8km on Kerbin, 6km on Laythe). However, from there on down to the deck, top speed isn\u0027t much lower, in the neighborhood of 215m/s. Thus, finding the altitude for absolute top speed doesn\u0027t make a significant difference in range. A plane with 1 Basic Jet and 3x 1.25m tanks can fly 1-way 2/3 to 3/4 of the way around Kerbin so might circumnavigate Laythe. IIRC, your BirdDogs have 2 tanks so should still be capable of pretty long trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERover Wheels:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, you\u0027ll probably need fuel cells for those. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EHOWEVER, there\u0027s also the option to use ModuleManager (see under Seaplanes below).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wouldn\u0027t expect the original Laythe SSTO (based on jet engines) to be able to make orbit...but the RASSTO version might because it\u0027s built around RAPIERs. The little STUBBY SSTO rocket (also jet power) will be useless in reaching orbit as well. I expect the LadyHawk spaceplane (Turbojet) won\u0027t stand a chance to reach orbit, and the Raptor RAPIER version of the spaceplane is probably too draggy to get through the sound barrier. I read a post that said that scoop intakes no longer work as flotation devices...in which case anybody flying the Mallard will be in for a rude shock if he tries to land on water. Also, the Turbojet Mallard isn\u0027t going to be accidentally going into orbit anymore. (What are people able to do for seaplanes in KSP 1.0 with no decent flotation devices, accidental or otherwise?)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESSTO Spaceplanes:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major change here is that no jet engine, not even the RAPIER, can get nearly as high or as fast as before. For example, the RAPIER in jet mode now just flat dies instantly between 24-25km at about 1000m/s. This means you need in excess of 1500m/s dV of rocket just to reach LKO, which means the bulk of your spaceplane now has to be LFO tanks, resulting in huge spaceplanes for their payload compared to before. Also, it\u0027s VERY difficult to make an interplanetary spaceplane using anythinge except RAPIERs due to the need to 1) reserve the rear fuselage for the tug\u0027s docking port, 2) reduce drag by keeping radial tanks/engines to a minimum, and 3) the major nerfing of the 48-7S in general and the atmospheric performance of the 909. The latter means anything using seperate jets and rockets has to use things like T-30s or Aerospikes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome folks have gotten into LKO using LF-only spaceplanes powered by TurboRamjets and LV-Ns, but I haven\u0027t messed with this idea myself yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one rather ironic piece of good news regarding spaceplanes is that you no longer need to to worry about asymmetrical flameout because the jets drop dead before they run out of IntakeAir. So no more having to attach 1 engine, then its intakes, then the other engine, then its intakes. You do, however, still need to airhog just a bit. Usually 1 inline intake (shock cone or ram, doesn\u0027t seem to matter) and either 1 precooler or a pair of structural radial intakes per engine is all you need. Just using the inline intake won\u0027t do it. And do NOT use the old, hoodscoop-looking radial intake on anything you want to go high and fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESeaplanes\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, this sucks. However, after a rather nasty crash, I happened to notice that the new stock airbrakes seem to have some bouncy floatiness sorta like the old radial intakes used to. It could be that you could make a plane with retractable hydroplane-type floats this way, which woudl be cool. The main problem I foresee is that the airbrakes are broken when it comes to action groups. While you can assign their various features to action groups in the SPH, your changes don\u0027t stick. Instead, the Airbrake ALWAYS reverts to its default of being part of the stock Brake action group. Thus, you can\u0027t have a separate bunch of Airbrakes to use as floats. Hopefully there will soon be a stock bugfix mod addressing this. But anyway, I haven\u0027t experimented with this yet so don\u0027t know if it will actually work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat leaves the old standard of the Firespitter mod. There are 2 options here. First is to use the pontoon parts that come in the mod. Downside here is HUGE drag. Once I had a spaceplane that would reach orbit, I put it on pontoons and it wouldn\u0027t break the sound barrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2nd option is to use ModuleManager. The Firespitter pontoons work using the module FSbuoyancy, which is all under the hood without any exposed variables. Thus, you could have ONLY the Firespitter.dll in your game, none of the parts, and use ModuleManager to apply the FSbuoyancy module to whatever stock parts you desire, turning those parts into pontoons. If you did this for the old radial intakes, then your could make your existing seaplanes float again (although the huge drag of said old radial intakes would be a detriment to performance so you might have to ModuleManager a tweak there, too). Also note that there\u0027s an FSrudder module as well (used by the rear pontoon section) that provides turning ability while on the water \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EAND while we\u0027re on the subject of Firespitter, it also has the module FSwheel. FSwheel adds motors to landing gear that DO NOT REQUIRE ANY RESOURCES to run. So, to save solarpowered BirdDog rover wheels, you could use ModuleManager to put FSwheel on their rover wheels and drive around all you want, with the solar panels just there for decoration.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Turns out FSwheel does in fact require EC. But OTOH, for all powered wheels, the resource consumption seems to be just a separate bookkeeping thing from the actual movement. Thus, you can ModuleManager resource consumption however you want and still get the same driving performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T13:06:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 01:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did a little testing of the Laythe ships in 1.0.2... I was able to get the RASSTO RAPIER powered SSTO rocket to orbit, but I had problems testing the original jet-powered SSTO rocket because the action groups are messed up. First, the parachutes that I repack and deploy with action groups are popping out when I take off (I\u0027ve had this problem on some of my Duna ships as well)...so I had to bump the ship up a little until the chutes popped, then land it and repack them (or not bother repacking since it\u0027s just a boost test). The jet-powered SSTO also has its jet-toggle action broken, so I couldn\u0027t stop asymmetrical flameout during test boost (I\u0027ll have to edit the save file) -- but the jet engines are very, very weak in lifting the rocket...still, it gets over 10K, at which time its rocket engines and considerable amount if fuel still might be able to make orbit (the ship could get to Low Kerbin Orbit originally, so it was a bit overdesigned for Laythe).

But it does takeoff from the water much easier than it used to, without all the loud noise and splashing.
