Set it in the VAB, but its effect occurs during usage of the engine in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, if you need half thrust from one engine, and full thrust from 2 other engines, and need to run all three together, you can\u0027t do it short of specialised mods. There\u0027s only one throttle, and so either all three at half, all three at full, or somewhere around 5/6. if you needed that one engine at a reduced throttle to balance an asymmetrical stage, that could be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can set an LV-T30 to 50% so it gives only 100 thrust instead of 200 thrust, and leave the other two alone, then when you ask for 80% throttle, two give you 160kN or 200*80%, the third gives you 80kN, or 200*50%*80%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would certainly help with balancing various loads, such as a shuttle, without resorting to careful addition of LV-1\u0027s for a 1.5kN stepping and without the corresponding part count increase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, If I understand what tweakables will likely permit when the day comes they are implemented, I do think this would fall under that.
