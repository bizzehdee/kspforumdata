(I love MechJeb) Anyway, I have several crafts in orbit, and cannot for the life of me rendezvous with them. I\u0027ve come close-ish (18KM) but never got close to one. Most of the time I have a problem with being in a different (however so slightly) plane than the target craft, so I cannot meet with them. I was just wondering if there is a certain technique to doing it? I\u0027ve tried using the MechJeb rendezvous tool but it just gives me the targets velocity and altitude, which while they have gotten me closer to rendezvous than without it, it still isn\u0027t enough..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be awesome to have some kind of in game thing, where you select the target you want to rendezvous with as you are setting on the launch pad, and it tells you when you need to launch, i.e. T-20:00 minutes to Launch, along with a suggested flight path on the map screen, and a suggested prograde point on the Navball.

To catch up, lower your orbit. To slow down, raise your orbit. As you get closer, you need to reduce the altitude difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a bit of practice, this will get you within 5km. At that distance, forget about orbits, and use RCS for the final approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use the rendezvous tools in the MechJeb, because they are confusing.
