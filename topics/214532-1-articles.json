When I landed Successfully, I tried to get out of the spacecraft but, stupidly, had placed an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E that obstructed the hatch. Since there was nothing else I could do, I decided to hit the space button to launch, but forgot that it was a controlled liquid rocket, so now I have no way to get back? I would attempt to send a rescue shuttle there but even If I landed safely, I don\u0027t know how to get the Kerbals out.
