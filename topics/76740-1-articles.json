You\u0027d gain science and some money by completing missions as happens currently with science only. After a successful amount of research on the mun or some other location you will discover a resource (or perhaps get a lead from a firm and general coordinates of a site they\u0027ve surveyed from afar but need you to do a local survey of), thus attracting private firms for exploitation. The door is then open for mega bucks to get into the game once the machine of kerbins industrial society kicks in as they would require you to install some sort of means of extracting and delivering the resource back to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf however you want the game to be a science Sim where all funding is from gov then the purpose of money would basically be just to raise and lower your budget based on overall success. Too many mission failures could possibly tank the game for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like allowing fictional private interests in the game where exploitation of resources is happening as it would feel like a future space Sim where we are truly conquering the solar system. Now it feels like a fantasy historical space Sim, very cool to be sure, but govt only funding is not where space exploration in the real world is headed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-05T15:49:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2014 03:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
