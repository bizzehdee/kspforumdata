Not a trivial matter IRL, CO2 buildup is actually more of a danger than running out of oxygen. Such a scrubber would slowly consume a \u0022Sorbent\u0022 material in order to remove CO2 from the pod. In some designs (like the Shuttle RCRS and presumably Vozdukh), it could be regenerated, taking a large amount of ElectricCharge in a short time.
