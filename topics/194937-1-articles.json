I\u0027m assuming that the environment is friendly or at worst neutral to a human presence, apart from the local fauna - the air is breathable, the temperature is temperate, the soil is rich enough for cultivation. If you don\u0027t have some of those then the colony would need some higher tech levels in order to provide e.g. artificial fertilizer, or perhaps advanced drugs to allow humans to digest the local flora, or suits or breathing apparatus - things that would pose serious detriments to the colonists if they were not present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the colony is relatively accessible, then it can probably sustain a high tech level and can grow rapidly. In this case, you would probably start with a post-industrial tech level. Farming would be largely mechanized, and the colony would closely resemble a small modern town - shops for selling imported or exported goods, healthcare services, perhaps an open-air market for local artisans, but otherwise any profession that you could find in a town of say, 5000 people or so you would probably have there. The colony would start small but would grow quickly if the opportunity for free or subsidized land was accessible to laypeople from the homeworld, and ships would arrive regularly bringing more people, manufactured goods, and other necessities the colony couldn\u0027t produce for itself. Within a few decades the population would swell to the point where it was more or less producing all the technical goods that it required, and would be on par with a small city from the homeworld. In order of priority from your original list, here\u0027s how I think the population distribution would go in decreasing size:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n5 \u0026amp; 6: architects and engineers. I\u0027m considering the people that do the construction as engineers, although many of them would be working under an engineer and may be unskilled laborers. With the colony growing rapidly, the need for new buildings and infrastructure is going to be large, so most of the population would be dedicated to either construction or bootstrapping the industrial capacity of the colony\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n1: farmers. Farming would be at least partially mechanized, and in some circumstanced may be entirely automated. Still, the farmers would be responsible for maintaining the machinery and providing raw inputs (fertilizer \u0026amp; seeds) and moving food to the populated center. More people means more mouths to feed, so farmers could make up a significant fraction of the population if the work is less automated.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLaw enforcement. You touch on this with 9: hunters a bit, but law enforcement\u0027s role would be more defense of the colony and internal conflict management\u00A0rather than food acquisition. If the environment is sufficiently hostile, this camp could even be the largest proportion of the population (e.g. RDA security from Avatar).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBureaucrats: someone has to manage the limited resources of the new colony, and nobody better suited to do that than a burgeoning bureaucracy. initially, the bureaucracy may be tiny or nonexistent, but would grow as more concerns needed addressing by central leadership. This category also includes the \u0027mayor\u0027 and other public servants.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n2, 4, 8, and everything else: In this scenario, the population is expanding rapidly, so most other fields of specialization would come quickly as more people arrived. Doctors and medical staff would likely be on the first ship down, but aided by their technology and the small size of the colony it is unlikely they would be a significant fraction of the population.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScientific staff: as mentioned by others, scientists would love to get their hands on a new world. If the world is totally fresh, then a wide variety of scientists would be vying for a seat o the colony, but in general they would be a smaller proportion of the initial population.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere would be no need for 7 or 3, beasts of burden would be replaced with mechanical counterparts, and no breedstock would be required due to the constant external influx of people from the homeworld.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the colony is not accessible, than things are going to be a little different. In this scenario, it is either hard or expensive to get from the homeworld either due to the cost of interstellar travel, the travel time\u00A0from the homeworld, or other economic factors. Ships arrive once in a while, but the cadence is significantly slower or perhaps even nonexistent (abandoned colony scenario). For the colonists to survive here, regardless of their original tech level (which we can assume is significant, after all they are interstellar colonists), it is likely that they would adopt a more primitive lifestyle, probably around 1800\u0027s tech. The original settlement would be augmented with high-tech things from the original settlers, but the majority of people would likely start out as farmers, supporting a bare minimum number of other specialized professions. Unless the seed colony was large enough to start an industrial base on its own, it is unlikely that they would be able to maintain the high-tech things they brought with them for an extended period of time. In this scenario, it takes decades to even begin the process of industrialization, spurred on by what little technology they have functioning at that time. As above, the roles in decreasing size:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n1: Farmers. Farming in this scenario is a manual process, so most people are going to produce their own food. Unlike the previous scenario, the vast majority of people would likely be farmers or otherwise employed getting food (hunters, butchers, etc), perhaps upwards of 80% of the total initial population\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n7: beasts of burden. Either imported or domesticated from local fauna, beasts of burden would provide much of the \u0027tractive effort\u0027 of the fledgling colony, especially assisting with farming and transportation needs\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlaw enforecment, doctors, and engineer(s), and more: The central area of the colony would be small, but it would have most of the necessary professions to keep life going. A professional engineer to repair gizmos (if they are able), a doctor or two for when people get sick and to provide counseling needs, and other basic professions: a tavern, a cooper, a smithy, a potter, a teacher for basic education of children (advanced education would either be inaccessible as children would work on the farms, or done via apprenticeships), basically everything you would find in an early 19th century prairie town.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nscientific staff, again in the central area. Depending on the circumstances of the settling of the colony, they may not be present at all.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere would be no need for breed stock - everyone would be part of the of the breed stock, there is no reason to have people specialize in that.

I\u0027m assuming that the environment is friendly or at worst neutral to a human presence, apart from the local fauna - the air is breathable, the temperature is temperate, the soil is rich enough for cultivation. If you don\u0027t have some of those then the colony would need some higher tech levels in order to provide e.g. artificial fertilizer, or perhaps advanced drugs to allow humans to digest the local flora, or suits or breathing apparatus - things that would pose serious detriments to the colonists if they were not present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the colony is relatively accessible, then it can probably sustain a high tech level and can grow rapidly. In this case, you would probably start with a post-industrial tech level. Farming would be largely mechanized, and the colony would closely resemble a small modern town - shops for selling imported or exported goods, healthcare services, perhaps an open-air market for local artisans, but otherwise any profession that you could find in a town of say, 5000 people or so you would probably have there. The colony would start small but would grow quickly if the opportunity for free or subsidized land was accessible to laypeople from the homeworld, and ships would arrive regularly bringing more people, manufactured goods, and other necessities the colony couldn\u0027t produce for itself. Within a few decades the population would swell to the point where it was more or less producing all the technical goods that it required, and would be on par with a small city from the homeworld. In order of priority from your original list, here\u0027s how I think the population distribution would go in decreasing size:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n5 \u0026amp; 6: architects and engineers. I\u0027m considering the people that do the construction as engineers, although many of them would be working under an engineer and may be unskilled laborers. With the colony growing rapidly, the need for new buildings and infrastructure is going to be large, so most of the population would be dedicated to either construction or bootstrapping the industrial capacity of the colony\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n1: farmers. Farming would be at least partially mechanized, and in some circumstanced may be entirely automated. Still, the farmers would be responsible for maintaining the machinery and providing raw inputs (fertilizer \u0026amp; seeds) and moving food to the populated center. More people means more mouths to feed, so farmers could make up a significant fraction of the population if the work is less automated.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLaw enforcement. You touch on this with 9: hunters a bit, but law enforcement\u0027s role would be more defense of the colony and internal conflict management\u00A0rather than food acquisition. If the environment is sufficiently hostile, this camp could even be the largest proportion of the population (e.g. RDA security from Avatar).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBureaucrats: someone has to manage the limited resources of the new colony, and nobody better suited to do that than a burgeoning bureaucracy. initially, the bureaucracy may be tiny or nonexistent, but would grow as more concerns needed addressing by central leadership. This category also includes the \u0027mayor\u0027 and other public servants.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n2, 4, 8, and everything else: In this scenario, the population is expanding rapidly, so most other fields of specialization would come quickly as more people arrived. Doctors and medical staff would likely be on the first ship down, but aided by their technology and the small size of the colony it is unlikely they would be a significant fraction of the population.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScientific staff: as mentioned by others, scientists would love to get their hands on a new world. If the world is totally fresh, then a wide variety of scientists would be vying for a seat o the colony, but in general they would be a smaller proportion of the initial population.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere would be no need for 7 or 3, beasts of burden would be replaced with mechanical counterparts, and no breedstock would be required due to the constant external influx of people from the homeworld.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the colony is not accessible, than things are going to be a little different. In this scenario, it is either hard or expensive to get from the homeworld either due to the cost of interstellar travel, the travel time\u00A0from the homeworld, or other economic factors. Ships arrive once in a while, but the cadence is significantly slower or perhaps even nonexistent (abandoned colony scenario). For the colonists to survive here, regardless of their original tech level (which we can assume is significant, after all they are interstellar colonists), it is likely that they would adopt a more primitive lifestyle, probably around 1800\u0027s tech. The original settlement would be augmented with high-tech things from the original settlers, but the majority of people would likely start out as farmers, supporting a bare minimum number of other specialized professions. Unless the seed colony was large enough to start an industrial base on its own, it is unlikely that they would be able to maintain the high-tech things they brought with them for an extended period of time. In this scenario, it takes decades to even begin the process of industrialization, spurred on by what little technology they have functioning at that time. As above, the roles in decreasing size:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n1: Farmers. Farming in this scenario is a manual process, so most people are going to produce their own food. Unlike the previous scenario, the vast majority of people would likely be farmers or otherwise employed getting food (hunters, butchers, etc), perhaps upwards of 80% of the total initial population\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n7: beasts of burden. Either imported or domesticated from local fauna, beasts of burden would provide much of the \u0027tractive effort\u0027 of the fledgling colony, especially assisting with farming and transportation needs\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nlaw enforecment, doctors, and engineer(s), and more: The central area of the colony would be small, but it would have most of the necessary professions to keep life going. A professional engineer to repair gizmos (if they are able), a doctor or two for when people get sick and to provide counseling needs, and other basic professions: a tavern, a cooper, a smithy, a potter, a teacher for basic education of children (advanced education would either be inaccessible as children would work on the farms, or done via apprenticeships), basically everything you would find in an early 19th century prairie town.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nscientific staff, again in the central area. Depending on the circumstances of the settling of the colony, they may not be present at all.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere would be no need for breed stock - everyone would be part of the of the breed stock, there is no reason to have people specialize in that. What I might see possible is a sperm/egg bank, or even zygotes for IVF - 200 people is not enough genetic diversity without purposefully introducing mutations in newborns.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTravel time is near hard-scifi, since vessels somehow travel at the speed of light, time dialation and all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next supply vessel is due to drop in two Earth years, which to the MC on Talaam is about 30 months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIngame the alien world known as Talaam has several differences with Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a bit closer to the sun, has two moons, and has a thicker atmospheric blanket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently it\u0027s not so thick that it is like Venus... still if applying what I think I know of science I would expect Talaam to be very arid... unless it had abundant water... which to the makers of the game\u0027s credit it does. \u00A0It has oceans as vast as Earth\u0027s and plenty of freshwater lakes too.
