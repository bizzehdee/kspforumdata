For that matter, are there other effects available we don\u0027t know about? Let\u0027s say I wanted to make a Miner or Geologist. (So that I could make a MM-patch for mining equipment to require a Miner or Geologist, just for sake of example.) Or anything else a plug-in, patch, or any other mod might hook into.\n\nThe closest answer I found on my own was: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103664-How-do-the-new-EFFECT-modules-work](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103664-How-do-the-new-EFFECT-modules-work)\n\nBut it never received any response. However, from the post I gather I need to code the effect in C#, compile it to a \\*.dll, and put it into GameData? (ie: I need to write a plug-in?) Where do I start? I\u0027m not bad at reverse-engineering example code, documentation, etc. I just can\u0027t find any.\n\nAny help, opinions, etc are more than welcome.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T23:57:54Z","Content":"You could take a look at the source from taniwha\u0027s Extraplanetary Launchpads, he actualy does add custom effects I believe."},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:49:03Z","Content":"I believe you can find an example from taniwha\u0027s Extraplanetary Launchpads here :\n\nThe PartModule he made for his XP trait : [https://github.com/taniwha-qf/Extraplanetary-Launchpads/blob/a38adaf4131ccc97d192403f5303e937b967e821/Source/Workshop/Workshop.cs](https://github.com/taniwha-qf/Extraplanetary-Launchpads/blob/a38adaf4131ccc97d192403f5303e937b967e821/Source/Workshop/Workshop.cs)\n\nThe Experience effect class : [https://github.com/taniwha-qf/Extraplanetary-Launchpads/blob/a38adaf4131ccc97d192403f5303e937b967e821/Source/Workshop/ConstructionSkill.cs](https://github.com/taniwha-qf/Extraplanetary-Launchpads/blob/a38adaf4131ccc97d192403f5303e937b967e821/Source/Workshop/ConstructionSkill.cs)\n\nBy the way your mod idea seems really nice ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
