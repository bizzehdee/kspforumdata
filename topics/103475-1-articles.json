The original Docking Mode is almost useless and the \u0022NavyFish Docking Port Alignement\u0022 is a very good help, but still perfectible. I\u0027ve got the idea of a laser coming out from the target docking port, that you can use to find a good alignement. In my opinion, the laser plus the Docking Port Alignement, will make every docking more easy and also a little more realistic. IRL lasers are used in docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone interested in this?
