I\u0027ve decided to join this forum because of the constant stream of ideas, though it\u0027s not so much a stream than it is a tsunami during springtime during a storm. Anyway, I\u0027ve been watching the Discovery TV documentary Alien Planet - which I do recommend you watch since it\u0027s about theoretical missions to explore extraterrestrial life - and I took a particular interest at the spaceplanes used to deliver the probes. So naturally I just drew up a handy dandy schematics/concept art sheet. It\u0027s a tad big, so bear with me - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.weasyl.com/~kavaeric/submission/547509/kavaeric-single-use-payload-delivery-spaceplane-1928718.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kavaeric-single-use-payload-delivery-spaceplane-1928718.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExt image link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.weasyl.com/~kavaeric/submission/547509/kavaeric-single-use-payload-delivery-spaceplane-1928718.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.weasyl.com/~kavaeric/submission/547509/kavaeric-single-use-payload-delivery-spaceplane-1928718.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceplane is to be deployed from a \u0022mothership\u0022, in which it glides down to its landing spot, using the atmosphere as an aerobrake. In its final moments in the air it uses downwards mounted thrusters to keep it above the ground for as long as possible, as well as a last-minute brake. Its graceful and gentle landing procedure consists of slamming and sliding along the ground on its belly (no gear or skids) before coming to a halt. The payload shield doors will be jettisoned and the rover, probe or possibly crew will exit via the rear of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking a disposa-- single-use delivery plane like this could potentially be lighter than a lander and possibly cheaper since it only really has 5 minutes of liquid fuel, though it\u0027ll probably end up needing a lot more ground to slide along. I\u0027m no modding expert so I don\u0027t have any clue how one would even go about trying to implement this in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for checking out my art and reading!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fox62","CreatedById":23673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T18:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E....
