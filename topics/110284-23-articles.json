If you strap it to the back of the wing, however, you\u0026#39;re fine. The initial prototype will take some creativity to use properly (hence the experimental stripes on the top of the wing), but hopefully later revisions will improve things. That\u0026#39;s where I\u0026#39;m needing help. Ideal test pilots will be unafraid to dive into the config files and tweak values to test performance improvements and then post their results.

It works similarly to a command seat; just drop it on the ground (be careful, some terrain is explosive), right-click to board it, then rotate upright. Alternately, bolt it to the side of a craft, board, and decouple. The wing can be used on any planet with an atmosphere thanks to its monopropellant-powered jet engines. Just don\u0026#39;t expect terrific range, unless you switch to liquid fuel and fly in an oxygenated atmosphere like Kerbin or Laythe. JetWing is inspired by JetMan Yves Rossy and the defunct KerbolQuest winged jetpack. The JetWing and its accessories work best with Kerbal Inventory System and either GoodSpeed Fuel Pump or TAC Fuel Balancer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn addition to the Jetwing, this release also introduces the M1A2 Grizzly, a larger wheel than the Mountain Goat that has a wider wheelbase and better traction. This all comes at the expense of not being able to enter and exit Mk3 cargo bays, however.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, there were some big changes to OSE Workshop and the Community Resource Pack recently, and Pathfinder has been updated to reflect the changes. You might find prospecting a lucrative business if you bring stuff home...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNOTE: Due to changes in OSE Workshop, you can no longer switch between MaterialKits and RocketParts. However, the Ironworks still has converters that switch between \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRocketParts and MaterialKits. Additionally, OSE Workshop\u0026#39;s changes now require ExoticMinerals and RareMetals for some parts, so plan accordingly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNew Parts\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the M1A2 Grizzly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the JetWing. \u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the JetWing Drop Tank. Works great with Good Speed Fuel Pump or TAC Fuel Balancer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the JetWing Parachute. Like the Outback, it can be attached to the JetWing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added the JetWing Cargo Pallet.

In my last install, the Wild Blue Industries mod was more of an alternative parts pack for MKS / OKS (which I loved), containing all of the same functionality with fewer and (IMHO) better looking parts. Now, more than a year later, it appears that this has gone on to develop its own identity, which is great, but since I\u0027m looking to develop more permanent bases (my current career goal is to plant a permanent colony on every solid body), for which MKS is designed, I\u0027m wondering if there is any integration between the two. I have done some reading through the thread, and there is some mention of MKS / Pathfinder integration, but as near as I can tell, it hasn\u0027t gone anywhere as of yet. Am I correct in this assessment, or has the integration been successful and my search-fu skills simply lacking?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, has anyone worked up a configuration that would allow this to be use with Real Fuels rather than the stock\u00A0liquid fuel, oxidizer, and monopropellant resources?
