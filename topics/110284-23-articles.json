What counts as a surface scan to unlock core samples? I\u0027ve got a TERRAIN probe in orbit and ran the geosurvey. Also ran a low-res ScanSat scan using the radar scanner.\n\nGreat question. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) The way it works is you can use either the TERRAIN or the stock M700 orbital scanner to unlock the planet, then use the stock surface scanner or the geology lab to unlock the biome. Basically, Pathfinder uses the stock system to unlock resources. Here is a link from the wiki page: [https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/Scanning-For-Resources-In-Pathfinder](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/wiki/Scanning-For-Resources-In-Pathfinder)"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T15:42:03Z","Content":"[Get the latest here.](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.9.0)\n\nThe Buffalo gets new wheels! The stock-based RoveMax M1A1 wheels were always interim placeholders, but now the Buffalo has its real wheels. The new M1A1 Mountain Goat is inspired by the wheels found on NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s MMSEV but they have been brought inline with the KSP art style. The current stock-based wheel will be going away. They are deprecated in this release (existing craft won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t break but you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find the wheels in the catalog) and it will be removed at a later date, so be sure to retrofit or retire your rovers that have the older wheels.\n\nNew Parts\n\n- Added the Patio, a 3.75m muncrete slab that\u0027s useful for making landing pads and foundations for bases on uneven terrain. You can clip slabs together to form larger areas. To use it, bolt it into the ground NOTE: This is an experimental part, use at your own risk.\n\n- Added the M1A1 Mountain Goat. The M1A1 can switch between a wide wheelbase for normal driving, and a narrow wheelbase to get in and out of cargo bays. And to top it off, it has sound effects if you have the Wheel Sounds mod installed. Thanks for the suggestion, Supermarine! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- Added the Tundra 200 and Tundra 400. These are conformal storage tanks for the Buffalo that are intended for ground and aerospace craft. Unlike the Wagon, they do not expand, but you can attach other parts to them.\n\nGold Digger\n\n- Lowered EC requirements for the Gold Digger to reflect its lower efficiency compared to the stock Drill-O-Matic.\n\nBuffalo Command Cab\n\n- Increased storage slots slightly.\n\nInterim Rover Wheel\n\n- The existing stock-based rover wheel has been deprecated in favor of the new M1A1 Mountain Goat. Be sure to retrofit your rovers.\n\nOther\n\n- Moved the Mineshaft, Capstone, and Switchback to the Structural tab (they are still found under the Pathfinder category as well).\n\n- Moved the part config files to the new Parts directory, organized by tab. Textures and mesh files remain in the Assets folder.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n- The greenhouse will now retain its resources when you switch away from the vessel and switch back.\n\n- The Spyglass can now attach KAS pipes.\n\n- The Watney Rainmaker no longer complains about a lack of Oxidizer or MonoPropellant (you might need to transfer some into the Doc).\n\n- Fixed GeoEnergy resource distribution for Eeloo.

But the engine effects are where I want them, and the hover system is working, though it tends to rev the engines. For an initial release that\u0027s ok, but I want a steady engine thrust. It also has issues with holding its pitch, but that too can be overcome with some finesse. And You can\u0027t just strap the wings on your back via KIS and fly away; I haven\u0027t figured out how to point straight with stability assist because kerbals on EVA don\u0027t \u0022fly\u0022 the same as an aircraft. And I am cleaning up the context menu...  \n\nAll that said, it flies, it can hover, it can make precision landings thanks to its RCS thrusters, and you can switch between LiquidFuel/IntakeAir for great range on Kerbin and Laythe, or MonoPropellant for mediocre range on Duna and Eve. And it has accessories that can be attached via KIS. Hopefully it is a worthy successor to the discontinued KerbolQuest winged jet pack...  \n\nI\u0027ll be needing test pilots soon... :)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T19:27:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whizzkid","CreatedById":126892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T15:48:40Z","Content":"Does this work ok with 1.0.5?

It also hovers, complete with jet engine-powered RCS for precision landings. The approach may lead to other parts in the future...  \n\nI was testing things out over the weekend; it\u0027s definitely flyable and has pretty good range. Some compromises had to be made though; the wing has a parachute accessory, but I haven\u0027t had any luck making it useable as an individual KIS part that you can strap to your back and jump out of an aircraft with. If you strap it to the back of the wing, however, you\u0027re fine. The initial prototype will take some creativity to use properly (hence the experimental stripes on the top of the wing), but hopefully later revisions will improve things. That\u0027s where I\u0027m needing help. Ideal test pilots will be unafraid to dive into the config files and tweak values to test performance improvements and then post their results.

It works similarly to a command seat; just drop it on the ground (be careful, some terrain is explosive), right-click to board it, then rotate upright. Alternately, bolt it to the side of a craft, board, and decouple. The wing can be used on any planet with an atmosphere thanks to its monopropellant-powered jet engines. Just don\u0027t expect terrific range, unless you switch to liquid fuel and fly in an oxygenated atmosphere like Kerbin or Laythe. JetWing is inspired by JetMan Yves Rossy and the defunct KerbolQuest winged jetpack. The JetWing and its accessories work best with Kerbal Inventory System and either GoodSpeed Fuel Pump or TAC Fuel Balancer.  \n\nIn addition to the Jetwing, this release also introduces the M1A2 Grizzly, a larger wheel than the Mountain Goat that has a wider wheelbase and better traction. This all comes at the expense of not being able to enter and exit Mk3 cargo bays, however.  \n\nFinally, there were some big changes to OSE Workshop and the Community Resource Pack recently, and Pathfinder has been updated to reflect the changes. You might find prospecting a lucrative business if you bring stuff home...  \n\nNOTE: Due to changes in OSE Workshop, you can no longer switch between MaterialKits and RocketParts. However, the Ironworks still has converters that switch between   \n\nRocketParts and MaterialKits. Additionally, OSE Workshop\u0027s changes now require ExoticMinerals and RareMetals for some parts, so plan accordingly.  \n\nNew Parts  \n\n- Added the M1A2 Grizzly.  \n\n- Added the JetWing.   \n\n- Added the JetWing Drop Tank. Works great with Good Speed Fuel Pump or TAC Fuel Balancer.  \n\n- Added the JetWing Parachute. Like the Outback, it can be attached to the JetWing.  \n\n- Added the JetWing Cargo Pallet.

It isn\u0027t as efficient as the converter in the Clockworks but it gets the job done.  \n\nBug Fixes  \n\n- The Greenhouse will now properly account for the current crewmember residing in the module.  \n\n- If you have Extraplanetary Launchpads installed, when making RocketParts, excess ScrapMetal will be dumped instead of halting RocketPart creation.  \n\n- The Smoke Pipe should inflate properly now, and its active cooling can be enabled/disabled.  \n\nOther  \n\n- Updated to latest CRP  \n\n- Updated to latest OSE Workshop.  \n\n- Adjusted maximum stored resources by module.

In my last install, the Wild Blue Industries mod was more of an alternative parts pack for MKS / OKS (which I loved), containing all of the same functionality with fewer and (IMHO) better looking parts. Now, more than a year later, it appears that this has gone on to develop its own identity, which is great, but since I\u0027m looking to develop more permanent bases (my current career goal is to plant a permanent colony on every solid body), for which MKS is designed, I\u0027m wondering if there is any integration between the two.
