(Most delaval nozzles are optimised for specific phases of the flight - except the SSME\u0027s, who have a \u0027trick\u0027 to improve ISP at sea level pressures - but it made the nozzles heavier)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the same well engineered aerospike engine is not supposed to outperform ISP wise standard nozzles - the best aerospike will end up having more or less the same ISP when firing at the same altitude a dedicated nozzle operates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the nozzle will underperform at other altitudes / pressures than what it was made for - while the aerospike will continue to be as efficient as the nozzle made for this altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, while you save on structural weight thanks to an aerospike not needing a huge nozzle, they have a much more complicated plumbing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E - so more costly to devellop and build (as you need an even fuel burn all around the spike) - and that would only help for a mere 1 to 2 minutes while the rocket is operating while in dense atmosphere. (So, let\u0027s balance a costly engine which will help lower a bit your fuel consumption VS a vacuum optimised nozzle during the early stage of flight, towards the cost of a bit of additional fuel to keep your vacuum engine fire long enough (for rockets using solid boosters around vacuum optimised engines, like Ariane V or the space shuttle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikolay-spb","CreatedById":135182,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T13:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esgt_flyert thanks for good explanation, so the pressure was key.
