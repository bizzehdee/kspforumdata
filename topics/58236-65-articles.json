KSPI is what is known as \u0022Hard SciFi\u0022. It\u0027s very firmly inspired by real science, but many of the things it does are just past the realm of tested science and into the realm of hypothesis and near-fiction. Nothing wrong with that; in fact I quite like it! I love to see what\u0027s just over the horizon technologically, what would happen if hypothesis became tested practice. It\u0027s also fine to take some liberties like improving the tested stats to make it game-viable without game-breaking. But when it comes to these liberties, we will all, always, have to agree to disagree when we see things differently.

As an engineer, I see that as, if not cheating, a pointless mod for myself. No offense to those who would rather focus on flying missions, but my joy is in seeing the craft I built work beautifully, and if it\u0027s all just a prefab \u0027magic box\u0027 part, then how is it my creation? I never followed directions for lego sets as a kid, because if I did then it wouldnt have been my creation! So that is my KSP. If yours is different, that\u0027s fine. More than fine, it\u0027s great! You probably fly more missions and go more places than I do, typically holed up in the VAB/SPH for hours on end perfecting every aspect.

Rate of reaction is another matter entirely, but the KSP-Interstellar refineries actually work at quite a slow pace (it will take MONTHS in time-warp to fill a large rocket). And, I have to remind you, whenever we\u0027re talking scale, everything in KSP is 50% scale. so if it\u0027s 2.5 meters in Interstellar, it\u0027s 5 meters in real life. In a 5 meter refinery you can EASILY fit a decent-sized Sabatier. If a unit to serve a handful of astronauts (and by the way, even that unit could produce a rather substantial volume of methane over the course of a few months, if provided with enough CO2/H2O and electricity- the unit on the ISS only operates at a *fraction* of its rated capacity...) is only the size of a *mini* fridge (not a full-sized fridge, let\u0027s get this straight), then one taking up, say, a third of the volume of a 5 meter refinery, could work a lot faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in KSP-Interstellar, size DOES matter.

Especially when what\u0027s in KSP-Interstellar goes beyond merely plausible- most of this stuff has been the subject of extensive engineering studies PROVING its viability- and there are just certain missing materials or devices that we need to wait to be developed, but are sure will one day be around. The exception to this, of course, is the warp drive- but even NASA took that seriously enough to decide to encourage the scientists who were looking into it with a little conceptual art...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t play with mods like the 4-piece shuttles by the way. I often spend hours in the VAB/SPH as well. But for the sake of my poor old CPU, merging 9 or 10 different pieces of SMALL ISRU equipment into a single refinery part is probably a good idea. And like I said, FractalUK has given some thought to possibly making it tweakable in the future as to what the loud-out is of a given ISRU refinery...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, shoot me a PM- what\u0027s the status of that integration config?

If it were a separate part, it should come in two sizes- a large and a small variant, with the larger variant being more powerful for its mass to reflect reality (REALLY BIG fuel tanks should need multiple large units, and would thus fail to benefit further, though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe balance of cooling requirements also needs to be account for the Square-Cube law and tank geometry- i.e. cooling requirements should be proportional either to tank Surface Area (if there is a way to find that directly) or the 2/3rd power of tank volume (the exponent at which heat leakage scales- boil-off is proportional *both* to heat leakage and the available surface area for fuel to leak through, and thus the 4/9th rather than 2/3rd power though...) And cooling a tank should reduce (to about 1/10,000th the normal rate) but not eliminate boil-off, like in real life- so larger tanks would still experience relatively less boil-off, and tanks of any finite size could still not hold cryogenic fuel indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final note- saying heat leakage scales with the 2/3rd power of tank volume is a *very* rough approximation, even with a cuboidal or cylindrical fuel tank. This is because fuel tanks are essentially pressure vessels (internal pressure vs. vacuum of space), and their walls become thicker the relatively less surface area they have for their volume (this is also why their mass scales linearly with volume, rather than with the Square-Cube Law). So larger tanks not only have relatively less surface area, they also have thicker tank walls- which are inherently better at insulating the fuel (a 2-inch thick aluminum sheet is a better insulator than an aluminum sheet a few cm thick...) And if you add actual insulation (most real fuel tanks have at least a little light added insulation), the insulation mass is spread over a relatively smaller surface area- which means the same relative mass of insulation will be coated on in a thicker or larger number of (thus more effective) layers... In short- heat leakage scales at *LESS* than the 2/3rd power of volume...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E One of the subtle, and not-so-obvious consequences of scaling heat leakage with the 2/3rd power of tank volume, and overall boil-off with the 4/9th power, is than two 1000 L tanks laid end-to-end actually experience slightly more boil-off than a double-length tank with 2000 L volume. This is actually both expected and accurate/realistic- the longer tank would actually have thicker outer walls than the shorter tanks. Taken to an extreme, compare the wall thickness of, say, a single monolithic tank, and a honeycomb structure of smaller tanks with the same total volume (remember, tank mass scales linearly with volume- and larger tanks require thicker walls) to see drastic differences in outer wall thickness...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T22:42:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T22:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Felbourn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Felbourn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2_rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ereading about the V2\u003C/a\u003E and saw it used 75% ethanol and 25% water for fuel.
