different approach, a Vertical launch, horizontal landing SSTO... payload fraction wasn\u0027t as good because it needs a TWR\u0026gt;1 to lift off, but it worked reasonably well and could accomodate

tested it on Kerbin (as best as I could... at high altitudes), I save file edited my way to Duna, and it flew there (with 1 version of the electric propulsion, it could barely maintain altitude at 5km, and a buffed version allowed it to maintain altitude at 9km.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flew well enough (though there were some things that didn\u0027t work as well as I expected, I decided to just let it be... mainly the lift fans aren\u0027t very useful, now that the thrust scales with atmospheric pressure, similar pre 1.0 deigns could pop chutes and use the lift fans for vertical landings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was satisfied, and needed to get this thing to orbit and then duna....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce its in orbit, its simple enough to have a claw tug take it to Duna... but how was I going to get this thing to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe electric propulsion has a hard limit of mach 0.95, and a terrible TWR... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has no

in the way of lifting surfaces, a very good TWR, and everything needed to deorbit and return. After a few test flights to make sure they attain orbit easily, and land easily enough, I made it into a subassembly attached with the pylon that leaves nothing on the part it was attached to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried slinging two of these under the wings of my electric plane... but it wasn\u0027t sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 3rd one on top, some use of the offset tool to get the center of thrust in a good position, and I had my payload in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now plan on using them as strap on supplemental boosters for a variety of things. their CoL and CoT are already balanced, so I should be able to stick them on something (that already flies well) without much precision needed in their placement (aside from Center of thrust considerations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard of some people making reusable boosters, but often this is in the form of a suborbital booster, or a single SSTO booster with a top mounted payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I haven\u0027t seen people doing strap on SSTOs as boosters, or doing anything like this for getting oddly shaped payloads to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurely some of you have, and I just haven\u0027t seen it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave any pictures?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in 0.24, I had some strap on SSTO Rapier boosters for a similar electric plane for duna, but they weren\u0027t winged, and just came down on chutes, hopefuly near KSC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping to get some bigger designs... Its already going to be a pain to land those 3... bigger payloads would result in a lot of SSTOs to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I want fewer, bigger strap on SSTOs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also want designs with some more nodes so I can add turbojets for better static TWR (I imagine many payloads will require a vertical launch and \u0026gt;1.0 TWR)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T19:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShowcase thread moved to Spacecraft Exchange.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
