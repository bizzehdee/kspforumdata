The flavor text for that one says \u0022We now understand the procedure of a powered landing with probes, but the real test for a manned Mun mission is a manned powered landing on Kerbin\u0022. Clearly it was meant to follow the previous one.

Otherwise you have to take a crew report, keep it, go EVA, take reports, store experiments, re-board vessel (assuming you want to store a number of reports). Whereas previously, since you were already EVA to get the biome-specific reports, all you had to do was right-click the command pod and select \u0022store experiments\u0022, then wait for the next biome. Really a six-of-one, half-a-dozen-of-the-other argument for myself. I suppose it suits different playstyles differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to the contracts pack, it would be nice if the unmanned and manned contracts actually said in the description text something along the lines of \u0022send a probe\u0022 or \u0022a manned flight\u0022. Not all of them mention this. Perhaps I don\u0027t understand how the contracts system works, but I got the contract for \u0022powered landing\u0022 (not accepted, just showing in the list), but next time I looked, it was gone and had been replaced by \u0022fly by Minmus and Kerbol\u0022. I don\u0027t recall doing a powered landing with no parachutes on my ship, so I don\u0027t see why this contract should have vanished. I also don\u0027t quite understand the \u0022Minmus and Kerbol\u0022 unmanned contract. All I\u0027ve done so far in my game is a Mun flyby and Mun orbit. This contract wants me to fly a ship (a probe actually, although that\u0027s not mentioned in the contract) to Minmus, gather science, then leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI and orbit the sun, gather science and I\u0027m guessing I\u0027m meant to transmit this science back to KSC, since it\u0027d be difficult if not impossible to retrieve an early probe that\u0027s orbiting the sun. I\u0027m really far away from this capability, since I\u0027m using Remote Tech and I have yet to set up any type of satellite network, especially one that\u0027s capable of transmitting from outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI. As far as progression goes, perhaps it would be better if this contract simply requested science data from a Minmus flyby or orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Looking at the contracts again, the one that vanished for me (unmanned) \u0022Kerbin Powered Landing!\u0022 appears that it was supposed to be followed by the manned contract, \u0022Manned Kerbin Landing!\u0022. The flavor text for that one says \u0022We now understand the procedure of a powered landing with probes, but the real test for a manned Mun mission is a manned powered landing on Kerbin\u0022. Clearly it was meant to follow the previous one. However, as I said, the unmanned one vanished from the list of available contracts, so this line of progression appears to be broken for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you are missing this mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119971\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119971\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt automatically stores crew reports into the science container without the EVA dance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManned and unmanned SETIcontracts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManned contracts say so in the title/description, if there is no such specification, contracts can be completed by probes and manned vessels. Attempting an unspecified contracts with a manned vessel is mostly a bad habit from stock, no space agency would send a manned mission if that is not part of the requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I wanted to keep the contracts as open as possible. So if users really want to send a manned mission for such a contract, they can do so. It would not be logical that they have to EVA the kerbal to complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowered Kerbin Landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI m not sure why the landing contract disappeared, but generally try declining 2 and 3 star contracts if you are missing SETI contracts. It is a ksp limitation that I can not force them to show up, if the 2 and 3 star slots are blocked by other contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you did not accept the powered landing contract, it should become available and stay so until completed. If declining other 2 star contracts does not bring it back, please upload your savegame, I ll try to find out what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus\u0026amp;Kerbol:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaving Kerbin SoI (thus reaching high Kerbol orbit) only requires about 100 more deltaV than a Mun intercept, so should be comparable to getting to space low above the Mun. You can do a Minmus gravity assist (though the dV saved is miniscule) to complete the mission in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only limitation is the RemoteTech connection. But with basicScience and SETIctt, you already get the KR-7 dish (which is needed for Mun anyway). That one has a range of 90Mm, while Kerbin SoI ends at less than 85Mm (when high Kerbol begins).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially you should be able to complete the Minmus\u0026amp;Kerbol mission with about the same craft, which you used for the Mun flyby mission (provided you used a KR-7 on that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt mostly a matter of getting rid of bad stock habits/limitations in thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Landwalker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Landwalker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERoger. Thanks for clarifying on both counts. \u003Cp\u003EI do like the \u0022different kerbals have different specialties\u0022 \u003Cem\u003Econcept\u003C/em\u003E, but not always the way it\u0027s implemented\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthe way leveling/XP works, the fact that by stock untrained engineers are basically deadweight (at least Pilots can use SAS and Scientists can collect and reset observation experiments). Having specialist kerbals gives a sense of a group being an actual crew where everybody has their particular roles, instead of just being clones of each other. Hopefully when 1.1 rolls around the Kerbal \u0022Class System\u0022 will be much improved. At least, I can hope. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll stay away from RealFuels and any parallels for now and just stick with the stock fuels, imbalance and all. If it gets too much on my nerves, maybe at some point I\u0027ll sit down and hammer out what the fuel situation \u0022should be,\u0022 but for now I think I\u0027m okay.

They only made it worse with every version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the experiments, I d say give it a try. It is certainly something to get used to, but as from the response above, in many cases we just got accustomed to bad stock habits/gameplay/incentives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, I removed the partial values from mystery goo and science jr and so on.
