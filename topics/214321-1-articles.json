I.E. the physical properties change. For example: Attitude will continue to rotate, or electrical charge of a battery decrease or increase, and will continue through a time warp the same amount as they would in normal time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNon-Physics Time Warp = Simply, the physicals parameters will not change during the Time Warp. I.E. Your initial physical conditions will stay constant. For example: Initial Attitude or the electrical charge of a battery will remain the same at the end of the Time Warp as they were at the the beginning. Only your relative location will change along your orbit path.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first will add processing burden to accomplish since the propagator algorithm has to recalculate all the parameter values as each iteration step of the way. The second, reduces the processing amount since it only has to re-calculate the position change at the end of the Time Warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cosmus","CreatedById":227070,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-09T15:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you, that helped a lot!

Time warp is \u201Con rails\u201D- the vessel is fixed as a single object (no wobbling parts) and physics calculations aren\u2019t done so you could set up an encounter with Jool\u2019s atmosphere, go to the tracking station and time warp right through without the vessel slowing down since the atmospheric drag is never calculated. You can\u2019t activate time warp while moving on a planetary body\u2019s surface or flying in an atmosphere, only physics warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
