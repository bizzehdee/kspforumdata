You specify that this mod requires Extraplanetary Launchpads for one of the parts to work.

This part does nothing otherwise. In my testing I built a mun city with survey stakes and had MKS installed. An MKS colony control center provided the construction pad. It will work with any other launchpad too. I provided parts which let you use the original 3 step system from EPL with MKS installed as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaser Drill: Can mine Ore\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaser Smelter: Convert Ore to Metal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECnc Mill: Convert Metal to rocket parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction Drone: Increases the productivity of the ship by 30.
