It\u0027s why farther objects appear to move slower than nearer objects when you are in a car). You can tell how far the celestial object is away from you by using things like Cephid variables which have a given absolute magnitude, so you can tell how far it is by how dim it appears.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T16:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, aircraft use differential pressure to measure their air speed, I think that is what the OP was referring to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the space shuttle, inertial navigation units provide both velocity and location measurements.

Further out than that, I believe standard practice is to use a combination of celestial observations (planets and such) and Earth-based measurements with radar or radio transponders (sorta like radar, but the signal that goes back to Earth is amplified by electronics on the spacecraft, not just a passive reflection). Radar on board the spacecraft is normally only used for short-range work like rendezvous, because long-range radar takes rather a lot of electrical power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
