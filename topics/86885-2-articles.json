Main problem is that I also need a dedicated rigidbody. My vision is that a part can define a number of transforms (by name and offset from their position) which are possible anchor points for some other parts/modules (or Kerbals) also listed. The AS plugin would then inject a gameobject with a rigidgbody at this position and link to it. This way the models don\u0027t have to change in Unity every time. And we also get very proper targeting since the position desn\u0027t have to be sorcered from weird mouse positions. I\u0027m on it but still have a long way to go to be honest. I\u0027m pretty sure it should be possible, but if not I\u0027ll resort to requiring what Kipard suggested: adding an empty gameobject at the proper position as a child in Unity and I\u0027ll just add a rigidbody to it once needed, this should work almost certainly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u0027m not planning on making this feature standalone though, since I want to resuse a bunch of code which logically belongs to AS. However, bundling only the plugin is fine with me and I can certainly add a config option to turn of unwanted features (there is a bunch of them already anyway), so you shouldn\u0027t have a problem since dll sizes are practically irrelevant anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlightly confuse but hopefully useful \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T17:20:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried this because of the Modding Monday article, but the EVA tether problem happens always not at random, and when I added these struts to a rocket and went to launch the game froze with the message \u0022Waiting for Unity to catch up\u0022 displayed.
