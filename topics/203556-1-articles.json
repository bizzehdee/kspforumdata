I think we\u0027ll get a dev diary before two months. But I don\u0027t see the next feature video happening before then. To the best\u00A0 of my knowledge we don\u0027t know how many feature videos are left, but I imagine there\u0027s one for colonies and one for multiplayer. If two more is the bare minimum, and we assume the game\u0027s release date is the first half of 2022, it most likely will be longer than two months before we get the next video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-05T22:59:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNate mentioned in the interview posted recently to the thread that he couldn\u0027t say much about multiplayer as there was something being prepared for a discussion coming soon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"intelliCom","CreatedById":209738,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-07T05:39:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect sometime within a month, and sometime within a month.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WelshSteW","CreatedById":202966,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-08T17:57:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nae we getting a new show and tell today?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-09T15:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224001514\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203556\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221625767075\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022202966\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WelshSteW\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, WelshSteW said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nae we getting a new show and tell today?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tenor.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022113.64\u0022 height=\u0022250\u0022 width=\u0022220\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.tenor.com/images/e2633389b1156dc40bf856a342806ae3/tenor.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
