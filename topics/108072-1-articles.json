In addition, the manouver node editor helps you to set them up with more precision. And of course the ascent guidance, but as this one comes with \u0022Unmanned Tech\u0022, we will have to do a lot of launches manually, as science points are rare at the beginning of a hard career.)\n\n TranferWindowPlaner (To see the launch windows to other planets)\n\nKerbalAlarmClock (To keep track of the launch windows and or vessels)\n\nSo, it all starts with our first vessel , named \u0022Hopper-1\u0022, based on the RT-5 \u0022Flea\u0022 Solid Rocket Booster. We could also gather some science at the runway and on the launchpad first and start with the RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022, but then I would feel sorry for the guy at SQUAD, who designed the \u0022Flea\u0022, if I never use it at all.\n\nInfo for new players: Right click on the engine when in the VAB and set its thrust limiter to about 20, so we get a TWR of about 1.7 at lift off. A longer, weaker acceleration should be more efficient than a short strong one, due to the drag.\n\nOh, and don\u0027t forget to get the contracts \u0022Launch your first vessel\u0022 and \u0022Gather scientific data from Kerbin\u0022\n\nWe don\u0027t have to activate SAS on this one, just launch it, rotate it a few degrees to the east and it will fly a nice curve on its own.\n\nWhile in flight, we use one of the two goo containers, and take a crew report. After splashdown in the water to the east, we take another crew report, run the second goo experiment and take an eva report while flying over the water (hanging on the capsules), and one in the water (or standing on the vessel).\n\nFor new players: As we already have a crew report stored in our capsule, we have to do an eva, take the data out of the capsule and store it there again, then we can do a new one. Same goes for the EVA reports. Take one while hanging on the capsule, store it in the capsule, then you can take a second one while standing on the capsule.\n\n![B7EFF3D80D1266EB36CF25A203B659DFC99FEB69](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290585853090/B7EFF3D80D1266EB36CF25A203B659DFC99FEB69/)\n\nThis diary might become more interesting, when we start designing vessels for tourist contracts around Mun and Minmus and vessels for interplanetary travels.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nTime for our second vessel:\n\nAs we spent our research points, we now have the more powerful RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 engine (don\u0027t forget to set its thrust limiter for a TWR of about 1.7) and the materials lab, we can launch or second vessel named \u0022Hopper-2\u0022.\n\nOne materials lab for flight in lower atmosphere, one for being in the water. This time we take the crew report \u0022in-flight\u0022, that we missed the last time. So as we took one above \u0022Shores\u0022 with the Hopper-1, we take one above \u0022Water\u0022 now.\n\nSame procedure as last time, we launch without SAS and tilt it to the east by about 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and let it fly on its own.\n\nThis flight we reached an altitude record of 7,500m, a distance of 11km from KSC and a speed record of over 300m/s.\n\n![0C34E719F55A54F4C7E144BE4856C8FBB95CCFBD](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290585886963/0C34E719F55A54F4C7E144BE4856C8FBB95CCFBD/)\n\nLet\u0027s make it bigger: As we\u0027re gathering more and more science we can create a vessel \u0022Hopper-3\u0022 based on the BACC \u0022Thumper\u0022 Engine now. We have a materials lab and a goo container on board, hopefully we reach an altitude of more than 18km, so that we can take high atmosphere samples, as well as a crew report from up there. Notice the single goo container on the right? It actually creates an imbalance which forces our vessel into a curve to the east on its own. However, during the flight we had to do some minor inputs to keep it from turning too fast, otherwise we would have missed the upper atmosphere (18km) by a few hundred meters.\n\nUsing this vessel we\u0027ve set a speed record of 450m/s, a land distance of 28km, an altitude record of 11.5km and gathered some upper atomosphere science as well.\n\n![144AD828E3417AF93E30A209C3FE14D760DA6BCD](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290585914687/144AD828E3417AF93E30A209C3FE14D760DA6BCD/)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHaving 34.5 science right now, we\u0027re 9.5 science points short of getting access to the LV909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 engine, so let\u0027s do some science at the launchpad and on the runway. One EVA report while \u0022flying\u0022 over shores (hanging on the capsule) and one EVA report on the ground, as well as a materials lab and goo experiment for both the runway and the launchpad.\n\n![6DE21D11BED760B71CA6684C421F69DBD1FA171F](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290585935734/6DE21D11BED760B71CA6684C421F69DBD1FA171F/)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAs we could now build an orbiter, able to achieve an apoapsis of more than 250km (high orbit) we need an heat shield to protect our materials labs during reentry, however we need more science points to get acces to that technology. Right now we have 10.1 science points available, and we would need 15. So we could either build a small hopper, flying to the grassland in the west or the shores in the south, or we could explore the KSC buildings. However, I\u0027d like to do those things in one run, as soon as we have the wheels from the \u0022Aviation\u0022 science node, so we just create another vessel leaving the atmosphere (above 70km) without going into orbit. The slower velocity during reentry should protect our materials lab below our capsule and give us enough science for the heat-shield.\n\nAs always we take off without SAS, and let the vessel turn by itself due to the single goo container, but activate SAS this time after we turned about 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to the east, so we get a high altitude with a low horizontal velocity.\n\n![AF0C37A2CCB87E72AA592A4556A758492334F14A](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290585986856/AF0C37A2CCB87E72AA592A4556A758492334F14A/)\n\n![62A2650E898FABAC2CADB4FFB57D5634A27CF058](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290585987132/62A2650E898FABAC2CADB4FFB57D5634A27CF058/)"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:07:04Z","Content":"Time to launch into a stable orbit:\n\nOur vessel is based on a LV-T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022 engine in the first and a LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 in the second stage.

Try to point horizontal when reaching an apoapsis of 60km.\n\nAs soon as the target apoapsis is reached (I usually go for 75-80km) turn off the engine an wait for approaching the apoapsis. Few seconds before reaching the apoasis burn horizontal, and watch your apoasis in the map view. If the apoapsis moves away from your vessel cut off the engine and wait for appraoching it again. If you\u0027re going to overtake the apoapsis point a little into the sky, which makes the apoapsis move ahead of your vessel again:\n\n![5D81DF0E5D83179A0A490C57744D2B8B105E2D78](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290586109070/5D81DF0E5D83179A0A490C57744D2B8B105E2D78/)\n\nAs we\u0027ve had enough fuel on board we can get into a high orbit (\u003E250km) to get some more science points.\n\n![7C2641BEA9BAAF9E11D07970BBE466C1DBA59ECD](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290586109586/7C2641BEA9BAAF9E11D07970BBE466C1DBA59ECD/)\n\nAt the apoapsis we burn retrograde to decrease the periapsis to about 28km for a save reentry, but not before we checked the mission control building for a \u0022Return to Kerbin from Orbit\u0022 contract. At the beginning we need all the money we can get in a hard career.\n\n![6B7482B107C73B245354074F3E4026C269E8B377](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290586127824/6B7482B107C73B245354074F3E4026C269E8B377/)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNow that\u0027s a precise landing after returning from orbit.

For the orbit flights we also got a \u0022Science data from space around Kerbin\u0022, as well as a \u0022Test LV-T45 engine at launch site\u0022 contracts. As I said before, money is pretty important at the beginning, as we have quite some buildings to upgrade. We landed in the desert west of KSV this time, so we were able to get some more science data from there, temp from flight and surface, as well as the crew reports and eva reports from flight and surface of the desert, which leaves us with enough science to unlock \u0022Stablility\u0022 and \u0022Aviation\u0022.\n\nTime to build a rover to visit all the KSC buildings, as well as the shore biome to the north and the grassland biome to the west. Oh and don\u0027t leave out that small stripe of tundra between the shore and grassland biomes to the north.\n\nIt\u0027s not really a rover, it\u0027s acutally an airplane without wings. This is a job for our scientist Bob, as he is able to restore the materials lab and goo container after collecting the data, so we can get everything in one run.\n\n![3A066BFE5F5E019D7F28C1990D364E311551A245](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290586223122/3A066BFE5F5E019D7F28C1990D364E311551A245/)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWoohoo, 120.5 science points gathered.\n\nA new \u0022World\u0027s First\u0022 contract is available: \u0022Fly by the Mun\u0022. \n\nBut first think about the available upgrades for the buildings: \n\nThe launch pad (150,000) would give us the chance to build bigger rockets with a mass over 18 tons.\n\nThe Astronaut complex (150,000) would allow us to do EVAs, to gather even more science points.\n\nThe Tracking station (300,000) allows us to see \u0022patched conics\u0022, so we wouldn\u0027t be flying blind, when trying to get to the Mun. Fly by and orbit around the mun will be possible without patched conics, but we will need them in order to do rescue contracts, which will reward us with quite some money as well as a new Kerbal for free.\n\nAs we only have 410,000 available we will delay that decision as long as possible, and try a blind fly by the Mun first."},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T21:18:04Z","Content":"For our Mun Fly-By vessel we\u0027re aiming to have a d/v of about 5,000m/s in total. About 4,000m/s to get into Kerbin orbit, about 850m/s to get to the Mun, and 150m/s for course corrections to get back into a reentry orbit.\n\nOur design gives us 5,035m/s according to Engineer Redux. The two \u0022Flea\u0022 boosters are placed in order to start with a higher TWR (but only 129m/s), as the first liquid fuel stage only gives us a TWR of 1.42.\n\nWe use a launch stability enhancer on that mission (you can only see its shadow), as we got a contract to test one at launch.\n\n![0D8D400FC91FB5591126A9653E747104B191638B](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389290586345489/0D8D400FC91FB5591126A9653E747104B191638B/)\n\nWe made it into orbit with 1,411m/s left, so it took us only 3,624m/s to get into orbit.\n\nSo let\u0027s wait until the Mun appears just over the horizon an burn prograde, until our orbit ends slightly below Mun\u0027s orbit. We don\u0027t want to get too close to the Mun, as we only want to do a fly-by, and don\u0027t want the Mun to change our orbit too much, as we can\u0027t see the result of the influence without patched conics.\n\n![52C38E7D2F2AF75B5E3DE662963C771C50202BF8](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375426301517/52C38E7D2F2AF75B5E3DE662963C771C50202BF8/)\n\n![30058B341DAE768D44122CA2060E2764CC4C120A](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375426300344/30058B341DAE768D44122CA2060E2764CC4C120A/)\n\n![FFDA2A89A9E6B8B65F30C14B9194ABF9FA1D5640](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375426446147/FFDA2A89A9E6B8B65F30C14B9194ABF9FA1D5640/)\n\nHmm, that\u0027s what I wanted to avoid, our orbit after leaving Mun\u0027s SOI is much more energetic than before. Thinking about it, I think I should have tried to be intercepted by the Mun at a higher point, so that the leaving vector goes just along the Mun\u0027s orbit...

However we should have a bit more dv for this one, as I\u0027m not sure whether I can reproduce such a nice ascent into Kerbin orbit. For this task I\u0027d like to use the \u0022Poodle\u0022 and \u0022Skipper\u0022 engines, however we\u0027re about 10 science points short of getting all the required technology. (General Construction, Heavyer Rocketry, Fuel Systems)\n\nSo let\u0027s go for another science gathering mission on Kerbin. Our targets this time are the highlands and mountains to the west, as well as the desert at the southern tip of the continent.

Getting to the Mun is not that much of a problem without the patched conics, but for leaving Mun\u0027s SOI I\u0027d like to have them, to see how our resulting Kerbin orbit will be.

I did the same \u0022hopper\u0022 kind of vessel (except I named them \u0022Exploiter\u0022s ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) and just tonight did the plane runaround of KSC (nice mention of the crew report stacking trick btw, I\u0027ve been playing for like 200h\u002B total and I didn\u0027t know that lol). I\u0027m playing without saving and reverting (and mod-less) so I build my vessels in career and use a separate sandbox profile to test and practice on them before launching (and when a kerbal dies or is stranded I restart - so far I\u0027ve restarted 3 times ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)).\n\nA couple of questions: What do you think of the minor contracts? From what I can tell, you\u0027re skipping most of them, as am I. They seem to cost more than they\u0027re worth and it also seems a lot more efficient to just go for the major steps (orbits, flybys etc.). How far did you get in your previous hard careers?\n\nBy the way, that Mun flyby without patched conics is scary - I do it manually, by eyeballing the lead angle and I had no idea that it wouldn\u0027t even show me the encounter, the first time. In the two times I tried it outside of sandbox, I got a 12.5km and 16km periapsis and the first time I panicked when I left the Mun SOI and despite having enough fuel to return, I managed to waste it trying to reduce my re-entry speed and got Valentina stranded ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). Re-entry heating so far has no been an issue, even when entering at 3.3km/s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T03:32:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 03:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MechaLynx**"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:01:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E *Not sure if it\u0027s ok to reply to this kind of thread - if it\u0027s inappropriate I\u0027ll delete the post*\n\nOf course it\u0027s okay, i\u0027ve been waiting for a reply.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What do you think of the minor contracts? From what I can tell, you\u0027re skipping most of them, as am I. They seem to cost more than they\u0027re worth and it also seems a lot more efficient to just go for the major steps (orbits, flybys etc.)\n\nI think you would always make some money, even with those minor contracts. As soon as the contracts request something like Kerbin or Mun orbit, they reward you a nice amount of money. But I try to avoid them, because they\u0027re boring to do. However, if I have to make a flight anyway, I\u0027m trying to get some sidecontracts, which I can do on the flight.\n\nWhen waiting for the Duna launch window, I think I\u0027m gonna do some tourist contracts with a vessel capable of a Kerbin-\u003EMun-\u003EMinmus-\u003EKerbin tour. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E How far did you get in your previous hard careers?\n\nIn my last career I had a surface outpost on Duna, a vessel that visited Ike\u0027s surface was waiting in orbit for a return window to Kerbin, a space station around Eve and a station on its way to Jool.\n\nHere\u0027s the thread I had posted about my Duna mission: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119440-Ike-sample-return-probe](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119440-Ike-sample-return-probe)."},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:31:14Z","Content":"Nice Duna craft, looks pretty solid compared to what I usually make xD\n\nHave you tried to recover discarded stages?

A shame, since it would help tons in hard mode to save money.\n\nThere\u0027s a mod, that gives you money, if a discarded stage is in atmosphere and contains enough parachuts for a safe touchdown. I used it in 0.9, but I don\u0027t know whether it works in 1.0.2, and I wanted to use as few mods as possible, to see, how well a hard career progreses.\n\nRight now, I quite like it. Back in 0.9 you had to do lots of \u0022test in orbit\u0022 contracts, in order to make the money to upgrade your facilities, now you\u0027re pretty fine due to the large amount of money you get from the \u0022record setting\u0022 contracts in the beginning as well as the \u0022Worlds First\u0022 contracts. However, especially in a career with hard setting, you have to plan the technology nodes and building upgrades very well.\n\nBut now let\u0027s get back to the game, I actually played further yesterday, but I haven\u0027t posted the screenshots yet.\n\nSo after Jeb finished the \u0022Rendevouz two vessels in Orbit\u0022 contract, the \u0022World\u0027s First\u0022 commiteee decided, that it would be time for the first landing on the mun in Kerbal\u0027s history.\n\nBack in the 0.9 days, i usually used a probe for the first mun landing, but as we also got a \u0022place flag on the mun\u0022 contract, Jeb volunteers to set foot on the Mun. Actually, we were able to grab seven contracts, which we should be able to fullfill on our trip to the Mun.\n\n![3BCBFAC2293B6D3D3EEBB9CF63B0AE53B9DEECA9](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375430225480/3BCBFAC2293B6D3D3EEBB9CF63B0AE53B9DEECA9/)\n\nHere\u0027s our rocket, the guys at KSC designed to fullfill this task. Unfortunately we couldn\u0027t upgrade our VAB yet, so we are still limited to 30 parts, which forces us to cut some corners. For example, our landing vessel only contains three landing legs instead of four, three tailfins instead of four, only two solar panels, only three strut connectors to connect the thin upper part to the lower part and so on. Our vessel is not really a beauty, but it will do the job.\n\n![6F99C3D6F19BA56EB99935595CA68D95A2AC742F](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375430241776/6F99C3D6F19BA56EB99935595CA68D95A2AC742F/)\n\nUnfortunately, i feared, that we could run low on fuel, as we \u0022only\u0022 had our final landing stage left when we circulized our orbit around the Mun, so Jeb didn\u0027t want to take the risk of running out of fuel, in order to do the inclination change for the survey contract we gathered. \n\nIn order to save some fuel for the descent, Jeb decided to land on a high elevation, right to the east of the Farside Crater. (Or East Farside Crater? I\u0027m not sure which one it is, but it\u0027s the one with the canyon to the North)\n\nJeb reduced the periapsis as low as possible, und burned retrograde for the final touchdown, when he orbited the surface with an altitude of less than 400 meters above the surface, and landed at an elevation of 3925m above \u0022sea level\u0022.\n\nUnfortunately, Jeb was so occupied by the experience of walking on the Mun and running all those scientific experiments, that he forgot to take a selfie outside his lander, so this is all he got back from there.\n\n![56719D7783F424EC0F27DFF598976A65ADF085D6](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375430242738/56719D7783F424EC0F27DFF598976A65ADF085D6/)\n\nLuckily, our high landing spot together with the fuel saving descent left us with enough fuel, to launch into the correct inclination, to take the survey crew report, in order to fullfill all of our 7 contracts.\n\nNext stop: Minmus!\n\nActually, it\u0027s not a stop, it\u0027s just a flyby, but we\u0027re planning our vessel to have enough fuel, to make it into orbit, in case the \u0022World\u0027s first\u0022 comittee wants us to orbit it right after the flyby.\n\nHere\u0027s the vessel we use for this task, giving us a total delta-v of 4,999m/s. 3600 planned for orbiting kerbin, 950m/s for the intercepting orbit with Minmus, leaving us with about 450m/s to get into Minmus orbit and back to Kerbin, in case we get that contract. Two Material bays (SC-9001 Science Jr., especially new players often ask what a materials bay is, as the name had been changed some time ago) and too goo containers, so can run both, high and low orbit experiments.\n\n![247A63B91EA30E8CAC3FD89336405CC5B698656B](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375430314185/247A63B91EA30E8CAC3FD89336405CC5B698656B/)\n\nThat trip had been rather boring, so Jeb had been sleeping most of the time, and was very disappointed when word reached him, that the \u0022World\u0027s First\u0022 committee wants to see the first docking procedure in space instead of an orbit around Minmus. Instead of letting someone else do this back at Kerbin, while he travels towards Minmus\u0027s periapsis, Jeb insisted to be part of the vessel docking procedure, so he returned back home. However, some people say, that his launch into Kerbin\u0027s orbit was so inefficient this time, that he wouldn\u0027t have had enough fuel to get into orbit and back to Kerbin afterwards anyway...\n\nSo now, Jeb and Valentina will have their first contract in which they have to work together as a team. The folks at KSC developed a special docking vessel with thrusters mounted to the side of the main structure, so that a docking port could be placed to the bottom of the crew capsule. Here\u0027s the design they came up with:\n\n![BC9BD4DB6055CAA2CD725A3D21F5E1D03B129815](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375430331955/BC9BD4DB6055CAA2CD725A3D21F5E1D03B129815/)\n\nMeeting in orbit was a pretty easy task, but the first vessel reached orbit with only 68m/s of fuel left, so the decision was made to give Valentina\u0027s vessel two additional fuel tanks above the thrusters, in case she has to change her orbit to rendezvouz with Jeb.\n\n![6ABC8F866D837AA2A9892DAEE38E0FAC1951E085](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375430334478/6ABC8F866D837AA2A9892DAEE38E0FAC1951E085/)\n\n![43DE80CB214ED893062A56BA19BB5E41B57019E1](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375430340594/43DE80CB214ED893062A56BA19BB5E41B57019E1/)\n\nThings are going pretty well, and finally the \u0022World\u0027s First\u0022 guys want us to orbit Minmus, so it\u0027s time to get there, using the same vessel Jeb used for the flyby, but without the science experiments.\n\n![E7A13B906B2DEBE11F1E34D74ADEDCEA40DC6F0A](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375430348954/E7A13B906B2DEBE11F1E34D74ADEDCEA40DC6F0A/)\n\nWhile Jeb had been orbiting Minmus, Valentina decided to check out the top of the VAB. There are rumors, that there are landing spots for verticaly launching and landing airplanes, even though our engineers have no idea how this could even be possible. The only thing launching verticaly are rockets, and they are not meant to be used for atmospheric flights, the scientists said.\n\n![386299224C7E97BA1413F71F5EDE8F1CFABD1C07](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389375430355813/386299224C7E97BA1413F71F5EDE8F1CFABD1C07/)\n\nSo the next task will be to land on Minmus, together with the side contracts of planting a flag and bringing back scientific data, but not before Valentina wants to check out some rumors about some kind of ancient structure in the deserts of Kerbin.

In addtion we accepted a contract to put a station into a solar orbit.\n\nAs we only have one Scientist except for Bob, named Caldous Kerman, he will be joined by an engineer, so he won\u0027t be alone in the station.\n\nThe return vehicle (Mk1-2 capsule) is manned by Jeb, Bill, and Bob in order to get a three star rating.\n\nFirst some pictures from the launch. The fuel distribution works as follow: The lower center engine is fueled by the lower outer ones. The upper outer ones are fueled by the center lower tank (they ignite at about 8km altitude, where the Poodles already have nearly the ISP as the Skippers). The upper center one is fueled by the upper outer ones.\n\nAbout the stages:\n\nFirst stage (center lower MainSail \u002B outer lower Skippers): 1202m/s, TWR 1.44\n\nSecond Stage (center lower MainSail \u002B outer upper Poodles): 979m/s, TWR: 1.71\n\nThird stage (all three upper Poodles): 1873m/s, TWR: 1.00\n\nForth stage (center upper Poodle): 2019m/s, TWR: 0.71\n\nSo you can see, during the ascent into orbit(stages 1-3) we always have a TWR \u003E 1. Even though two skippers are replaced by two poodles after the first stage the TWR will still be 1.7 at stage separation, but we\u0027re using the more fuel efficient and have less engine weight using Poodle engines instead of skippers.\n\n![C8C3B89AE12E6C0CD77FCCB58CF8841E167A02DA](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490163153205/C8C3B89AE12E6C0CD77FCCB58CF8841E167A02DA/)\n\n![866DA0476E97300B195B7AA83FDE90F25D88B332](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490163154180/866DA0476E97300B195B7AA83FDE90F25D88B332/)\n\n![D0463B9C3A47D330ED42A4A4F8D6DA36A52FBC2B](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490163154344/D0463B9C3A47D330ED42A4A4F8D6DA36A52FBC2B/)\n\n![D5C3F1AC19134D5A4849F1C8FBD8D45246B71B34](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490163154483/D5C3F1AC19134D5A4849F1C8FBD8D45246B71B34/)\n\n![FECF092F583E6F8E6EF0FF05C4458EDE433A6324](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490163153903/FECF092F583E6F8E6EF0FF05C4458EDE433A6324/)\n\n![F08C84C5505750926F88A8F3E8C8D39B41D5A384](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490163154050/F08C84C5505750926F88A8F3E8C8D39B41D5A384/)\n\nNow the more important part about the mission: As we don\u0027t want the Kerbals to be in the station up there forever, we set a new orbit, which brings the station back into Kerbin\u0027s SOI after 3 years. We can then launch a vessel to pick the guys up.\n\nHINT: By default, the map view only shows the closest encounter for the next orbit. If you want to see later ones, just place a manouver node somewhere (in the picture it\u0027s the one in the upper left) and set it not for the next orbit, but for a later one.

Let\u0027s plan a return using a Mun slingshot to get a reentry course at Kerbin:\n\nHINT: As above, placing additional dummy manouver nodes helps a lot when planing the slingshot. When being still outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, the map view wouldn\u0027t show us our planned orbit after leaving Mun\u0027s SOI. By placing a dummy manouver node into the path within Mun\u0027s SOI (the red one in the picture) you can force the map view to project the path ahead of leaving the SOI.\n\n![CA625B57AE796AFAE15767936F7E14111AEC3ED8](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490163158463/CA625B57AE796AFAE15767936F7E14111AEC3ED8/)\n\nWorked pretty well, even though we will have to make a minor course correction when we\u0027re in Mun\u0027s SOI, in order to get a higher Kerbin periapsis of about 28km.\n\n![62B6F17A4D70958E3B1565738074B7936412EF57](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490163196689/62B6F17A4D70958E3B1565738074B7936412EF57/)"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:50:08Z","Content":"As our last missions took a lot of time, the launch window for Duna comes closer and closer.

We should get a orbiting and maybe a landing on Duna contract after we fullfill the flyby)\n\nOptional, depending on whether we can get enough money until the launch window arrives:\n\nLaunch a return vessel for one of the guys at the Duna surface outpost.\n\nLaunch an experimental Glider, able to do some atmospheric flying on Duna.

Unfortunately, it ended up a bit too far away (2km), but the outpost\u0027s six 24-77 engines had a TWR of slighly above 1, so that I\u0027ve been able to relocate the oupost to the return vessel.\n\nDue to the high elevation of the landing site (3km) our outpost came down pretty fast, which broke the landing legs on the back. Those legs seem to be a bit shortened now, but they still work.\n\nThe outpost in Kerbin orbit:\n\n![DF88BC8F3D95B56FB061735FBB8F13EF8CC0EA96](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490176200245/DF88BC8F3D95B56FB061735FBB8F13EF8CC0EA96/)\n\nArriving at Duna:\n\n![716BA115B9A01DDF490E4FFD233A5F462F5E5754](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490176200723/716BA115B9A01DDF490E4FFD233A5F462F5E5754/)\n\nPreparing for the descent:\n\n![52F120916D8340D43DF0943D4CACD0DE749FA559](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490176201039/52F120916D8340D43DF0943D4CACD0DE749FA559/)\n\n![B13E3D9CD67619D73F61D62D169AB04DB7C29B13](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490176201243/B13E3D9CD67619D73F61D62D169AB04DB7C29B13/)\n\n![1EF175EADD3E2B622B3A9B6ECFFB0F024569D562](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490176201408/1EF175EADD3E2B622B3A9B6ECFFB0F024569D562/)\n\nNow let\u0027s wait for our Ike probe to arrive at Duna\u0027s SOI."},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T17:16:27Z","Content":"After a bit of timewarping, the Ike probe arrived at the Duna system, so we\u0027re ready to plan the manouvers required to get us into a stable Ike orbit.\n\n![2D87F2D7C562699019C92144B6EA0534FDCD1DDD](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528389490176254666/2D87F2D7C562699019C92144B6EA0534FDCD1DDD/)\n\nWe wouldn\u0027t even have to do a burn in Ike\u0027s SOI, as our path gets us caught into a stable Ike orbit on its own.

But as his return vessel wouldn\u0027t be able to make a detour via Ike surface, we have to send him another lander, so he can board it in Ike orbit. Later he can dock to the return vessel for the Ike probe and use it for a return to Kerbin, as there would be no need to return the unmanned Ike lander, as Jeb can just grab the science report.\n\nHowever, the next launch window to Duna will be long after the launch window for the return trip. In order to send a vessel which will arrive before the return launch window, it must have at least 5400m/s for Kerbin ejection and Duna injection.
