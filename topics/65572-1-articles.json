Besides pump starting problem (for example, LK had limited ignitions because the pumps were started by solid charges), you have to ensure that the fuel will be in the lower part of the tang and the pump won\u0027t be pumping gas instead of liquid, which is a problem in 0 g:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Having some force accelerating the rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Ignition on the pad (first stages, of course)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Hot staging - igniting the next stages before the previous cuts off (most Russian rockets, first used on R-9 ICBM and Luna/Vostok launch vehicles).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Solid ullage motors. Especially actual for staging in the upper atmosphere (Saturn V), because you need to overcome the drag. Can have charges for multiple ignitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Auxiliary propulsion units (S-IVB, Blok D and many other upper stages). Often work also as attitude control RCS before ignition. Usually, pressure-fed hypergolic RCS - the optimal multi-ignition solution for heavy stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Pressure fed tanks - there\u0027s no gas directly over the liquid (it\u0027s separated by the membrane). Also, no turbopump required, which make that perfect for RCS and other small thrusters. However lower ISP than with turbopumps and not compatible with cryogenic fuels, therefore using that for the main engines (all 3 engines of Apollo) is a major trade-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Special combined solutions. For example, on LK part of the tanks was separated by special membrane ensuring the gas won\u0027t get under it in 0 g, but allowing fuel flow during burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving re-ignitable engines imposes some disadvantages comparing to simpler single-ignition solutions (additional hardware or lower ISP), so when it is possible, the engineers try to use the simplest things (and they can be made even lighter by making other elements designed for single use). The same with wide range throttling - it require more complex heavier hardware, so if your rocket doesn\u0027t really need it, it\u0027s better to avoid this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
