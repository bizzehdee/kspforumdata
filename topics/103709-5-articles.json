But I\u0027m still irritated. I\u0027m not irritated because my game is broken; I\u0027m irritated because this sort of unwarranted and unexpected update means SQUAD lacks a certain degree of civility and foresight. It would have taken maybe thirty seconds to make an official announcement about this (in the devnotes or elsewhere), and it would have been met with mostly positive feedback. Instead, it seems as if SQUAD deliberately tried to remove this option, and thus ruin many peoples\u0027 games, in complete secrecy. Which strikes me as a certain breach of trust.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027ll leave now.

If you do need to format the disk, reinstall windows first and just set the partition for windows during that process (just give it half the disk. also, don\u0027t format the empty space you plan to put ubuntu in at that point, let ubuntu do that so it formats it as ext4 rather than ntfs). Then install ubuntu afterwards and it will take care of setting up bootloaders for switching OS when you boot, windows doesn\u0027t do that so you have to manually fiddle about setting up dual boot. \n\nI\u0027m not sure, but ubuntu might even be able to partition the disk with windows already present, but I tend to think doing that is bad practice so I\u0027ve not tried that recently."},{"CreatedByName":"rockowwc","CreatedById":138930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T11:02:15Z","Content":"A couple of things to note..

A VM adds a level of abstraction and opens up a series of potential bugs. A VM will never be more stable than the OS on which it is running. Ubuntu inside a VM, inside windows, will always be less stable than windows because the VM is still relying upon windows. KSP might be more stable, but if your issues are related to windows and/or hardware, a VM won\u0027t help. Windows would also be less stable running in a VM running within ubuntu.
