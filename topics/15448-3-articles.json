Most of the fun for me is getting to do exactly what you want yourself, without the aid of a machine.

The same goes for rendezvous and landings.\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know many people prefer the more scientific side of KSP (i.e. the Kerbin Geographic Society) and I appreciate the need for simple, fast orbits in order to collect data with the minimum fuss, but when I hear of people performing their first ever moon landing/rendezvous/minmus landing etc, with mechjeb, I wonder \\\u0027where\\\u0027s the achievement?\\\u0027 Now, obviously there\\\u0027s the rocket design that, since 0.16, has (I think) made it easier to get items into orbit, and that does require skill, thought, and planning.

I don\\\u0027t know about anybody else, but my first ten landing attempts exploded, but I slowly got better and now, if a ship is capable of landing at all, I can land it 99% of the time using no RCS. The same for rendezvous and rescue landings, although I have only ever performed three rendezvous manoeuvres, I found each one massively easier than the last... But with mechjeb, you just don\\\u0027t get the chance to learn... which I find to be an opportunity wasted, so essentially, I reckon that for the true KSP experience, players really ought to steer relatively clear of mechjeb until they\\\u0027re confident in manual flights, since it\\\u0027s a learning experience that way.

I had never heard of it and someone mentioned it in a vlog. I picked up the demo....flew two rockets into a rather cruddy parabola and was hooked. I bought the full paid version, fired it up, and did a couple more and looked up a youtube video on how to get into an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I could reliably do that, I watched some video to figure out the transfer. I wound up orbiting Kerbol a few times till I figured out how to manipulate my capture by the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso then I spent a whole evening trying to land on the Mun. when I thought i finally had it I was unfortunately on the dark side and didn\u0027t realize how fast I was approaching the ground. Still, I thought I was on the right track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I downloaded Mechjeb and let it run the same mission I had just run. the same starting orbit, roughly the same transfer, the same orbit around the Mun. Even tried landing on the dark side with it. However I learned my method had been properly executed, and that I really needed to be burning my engines much sooner and harder than I had been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I use Mechjeb? Not much. I did want to use it because there is only so much I can pick up off youtube videos.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warshawski","CreatedById":9171,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T19:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI mostly use MechJeb to keep my craft stable, because the KillRot function is sooo much more convenient than babying the SAS/RCS buttons while I try to make orbit.

So i have Mechjeb to thank for that. Now i can do it manually, which i love doing as every time is different and exciting (especially the way i end up fudging things up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But if you don\u0027t want to use it, don\u0027t.
