Love the idea. Though for future versions. If possible hide/disable all the buttons in the Rclick menu when using the mod as a lot of mods put info in that menu that just needs to be seen not interacted with. It can at times be split between the top and bottom of a long menu with a ton of buttons between. If you hide/disable all the buttons we use this mod to active stuff and the Rclick is clean for just info to be presented. Just a thought.

You perfectly display all the info from the menu it is not just the buttons. Very nice work! Only things missing I saw was when enabling the F12 menu thermal readouts. Rad flux, Conv flux, Cond flux, Int flux, Thermal mass, and Temp ext are not displayed. This was with FAR and DR.

I could create some sort of \u0022pop off\u0022 button that would spawn another window for the selected part. That will take a bit of work though. At the same time I\u0027d like to start linking the window states to the active vessel - right now when you switch vessels then go back it forgets what part you had selected before. The final piece would be to save the various window states so they persist across different gaming sessions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Svm420 - Also a good idea! I managed to find where those temperature fields are stored on the part, so adding them will be easy enough. Perhaps as a default I will display something like \u0022current temp / max temp\u0022 and only display the others when the debug option is enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T19:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eya, if you could fix the vessel switch bug, then this would be perfect.
