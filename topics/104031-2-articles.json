There will be an optimum re-entry profile for target destruction, another profile for maximum penetration and neither of which will be a \u0022maximum attainable velocity\u0022 profile.\n\nNB: Funny that Newton derived an equation almost 400 years ago that is still relevant when considering orbital weaponry!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-25T11:50:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2016 11:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o**"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T12:29:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 37 minutes ago, p1t1o said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Note that velocity is not a component, above a certain threshold higher velocity will not result in greater penetration.\n\u003E \n\nIMO amount of damage you can do with this weapon is not key feature.

Without actually trying it out, only vague conclusions can be drawn, naturally, but here are some salient points IIRC:\n\nYes, ships are vulnerable.\n\nABM systems already in service on some modern ships are quite well suited for defence against these weapons. A kinetic projectile would likely be more physically robust vs. conventional ABM, but deflection would be possible.\n\nThe \u0022kill-chain\u0022 (Command structure, sensor network, and communication links to the weapon itself) is unusually long and is vulnerable to jamming/disruption. This is likely to be similar for orbital kinetic weapons too, complicated by the fact that ships are moving targets.\n\nThe best defence against ballistic or orbital weaponry is political/deterrent in nature, especially since anything streaking in from space is indistinguishable from a nuclear warhead.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-25T12:49:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2016 12:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-25T13:14:37Z","Content":"The crater diameter goes as the cube root of energy, though as I recall.
