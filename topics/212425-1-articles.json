My approach is entirely dependent on using CH Control Manager so using other brands of controller would require finding a compatible utility. Joystick Gremlin looks like it might do the job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe TL;DR is that you get to map the stick to any two of pitch/yaw/roll, your choice. Any additional controller axes need to be converted to keyboard input, hence the need for a utility to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurtvw","CreatedById":83214,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T00:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this is coming very soon, I use the stick for all planes, and I use my throttle for pretty much all craft.\u00A0 I really need this working.\u00A0 Really unfortunate it apparently isn\u0027t there right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T06:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncan haz my spacemouse back?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T07:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlooks like the game has xinput support. i was able to map my analog keyboard to stuff. granted analog keys are not as good as an axis proper. you can use a directinput-\u0026gt;xinput wrapper for now. but i always find game pads to limiting to big boy games, that require more than 4 axes. especially when a lot of players will want to use their hotas. again i blame microsoft for pushing a console pesant api on the pc master race. its a shame considering the number of diy launch consoles built by the ksp community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T07:31:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 07:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
