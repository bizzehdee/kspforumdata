So I\u0027m going to joule! (unmanned, otherwise all those poor souls). And I would like to land on laythe! So my orbit is about 68,500,000 m (apoapses and periapses (its around as big as tylo\u0027s orbit)) But how do I get into a low orbit around laythe now? I tried aerobraking because I only have 900 m / s of fuel but that is far too bad. Do you know how I can lower my speed to NOT explode in the atmosphere? Thank you in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely Prat4545!

If aerobraking is your only shot, try spinning the craft wildly upon entering the atmosphere.

For starters, you only need to aerobrake into a \u003Cem\u003Ecapture\u003C/em\u003E. That means, any trajectory that ensures you stay near your destination, instead of careening off into solar orbit again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, you\u0027d capture into Laythe\u0027s sphere of influence. But if you\u0027re going so fast that a single aerobraking pass doesn\u0027t do the trick without melting your spacecraft, then at least capture into Jool\u0027s sphere of influence. As long as you stay at Jool after going past Laythe, you can later encounter Laythe again, and aerobrake again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a safe aerobraking pass at Laythe still results in your spacecraft shooting back out into solar orbit... well, I\u0027m afraid in that case, you did it wrong. Going this fast when arriving at Jool is a sign of not using a proper Hohmann transfer in the proper transfer window. Which is totally fair, sometimes you want to do a high energy transfer instead, to lower the travel time. But as the name implies, you\u0027ll be on a highly energetic trajectory, and you\u0027ll have to deal with that excess energy once you arrive at your destination. That typically means provisioning large amounts of spare fuel for propulsive capture. And you didn\u0027t bring enough. In such a case, two options: either abandon the mission and send another one, or cheat infinite fuel (alt\u002BF12).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prat4545","CreatedById":205127,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-29T11:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027m trying again with some more fuel and i hope its gonna be better\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-29T16:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have heat shields? If so, Jool is so big and close that there are often opportunities to aerobrake there and reduce your speed somewhat before getting to Laythe itself. But you will need heat protection to survive it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and even non-aerobrake passes of the moons can help, as they can slow you if you approach\u00A0them from opposite the direction they are moving.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prat4545","CreatedById":205127,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-30T10:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have one but it doesnt cover the whole craft\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI did the mission again and my tip is that your periapses has to go over laythe orbit or lower! I lowered my apoapses about to the orbit of tylo and did the burn to laythe at periapses\u00A0(laythe peraipses was at 60 000 m) And that burn costed 400 m/s and into a low orbit 900 m/s so i had 1800 m/s left!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was a better try thanks for the help everyone!z\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
