(example: 3,500 DeltaV with a 10 tonne payload) To do this I just put together a bunch of fuel tanks and other various parts to get my desired payload weight and then build a lifter that has ~ 3,500 DeltaV, which ensures that it should be capable of reaching LKO given a proper ascent\u00A0profile. Usually I build\u00A0my lifters to be rated at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 70 tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually my highest rated lifter is rated for 70 tonnes to LKO,\u00A0however if I have a payload which exceeds that weight\u00A0I\u0027ll build a specialty lifter which may later become standardized for similar payloads. At the other end of the scale though, if I have a payload that weighs around ~2\u00A0tonnes I may build a specialty lifter for that as well, seeing how a lifter rated for 5\u00A0tonnes to LKO would be a bit overkill for a 2\u00A0tonne payload. Additionally I do a bit of math to calculate the cost per tonne to LKO and attempt to build my lifters as cost effectively as possible, although this typically doesn\u0027t matter in the later career as funds are plentiful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Really the main reason I like to make standardized lifters is simply that it saves a significant amount of time.

So by standardizing some elements I can significantly reduce the time it takes to build a mission from what could be hours down to mere minutes. (I\u0027m also a perfectionist when it comes to building probes/vehicles/lifters, everything must be functionally and aesthetically perfect or I won\u0027t let it fly, which is part of the reason it can take hours to build)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from the time-saving benefits..

This way, if I know what the weight and purpose of the payload is, I can create the satellite or other equipment and then simply pull the appropriate lifter from my assemblies tab. No fuss, no muss.\u00A0 I will say that I also continue to design more efficient lifters as my game play experience improves. For that reason, I do have, for example, a set of lifters that will have serial numbers, such as KLO125-A, -B, etc (KLO= Kerbin Low Orbit).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRealism \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*cough, cough*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E and it economizes my playing time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T14:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to use more standard lifters but most of mine are custom builds. \u00A0In career which I mostly play every launch you have new and interesting parts to make more efficient lifters. \u00A0If your not using KER or MechJeb for dv readout creating a very efficient cost effective lifter can take a lot of time (in excel). \u00A0If you are playing hard no save no revert 2 or 3 failed launches can bankrupt a space program. \u00A0Any failed launches will generally may a contract a net loss because the margins are quite small. \u00A0Most of my Hard missions barely pay back 150-200%. \u00A0Where as on normal I would not do a mission if the return on investment was less then 1000%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-06T14:40:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2016 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Nich\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T15:09:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will generally re-use an entire rocket design, usually with a few tweaks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I get ISRU I tend to use it extensively, and my 3-star training/tourism designs just swap out crew capacity for a few extra tanks to be come Duna/Gilly/Moho ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest changes in my ship designs have been in accommodating the recent USI-LS changes for interplanetary missions(kerbals now get home-sick and get tired of cramped quarters combined with the need for recyclers to keep food usage reasonable), before that I would basically use the same ship\u00A0for all missions.(interplanetary would just have\u00A0extra fuel/ore tanks clipped inside)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T15:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI keep meaning to but never get round to it. \u00A0The main reason to do so would be to make a reusable single stage launch vehicle than loft a payload to LKO and then land back somewhere near the KSC. \u00A0This should work out cheaper than disposable rockets, but obviously the rocket will be bigger, heavier and more expensive in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I never get round to is in the early game when money\u0027s tight I\u0027m constantly \u00A0researching new stuff so any design is outdated by the next launch, but by the time the tech tree is unlocked money usually isn\u0027t much of an issue and I don\u0027t mind more expensive launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rabada","CreatedById":66044,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T15:42:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI too would like to use standardized lifters in KSP more often. I think I have figured out why I never seem to get around to making them. The biggest reason by far that I don\u0027t tend to design standardized lifters is because I usually play in career mode and there are some parts that I would want to put on my standard lifters that are unlocked at the end of the tech tree. I never rush through the tech tree because I enjoy the challenge of building low tech craft. By the time I get around to unlocking the parts that I am looking for,\u00A0(specifically the 1.25 and the 2.5m probe cores) I usually have a ton of various low tech design from earlier I designed earlier in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, sometimes it is difficult for me to say exactly where my rockets end and their\u00A0payload begins.
