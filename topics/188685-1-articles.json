I had a flight and noticed something at an odd point. It stopped stuttering. The low fps wasn\u0027t that bad and it would almost make the flight doable. But the stuttering seems to add so much time to the game that it can\u0027t fly without taking hours to do 10 minutes in game. Is there a way to reduce this for large parts ships. I\u0027m not using more than 10 gb out of 16. I had ram. But it still seems to remove stuff and do what I assume is unity garbage collection constantly. Same with in the vehicle bay. I\u0027ve read stuff about it being removable in things like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.

It does this repeatedly throughout the flight and in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint is, is there a way to fix the stuttering permanently. Even for large ships. There is more room in my ram.

Not the ones in the parts window but the independent one that shows all of the ships general aero stats like L-I-D and thrust to drag and whatnot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, I fly with absolutely minimum settings to reduce lag. It\u0027s the stutter that is the biggest performance hit from what I can tell.

Larger craft may make it appear earlier but no game is immune, it appears after a few hours or a few launches; reverting launches or loading from saves makes it appear sooner.

But it doesn\u0027t always. pull up before the end of the runway and hold(preferably at those shapes at the end). But this is 10\u002B minutes later. 46 seconds according to the in game timer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t even realize this was just a performance problem. I thought it was something that couldn\u0027t be fixed. My game has always been like this for large ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, I get about 5 big stutters per in game second. In game timer is about 13-15(10-15?) second per real world second. Stutters are up to 1-2 seconds each. At worst case you get rid of 5 seconds out of 15. At best you remove 10 out of 10 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I have to note, the stutter is gone in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E if I\u0027m not pushing buttons though. It still does upon trying to play with the ship part, but the bottom creatures aren\u0027t stuttering evenly anymore. In flight is still constant though. Even sitting on the runway. Although I haven\u0027t tested after the ship stops moving from launching it and bobbing up and down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTested: It stutters like twice when dropped on the runway, but then does not stutter after it stops on the runway(After turning on breaks.). It runs about 5 seconds per in game second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does start stuttering once I start up the engines though. Even if the throttle is at 0%. I wonder if that is part of the problem. I\u0027m running 108 rapiers. But they are not doing anything and it\u0027s stuttering like before. Turning off the engines does stop the stuttering also. These are engines at 0% throttle. I even turned on only 1 engine at 0% throttle and it does the same thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can test the stutter by right clicking and moving the camera around. Assuming you even need to. But it makes it more pronounced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone else get the same problem with this craft? Is it possibly it\u0027s my hardware also? I have a phenom II 1100t. Could ram timings effect it. I\u0027m running a little aggressivly with 1-9-9-9-24. I\u0027m assuming it doesn\u0027t matter though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is a memory leak with things like aero gui, could that be helping exaggerate garbage collection?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lack of stutter while it\u0027s sitting there is really nice though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFun Note:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have massive helicopter things on this same vessel on another version.
