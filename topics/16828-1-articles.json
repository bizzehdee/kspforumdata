I\u0027ve been playing around with KSP for a while now and decided to try some user-made parts and packs for an enhanced experience. So I joined the forum. I\u0027m hoping to find some help and ideas for future crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt so happens that i was just a minute ago trying to get Jebediah Kerman to Mun. Unfortunately for Jeb, the game bugged out and the spacecraft kept accelerating to 600km/s just as it reached the point when it was about to encounter Mun, even if i did a retroburn to slow myself down to less than 400km/s. At least I think that should\u0027ve been enough to let Mun catch up with my spacecraft, but apparently not. Instead, the craft still accelerated and I ended up orbiting the Sun. 0.0 Well. Since I love experimenting, I decided to test if it was possible to escape the orbit of the Sun. As it turned out, it\u0027s quite difficult, at least with the craft I had at the time (a stock Munar lander). Well, poor Jebediah is now trapped on an elliptical orbit around the Sun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E Here are a couple of screenshots when I had no fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/5328/screenshot6hu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6hu.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/1802/screenshot8bm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot8bm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T23:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi heikkik and welcome to the KSP forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShame Jeb is going on such a long holiday, at least he gets a really good view from way up there though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T15:41:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
