They are both on a kingpin vertex that is shared with the wings and the main gear. Simply unlink it from cargo_bay and link it to their respective wing. The only thing I would do different is rename from dummy_attach_cargo_gear_left(right) to dummy_attach_right_wing_gear and dummy_attach_left_wing_gear respectively (unless you\u0027re using your own naming convention). Either way, let me know via PM if you reassign those attach points so I can do the same on the production files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, realistically the gear would be attached to the main root spar. In an event of a crash the wings are designed to rip off leaving the gear as intact as possible. So technically, the gear should actually stay on if the player were to rip the wings off since they are traditionally attached to the strongest point of the entire aircraft. Actually, believe it or not, on most real aircraft (dunno about the shuttle) that area has the most expensive and difficult to manufacture structural component, the primary former. In many aircraft it is made of a solid machined titanium slab. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe attach points in the cargo bay and engine mounting (on rear_end) are the minimum required. The reason why the mounting pads have two (01,02 and 04,05) are so that you can mount larger than off-center items on them. However, if you find 02 and 05 to be too close and unnecessary feel free to remove them. If you move any of the attach points on the firewall, the engines won\u0027t line up with the baked mounting location on the texture.

It\u0027s a good idea, but putting it in practice poses a few challenges.\u003Cp\u003EHow do we rate the science value of your missions? What even defines a mission in the first place? These things are actually pretty hazy in terms of how the game deals with them, so coming up with a nice, solid way of doing science is a deceptively tough task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do believe I\u0027ve worked out a good solution now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game won\u0027t award you any science automatically. That would be artificial and generally meaningless, but worse still, it would require us to make arbitrary decisions about the science value of this or that action. That\u0027s a bad road to go down. Instead, we can let you \u0027do science\u0027 as part of your missions, and get your science points for yourself. Here\u0027s how:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have a few science sensor parts, which apart from a context menu readout, are largely decorative. We can put those to some use now, along with a couple other scientific parts we\u0027re going to add. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that science parts work as one-shot experiments. That is, they\u0027re activated by action group or as part of the staging sequence, and once deployed, they to their thing. This is essentially deploying the experiment to gather data. This data isn\u0027t science yet though, because you need to get it to your resident experts over at R\u0026amp;D to crunch the numbers and make some sense out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do that, you can recover the experiments (or whatever is left of them). That will convert the data you gathered into scientific knowledge, provided you don\u0027t already have it. This is done by us storing where each experiment was run and what it was, and using that \u0027source\u0027 as a key to a multiplier value, which starts at 100% and gets progressively lower the more data on the same subject you gather. The more you spam the same type of experiment in the same place, the less science you\u0027ll get for the data it generates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if we\u0027ve learned anything this far, it\u0027s that recovery is by no means guaranteed. So here\u0027s where the antennas and comm dishes finally get a purpose. Once available, you can use comms equipment to transmit science data back down and gain science immediately. Of course, you can\u0027t expect to get as much knowledge for the same experiment data if you beam it back as if you had recovered it hands-on. How efficient the data-for-science rate is depends largely on the quality of the antenna being used, as does its power requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe possibilities for what the science-gathering parts can be then are pretty huge. They could be anything from experiment canisters filled with some mystery goo, a camera array, a mass spectrometer, anything really. Functionally it all works the same way, and better yet, it works \u003Cem\u003Ewith \u003C/em\u003Ethe game rather than over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it in a very tightly packed nutshell. I\u0027m pretty happy with this idea now, it should fit any style of playing. You could focus on running as many different experiments as possible in Kerbin\u0027s lower atmosphere, or rush into discovering the different properties of Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 across the farthest reaches of the solar system, and hopefully any point in between as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 is not really a planned feature (yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I don\u0027t really care what you make, because it\u0027s certain to be awesome anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lyze Of J","CreatedById":61687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T04:02:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion is: a manned pod in the cargo bay like the shuttle launch experience at NASA\u0027s KSC, (in Florida, not kerbin) it\u0027s like space lab, except its more like a bus\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMooner","CreatedById":79610,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T05:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Helldiver,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill that mini docking port in the cargo be functional?
