The settings.cfg file is pretty easy to read. Just make sure you edit it with a plain text editor (such as notepad) and nothing that has formatting options (such as word or wordpad).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of the settings in settings.cfg have maximum and minimum values when you adjust them in game. However, you can override a lot of those settings by manually editing the file. Just be aware that if you ever go into the settings page ingame, it will reset any values that are outside the min/max allowed and you\u0027ll have to manually edit the .cfg again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And be prepared for possible strange results.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
