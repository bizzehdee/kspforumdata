An insistent chill against her drew her intention. She pulled the M\u00FCnstone from beneath her shirt. It was cold to the touch again, not freezing, but she had the feeling it had been even colder a moment ago. It seemed to warm much faster than a big lump of metal should as she turned it over in her hands. \n\nThe brilliant, lens-shaped crimson stone almost seemed to glow, probably just a trick of the morning sunlight streaming in the window. She turned it this way and that, watching the light refract and dance within. The stone was quite translucent, but Valentina realized she couldn\u0027t see the back of the titanium setting through it. It just seemed to go on and on forever, filled with fragile shafts of light. There was a sudden, unpleasant sense of *d\u00E9j\u00E0 vu*... like she was falling *into* the stone.\n\nIt didn\u0027t feel that unusual, just a big gemstone. Not that she had much experience with such things. Solid, yet as she ran a thumb over the surface Valentina marveled at how smooth it was. Slick, almost as if it were wet--\n\nHer eyes widened with recognition. It seemed like a lifetime ago, could it really only have been a few months? The way the light played inside the stone, the sense of falling... no, *rising*... rising toward the light... It reminded her of a time she had risen through an olive sea, at the very edge of life, surrounded by ominous shadows... and fragile shafts of light stretching on into infinity. \n\nShe lifted the M\u00FCnstone and frowned at it. What *is* this thing, anyway? Her eyes moved to the reddish bands across her fingers, punctuated here and there by a tiny blister. It looked like frostbite, but surely that couldn\u0027t be right. Just another trick of the light, or perhaps some allergic reaction... Rising, she moved to the mirror over her small sink. The stripes across her neck were only a little worse, barely even an itch. A few larger spots on her chest. And yet...\n\nLast night, listening to Chadvey, the stone had burned, *burned*, not with ice but with fire. Burned with all the intensity of her nightmares. Yet it hadn\u0027t left a single mark on her. Dibella had said that according to legend, M\u00FCnstones had mystical powers. That was just silly stories and and old fairy tales...\n\n...right?\n\nWith a sigh, she pushed the thoughts away and dressed. She needed to go talk to Gene. Why could no one see what was happening around here? Last night, Chadvey had gone on to mention how this \u0027Layland Kerman\u0027 had built his empire. Buying patents, stealing designs. Running other companies into bankruptcy and then snatching them up for a song. \n\nShe paused. \n\nHow does one purchase an entire company, even a bankrupt one, for a song? Perhaps that\u0027s why Ol\u0027 Sam\u0027s bar was so popular. It all seemed very strange, but these were strange people with strange laws. \n\nAnyway, maybe a- she rolled her eyes- *foreign* perspective could could bring light to the situation. Make Gene see reason. Layland\u0027s rockets had saved the Ussari Space Program, but... it was different here. The Union had the Imperium to keep Layland in check, he could never scheme against them. Only... hadn\u0027t the Empress done just that? Outmaneuvered the Imperium on their own territory?\n\nBah, more politics! She\u0027d been in this strange place too long, now she was even starting to *think* like them, with their constant schemes and games.\n\nIf everything Chadvey had said was true... If everything she had seen with her own eyes was true... Yes, these foreigners could *use* some simple Ussari sensibility. It was so *obvious*, why couldn\u0027t *they* see it?\n\nSighing again, she slipped the M\u00FCnstone over her head. No time for fairy tales and stories now. \n\nAnd paused. The stark shadows from the late morning sun seemed to move and dance for a moment. Drifting clouds perhaps. She looked again to the stone. This was Dibella\u0027s. This was home. She shifted it back over her head again, tucked it away beneath her shirt, and reached for the door.\n\nUgh, why couldn\u0027t they see what was right in front of their faces?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe elevator doors *bing*ed open, and Valentina stepped out into a cacophony of clacking typewriters. She made her way past them, nodded to Sally, the ever-smiling secretary behind the big desk at the end of the room, then headed down the long hallway to Gene\u0027s office. Like that office, the narrow hall was festooned with space-themed artwork and various photographs. Valentina paused at one now, one she must have passed before without noticing. \n\nIn it, a group of smiling people drove shovels into the ground. She recognized Gene in the center, a bit younger if every bit as haggard. Flanking him on one side was a regal-looking lady who could only be the Queen of Omork. On the other, a handsome fellow she remembered from other pictures as a former President of Kleptogart. He looked quite young to hold such an office; a shame, what happened to him. On the other side of the Queen was a Kerb who was the spitting image of poor Jebediah. His brother, Bob, she surmised. And opposite him, next to the President... \n\nHe didn\u0027t look all that remarkable. He bore the same official smile as the others, wore the same finely-tailored clothes. Even had an undeniably regal bearing. Valentina hadn\u0027t missed J.R. standing just off to his side, hands folded, with that ever-present feral smile. *This* must be Layland Kerman. He didn\u0027t *look* like a murderer, but, she supposed, such people rarely did. \n\nRaised voices further down the hall pulled her attention away from the photograph. Gene\u0027s door was open, as it always was, and it appeared he already had a visitor. It sounded like Chadvey. \n\nFeeling a bit guilty, she crept closer. Not eavesdropping at all, mind you, not her, just patiently waiting her turn to see him. Not her fault if they were carrying on so loudly she could clearly hear them. Clearly, if she inched another step closer, leaned over and cocked her head just so...\n\n\u0022Hogwash, Gene!\u0022 Chadvey spat, \u0022this is hogwash and you know it!\u0022\n\n\u0022Just calm down, Chadvey,\u0022 Gene said placatingly, \u0022you knew this was coming. We all did. We can\u0027t continue like this.\u0022\n\n\u0022You\u0027re putting hundreds of people out of work! Rockomax\u0027s gambled everything on us, we can\u0027t just shove them aside!\u0022\n\n\u0022They haven\u0027t delivered. They\u0027ve had every chance we can give them but they just can\u0027t make that booster work. Unless you want everyone *here* to be out of a job, we\u0027ve got to move on.\u0022\n\n\u0022Bob will come through. He always has. He knows the stakes...\u0022\n\nChadvey\u0027s voice suddenly trailed off. Valentina leaned in a bit closer.\n\n\u0022Gene... Why are you looking at me like that?\u0022 He said with a barely perceptible tremble, \u0022why are you *looking* at me like that, Gene?!\u0022\n\nGene spoke slowly, fumbling over his words, \u0022I... was going to make an announcement later... try to get everyone together... it\u0027s... well, there\u0027s been...\n\n\u0022What is it? What\u0027s happened?!\u0022\n\nValentina frowned. This didn\u0027t sound good. She glanced back down the hall, no one could see with the turn at the end, and leaned closer still. \n\n\u0022It\u0027s Bob... he\u0027s... well, they say... they think he left his kar running... when he closed his garage last night... never showed up at his office. By the time they found him... it was... I\u0027m sorry...\u0022\n\n\u0022Ach, bloody hells!\u0022 Valentina drew back as she heard Chadvey stomping and cursing around the small room, \u0022bloody, bloody hells!\u0022\n\nA shadow seemed to draw over her. Bob... Jebediah\u0027s brother, the founder of Rockomax. The poor Kerb...\n\n\u0022It\u0027s Layland!\u0022 A hand slapped against wood, \u0022he\u0027s behind it and you know it, Gene!\u0022\n\n\u0022Please, calm *down*. That\u0027s crazy talk. It was an accident. Just a horrible, unfortunate accident,\u0022 something in Gene\u0027s voice said he really wanted to believe that, \u0022these things happen...\u0022\n\n\u0022And this is how you remember him? By throwin\u0027 what he built under the bus before his body\u0027s even cold?!\u0022 Chadvey railed. \n\n\u0022Now you just watch yourself!\u0022 Gene shot back, \u0022this was the Board\u0027s decision. I fought this thing kicking and screaming as long as I could!\u0022\n\n\u0022The Board of Directors doesna\u0027 know a haggis from its own ar--\u0022\n\n\u0022They\u0027re still the Board. They make the decisions around here. Rockomax hasn\u0027t fulfilled their contractual obligations. Besides, you of *all* people should be happy to see the Mule moved up the schedule.\u0022\n\nMule? What was the KSA doing with small horses? Valentina frowned. She shouldn\u0027t be here. This wasn\u0027t her business. But curiosity... what was that figure of speech about the cat?\n\n\u0022Happy that Layland used his key to the Patent Office to steal mah designs?!\u0022\n\n\u0022You know that design work done for the Agency becomes the Agency\u0027s property for the duration. The Company--\u0022\n\n\u0022Wait, *the* Company? It\u0027s *the* Company now? As if it\u0027s the only one?\u0022\n\nGene grumbled, \u0022Layland Heavy Industries has a valid license from the KSA to produce the Mule. You *know* this. They\u0027ve had multiple suborbital test flights of all stages of the new launcher. *Successful* test flights.\u0022\n\nChadvey seemed to stumble briefly, \u0022*we\u0027ve* got flight-ready hardware sitting in the back of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, Rockomax was just tooling up for the rest of the DUOS production run. Couldn\u0027t we at least give them *that* much?!\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s been discussed. Integration with the Layland  stage would take months. By that time, their Mule production line will be up and running. I\u0027m sorry, Chadvey, there\u0027s just no other alternatives at this point. The contracts go to the Company now. Look, even in the best case, DUOS was a dead end. We all *knew* that. It just doesn\u0027t have the endurance...\u0022\n\n\u0022Endurance? What d\u0027you mean, endurance? It\u0027s go to low orbit for a few days not to the bloody--\u0022\n\nThe room, the hall, the whole world seemed to go silent, save for the distant ticking of a clock. Around Valentina, unnoticed, the shadows shifted. For her part, she dared not even breathe. \n\nAnd then, Chadvey Kerman let loose with a tempest of guttural, vowelless syllables that could only be Gednalnan swear words.\n\n\u0022Bloody hells! *All* the Nine Bloody Hells! Of all the-- so *that\u0027s* what this is really about! Blind me, Ah\u0027m s\u0027bloody stupid!\u0022\n\n\u0022Chadvey, just please calm down...\u0022\n\n\u0022*The M\u00FCn!*\u0022\n\nValentina jumped as a hand slammed down on the desk again. Distantly, she wondered if the shouting had drawn anyone else\u0027s attention, but didn\u0027t dare look.\n\n\u0022You wanna send someone to the bloody *M\u00FCn!*\u0022\n\n\u0022Please, keep your voice down!\u0022 Gene strained.\n\n\u0022Blast it, Gene you\u0027re going t\u0027get someone killed! We\u0027re not ready yet!\u0022\n\n\u0022The Board thinks an audacious program with a clearly defined goal will synergize public sup--\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027ve barely gotten anyone into orbit! Not even the bloody Ussaris--\u0022\n\nThe M\u00FCn? She drew back again. This, *this* must be what the Kommissar wanted her to find out! A new KSA craft capable of reaching the M\u00FCn. But to what end? Chadvey was right, the only talk she\u0027d ever heard back home was entirely academic, not even the Union could send a ship to the M\u00FCn!\n\nAt least, not if they wanted them to come back. Alive. \n\nShe needed to hear more. Carefully, still not daring to breathe, she inched closer to the doorway. \n\nThen jumped back, barely stifling a gasp as Chadvey\u0027s hand slammed against the far side of the thin wall. She could just see the tips of his fingers gripping the door frame. \n\n\u0022Blind me! Cor, blind me, Ah\u0027m so bloody stupid,\u0022 Chadvey whispered only a few centimeters away... where only Valentina could hear, \u0022he\u0027s doin\u0027 it again... tear ourselves apart...\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry Chadvey, I really am,\u0022 Gene said consolingly, \u0022but this is out of my hands. I\u0027m only the Flight Director...\u0022\n\nValentina felt Chadvey stir through the wall, \u0022*flight director*...\u0022 he breathed. \n\nMuffled thumps as he stalked back across the office, then a soft creaking as he leaned over Gene\u0027s desk, \u0022then send *me*.\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022 Gene breathed, \u0022*you?* To the M\u00FCn?!\u0022\n\n\u0022You\u0027re the *Flight Director*, only *you* have the authority to choose the mission crews. So you send *me*.\u0022\n\n\u0022I... can\u0027t do that...\u0022 she could almost hear Gene shrinking back, \u0022we can\u0027t risk you, you\u0027re too...\u0022\n\nThe desk creaked more, and all at once, that dangerous edge found Chadvey\u0027s voice again, \u0022you *do* this, Gene, or Ah\u0027ll go see mah damn fool brother, the King of Gednalna. And *shut. This. Place. \u003Cu\u003EDown\u003C/u\u003E*.\u0022\n\nGene\u0027s own voice was barely a whisper, now, \u0022you... you wouldn\u0027t...\u0022 then questioningly, \u0022you... you couldn\u0027t...?\u0022\n\n\u0022Ah\u0027m the thirteenth son of King Tyrion I, the Spider of Edinkergh, Ah grew up- *survived*- in his court.\u0022\n\nValentina imagined Chadvey\u0027s face only a hair\u0027s breadth from Gene\u0027s. \n\n\u0022Ah\u0027ve learnt how to pull a few strings,\u0022 he hissed. \n\n\u0022You... want this that bad?\u0022 Awe plain as Gene spoke. \n\n\u0022No Gene, Ah don\u0027t,\u0022 Chadvey said quietly, consolingly, \u0022Ah want nothing to do with it. But Ah kinna let you risk anyone else on this fool\u0027s errand. And maybe if it\u0027s mah face up there... those fools will think just a little bit harder about it.\u0022\n\nTension hung in the air. Valentina wondered when she\u0027d last taken a breath. Above her, the shadow played. It was silly, but... it seemed like the whole world hung on this moment. \n\n\u0022All right. All right, you win, Chadvey,\u0022 Gene finally said after a long sigh, \u0022you\u0027ll be the first Kerbal on the M\u00FCn. I give you my word.\u0022\n\nValentina let out an achingly long breath herself, and rested her head against the wall. \n\n\u0022You might as well have a seat again,\u0022 said Gene, sounding a bit more like himself, \u0022we have a lot to go over.\u0022\n\nShuffling papers, and more muted voices came from the room. Valentina frowned. Well, it was plain she wouldn\u0027t get a chance to talk to Gene right now. Best make herself scarce before--\n\nThe shadow shifted again...\n\n*Click-click*\n\n...and the soft, metallic noise made her blood run cold. \n\n\u0022Well, now. It is *amazin\u0027* what y\u0027all can overhear listenin\u0027 in at doorways.

This Kerb was *dangerous*.\n\nAs if reading her thoughts on her face, his grin widened. He nodded toward the main room, letting his coat drop but keeping his thumb hooked over his belt nearby, never taking his steely eyes off her. Valentina grit her teeth, and began walking. A moment later, she felt a hand wrap her shoulder in a thousand unsettling ways. \n\n\u0022Now we\u0027re gonna take a little walk, you an\u0027 Ah,\u0022 J.R. hissed, still looking down at her from the corner of his eye, \u0022like Ol\u0027 friends. An\u0027 you gon\u0027 put on a great big Exast smile for Miss Sally over yonder. Be a shame if there were a... incident.\u0022\n\nValentina forced the edges of her mouth up. Fingers pressed into her flesh, finding nerves, moving her along like a puppet. She spared a glance toward J.R.\u0027s belt. Only a few centimeters way... how fast could he react?\n\nNo. Underestimating this Kerb would be a grave mistake. Grave, indeed. \n\nAs they passed into the room full of office workers, J.R. raised a hand and boomed in a loud voice, \u0022tar*nation*, ol\u0027 Gene\u0027s busier than a one-legged Kerb in a butt-kickin\u0027 contest, s\u0027pose we\u0027ll just have to come back later.\u0022\n\nValentina tensed. \n\nThe other hand squeezed. He tipped his huge hat to the secretary.\n\n\u0022Well now, Miss Sally! Lovely day, ain\u0027t it? How\u0027re the *kids?*\u0022 His eyes flicked to Valentina for just an instant, \u0022growin\u0027 like weeds, Ah reckon, what with yaw *fine* cookin\u0027.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, Mister J.R.!\u0022 Sally waved a playful hand at him, \u0022you old flatterer!\u0022\n\n\u0022Ah swear, Miss Sally here makes the best *p\u0113*can pie this side of the Tethys,\u0022 he grinned at Valentina, \u0022it is simply to *die* for.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, you!\u0022 Sally giggled.\n\nValentina forced herself to relax. *P\u0426TI\u0419! P\u0426TI\u0419P\u0426TI\u0419P\u0426TI\u0419...G\u0424\u042F\u042C\u0414CH\u0417V!* How had could she have been so foolish? Letting him sneak up on her like that. She\u0027d been in this place too long, and she\u0027d let her guard down. *ST\u0414LI\u0419!* And now she was trapped. \n\n\u0022Love to stay and chat, but Ah\u0027m afraid mah comrade and Ah,\u0022 he squeezed Valentina\u0027s shoulder again, \u0022have some urgent business to discuss.\u0022\n\n\u0022You have yourself a *lovely* day,\u0022 he said to the secretary, tipping his hat once more. She waved as he led Valentina to the elevator. \n\n\u0022That\u0027s right, you\u0027re a smart one. You know when you been git,\u0022 he said softly as they waited for the lift, \u0022you jus\u0027 keep playin\u0027 it very cool.\u0022\n\nThe elevator doors *bing*ed open and they stepped inside. Valentina kept searching for any way out of his grasp, any advantage, but came up wanting as the doors slid shut. \n\n\u0022What do you want?\u0022 She said softly, staring straight ahead.\n\n\u0022The only thing Ah\u0027ve ever wanted,\u0022 J.R. grinned, \u0022just to talk.\u0022\n\nThe doors opened on the next floor, ending anything further, and Lolli Kerman stepped on, all bright smile and perpetually closed eyes. \n\n\u0022Oh, hi Miss Valentina!\u0022 She squeaked, \u0022Mister J.R!\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, good mornin\u0027, cupcake. Though Ah s\u0027pose it\u0027s not really mornin\u0027 any more,\u0022 the hand squeezed.\n\nValentina\u0027s stomach jumped as the car dropped.\n\n\u0022Isn\u0027t it?\u0022 Lolli chirped, \u0022wow I guess not, busy day as always!\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419! P\u0426TI\u0419P\u0426TI\u0419P\u0426TI\u0419**P\u0426TI\u0419!!!!!*** This one had fight in her, but... no, the risk was too great.\n\nLolli wrinkled her brow, \u0022are you all right, Miss Valentina? You look kinda pale.\u0022\n\n\u0022Am fine,\u0022 she forced a smile, \u0022er... too many cheeseburgers.\u0022\n\n\u0022I know, right?\u0022 The other Kerbelle beamed, \u0022get a bad one and they just *tear* you up all day.\u0022\n\nValentina forced herself to remain calm, keep her shoulders relaxed. A drop of sweat slid down the back of her neck. And all the while, J.R. just grinned and grinned, showing far too many teeth. Finally, the doors *bing*ed open on the lobby. \n\n\u0022Oh well, this is my floor too. Back to training! Toodles!\u0022 and she bounced off. \n\nThe hand prodded Valentina onward, through the masses of bustling, oblivious people and swarms of cadets inside, and out into the blistering tropical sun. All the while she cursed herself, for letting her guard down, for not seeing the obvious. J.R. led her across the campus, past more people blindly going about their days. Blindly, save for that tiny mental seed that why yes, they *had* seen J.R. that day, walking with around Valentina like the *best* of friends...\n\nFinally, they came to a wide, open area not far from the Research Center, but just distant *enough* from everyone else. \n\n\u0022That\u0027s far enough,\u0022 he spat, and shoved her forward. Valentina took three or four stumbling, off balance steps, trying not to go sprawling onto the pavement. She spun around, squinting against the sun now glaring down into her eyes. J.R. just grinned from beneath the shadow of his silly, wide-brimmed black hat. His face seemed to disappear into that shadow, save for those chill eyes and that horrible, horrible grin. His teeth almost looked sharper. He stood there, implacable, his thumbs casually hooked into his belt. \n\n\u0022What do you want?\u0022 Valentina spat again. \n\n\u0022Well, it\u0027s not about what Ah want, it\u0027s about what *you* want,\u0022 he slithered, \u0022though it does seem the scales have shifted. Espionage while under color of diplomatic privilege...\u0022\n\nHe shook his head slowly, \u0022where Ah come from, that\u0027s still a hangin\u0027 offense. Even here, yaw immunity won\u0027t help you.\u0022\n\nValentina said nothing, just tried to hold that gaze like cold steel. \n\n\u0022Ah can make awl this go away. Make it awl just a... bad dream, if you will,\u0022 the grin widened. \n\n\u0022And if I tell you to shove it in dark place?\u0022 She sneered. \n\nThe grin crept wider. His fingers flexed about his belt. \n\n\u0022Then Ah\u0027m\u0027a gonna have\u0027ta get mah hands dirty. And Ah do so *hate* gettin\u0027 mah hands dirty.\u0022\n\nShe glanced around at the distant workers, \u0022there are people about. They will hear. And see.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, Ah reckon they\u0027ll hear *some*thin\u0027. What they *thought* they *saw*, now... well that\u0027s all a matter of perception. And Ah\u0027ve found perceptions to be highly susceptible to the right kinda persuasion.\u0022 \n\nThe grin faltered for an instant, \u0022now it don\u0027t have to be like that. It don\u0027t *need* to be like that. You don\u0027t like me, and that\u0027s fine, you ain\u0027t gotta like yaw teammates. You just gotta play ball with \u0027em.\u0022\n\n\u0022We ain\u0027t that different, you and Ah,\u0022 the cast of his eyes seemed to subtly change, loosing none of their iciness but somehow burning with fire as well, \u0022we both see what\u0027s wrong with the world. Mister Kerman wants to change all that. He wants to build a *better* world. Build better *worlds*.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Mister* Kerman,\u0022 Valentina said slowly, \u0022you speak of Layland Kerman.\u0022\n\nThe barest hint of a nod, \u0022*Mister* Kerman is a visionary. Some might even say a prophet. He wants to better everyone, lift *everyone* up. But he needs *everyone\u0027s* help to do that. He needs *yaw* help.\u0022\n\nHe raised a hand. Offering? Beseeching? His eyes grew wide. \n\n\u0022Just... just think about it for *one* minute... a world, without borders. Without scarcity. Without..,\u0022 *P\u0426TI\u0419*, that *grin!* \u0022...politics. A world with no Imperium breathin\u0027 down yaw neck, no political officers checkin\u0027 yaw papers. No Kerbs coming in the dark of night... and draggin\u0027 yaw family away.\u0022\n\nHis eyes narrowed, as he saw something in her own, \u0022you can be a part of that brave, new world.\u0022\n\nThought rode roughshod through Valentina\u0027s head, each toppling the next. Finally, one shone through the others. \n\n\u0022And what of Jebediah Kerman?\u0022 She countered, \u0022where is *he* in your brave new world?\u0022   \n\n\u0022The journey is long, and the night is full of terrors,\u0022 fire flared in J.R.\u0027s eyes again, \u0022surely *you* can see that sacrifices... must be made.\u0022\n\nJust as quickly, the ice returned, \u0022Mister Kerman holds no grudges. Even ol\u0027 Dean came to see the light, once he found the right... perception.\u0022\n\nThe final piece clicked into place, \u0022you... *you* killed him?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Well no, *Ah* didn\u0027t kill him,\u0022 J.R. sounded genuinely offended, \u0022Ah just... made some arrangements. Truth is, no one *else* killed Dean either. Ah just had a little heart-to-heart with him. Suggested it\u0027d be a *cryin*\u0027 shame if\u0027n anythin\u0027 untoward happened to his young wife an\u0027 brand new baby girl. Cryin\u0027 shame, indeed. He became *most* amenable after that. Completely willing to, uh...\u0022 \n\nHe grinned, *P\u0426TI\u0419* he *grinned!*\n\n\u0022...take one for the team.\u0022\n\nValentina shrieked back at the edge of tears, \u0022you son of a--!\u0022\n\nThe grin widened, \u0022you learnin\u0027 the *real* important words now. Won\u0027t be long \u0027fore you sound like a native. Ah told you there\u0027d be a good faith offerin\u0027. An example. Of just how far Mister Kerman is willin\u0027 to go for his friends, and... his enemies.\u0022\n\nBalling her hands into fists, it was all Valentina could do to hold her ground. He wanted her to charge, he *wanted* it. The excuse played over and over in her mind in his drawling accent, *caught her spyin\u0027 yah see. Tried to talk some sense into her, get her to hear reason, turn herself in peaceful-like. Came at me like a wild animal. Why, it was just self-defense, yuh hona\u0027... just self de-fense*.\n\n\u0022Now Ah told you Mister Kerman don\u0027t hold grudges,\u0022 he prattled on, \u0022that lil\u0027 lady won\u0027t want for anythin\u0027 the rest of her life, an\u0027 when her lil\u0027 baby come of age, why, she\u0027ll have her pick of any university in the country. Maybe the world. Ah\u0027m sure she\u0027ll make a *fine* team player, just like her dear ol\u0027 daddy Dean.\u0022\n\n\u0022Donald!\u0022 She took a step, \u0022his name was Donald! Did *any* of you even know?! Did any of you even *try?\u0022*\n\n\u0022Why, Ah reckon you had a soft spot for the ol\u0027 boy. Well ain\u0027t that sumpthin\u0027,\u0022 the grin faded again, \u0022it still don\u0027t gotta *be* like this. Ah\u0027ll give you one last chance, to hear reason. You can name yaw price, this is a negotiation, after all. You ain\u0027t the money-lovin\u0027 type, so what\u0027ll it be? What do you want more than anything else in the world? Go on, gimme a challenge. Ah do so *love* a challenge.\u0022\n\nWith resignation, she bowed her head... and pointed vaguely in the direction of the sea, \u0022I want you. To take long trip. Off short dock.\u0022\n\nThe hideous grin widened until it split his face in two, \u0022so be it.\u0022\n\n\u0022You\u0027ve made yaw choice,\u0022 his fingers flexed at his belt, \u0022now make yaw move.\u0022\n\n J.R. fixed her with that icy gaze, that feral grin, and Valentina knew then that she had been wrong. About him. About everything. Those soulless eyes did not belong to a predator, but to a *killer*. And worse, a *fanatic*. Yet only the tip of a very long spear that was now pointed directly at her. And she knew that it was too late now to stand out of the way. She\u0027d been stalked and driven, and there was only one way this could end. Tensing, she prepared for the inevitable. \n\nThe ground quaked, and a flash drew her eyes. \n\n\u0022Heads up!\u0022 Cried someone. \n\n\u0022*Line drive!*\u0022 Screamed another. \n\nSomething sparked across the concrete once, twice, steel met flesh, warm spray hit burning pavement, and Valentina gasped as fire bloomed at her chest. The harsh glare of the sun faltered, dimmed, then all the light went out of the world. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-31T07:21:42Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2020 07:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"TotallyNotHuman","CreatedById":157240,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T04:23:57Z","Content":"Oh.

Her lungs fought for the thick, tropical air. The world had become still, and restless. Slowly, her eyes fluttered open. \n\nShe never saw where it came from, but that didn\u0027t matter anymore. Where it was *now*, had most recently been occupied by J.R. Kerman\u0027s right eyeball. The rest was sticking out of the back of his head. \n\n\u0022Guk,\u0022 said J.R. Kerman, and toppled over backwards. For a few moments he twitched, and then all was once again still. \n\nValentina stared on in shock, unmoving, untouched. At her chest, the last warm flares of the M\u00FCnstone slowed, then faded away. A pall of oily black smoke rose over the nearby research center. Around her, blood soaked into the thirsty, burning pavement like the bitter understanding now soaking into her mind. For just an instant, she\u0027d thought she\u0027d seen... felt... but no. She\u0027d been wrong, she\u0027d been *so* wrong. \n\nAbout *everything*.\n\nIn the distance, sirens began to wail.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt had all happened so *fast*.\n\nValentina stood amidst a vast crowd of people, the constant murmur broken by the occasional \u0022oooooh!\u0022 or \u0022aahhhhh!\u0022 The journey from Exast took weeks by ship, yet *these* had arrived in only days. Days, since the moment she\u0027d faced J.R. beneath the blistering sun. Today, wandering clouds tempered that sun, while a pleasant breeze brought fresh, clean air from the sea. \n\nThe massive form crept by on its hundred-wheeled self-propelled modular trailer, still clad in bright white shrink wrap. Despite laying on its side, only half a meter above the ground on its carrier, it towered nearly four meters over Valentina\u0027s head, and seemed to stretch in either direction to infinity. And this was only one piece. \n\nThey called it \u0022Colossus.\u0022 Someone had explained the word to her. It fit. It was the largest, heaviest, most powerful rocket ever conceived anywhere, by anyone. Five hundred tonnes at launch, nearly double the heaviest lifter the Ussaris had, with an estimated 25 tonnes to orbit. A number that was expected to increase. \n\nIn one fell swoop, the foundering Kerbal Space Administration was now poised to lap the mighty Ussari Space Program. As the enormous stage pivoted away around an impossibly tight corner, Valentina could plainly see why. Even beneath their protective shrink wrap, the resemblance of the four main engines to the ones that powered nearly every Ussari rocket was undeniable. Only these were much, *much* larger. \n\nFollowing the enormous core stage, came a much more ordinary looking crate behind an ordinary looking truck, the angular \u0022Layland Heavy Industries\u0022 logo plain on both. The murmurs of the crowd rose in intensity. Inside, was the Medium Utility Launch-Experimental. Everyone just called it the Mule. Valentina didn\u0027t get the reference.  \n\nHere, was the KSA\u0027s long-awaited answer to the Union\u0027s *Zarya*, a three-person spacecraft that could maneuver, dock, and, some whispered, even go to the M\u00FCn. Controlling it would be a state-of-the-art computer system supplied through a partnership with Wutani Kokuni. They called it, the Mechanical JEB. Neither the slight nor the irony was lost on Valentina. \n\nBehind the crate on its truck, more immense shapes stretched off in a long line towards the port, where tankers waited in turns to offload their cargo of cheap, storable, *safe* propellium. At least, that\u0027s what the faces on the news programs said, the newspaper articles, the radio broadcasts. Enough for *dozens* of launches. \n\nNone of which would happen for at least a year. These massive constructs slowly rolling by were only mockups, needed just to design and build the equally massive hardware to manipulate them. Ahead there would be months, yet, of training and testing shakedowns, but the outcome was as clear as this brilliant tropical winter\u0027s day: Layland Heavy Industries had *saved* the KSA. Rockomax would continue on, producing brackets and fittings and sundry things, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of \u0022The Company.\u0022\n\nAs it was, J.R. Kerman\u0027s unfortunate *accident* had received little attention. Valentina had been interviewed by various authorities, signed a short statement. Just a horrible, horrible accident. She didn\u0027t mention his offer. Or his threats. \n\nWhat was the point?\n\nSurrounded here by babbling Kerbals, catching snippets here and there, \u0022Layland has saved us... Layland the genius! Layland, the Hero! Layland for President! Layland for *King!*\u0022 the harsh reality of this place was also blindingly clear.\n\nShe had been wrong. About *everything*.\n\n*Never make noise, do what you must to survive. And never, \u003Cu\u003Eever\u003C/u\u003E take sides.*\n\nHer *Deda* had been right, in that time a world away. This force... this *power*... that could drive haughty, self-absorbed Donald Nelson Kerman to suicide for its own ends, that could toss away devoted J.R. Kerman like so much trash as soon as his usefulness expired, that broke every rival and then devoured them...\n\nSadly, alone in the throng, she shook her head. It was often said, that the Imperium ruled the Ussari Union with an iron fist, but this place...\n\nThis place was ruled by a silken whisper, from a fleeting shadow. And how could she fight that?\n\nHow could *anyone?*\n\nAnd what would the cost be even now, to the ones she cared for? Now, that the predator had her scent. For now, only one thing was certain. \n\nIt was time to go home.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-31T07:28:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2020 07:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-02T06:30:35Z","Content":"Well we knew things were heading that way from *Shadows*... but darn. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022) \n\nPoor Bob.

He squinted tearing eyes, cursing for the thousandth time for putting himself in this unfortunate position. Never, never again would he switch out the crew chief\u0027s coffee with decaf. \n\nNot even the thickest bunny ears he could find, stuffed full of tissues, seemed to make the slightest dent in this infernal noise. With arms that trembled, he continued to guide the wailing Converter toward its parking spot. \n\nAt last, at *long* last, its wheels reached the painted marker on the ground. Gus raised the paddles in an X over his head, then drew one back and forth across his throat over and over again. Finally, the shrieking racket began to abate. He slid the chocks around one strange-looking wheel, then wandered off to go rethink his life. \n\nOccasionally rapping at his head with a fist. \n\nBehind him, the small crowd of Kerbals cautiously approached the aircraft, also rapping at their heads or making silly \u0022oooo-WAAAH\u0022 faces to clear their own ears. The hull door slid open and a face appeared, one Valentina was exceptionally glad to see. \n\n\u0022TIIIIIIAAAAAAA!\u0022 Dibella squealed as she hopped down from the plane, \u0022I--*oh!*\u0022 She twisted her ankle on a small rock on the pavement, taking two or three long, stumbling steps before crashing headlong into--\n\n\u0022I\u0027ve got you!\u0022 Jorrigh smiled down, having deftly caught her about mid-chest. They stared at each other for a moment, then both blushed furiously and they quickly separated themselves, with lots of awkward coughing and furtive glances. \n\nValentina gaped. It seemed to take Dibella a minute to realize why she was there in the first place. \n\n\u0022Oh... *TIA!*\u0022 She recovered and glomped into Valentina, \u0022I\u0027ve missed you *so* much!\u0022\n\nValentina enjoyed the welcome, slightly crushing hug, \u0022I have missed you too,\u0022 she nodded toward the Converter, \u0022were you able to...\u0022\n\nDibella grinned, and winked, and... glanced back at Jorrigh.\n\nWith a roll of her eyes, Valentina turned to the small crowd. Feeling more than a bit awkward once again, she spoke slowly and carefully. \n\n\u0022My friends! This is my other good friend and comrade, Dibella Kermanov, of the Ussari Space Program,\u0022 nods and friendly mutters, \u0022where I come from, in Kerberia, it is an old tradition, when a guest departs, to present their host with small tokens of their appreciation.\u0022\n\nShe approached Jorrigh, who was not at all glancing back at Dibella when he thought she wasn\u0027t looking, and offered a hand, \u0022Jorrigh, my friend, I shall see you again in one month, no?\u0022\n\n\u0022No... I mean, yes! I mean..,\u0022 his attention stumbled, then he straightened, and said in Ussari, \u0022I am this yuo, blue of cats, where cheese abundance.\u0022\n\nValentina opened her mouth. \n\nValentina closed her mouth. \n\nJorrigh\u0027s face fell into a dejected pout that, by the look on *her* face, Dibella found rather adorable, \u0022I\u0027ll never learn Ussari, will I?\u0022\n\n\u0022I have just the thing,\u0022 Valentina grinned, then nodded to Dibella, who was--\n\nValentina cleared her throat. \n\n\u0022Huh? Oh!\u0022 Squeaked Dibella in a very un-Dibella-like way, before scurrying back over to the Converter and returning, with difficulty, carrying an enormous book that was quite a bit thicker than it was tall. She passed it to Valentina, herself nearly buckling under the weight, who passed it to Jorrigh. His eyes moved over the Kerillic letters on the cover, brow pinched, lips moving slightly, before the pout returned. \n\n\u0022Is Student\u0027s Edition Compilation of Greatest Ussari Literature: War, Peace, Crime, Punishment, Pride, Prejudice, and a Nasty Hernia. You read *this*,\u0022 Valentina laid a hand on the cover, \u0022and soon you speak like *real* Ussari, *D\u0414*?\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*! I mean, yes... I mean... thanks!\u0022 Jorrigh said, but he had gone back to absolutely *not* peeking at Dibella who was absolutely *not* peeking back at him. \n\nValentina sighed, and stepped to Edmund, \u0022Mister Edmund, or shall I now say *Commander?*\u0022\n\nHe grinned as he shook her hand, \u0022hah, I suppose the cat\u0027s out of the bag, now. Never expected to get the first Mule flight, after everything.\u0022\n\n\u0022It is well deserved,\u0022 she smiled back, \u0022have you chosen your crew yet?\u0022\n\n\u0022I do need an experienced pilot, I was thinking of asking Jorrigh, here--\u0022 he turned to Jorrigh, and stopped, his grin widening, \u0022well, would you look at that...\u0022\n\nJorrigh seemed to be flexing his arms a *bit* more than was strictly necessary to heft the massive book. Had... had he always had biceps like that? And did... yes, Dibella *did* just bat her eyelashes at him! Valentina groaned. She suspected that, book or no book, Jorrigh\u0027s Ussari skills would shortly be making an uncanny improvement. \n\nEdmund chuckled, \u0022hope that doesn\u0027t distract from his training. Anyway, Gene wants one of the rookies along too, as an engineer. Got my eye on one fellow, bright kid, learns fast. And when he fixes something, well it *stays* fixed, by gum!\u0022\n\n\u0022I wish you all the best,\u0022 Valentina said, then cleared her throat at Dibella again, who was absolutely *positively* not making eyes at Jorrigh who was *absolutely* not blushing furiously again. After another delay, Dibella returned with a small, oblong box.\n\n\u0022You will be doing much documenting on your historic flight,\u0022 Valentina handed him the box, \u0022you may find this useful.\u0022\n\nEdmund opened it, and his eyes grew wide.\n\n\u0022Is latest in cutting-edge transcription technology!\u0022 She pointed, \u0022titanium and stainless steel frame is light as it is strong, nitrogen-pressurized cartridge works under water, in vacuum, even in zero-G; and synthetic polymer ink is impervious to any temperature extreme. Is first released production model, straight from factory, with serial number.\u0022\n\n\u0022Wow...\u0022 He muttered, transfixed, \u0022ain\u0027t that a thing...\u0022 Gingerly, he lifted the pen from its box. He turned it over in his fingers, watching the light glint off the slotted, machined surface, hefted the weight, held it up, and sighted along the perfectly straight barrel.\n\n\u0022I mean, I was just gonna use a pencil, but *this* is incredible,\u0022 he slid it into his shirt pocket, and took her hand once more, \u0022if there\u0027s ever anything I can do for you, just ask.\u0022\n\nValentina smiled, \u0022we will meet again, soon.\u0022\n\nJerdous was waiting for her next, \u0022*Vseh blag, moy drug*, we will watch your career with great interest.\u0022\n\nShe looked around, confused, \u0022who is \u0027we?\u0027\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, just a little more archaeologist humor,\u0022 he grinned, \u0022don\u0027t mind me.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, um,\u0022 she thought for a minute, \u0022do not, how you say? Quit your day job.\u0022\n\nAn eye roll, \u0022we do tend to be a dry lot. Moisture\u0027s generally bad for the artifacts.\u0022\n\nValentina looked to Dibella again, who had once more gotten waylaid passing by Jorrigh and was absolutely, *positively* not gazing sidelong as him when he was absolutely positively not gazing sidelong at her.\n\n\u0022*Ahem*,\u0022 grunted Valentina. Dibella sheepishly brought another box. \n\nFrowning, Jerdous carefully removed the item inside. He held it up, turned it back and forth, a wooden hoop laced with a web of fine twine, flanked by dangling feathers.\n\n\u0022I...\u0022 He paused, then grinned widely at Valentina, \u0022I have absolutely *no* idea what this is!\u0022\n\n\u0022They are very rare, even in Kerberia,\u0022 she explained, \u0022is custom of the people who live even deeper in the taiga than I did.\u0022 Jerdous blinked at her.\n\n\u0022Is a dreamcatcher. Hang over your bed, and it will stop bad dreams, and only let good through.\u0022\n\n\u0022Bad dreams?\u0022 He muttered to himself, a subtle flood of emotions cascading over his face, creasing his brow. At length, he gave an odd little smile, \u0022thank you. I\u0027ll always keep it close.\u0022\n\nValentina took his offered hand, \u0022in two months, I will be watching your launch eagerly. If they let me. Good luck to you.\u0022\n\n\u0022Thanks,\u0022 Jerdous smiled again, then nodded towards his brother, \u0022good luck with *him*, too. You wouldn\u0027t believe what it took just to get him to show up.\u0022 Burdous just glowered at the both of them over crossed arms.\n\nAnother glance to Dibella, another loud \u0022*ahem!*\u0022 *\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DVS SH\u0424\u0417*, *really?!* Had they even said a single word to each other yet? Another box proffered. Burdous just harrumphed and scowled. Valentina rolled her eyes, removed the top, and held it up again.\n\nHis eyes betrayed him and glanced down for an instant, but he continued his glare. They glanced down again, flicked to Valentina, scowl. Glance, flick, scowl. Flick, glance, scowl. Pout, glance, flick, double scowl. Then they locked on the item and stayed. A furrow worked its way across his forehead. Cautiously, as if expecting it to bite, he reached into the box... slowly drew the thing out... eyes flicking back and forth between it and Valentina all the time... held it up to view... and then, made the *most* undignified noise deep in his throat. \n\nHis bulging eyes grew till they took up most of his face, \u0022it\u0027s..! It\u0027s..!\u0022 They shot to Valentina, \u0022how did you get this?!\u0022 Back to the thing, \u0022you can\u0027t *get* these here! You just... you *can\u0027t!*\u0022 back to her, \u0022*who did you kill?!*\u0022 Back to the thing, \u0022how did you *get* this?!\u0022\n\nHis brother finally leaned over with a questioning eye... bulge.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s...\u0022 Burdous squealed like a schoolchild, \u0022it\u0027s a Solpugids tour shirt from the Crimson Square show!\u0022 He rounded on Valentina again, \u0022how did you *get* this?!\u0022\n\nShe turned to share a sly look with Dibella, who was... Oh *ST\u0414LI\u0419S S\u0428\u0417\u0414T\u0423 S\u0424C\u041AS!*\n\nBurdous chirruped again, \u0022it\u0027s *signed!*\u0022 balled the shirt up to his face and inhaled deeply, \u0022it smells of magic marker and sweat!\u0022 And made an even more undignified noise. Valentina grinned in spite of herself. \n\n\u0022*Thank you*,\u0022 he said with glistening eyes, \u0022I will treasure it. Always.\u0022 He wrapped her in a warm, genuine, not-at-all-creepy hug.\n\nGene assisted in peeling Burdous off and left him to cuddle with his shirt, still making disturbing little cooing sounds. \n\n\u0022It\u0027s been a true honor to have you with us,\u0022 Gene said, wiping his hands on his slacks, \u0022we\u0027re down but we\u0027re not out yet.\u0022\n\nAnd then, a bit more formally, \u0022may this be the start of a new era of fraternity and cooperation between our peoples and efforts.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 Valentina smiled, \u0022this is only the beginning.\u0022\n\nShe didn\u0027t bother looking to Dibella, just walked back to the Converter herself to fetch the box from the hatchway, adding as she passed, \u0022*ST\u0414LI\u0419S ST\u0414CH\u0417*, just kiss and get it over with already.\u0022 Dibella and Jorrigh looked at her, looked at each other, looked at the ground and blushed new and fascinating shades of red and green. \n\nValentina held the new box out to Gene, \u0022a nesting doll, right?\u0022 he asked.\n\n\u0022Like your speech, are many figures,\u0022 she said, \u0022and many layers. Great things have solid hearts, deep inside. Now, you, too, will become great. Always remember, what is inside.\u0022 And inwardly winced. She hoped that sounded profound enough.\n\nCradling the large wooden doll in his hands, and looking better than he had in many days, Gene smiled, \u0022thank you. I hope to see you again soon.\u0022\n\nShe took his hand in a firm grip, \u0022to beginnings, then?\u0022\n\n\u0022To beginnings,\u0022 Gene beamed. \n\nAnd finally, she approached... \u0022Chadvey.\u0022\n\n\u0022Valentina,\u0022 he grinned... and bowed, \u0022Ah\u0027m a new Kerb, thanks to you.\u0022\n\nShe glanced down, smirking, \u0022one who is still not opposed to wearing skirts, I see.\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s the ancient tartan of mah family!\u0022 he huffed, \u0022and besides, it breathes well in the humidity, and this sporran is *absolutely* practical for carryin\u0027 things.\u0022\n\n\u0022If you say so,\u0022 winked Valentina, then looked to Dibella, who was... actually standing right beside her for once, holding the proper box. With a sly glance from the other Kerbelle, she passed the entire oblong, rather heavy box to Chadvey. He lifted the lid off and pulled back a bit of the white tissue paper packing, revealing a large bottle, or perhaps jar, filled with green liquid. \n\n\u0022Aye, Ah do believe Ah know what this is,\u0022 he smirked as he unwrapped it, \u0022a wee dram of some of that famous, thrice-distilled Ussari ***GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!***\u0022\n\nChadvey Kerman jumped a full meter into the air, sending the box flying, but Valentina deftly caught the bottle without missing a beat. \n\n\u0022*What in the bloody green blazes is that?!*\u0022 He pointed, trying to hide behind a rather bewildered-looking Gene. Valentina held the jar up. \n\n\u0022Is pickled mosquito head,\u0022 she grinned, then waved her hand vaguely, \u0022is only small one, though. Apparently is some silly import regulation on preserved insects over three kilograms, I do not understand such things.\u0022\n\nChadvey slowly approached and poked at the jar with a hollow, jar-like *bunk-bunk* sound, \u0022it *is* dead, right?\u0022\n\nShe frowned at him, \u0022oh, no no no. The heads, they usually grow back. Is great renewable resource,\u0022 she pointed at the head, \u0022the proboscis muscles are very tender, go well with *borscht* and *pelmeni*, and the eyes make delicious spread for crackers or toast.\u0022\n\n\u0022Is that... so?\u0022 Chadvey sounded less than convinced, but took the jar/bottle anyway, being sure to keep it upright, then shrugged and smiled broadly, \u0022Ah am goin\u0027 to miss you. Don\u0027t be a stranger.\u0022\n\n\u0022This place is quite strange enough already,\u0022 Valentina said with a wry grin, \u0022but... I shall miss you too. We *will* meet again.\u0022 They hugged, and kissed cheeks, she went to return to the Converter, but... paused. \n\nA little ways off, the spaceplane pilots were huddled together, now in cadet blue, looking lost and rudderless. Had they always been standing there? Valentina stared at them a moment longer, none of them quite meeting her eyes.\n\nShe pursed her lips, and nodded to herself. Stiffening, and making tight, formal, corners, she stepped up to Waterfowl, stopping in front of him with a click of her heel. She touched fingers to her temple in a precise and slow salute, seeing confusion in his eyes. Then she unpinned the gold and ruby pilot\u0027s wings from her collar, took the other Kerbal\u0027s hand, and pressed the emblem into it. \n\nHe looked at it, uncomprehending, for a moment, before snapping a salute in return... then lowering his hand in understanding. \n\n\u0022I\u0027ll be your wingkerb any day,\u0022 he said as Valentina shook it. \n\n\u0022No,\u0022 she smiled, \u0022I will be *yours*.\u0022\n\nAnd then the two of them looked up in confusion as, somewhere, a single electric guitar belted out a triumphant anthem. \n\nValentina just shrugged. These people were so *strange*.\n\nAfter more handshakes and salutes, she headed back towards the Converter again, pausing to collect Dibella who was still adamantly, inexorably *not* looking at Jorrigh who was adamantly, inexorably *not* looking back at her.\n\n\u0022She does speak Kerblish, you know,\u0022 Valentina said to no one in particular as she dragged Dibella away by her collar and ushered her into the aircraft. With a shy grin, Jorrigh gave a hesitant little wave. , Valentina hoisted herself on board, rolling her eyes\n\nIgor was collapsed off to one side, a hand tenaciously clutching a twisted longeron, his oxygen mask still in place. Frowning, she followed the hose back to its cylinder... and the one next to it marked \u0027halothane.\u0027 She shot Dibella a glare.\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t look at me,\u0022 the other Kerbelle pleaded, \u0022it was *his* idea!\u0022 She nodded to Junior Lieutenant Kerman, who was trying rather unsuccessfully to hide behind the pilot\u0027s seat. He quickly vacated once more, and stood next to it, quivering, with a terrified \u0022please don\u0027t eat me\u0022 grin frozen on his face.\n\n\u0022Lieutenant...\u0022 Valentina grumbled. \n\nHe quickly shot a trembling salute. \n\nOnce more she rolled her eyes... and smiled, \u0022get back in the seat.\u0022\n\nOutside, the engines soon began their slow climb towards ear-shattering. Valentina hung in the open doorway, and waved one last time before the noise sent people scattering.\n\n\u0022Goodbye, and *do svidaniya*, my friends, I *will* see you all again!\u0022\n\nRising on a cacophony, once more repelled from the ground by its own din, the Converter took to the air. Valentina slid the door shut and took her seat, thoughts rushing into her mind as any possibility for conversation fled before the noise. Besides, Dibella was still at the window-- *oh for P\u0426TI\u0419S sake!!!!!*  \n\nThe aircraft lumbered off to the north, climbing steadily, passing over the runway, the perimeter fence, and a blackened tree stump already being reclaimed by weeds. Valentina remembered, once, thinking she had been brought here for a reason. To *do* something. She shook her head. Such silliness, that wasn\u0027t like her. And even if she had, well... whatever she had been brought here for, she had failed. That much was plain. \n\nThe little bundle of emotions in the back of her mind stirred again, but she pushed it away. It seemed to be getting dimmer, anyway. These were good people, *strong* people. Strange, too, but... they would be alright. Plotting corporations... sinister whispers... *frogs*... It was all just politics. And amphibians. Not her business. And even if it was... what could *she* do, a peasant girl from the taiga?\n\nAnother wave of coolness flashed across the gem against her skin. A rational explanation, surely. A rational explanation for all of this. Because if there *wasn\u0027t*... shuddering, she pushed that thought away, too. \n\nDon\u0027t make noise. *Survive*. And never, *ever* take sides. If you did... the Kerbs in the night would come... or perhaps the night itself. But what was worse... what truly terrified her, beyond even what she would admit to herself... the darkness might not only come with chains, but with an *offer*.\n\nAnd there would always be... a price. \n\nOn a warm, tropical winter evening, a small, loud, lonely airplane turned away toward the west, toward the mountains and the setting sun.
