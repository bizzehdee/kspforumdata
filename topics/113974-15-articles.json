An insistent chill against her drew her intention. She pulled the M\u00FCnstone from beneath her shirt. It was cold to the touch again, not freezing, but she had the feeling it had been even colder a moment ago. It seemed to warm much faster than a big lump of metal should as she turned it over in her hands.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe brilliant, lens-shaped crimson stone almost seemed to glow, probably just a trick of the morning sunlight streaming in the window. She turned it this way and that, watching the light refract and dance within. The stone was quite translucent, but Valentina realized she couldn\u0027t see the back of the titanium setting through it. It just seemed to go on and on forever, filled with fragile shafts of light. There was a sudden, unpleasant sense of \u003Cem\u003Ed\u00E9j\u00E0 vu\u003C/em\u003E... like she was falling \u003Cem\u003Einto \u003C/em\u003Ethe stone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t feel that unusual, just a big gemstone. Not that she had much experience with such things. Solid, yet as she ran a thumb over the surface Valentina marveled at how smooth it was. Slick, almost as if it were wet--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer eyes widened with recognition. It seemed like a lifetime ago, could it really only have been a few months? The way the light played inside the stone, the sense of falling... no, \u003Cem\u003Erising\u003C/em\u003E... rising toward the light... It reminded her of a time she had risen through an olive sea, at the very edge of life, surrounded by ominous shadows... and fragile shafts of light stretching on into infinity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe lifted the M\u00FCnstone and frowned at it. What \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0this thing, anyway? Her eyes moved to the reddish bands across her fingers, punctuated here and there by a tiny blister. It looked like frostbite, but surely that couldn\u0027t be right. Just another trick of the light, or perhaps some allergic reaction...\u00A0Rising, she moved to the mirror over her small sink. The stripes across her neck were only a little worse, barely even an itch. A few larger spots on her chest. And yet...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast night, listening to Chadvey, the stone had burned, \u003Cem\u003Eburned\u003C/em\u003E, not with ice but with fire. Burned with all the intensity of her nightmares. Yet it hadn\u0027t left a single mark on her. Dibella had said that according to legend, M\u00FCnstones had mystical powers. That was just silly stories and and old fairy tales...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a sigh, she pushed the thoughts away and dressed. She needed to go talk to Gene. Why could no one see what was happening around here? Last night, Chadvey had gone on to mention how this \u0027Layland Kerman\u0027 had built his empire. Buying patents, stealing designs. Running other companies into bankruptcy and then snatching them up for a song.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe paused.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does one purchase an entire company, even a bankrupt one, for a song? Perhaps that\u0027s why Ol\u0027 Sam\u0027s bar was so popular.\u00A0It all seemed very strange, but these were strange people with strange laws.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, maybe a- she rolled her eyes- \u003Cem\u003Eforeign\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0perspective could could bring light to the situation. Make Gene see reason. Layland\u0027s rockets had saved the Ussari Space Program, but... it was different here. The Union had the Imperium to keep Layland in check, he could never scheme against them. Only... hadn\u0027t the Empress done just that?

No time for fairy tales and stories now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd paused. The stark shadows from the late morning sun seemed to move and dance for a moment. Drifting clouds perhaps. She looked again to the stone. This was Dibella\u0027s. This was home. She shifted it back over her head again, tucked it away beneath her shirt, and reached for the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUgh, why couldn\u0027t they see what was right in front of their faces?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe elevator doors \u003Cem\u003Ebing\u003C/em\u003Eed open, and Valentina stepped out into a cacophony of clacking typewriters. She made her way past them, nodded to Sally, the ever-smiling secretary behind the big desk at the end of the room, then headed down the long hallway to Gene\u0027s office. Like that office, the narrow hall was festooned with space-themed artwork and various photographs. Valentina paused at one now, one she must have passed before without noticing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn it, a group of smiling people drove shovels into the ground. She recognized Gene in the center, a bit younger if every bit as haggard. Flanking him on one side was a regal-looking lady who could only be the Queen of Omork. On the other, a handsome fellow she remembered from other pictures as a former President of Kleptogart. He looked quite young to hold such an office; a shame, what happened to him. On the other side of the Queen was a Kerb who was the spitting image of poor Jebediah. His brother, Bob, she surmised. And opposite him, next to the President...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe didn\u0027t look all that remarkable. He bore the same official smile as the others, wore the same finely-tailored clothes. Even had an undeniably regal bearing. Valentina hadn\u0027t missed J.R. standing just off to his side, hands folded, with that ever-present feral smile. \u003Cem\u003EThis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0must be Layland Kerman. He didn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like a murderer, but, she supposed, such people rarely did.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRaised voices further down the hall pulled her attention away from the photograph. Gene\u0027s door was open, as it always was, and it appeared he already had a visitor. It sounded like Chadvey.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeeling a bit guilty, she crept closer.

One hand brought a single finger to his lips, the other drew back his black suit coat, showing the grip of what was tucked into his belt.

He nodded toward the main room, letting his coat drop but keeping his thumb hooked over his belt nearby, never taking his steely eyes off her. Valentina grit her teeth, and began walking.

All the while she cursed herself, for letting her guard down, for not seeing the obvious. J.R. led her across the campus, past more people blindly going about their days. Blindly, save for that tiny mental seed that why yes, they \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0seen J.R. that day, walking with around Valentina like the \u003Cem\u003Ebest\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of friends...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, they came to a wide, open area not far from the Research Center, but just distant \u003Cem\u003Eenough\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0from everyone else.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s far enough,\u0022 he spat, and shoved her forward. Valentina took three or four stumbling, off balance steps, trying not to go sprawling onto the pavement. She spun around, squinting against the sun now glaring down into her eyes. J.R. just grinned from beneath the shadow of his silly, wide-brimmed black hat. His face seemed to disappear into that shadow, save for those chill eyes and that horrible, horrible grin. His teeth almost looked sharper. He stood there, implacable, his thumbs casually hooked into his belt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What do you want?\u0022 Valentina spat again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, it\u0027s not about what Ah want, it\u0027s about what \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0want,\u0022 he slithered, \u0022though it does seem the scales have shifted.

At her chest, the last warm flares of the M\u00FCnstone slowed, then faded away. A pall of oily black smoke rose over the nearby research center. Around her, blood soaked into the thirsty, burning pavement like the bitter understanding now soaking into her mind. For just an instant, she\u0027d thought she\u0027d seen... felt... but no.

Days, since the moment she\u0027d faced J.R. beneath the blistering sun. Today, wandering clouds tempered that sun, while a pleasant breeze brought fresh, clean air from the sea.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe massive form crept by on its hundred-wheeled self-propelled modular trailer, still clad in bright white shrink wrap. Despite laying on its side, only half a meter above the ground on its carrier, it towered nearly four meters over Valentina\u0027s head, and seemed to stretch in either direction to infinity. And this was only one piece.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey called it \u0022Colossus.\u0022 Someone had explained the word to her. It fit. It was the largest, heaviest, most powerful rocket ever conceived anywhere, by anyone. Five hundred tonnes at launch, nearly double the heaviest lifter the Ussaris had, with an estimated 25 tonnes to orbit. A number that was expected to increase.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn one fell swoop, the foundering Kerbal Space Administration was now poised to lap the mighty Ussari Space Program. As the enormous stage pivoted away around an impossibly tight corner, Valentina could plainly see why. Even beneath their protective shrink wrap, the resemblance of the four main engines to the ones that powered nearly every Ussari rocket was undeniable. Only these were much, \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0larger.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing the enormous core stage, came a much more ordinary looking crate behind an ordinary looking truck, the angular \u0022Layland Heavy Industries\u0022 logo plain on both. The murmurs of the crowd rose in intensity. Inside, was the Medium Utility Launch-Experimental. Everyone just called it the Mule. Valentina didn\u0027t get the reference. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere, was the KSA\u0027s long-awaited answer to the Union\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EZarya\u003C/em\u003E, a three-person spacecraft that could maneuver, dock, and, some whispered, even go to the M\u00FCn. Controlling it would be a state-of-the-art computer system supplied through a partnership with Wutani Kokuni. They called it, the Mechanical JEB. Neither the slight nor the irony was lost on Valentina.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehind the crate on its truck, more immense shapes stretched off in a long line towards the port, where tankers waited in turns to offload their cargo of cheap, storable, \u003Cem\u003Esafe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0propellium. At least, that\u0027s what the faces on the news programs said, the newspaper articles, the radio broadcasts.

These massive constructs slowly rolling by were only mockups, needed just to design and build the equally massive hardware to manipulate them. Ahead there would be months, yet, of training and testing shakedowns, but the outcome was as clear as this brilliant tropical winter\u0027s day: Layland Heavy Industries had \u003Cem\u003Esaved\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the KSA.

With a sly glance from the other Kerbelle, she passed the entire oblong, rather heavy box to Chadvey. He lifted the lid off and pulled back a bit of the white tissue paper packing, revealing a large bottle, or perhaps jar, filled with green liquid.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aye, Ah do believe Ah know what this is,\u0022 he smirked as he unwrapped it, \u0022a wee dram of some of that famous, thrice-distilled Ussari \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey Kerman jumped a full meter into the air, sending the box flying, but Valentina deftly caught the bottle without missing a beat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EWhat in the bloody green blazes is that?!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 He pointed, trying to hide behind a rather bewildered-looking Gene.

Don\u0027t be a stranger.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This place is quite strange enough already,\u0022 Valentina said with a wry grin, \u0022but... I shall miss you too. We \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0meet again.\u0022 They hugged, and kissed cheeks, she went to return to the Converter, but... paused.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA little ways off, the spaceplane pilots were huddled together, now in cadet blue, looking lost and rudderless. Had they always been standing there? Valentina stared at them a moment longer, none of them quite meeting her eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pursed her lips, and nodded to herself. Stiffening, and making tight, formal, corners, she stepped up to Waterfowl, stopping in front of him with a click of her heel. She touched fingers to her temple in a precise and slow salute, seeing confusion in his eyes. Then she unpinned the gold and ruby pilot\u0027s wings from her collar, took the other Kerbal\u0027s hand, and pressed the emblem into it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked at it, uncomprehending, for a moment, before snapping a salute in return... then lowering his hand in understanding.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll be your wingkerb any day,\u0022 he said as Valentina shook it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No,\u0022 she smiled, \u0022I will be \u003Cem\u003Eyours\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the two of them looked up in confusion as, somewhere, a single electric guitar belted out a triumphant anthem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina just shrugged. These people were so \u003Cem\u003Estrange\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter more handshakes and salutes, she headed back towards the Converter again, pausing to collect Dibella who was still adamantly, inexorably \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0looking at Jorrigh who was adamantly, inexorably \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0looking back at her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022She does speak Kerblish, you know,\u0022 Valentina said to no one in particular as she dragged Dibella away by her collar and ushered her into the aircraft. With a shy grin,\u00A0Jorrigh gave a hesitant little wave. , Valentina hoisted herself on board, rolling her eyes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgor was collapsed off to one side, a hand tenaciously clutching a twisted longeron, his oxygen mask still in place. Frowning, she followed the hose back to its cylinder... and the one next to it marked \u0027halothane.\u0027\u00A0She shot Dibella a glare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t look at me,\u0022 the other Kerbelle pleaded, \u0022it was \u003Cem\u003Ehis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0idea!\u0022 She nodded to Junior Lieutenant Kerman, who was trying rather unsuccessfully to hide behind the pilot\u0027s seat. He quickly vacated once more, and stood next to it, quivering, with a terrified \u0022please don\u0027t eat me\u0022 grin frozen on his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lieutenant...\u0022 Valentina grumbled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe quickly shot a trembling salute.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce more she rolled her eyes... and smiled, \u0022get back in the seat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside, the engines soon began their slow climb towards ear-shattering. Valentina hung in the open doorway, and waved one last time before the noise sent people scattering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Goodbye, and \u003Cem\u003Edo svidaniya\u003C/em\u003E, my friends, I \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0see you all again!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRising on a cacophony, once more repelled from the ground by its own din, the Converter took to the air. Valentina slid the door shut and took her seat, thoughts rushing into her mind as any possibility for conversation fled before the noise. Besides, Dibella was still at the window-- \u003Cem\u003Eoh for P\u0426TI\u0419S\u00A0sake!!!!! \u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aircraft lumbered off to the north, climbing steadily, passing over the runway, the perimeter fence, and a blackened tree stump already being reclaimed by weeds. Valentina remembered, once, thinking she had been brought here for a reason. To \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0something. She shook her head. Such silliness, that wasn\u0027t like her. And even if she had, well... whatever she had been brought here for, she had failed. That much was plain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe little bundle of emotions in the back of her mind stirred again, but she pushed it away. It seemed to be getting dimmer, anyway. These were good people, \u003Cem\u003Estrong\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0people. Strange, too, but... they would be alright. Plotting corporations... sinister whispers... \u003Cem\u003Efrogs\u003C/em\u003E... It was all just politics. And amphibians. Not her business. And even if it was... what could \u003Cem\u003Eshe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0do, a peasant girl from the taiga?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother wave of coolness flashed across the gem against her skin. A rational explanation, surely. A rational explanation for all of this. Because if there \u003Cem\u003Ewasn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E... shuddering, she pushed that thought away, too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t make noise. \u003Cem\u003ESurvive\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0And never, \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0take sides. If you did... the Kerbs in the night would come... or perhaps the night itself. But what was worse... what truly terrified her, beyond even what she would admit to herself... the darkness might not only come with chains, but with an \u003Cem\u003Eoffer\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there would always be... a price.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a warm, tropical winter evening, a small, loud, lonely airplane turned away toward the west, toward the mountains and the setting sun.
