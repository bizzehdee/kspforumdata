There is some speculative indication that Intercept is not going to leverage the ECS/DOTS, which is what you want to spread load between cores efficiently in latest versions of Unity,\u00A0so while we expect better thread usage, it\u0027s likely that single-thread performance is still going to be very important. If you have an older AMD processor, you might need to upgrade. Zen2 or later will probably be fine, as that matches Gen 9 consoles and competes favorably with similarly priced Intel processors in single-thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be on par with PS5, you want something like AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or Intel Core i7 10700K. You can go a bit older on Intel side and still match that performance, but older AMD processors might struggle due to poor single-thread performance. Of course, min-spec might be considerably lower. I\u0027m just confident that it won\u0027t be higher than that if they want the game to perform well on Gen 9 consoles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, right now is a bad time to buy CPU, so you might as well wait and see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
