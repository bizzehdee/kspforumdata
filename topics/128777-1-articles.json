My ship-prototypes tend to sink, while my test-submarines float happily. Both have a tendency to break apart when I get them into water. Ok, I heard that filled ore tanks are good for ballast, but that\u0027s the end of my expertise. What to use for propulsion? And for steering? Some smart way to get to water without hyperediting? Is there a way to EVA down there? I\u0027m looking for vague, general advice here. I\u0027m mainly interested in stock-solutions, but I don\u0027t mind a few targeted mods either if it\u0027s needed for certain tasks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... how should a spacelubber start to conquer the waters of Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T22:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, if you want to play with boats and subs, do yourself a favor and get the Vessel Placer mod.\u00A0 Then you can just dunk your stuff in the water with minimal wasted time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, boats are relatively easy.\u00A0 Most parts in KSP still float, just don\u0027t load them down with scads of engins and I-beams and you\u0027ll be OK.\u00A0 For propulsion, use jet engines.\u00A0 You do, however, need a fair amount of thrust to travel at any speed.\u00A0 Steering is done by normal control surfiaces which can be in the air or in the water.\u00A0 The main trouble with boats is that parts that if\u00A0at some point are completely out of the water ever touch the water again, the games checks to see if they break.\u00A0 This puts a real cap on survivable speed because boats plane up as they accelerate, lifting the bow.\u00A0 If the bow part ever gets clear of the water, it will likely break when you slow down and it touches water again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for subs, I recommend one of several mods for them.\u00A0 Ore sucks for ballast because you can\u0027t get any more of it once in the water (which is hard-coded to have zero so you can\u0027t drill the sea bottom).\u00A0 Thus, releasing ore ballast is a 1-time thing with a 1-way trip to the surface.\u00A0 It\u0027s only really useful for submersibles like the real Trieste that basically go straight down and straight back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
