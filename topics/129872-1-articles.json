And the further your decoupler is from the CoT, the greater the shear forces on your strut. Any difference in thrust vectoring between your central stack and the booster is going to magnify those forces. A single metal rod would never be used to hold the bottom of a booster to the core stack. You\u0027d want to attach the booster very firmly at the bottom so that it doesn\u0027t budge in any direction, and then strut it at the top so that it doesn\u0027t flex along its length.
