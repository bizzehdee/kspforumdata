Compared to other parts I\u0027m guessing that their helmets have a diameter around 0.625m or slightly smaller, so a hole that size, they should be able to squeeze through. Would be cool to have the original Kerbal model from the game as a scale reference for stuff like this, so we don\u0027t have to trial and error these things anymore...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T20:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd they\u0027re 1m tall, if you\u0027re using a base or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
