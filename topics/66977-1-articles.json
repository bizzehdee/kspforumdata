I do not see any models, only a .dll which is the plugin and .ogg which are the sounds and a few .png which are the textures I assume for the UI. No parts. You will probably have to right click on a command pod to open the UI and set up chatterer while on the launch pad. Just a guess. I\u0027ll test some more later. Chatterer forum thread is here : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25367-0-23-Chatterer-v-0-5-9-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25367-0-23-Chatterer-v-0-5-9-2\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : I\u0027ve always wanted chatterer but just have not got around to it. I tested first with a probe and didn\u0027t have any luck. Could have been just because I didn\u0027t know what I was looking for. My second try was with a manned command pod, and after launch I heard chatter right off the bat. Also the UI is a green microphone icon that shows up to the left of the navball as seen here :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/86RH9DH.png\u0022 alt=\u002286RH9DH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit edit : also, after reading some more through the posts, I must ask if your are familiar with zip files and are unpacking them in the right place? If not, I\u0027ll show you the easiest way to do this if you like. Module manager is only needed for certain mods that must change large amounts of .cfg files as far as I know. I usually do this myself because I\u0027m old and stubborn, I don\u0027t want anything messing with my KSP install but me. Module manager is not needed in this case. Also, be careful with using texture replacers. If you have a newer computer with good specs and a good video card, go for it. But I have found that my old laptop just doesn\u0027t like them. I get serious lag with to many high-res textures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-28T01:13:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2014 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Otis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
