This is logical; when the unit is busy with the program it is instructed to execute, there is no time for another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow do you make 2 scripts run at the same time?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simple solution would be to make the two tasks run within the same script/program by mashing the code together. Another option is to create a program that calls two other programs like functions, for example, first \u003Cem\u003Eguidance\u003C/em\u003E, then \u003Cem\u003Estaging\u003C/em\u003E, then \u003Cem\u003Eguidance\u003C/em\u003E again et cetera. By updating values (for example, updating \u003Cem\u003Eheadvar1\u003C/em\u003E every time you run the guidance script) that were locked in the original program (setting \u003Cem\u003Elock steering to heading headvar1\u003C/em\u003E in your original program) instead of locking them from the function programs you prevent the lock from being broken upon ending the function program. You kind of interlace the two desired functions that way with the option to add even more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third option would be to use a second or even third kOS unit, and to use \u003Cem\u003Earchive\u003C/em\u003E or something like the time to trigger execution of two programs at the same time. That way you can have something akin to multithreading.
