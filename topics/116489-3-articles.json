It all depends on if the Nuke was able to pull fuel from the outer fuel tanks... Central engines sometimes have issues with pulling from radially attached tanks...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeagle attempt 3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot the craft off the ground just fine. Just gave it very tiny and light inputs like GoSlash27 did. kept it at about 10 deg angle until 10Km where I stopped giving it any inputs at all and just let it fly strait. It accelerated pretty well up to the 20Km mark where I turned on the nuke. At about 25Km the rapiers had to switch to Closed cycle. At 32Km, the rapiers ran out of oxidizer. And finally at about 46Km, I ran out of acceleration, climb, and time and had to ditch the orbital attempt. Instead I shot for a landing on an island on the far side of Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft reentered on it\u0027s own, got quite hot, but held together. As the altitude got lower, I deployed the airbrakes and brought it down to speed so I felt safe enough to maneuver it. With a lot of it\u0027s fuel burned off, it actually flies better and can accept greater control inputs without freaking out. The descent was shallow and slow, intentionally, with the engines idling for a bit then flying dead stick for the rest of the way. I was able to get a nice clean touch down at about 90m/s, but the craft flexes so much that it ended up tipping on it\u0027s side a bit, breaking off it\u0027s wings, canards, both ram air intakes, the front two fuel tanks on the left engine, the Nuke engine, and two of the airbrakes due to flexing. The craft also broke its nose off after rocking back and forth a bit and lost the passanger section behind that before coming to a stop. Luckily the cockpit survived being wrenched off the craft so both kerbals survived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResults, the craft was battered, busted, and smoldering, but at least it landed.

If you move the main wings back a bit, the craft suddenly becomes very forgiving and lets you get away with some wildly exaggerated pitch angles while still recovering. It still has a tendancy to over react while adjusting pitch though... issue is with how much flex there is in the two side engines and the wings attached to them. If it\u0027s made a bit more rigid, it looses the pitch issues and becomes a much smoother flier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T23:40:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 11:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T00:17:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes I tried flying it today fully loaded and any pitching maneuvers are just plane dangerous because the head just flexes so much it is going at a significant AOA different then the wings are. I did most of my flight testing nearly empty getting it to orbit my first try must have been from working with big heavy clunky craft from the payload challenge. A strut from cockpit to the back on the bottom should stiffen it up so it wont be so erratic but I think the best solution would be to move the COL back half way through the COM.

Part of the problem is the wing slats(elevons) you added to the front of the wings. They get confused some times... But, it flew up to orbit with no issues other then drifting off course due to the oscillation. Got it into a nice medium orbit of 136Km x 139Km around Kerbin with just the two pilots on board. I deployed the satellite which was easy to do, it deploys nicely. Then performed a retro burn and brought her back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe entry went off without a hitch, used airbrakes and initially had her nosed up 30 deg, until at about 40Km where she started to climb again. So I brought the angle down to only 20 degrees which continued to slow her down nicely and let her sink into the atmosphere. Only a few of the tanks and the rear elevons got warm during the descent, which is a little odd, but was a nice change. From this point on, I simply flew her in dead stick with no engines. I never felt the need to turn them on during re entry, I had no worries I would be able to land safely without them. I misjudged the approach to KSC and ended up landing on the grass next to the runway. The vamanos\u0027s landing gear placement let her soak the landing nicely and she had no issues at all with the slightly rough handling I gave her during the taxiing to the runway, still at fairly high speed. I felt comfortable throwing her about on the ground, she was nice and stable there.

Silly BadHat, supersonic on the runway is for land speed cars...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit took off smoothly, had no issues with maneuvering or flying strait. It transitioned smoothly from air breathing to rocket booth to orbit. I got the craft into a nice clean 80Km x 80Km orbit dispite my missing that is had a swivel instead of the nuke I\u0027ve gotten used to having behind a craft like this. I kind of over did it with the throttle during closed cycle stage so ended up wasting more fuel then I should of... oops...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn orbit, I found the debree I had floating up there and rescued one of the Kerbals, I noticed the external seat you had placed in the cargo bay and used that to bring an extra man back down planet side. I was not able to dock with the debree due to no docking port on the debree, but got close enough to touch the debree with the spaceplane and did the short eva to bring the kerbal into his seat on the BadHat. I believe this counts as a crew transfer right? The BadHat had sufficient RCS to move it about, but doesn\u0027t maneuver really quickly in all directions. Thankfully, the BadHat turns through SAS fairly well which more then makes up for the slight lacking in lateral RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe entry went well, the craft handled the heat of re entry without any issues, other then the command seat getting quite hot inside the cargo bay for some odd reason... Used the same 30 degree nose up \u002B airbrakes deployed trick that has been working splendedly for me with every spaceplane I\u0027ve flown in this contest. Once the speed was dropped below 900m/s I turned off the airbrakes and brought the nose down a bit, still letting it bleed off some speed. For the majority of the flight back home, I flew it dead stick, with the engines turned off to conserve fuel. But this craft does not glide very well... I had a very hard time keeping it on a nice glide slope during the flight too the KSC and ended up having to kick on the engines just before the mountains west of KSC, otherwise It would of been yet another mountain landing... There was more then enough thrust in the engines to bring the craft over the mountains, but due to my sloppy flight to space, there was very little fuel left. In fact, the fuel ran out just as I was passing over the other side of the mountains forcing me back into glide mode... I missed the runway, and KSC by a bit and landed in the rolling hills just west of the KSC. The craft had enough maneuvering to land on the hills but I was forced to deploy the brakes to keep it from rolling off into more of the hills. In doing so, the bottom airbrakes tore off. No other damage was sustained and the craft was recovered at 94% due to the distance from the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPurchase cost = 33,810\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erecovery value(x0.94) = 29,918\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecost score = -3.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 kerbal recovered from Kerbin orbit = 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etotal score = -1.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escore if landed at KSC would of been exactly 0... but I failed to anticipate the glide profile of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, A very nice craft to fly, superb job.

She accelerated well in lower altitudes, but started to taper off at higher ones. I had a little trouble getting her to stop climbing and just accelerate at about 11Km so ended up not getting as much speed built up as I would of liked early on. But, she kept accelerating all the way up to 17Km before needing the rockets to assist in the ascent. At this point, I nosed her up again and started racing for orbit. Getting her to 75Km went smoothly and she rounded out her orbit with fuel to spare. I still had the orbital debree, I mean space station, up in orbit at a close enough orbit to use for thansfering crew. I tried docking with the debree, I mean station, but found it easier to just wedge the Deliverance\u0027s nose into the station instead. The station didn\u0027t have a matching docking port being the only trouble I had. Crew transfer went smoothly and I left the station, spinning slightly erraticly from having the Deliverance wedged oddly into it\u0027s side, and proceeded to deorbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeorbit went smoothly as well. There was more then enough fuel to bring the deliverance into a 36Km orbit just over KSC. This reentry went the exact same as every other space plane I\u0027ve been flying. deploy brakes at 60Km and pitch nose up 30 degrees. This was probably the best reentry I\u0027ve made so far and produced one of the most beautiful scenes I\u0027ve seen in KSP in a long time. Once the crafts speed had been dropped to below 900m/s I once again brought her nose down and prepared to turn off the airbrakes and fly to the runway. And even though she glided pretty well, I decided to do a little fun flying as I made my way to the KSC by turning on the ramjets and just having some fun. She flies quite well when barely loaded with fuel, nearly as well as she does when fully loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI flew her right over the tall spire in the mountains west of the KSC, clearing the top by a mere 200m. The approach was slow and steady, barely needing any input from me to keep her on coarse. I had the engines idling again at this point, at around 8% thrust just to keep electric charge in the batteries. The landing was perfect, probably one of the best I\u0027ve made in this game. The craft responded nicely to the last second deployment of the brakes and the nose up stall I put her into to bring her speed down to 60m/s for landing. Touchdown went off without even a bump.

It felt very strange having a craft that lifts off from the runway with no input at all from the pilot. O_o Got her up to speed and altitude with little problems. Controls were a little sluggish, but that\u0027s simply due to the weight of Mk3 parts. Transition to LFO mode was a bit easier then you made it seem and the nukes did make getting orbital interesting once the craft ran out of oxidizer. I do have to say, this craft does not like to fly strait.... From 30Km too orbit I had to constantly put manual input into the controls to keep the craft pointing the correct way. she wanted to drift up/down all the time and kept throwing off the orbital trajectory. I did, after quite a long burn time with the nukes, get it into a nice 75km x 80 km oblong orbit(nothing wrong with that if your trying to catch, or be caught, by something in a different orbit.) Deployment of the 17tons of cargo went smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe deorbit burn was hairy to say the least, it kept changing pitch on me during the burn. Reentry was accomplished by fighting the pitch the whole way in, not really sure why I couldn\u0027t get the fuel ballanced enough to get it to fly level, I only had about 6,000 units of liquid fuel left in the craft after deorbit burn was completed. maybe it just needs more SAS reaction wheels to help keep it level, who knows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry went fairly well at first, but as I got deeper into the atmosphere, it became harder and harder to maintain pitch. I ended up having to ditch my normal reentry plan and level her off, hoping she could take the heat for a while longer. With her being as big of a craft as she is, and only having the 4 airbrakes, not being able to hold her at a steep pitch meant I could not slow her down well enough to land at KSC, I ended up overshooting it by over half the ocean east of KSC. Once she was lower in the atmosphere, I attempted to rebalance her fuel again, and brought the engines back online. I then proceeded to try turning the craft back around to fly back too the runway. there was more then enough fuel to do so. but, about half way through the turn, I lost hold of the craft and she went into a flat spin. I was unable to recover the craft, even with 8,000m of height to do so, I was never able to get her out of the flat spin or bring her nose down low enough to get the speed needed to pull out... all my fighting with the controls only ended with the craft crashing sideways into the ocean at 112m/s nothing survived...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad flight on my part...
