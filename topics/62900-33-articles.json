After ascent, it picks it up to come home. My simulation is to move the docked lander/orbiter as a unit to Duna orbit, split, and go from there. I\u0027ve tried this scenario two ways with different results:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - using a KCT simulation; separation and descent fine and ascent out of atmosphere are fine, but gets weird after that. The orbiter never seems to be where the map view says it is, and all manoeuvres veer off in the last few m/s to point directly away from Duna. Trying to rendezvous seems to be like hitting a moving target; an intercept of 1.2km in half an orbit won\u0027t be an intercept by the time I get there. If I somehow fluke getting to within a few km, then burning to zero on the target-retrograde marker just results in the marker moving and the speed difference increasing.
