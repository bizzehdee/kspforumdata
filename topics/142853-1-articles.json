Briefly:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemote Tech requires line of sight, but this is not my concern. It allows you to pre-program burn times so as to allow a burn when there is no line of sight to the vessel. In other words, you can tell a vessel to burn x delta v in x direction at x time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, unless this has been changed, you need to be active on the vessel (e.g. - you cannot be sitting at the base and fast forwarding time and expect the burn to occur; while you have no direct control over your vessel if you have no line of sight, you still have to have the vessel \u0022active\u0022 to allow the burn to occur).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about allow vessels to commit actions without being active? This could have implications on UKS orbital resupply (never used the drones but I assume this is how they work) and other potential mods that have not been created because of the restriction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere may be rough implications, such as an executed burn during a fast forward of 100x, so feel free to discuss those limitations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother potential implication in stock KSP is controlling another craft from the view of an adjacent, different craft. Implementation seems odd because we aren\u0027t used to the idea, but\u00A0is applicable where you want to stop a ship from rotating that you are trying to connect\u00A0to/dock\u00A0because there is no kerbal in that ship or whatever the reason (and you need to have the ship active to engage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-30T16:24:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2016 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Friend Bear\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T14:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod you say.
