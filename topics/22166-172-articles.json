Even if it doesn\u0027t make sense to launch a rocket full of kethane it does for a kethane powered plane. Also, it really helps in design to see how the center of mass varies and calculate TWR under full/empy conditions. Besides, as kethane can be mined in kerbin, it\u0027s reasonable to assume the guys at KSC can get it and put it into the rocket before launching \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the way the integration with the toolbar works now requires two clicks to show/hide the grid and menu window, where the menu window has the option to show/hide the grid.

I just tested it and found it\u0027s true. One Kethane scanner with a delay of 0 *is* as efficient as 1000 scanners (with the default delay) all on the same ship. I should have tested first and not taken what KhaosCorp said at face value. His idea works if you don\u0027t change the delay, but is useless if you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the final question: \u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the purpose of the delay\u003C/strong\u003E? I see no in-game detriment to it other than keeping time warp down to 50x. With no delay you can usually comfortably cruise along at 1000x which means that instead of having to watch a couple episodes of a TV show, I can instead make coffee or something and have a planet fully scanned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
