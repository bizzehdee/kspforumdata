I\u0027ve probes designed to land there and a station from where I operate.\n\nI was collecting science from \u0022near Eve\u0022 with my generic vacuum heavy lander (3000m/s for 7T) which I use for Gilly. \n\nThen Aldrick Kerman said : \u0022Why not give it a try, it\u0027s quite nice down there !\u0022 No heat shield, no air-brakes, no parachutes, piece of cake !. Well, he\u0027s only a scientist, what does he know about piloting and heating effect.\n\n[![57489adc-1224-404f-823d-99a55126dbf3.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview2/57489adc-1224-404f-823d-99a55126dbf3.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/57489adc-1224-404f-823d-99a55126dbf3.jpg)\n\nStarting from LEO, burn for 60km PE, use 1000m/s leftover fuel to slowdown at high altitude (it\u0027s a terrier). No heat problem (no gauge appeared), terminal velocity at 55m/s.\n\nI jumped out of the ship 50m before impact. Both pilot and ship survived. I only broke the Terrier\n\nPS : Career mode, normal difficulty."},{"CreatedByName":"obsidian_x","CreatedById":145147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T10:24:16Z","Content":"Now to mount a rescue ship to get him home"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T10:43:01Z","Content":"Well, no...
