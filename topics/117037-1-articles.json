The Thermal Control Systems were not necessary and were removed. The Craft is called Space Tech Sat-9, It is capable of deploying 9 Satellites from it\u0027s tail end into orbit and return to base by Runway. Deploying the Satellites was a real treat when watching them drift out of the structural work. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.\n\nCraft File\n\n[Space Tech Sat-9](https://files.secureserver.net/0subYQswXZHjeL)\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T13:25:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 01:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by castille7**\n  \nTitle Change"}]}
