We can do that with 2 antennas, or antenna arrays, with 87dB gain each.

An array the same size has the same beamwidth, but not the same gain, so it would need to be larger, until the combined area of the dishes is comparable to the area of the single dish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E60m optical telescope is significantly larger than today\u0027s largest telescope (10m), but when we want to talk with the galactic core, we should be able to make mirrors that large in orbit or something.

Radio astronomers regularly bounce radiopulses from other planets and moons to accurately measure rotation and velocity. These pulses should be detectable from a very large distance. Signals send to space probes like the Voyagers or New Horizons should also be detectable from a few dozen lightyears if you\u0027re willing to try hard enough.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever this is rare, you have a few high focus and high power signals you sends from time to time, in some directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs both Earth and the probe moves its unlikely that the next signal can be intercepted 10 light year out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight explain the WOW signal or the \u0022Jeb what is you doing\u0022 signal it was called locally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELasers might be better then communicate with probes too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T22:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScientists are currently looking for pulsed laser signals from intelligent life.
