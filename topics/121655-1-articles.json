I\u0027m a system engineer, had a few jobs in aeronautics bet never dealt with hard science/design problems like you do in KSP, so the game is for me a manner of getting introduced to some notions. I also love to solve some simple physics problems, to optimize things, and imagine futuristic crafts. The bigger/futuristic/overpowered, the merrier. It seems like KSP was made for me then ! I\u0027ve purchased the game a couple days ago, played for a few of hours, gotten familiarized with the tutorials and some simple manoeuvers, and successfully launched a probe and a landing mission on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Next I will try to make a few planes and eventually an SSTO spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been lurking this forum for some time now, and learnt tons of useful information. Many thanks to all the tutorials contributors, you\u0027re my heroes guys !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I have so many questions, I decided to register and say hi.
