It\u0027s UpsilonAerospace.\n\nI tend to drone on and on with my posts, so I\u0027ll keep this one short. You\u0027re welcome. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nYesterday, I took my last batch of finals at the local community college. Because of some financial problems, it\u0027s been a bit of a long and inauspicious road. But I\u0027m graduating with an Associate\u0027s degree in general science, and I couldn\u0027t be happier. (I\u0027ll get my diploma on Saturday, so I guess I haven\u0027t officially graduated yet... but I *am* taking a break from the frenzied madness of finals, which is nice.)\n\nI\u0027m officially done with schoolwork until next fall, when I\u0027ll attend some college that\u0027s relatively nearby. For now, though, I just want to take it easy and rest for awhile. Oh, and over the summer, I\u0027ll also have the opportunity to make some videos with Starwhip, Felsmak, and Avera9eJoe! Stay tuned. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThanks for being such a great community, guys.
