Maybe something related to the rendering of the green colours?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently the program renders Sky first and then places Water and Ground over it and THEN the objects, I\u0027d say the problem is only with the GROUND, the parts where I can see black or sky is just the sky background behind transparent areas where it should have been ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this same machine, running Windows 7 x64, everything is OK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: The game seems much more slower than running Windows.
