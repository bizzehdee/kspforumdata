Note, the green lawn around KSC buildings is NOT affected.\n\nAt other places on Kerbin, the same problem. On Duna, no problems. Maybe something related to the rendering of the green colours?\n\nApparently the program renders Sky first and then places Water and Ground over it and THEN the objects, I\u0027d say the problem is only with the GROUND, the parts where I can see black or sky is just the sky background behind transparent areas where it should have been ground.\n\nOn this same machine, running Windows 7 x64, everything is OK\n\nNote: The game seems much more slower than running Windows. Ubuntu is a fresh install, maybe I should try to look for another graphics driver?\n\nIf anyone ever had this problem, though, I\u0027d like to know if it is possible to solve and how.\n\nThanks in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:33:12Z","Content":"Hi Jaeleth, it\u0027s caused by Unity3D\u0027s built-in anti-aliasing on AMD hardware, turn off anti-aliasing in the KSP settings to fix it."},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T16:28:12Z","Content":"Took a long time to answer since I had my linux disk removed.
