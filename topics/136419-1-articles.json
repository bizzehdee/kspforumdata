And to be honest the UI doesn\u0027t work very well. You\u0027ve got staging way out on the left, resources way out on the right, navball in the middle, it\u0027s all rather awkward. I ended up dragging empty boosters into space because I didn\u0027t even see that they were out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think KSP would benefit from a UI that\u0027s better in such setups. The obvious thing would be to keep all UI on the central screen, though there might be other solutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-08T16:06:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2016 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T16:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t know KSP worked in a multi-monitor setup, unless you mean that your system is set up in such a way that the three monitors behave like a single screen. Indeed, while inconvenient that things are all over the three screens, having them bunched all together in the middle (not utilizing the edges) would be inconvenient for those that play KSP on a single screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a true multi-monitor environment it would be much more useful to dedicate one monitor to map mode, one to the regular view and perhaps a third one to IVA, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T21:21:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know the details of the system setup, it may well have been doing what you described.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose making it generally configurable, but with sane defaults, would be best. So that the player who does have an ultrawide screen, or multiple monitors that KSP thinks are one, can just move the interface elements into the correct place themself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T23:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t work in Multi-monitor natively (I wish it would).\u00A0 What you do is run it in border-less window mode that spans the full range of all 3 monitors.\u00A0 However, the number of games that support a native multi-monitor setup is very small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElite Dangerous handles it pretty well but it\u0027s cockpit design kinda plays into it, since it has that whole 3 segmented areas.\u00A0 I think Multi-monitor in KSP would better take the form of an always open solar system map on one screen, and everything else on the other (2-monitors), a 3rd monitor could be used to have the IVA always visible.\u00A0 Of course, which monitor is which should be configurable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-08T23:24:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2016 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
