As with the RS-25 in Restock, there will be enough mounting variation to satisfy.\n    - A vacuum engine as a single RL-60 with extendable nozzle.\n- 2.5m\n    - KS-01 \u0027Odin\u0027 will no longer be based on the LE-7A. I\u0027m working on the exact nature of the replacement. Leading contender is the [LE-9](http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets/Specials/Asian_Rocket_engines/LE-9.jpg) which is its successor.\n    - Ct-2X \u0027Tunguska\u0060 will still be the J2-X, but there will likely be some model footprint changes to support a more realistic nozzle.\n- 3.75m\n    - Ks-68 \u0027Mars\u0027 will remain the RS-68.\n    - Ct-65 \u0027Yucutan\u0027 will be completely reworked and rebalanced - no longer a RD-0120 but now a paired RL-60 cluster. Thrust will drop a bunch, Isp will increase.\n\nObviously 8 new high detail engine models is a big chunk of work so don\u0027t expect this anytime soon.
