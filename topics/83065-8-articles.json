There is a new sailing gam win the works and they seem to have scaled up all the sailing speed for \u0022gameplay\u0022 (they are doing MMO in a game that really requires time compression). So while the controls look the same as they otherwise would, the ships seem to move about 20 knots (they\u0027d be doing great in a stiff quartering breeze at 1/2 that in real life). The gameplay is then faster, but the physics is entirely wrong (ships moving too fast). The paths the spacecraft take would certainly change to more realistic ones, and reentry would matter, but the UI experience would be unchanged.

BY that rationale why not make the solar system so small as to not require any time compression at all? Once there is TC, there is no reason not to have sort of realistic distances. Note that no one here has suggested the stock game get RSS, so we\u0027re assuming a mini system anyway.

A new player should expect that a rocket with something that looks like an LEM stuck on top should possibly undergo a catastrophic failure upon launch---since such payloads in RL have a fairing around them to avoid this.
