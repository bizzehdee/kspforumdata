As your velocity changes direction, so does its normal, so you have to continuously change your ship\u0027s orientation. For a high velocity orbit it\u0027s going to take a fair amount of delta-v to do this though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re on Kerbin, you\u0027re best off just launching the vessel anew and burning toward the north or south to begin with. Make your usual gravity turn, but instead of turning toward 90, turn toward 0 or 180. Depending on how particular you\u0027re feeling regarding your polar orbit you can burn slightly to the west to correct for the eastward velocity you begin with from Kerbin\u0027s rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, if you\u0027re in a circular orbit then the minimum delta-v is given by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-v = 2v sin(theta/2) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere v is the orbital speed and theta is the inclination change. Here that would be 90 degrees, so you\u0027re looking at 1.4 times the orbital speed to change from an eastward orbit to a north- or southward orbit. That\u0027s the ideal, not what I suggested above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re set on altering an existing orbit, burn to change your orbit (which will probably wind up being eccentric) then fix the eccentricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tek_604","CreatedById":59699,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T06:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I want to shift into a polar orbit (for mapping), then as soon as you hit the SOI of the body, this is the best time I find.

If you do a bunch of infinitesimal normal impulses, updating which way is normal each time, then you\u0027re burning an arc around a circle. You can do the same net burn in a single impulse burning the chord. That corresponds to one big impulse that\u0027s halfway between normal of your correct orbit and normal of your destination orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, that\u0027s not what the maneuver node lets you plan: it lets you fire a big impulse normal to your current orbit, and you have to plan some retrograde (or prograde? I always forget) to balance out and get that average.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, if you\u0027re doing a 90-degree plane change, you are best off pushing your apoapsis way high and changing inclination up there.
