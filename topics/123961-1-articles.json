I thought it would be easy cash, but I forgot that I just started a new career and didn\u0027t have the manoeuvre nodes unlocked yet...I\u0027ve visited minmus and the Mun without manoeuvre nodes before, but never attempted this beyond Kerbin\u0027s SOI... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to give it a go and just tried to approach this problem as if it was a rendezvous mission with a satellite. I parked a probe in a solar orbit and lowered my periapsis until it intersected with Eve\u0027s orbit. When I reached periapsis, I then lowered my apoapsis until it was a bit higher than the orbit of Eve and just waited until I got an encounter. I didn\u0027t think it would work but after a lot of waiting, Eve\u0027s gravity pulled me in! I was quite surprised and a bit proud that I managed to get an encounter this early in this career. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I then used aerobreaking to slow down and finally splashed down in the sea to perform SCIENCE and gain 600k of sweet juicy profit! Here are some pictures. I didn\u0027t take many pictures because I figured I was doomed to fail this mission... XD Anyway... I\u0027m just very exited and I wanted to share this with you guys. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture of the probe on the launchpad.
