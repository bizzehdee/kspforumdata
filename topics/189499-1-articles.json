Parachute will only fully deploy at the altitude its set to (defaults to 1000m).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStaging at top of flight you will be going slow enough but from that point onwards you are accelerating back to the surface. If you\u0027ve picked up too much speed on your fall then you will be travelling too fast for the parachute to deploy when you hit the altitude set on the parachute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis typically happens if you fall prograde (pointy end first). Not enough air resistance from pointy end to slow you down and you keep accelerating. You ideally want to fall retrograde so that flat surfaces stop you accelerating at a point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may also want to adjust the power of the booster (and the amount of fuel) so you don\u0027t go too fast to start with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
