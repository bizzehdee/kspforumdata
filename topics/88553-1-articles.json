I know this is hard, but just at least copy \u0026amp; paste tree\u0027s so it looks like a forest when we\u0027re crashing into Kerbin, you know? And where are the animals? It feel\u0027s lifeless, the mountains are just plain boring and all there the only difference is color! What I want is the ability to fly over kerbin and see actual kerbin life, not just plains and plains of grass and then a magical desert where there are a few cactus. Where is the nature? There are a few tree\u0027s, there are a few bushes, and there are a few cactus. Animals? None to be seen \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#DBDBDB;\u0022\u003EAnd I do know that there are mods out there, but it\u0027d be nice to have them implemented!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ENow, I know that this will be hard because of some problems such as having too many units on such an enourmos scale (sorry if I pronounced that wrong), but honestly we have to add some life, some Kerbals walking around the KSP, or a village a few miles away into the north and things like that. It\u0027d be nice. Maybe some day in the future you could implement that. It\u0027s just to add realism, some player may want this and other not. It\u0027d be nice to have this implemented into the game. And if it is someday implemented into the game, there should be an option for that.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/Khappy\u0022 alt=\u0022Khappy\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/KSmiley\u0022 alt=\u0022KSmiley\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
