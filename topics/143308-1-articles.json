Thus, I do not have the step by step procedures or whatnot to guarantee your fail safe aproach of success. But the idea behind it is that you can use the gravity assist from venus to change your orbital time period around the sun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nChanging your orbital time period around the sun is your main focus on your first venus gravity assist. That means your main focus is not getting the fastest slingshot, and added speed from your first assists by raising your apogee as much as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe trick is that your first assists has a orbital time period which equals the amount of time for your next target to meet your own as you cross it\u0027s orbit line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simplest example is that if your first gravity assists is Venus, then you want to gravity assist by exceeding your apogee around the sun by 1.5 times the orbital time period that Venus has orbiting the sun. This means you\u0027ll meet venus again in 2 orbits, and you can raise your apogee around the sun even further.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA third mars and/or Earth gravity assist might get you to where you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember, venus could be your second try, this can also be Earth. It can even be Mars in some cases. As Geshosskopf pointed out, it depends on the location of the planets during your game time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn some cases it means you may want to lower your periapsis around the sun with a mars gravity assist to match your orbital time period around the sun to meet up with venus or earth again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could take 3, 4, 5 or more gravity assists in total to even get your apogee around the sun up to that of jupiters. By that time, it\u0027s speculative whether saturn is in the proper location to be reached at all. These are all things you have to consider in advance. So if you don\u0027t want a straight hohman transfer aproach to jupiter with the intention to reach saturn or beyond, you\u0027ll have to know in advance to use several gravity assists to reach jupiter, and by then know whether saturn and or uranus will be in the correct position when you get to jupiter. The necessity of a Nasa computer as stated is not that much of a joke.
