Press it to quicksave. If at any time you feel like you\u0027ve screwed up the descent, simply hold F9 and you will be transported back in time and space to the moment where you initially quicksaved.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELocate your landing spot of choice. \u003C/em\u003EAn ideal landing site will be well-lit, not on the side of a mountain, and optionally on the side of the Mun facing Kerbin so you can see it in the sky.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003EExecute your deorbit burn.\u003C/em\u003EThis bit requires a bit of trial-and-error. You can either burn on the opposite side of the Mun to your landing spot, expending the least amount of fuel possible, or you could burn directly over your site, killing all horizontal velocity. Ideally, you want a mixture of the two, as the former requires you to kill a lot of velocity on your final approach, and the latter eats up a lot of fuel. I find a good balance is to burn retrograde when your lander is approximately 45 degrees away from your landing site, but feel free to experiment. In the end, you want your orbit to be intersecting the ground a little further out from your landing zone.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECoast down towards your landing site. This part requires you to be on the ball. You don\u0027t want to start braking too high up, but neither do you want to try to burn when you\u0027re 500 metres above the ground. Remember, quicksave is your friend in this case.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPut down landing legs. Yes, I know that you could put the landing legs down at any time during the flight, but this is generally when I first decide to/remember.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBegin your final landing burn. Your aim here is to kill all of your velocity, both the velocity you have accumulated while falling towards the Mun, and also the velocity you started out with in orbit. Try to get a feel for your lander, and figure out how quickly it accelerates; landers with higher Thrust to Weight Ratios are a lot easier to handle at this point, as they can kill their speed a lot quicker. Ideally you want to reach zero exactly when you reach ground level, but this is not always the case. If you stop before your landing site, no worries, take a look at the next step. Again, feel free to hold F9 if you screw up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDescend the final few metres. Unless you are a cyborg, you likely did not reach zero velocity exactly at ground level. As such, your lander will be stationary in the air above your landing site. To rectify this problem, simply cut the throttle and let yourself fall. However, it is not recommended to fall too far, and possibly throttle up a bit so that your velocity doesn\u0027t get out of hand. Keep your velocity below 10 m/s when you reach ground level, and you will land safely! Note that you also will be dealing with horizontal velocity, so keep your nose pointed at your yellow retrograde marker the whole way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESettle onto your landing legs, extend your ladder, deploy your solar panels, activate lights and scientific instruments, and finally EVA your kerbal and plant a flag detailing your remarkable achievement.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETips: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe altitude numbers at the top of the screen display your current height above sea level, not the ground.

Wait until the last moment before you start retro-burning. The faster you approach the surface the less time you spend in the gravity field and the less acceleration you have to kill by expending fuel. Braking too early and then spending time hovering thousands of meters above the surface is just a waste of precious fuel. But when is the last moment? That depends on the acceleration power (thrust/mass ratio) of your lander. It might sound counter-intuitive, but a lander with more and bigger engines can actually be more fuel-efficient, because you can wait longer before you brake.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-24T23:39:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2013 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Crush\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IllicitMedic","CreatedById":66677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T02:05:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kosmo-not\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kosmo-not\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis video might help:\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXLFQMPZMVY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, maybe it doesn\u0027t, but I hope it motivates you to master the art of landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoly **** lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
