The last two are the ones I\u0027m primarily considering. Either way, it would increase the build rate (having one second of build time be worth more than one second, or for the second ship it would still be worth less than one second, but go from 1/5 to 1/4 or something like that). I may get that in next version, I may not. It depends on how everything else I\u0027m implementing works out. I\u0027ve got it to the point where I can start simulations around Eve or any other planet, but it\u0027s definitely not the circular orbit I was hoping for, as the game gets really confused and doesn\u0027t seem to recognize the change in parent body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Rocket Construction nodes would be for the VAB. The Spaceplane Construction nodes would be for the SPH.

It wouldn\u0027t be impossible to use, it would just be less practical. The VAB will start out at a rate of 1 with further unlocks either increasing that above 1 or giving a second rate starting at 1/4 or so (which then can get upgraded to 1). The SPH will also have a second rate with additional unlocks, but since there\u0027s much fewer nodes the rates will increase much faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking I may need to move away from set build times, and instead list Build Points or something like that, with an approximated time given in the editor/build list. Then, the different rates will be measured in Build Points/second. Then when the rate is \u0026gt;0 I can give a time to completion based on the rate. I\u0027ve also been considering letting you choose between buying an increased primary rate, or a secondary rate\u002Bupgrades for it. Secondary rates should actually be cheaper/easier to get/upgrade, imo, because having a primary rate of 2x is the same as 2 rates at 1x, but has more practical purpose (since if you only have one ship building, two rates isn\u0027t useful). But that implies some sort of cost/buying system and I don\u0027t want to make you purchase upgrades with science (you already have to buy tech tree nodes and I like the idea of tying upgrades with node unlocks). Maybe when you unlock a node, you can choose which to upgrade. The primary rate will have smaller upgrades and a limit of 1.5x or 2x, but the secondary rate will also be able to be upgraded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T19:50:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree as well not wanting to purchase upgrades with science as well as tech tree with the same, but the construction system as you present it does sound fantastic. Some of the ideas for buying improvements might be put on the back burner until after .24 to utilize the economic system that the contracts bring instead of using science as currency. This could actually make the contracts more valuable as to bring additional income to pay for improvements to the construction systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T00:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally got the ability to put a ship into orbit around another body for simulations.

Thanks for the heads up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE1: The field I use for getting the area doesn\u0027t exist anymore and now I have to compute it from the diameter. The reason I didn\u0027t do that originally was in case chutes of different shapes were used (like squares) instead of circles. Currently debugging why the cone chute gives a null reference. E2: It\u0027s all chutes and I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s doing it yet...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE3: I can\u0027t figure this out and I need to finish up a presentation I have to give tomorrow morning. So I won\u0027t be able to get it resolved tonight. I can\u0027t figure out why it\u0027s giving a null reference when I try to get the deployedDiameter property. I\u0027ll see what I can come up with tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE4: Just looking at the changes to RealChutes from 1.04 to 1.1, he totally removed my ability to reference the material or diameter/area of the chute using the current method. I\u0027m going to have to either find a new way (with the tiny amount of knowledge of reflection that I have) or drop Real Chute support :/ Laaaaaaammmmeee\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE5: Shhhh. I know I should be working on other things.

Step one, complete. Next I need to find a way to access the material definition (which may not exist at all...) and get the drag coefficient for the material used. I may leave that for tomorrow and PM you a WIP update to test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE6: State of the Update: I think I\u0027ve gotten compatibility working with the new version, and it is currently being tested.

It doesn\u0027t have all of the features that I wanted to include, but there are enough changes that it was worth a new number. Changes to the build list are pushed back to PR6 or later because I needed to get this release out for the Real Chute compatibility. It should be relatively bug free, as I\u0027ve had some help from JeffreyCor with testing (and he managed to find a bunch of little bugs in the new features, which no longer exist for the rest of you!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChangelog:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPR5 (4/30/14)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Adding settings menu so you can change settings in-game (time settings/enable or disable for a save).

By default you start on Kerbin on the launchpad/runway. You can click the button that says \u0022Start in orbit?\u0022 to start in orbit around Kerbin (with an altitude between 70km and the edge of the SOI). The orbit is circular and equatorial at the specified altitude. I later will probably allow you to change the inclination. After you enter the SOI of another body (or, if you already have vessels in orbit/landed on another body, when you switch to them from Map Mode/the Tracking Station) you \u0022unlock\u0022 that body for simulation (a message will appear in the top left, where science stuff appears). Then, you can start in orbit around any bodies you have unlocked. You can override this to allow you to effectively have all bodies unlocked in the settings menu (EnableAllBodies).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESettings menu: You access it from the build list (there\u0027s a button that says \u0022Settings\u0022). From this menu you can enable/disable KCT for a particular save, change the maximum timewarp KCT will use, override the body tracker, and change all of the time parameters from within game (changing these will not affect currently building vessels). This makes it much easier to adjust the times how you want them and enable or disable the mod in a save. \u0022But magico13, how can I re-enable the mod if I can\u0027t access the build list when the mod is disabled?\u0022 you ask, well it\u0027s simple! Just click the KCT button on the toolbar and the settings menu will appear when the mod is disabled. Then you can re-enable it! While the mod is disabled, everything is still saved and you can re-enable it later without losing anything. But progress will not continue on anything that is building while the mod is disabled (duh!). The icon will be the \u0022off\u0022 version when KCT is disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any questions or bugs to report, let me know. The download is on the OP.
