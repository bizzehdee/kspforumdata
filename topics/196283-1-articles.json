with the knee and hip joint.\u00A0in rocketry terms, cats have moar boosters. but it doesnt stop there. throughout the jump the legs go from a tightly coiled configuration to fully extended, a lot of travel when compared to the cat\u0027s body length, its applying force for a longer amount of time.\u00A0so cats have more fuel. then you throw on the fast twitch musculature and those boosters get moar thrust, but at a cost to specific impulse (they tire easy). cats are most certainly rockets. cat-shaped rocket contest anyone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na humanoid biped only has the knee and hip\u00A0providing much of the work, humanoids do use the foot for leverage when jumping however there is a lot less mechanical advantage. the range of travel is a lot smaller in terms of body height. the muscles are slow twitch for endurance not speed. and another thing we have that cats dont is locking knees. they would probably also need a locking heel as well since both joints are under tension. a bipedal cat will typically stand on fully extended and locked legs, unless they were sprinting. if the total cat height of the standing bipedal cat was a human, its pelvis would be up to

jump quite well, especially if they come from a planet with mars-like gravity. i dont think they would sprint very well, but they might do well in an arboreal setting and could hunt large birds with ease, just jump up and grab em. barring locking joints they would have trouble standing or walking for long periods of time. they are definately going to be of lower body mass than the human because

but it doesnt stop there. throughout the jump the legs go from a tightly coiled configuration to fully extended, a lot of travel when compared to the cat\u0027s body length, its applying force for a longer amount of time.\u00A0so cats have more fuel. then you throw on the fast twitch musculature and those boosters get moar thrust, but at a cost to specific impulse (they tire easy). cats are most
