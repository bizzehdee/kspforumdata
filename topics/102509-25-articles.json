The neat thing about this challenge is that everyone has a slightly different take on it. I like this sort of challenge more than \u0022what\u0027s the minimum parts to do X\u0022 type challenges. In fact, I like it so much that I\u0027m actually posting about my trip, although I think the Elcano posts pull very little interest to most folks. I think the people who are in this challenge do it for the personal satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I don\u0027t time warp through everything. I do real time through the interesting parts, but really there\u0027s only so much to talk about and post for a circumnavigation trip that takes so long to complete. Especially given that I\u0027m up to five bodies now. I think for me part of the interesting piece of this challenge is designing a rover (or boat) that can be so rugged. I\u0027m also fairly certain that had I only stuck with one body to circumnavigate, I would have taken a much longer approach. An example of that fact can be seen with my Polar Challenge (drive from KSC to the North Pole) where I actually created an entire storyline for is and proceeded through most of it in real time, which was still 12 hours of driving even with a relatively fast rover. Ultimately I threw out the story line because I didn\u0027t think most people cared. Wilsey and Bartiger were the pioneers who made the rover so stout. I had actually designed it to withstand warp, because I didn\u0027t know how punishing the mountains would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T06:21:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 06:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T07:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022damerell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022damerell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just read Claw\u0027s report, and the timewarp difficulties reminded me of something I\u0027ve been pondering for a while.\u003Cp\u003EI used timewarp (via Better Timewarp) only to get up to real time when I had too many parts on the rover for it to run in real time at 1x warp.
