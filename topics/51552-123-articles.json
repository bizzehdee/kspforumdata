I intend on releasing 0.24 complete with documentation and fully tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDYJ and Kommit have signed up to do two new dishes. Starstrider42 is currently taking care of some user documentation. Give them some applause from me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Applause for the support team*\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
