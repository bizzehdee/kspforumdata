Being Batman is near impossible in the USA because law enforcement WILL hunt anyone down\u00A0who is dressed like a bat beating down criminals at night. And it would not be too hard either, because of helicopter cameras and lots of police cruisers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I think the only way a real Batman could exist would be to literally BUY a country. Batman surely has the money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it would likely be a fixer upper third world country or island, as I do not see any prosperous western nation selling their goverment off so Batman can function without prosecution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell... unless they actually did. I suppose if Batman paid the government enough cash, they may look the other way more often than not when he doe his\u00A0vigilante activity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there you have it. Batman can only exist if he has bought off the government and law enforcement, or started his own country.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis article is also hilarious below.

And nothing makes you feel LESS like Batman than scaring sad, homeless crackheads. You tried to chase down a kid when you saw him punch a lady and take her purse, but you can\u2019t really pursue that kind of thing by running on rooftops, you gotta do it the hard way by chasing him on foot down the sidewalk\u2026 in your full Batman costume, where everybody can see you. People are taking photos on cell-phones, and yep there\u2019s a cop car at the intersection and he saw you, and now he has his lights on and it\u2019s YOU he\u2019s after. Great, you have to let the kid go so you can run down an alley and climb up a fire escape to the roof to get away. Someone even laughed.
