To prepare for the journey to the stars, you must first leave our own, in KSP 1. Now, while this is just for fun, I do want screenshots, to track how many successes there are, and there will be rules, which I will state later on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, while some of you know what I mean by escaping Kerbol, the sun, but, others don\u0027t, so I\u0027ll quickly explain what I mean. If you go to the star map, and you zoom out to the planet orbital lines, the line of your craft should be a line pointing away from Kerbol, the sun, and shouldn\u0027t have an orbit of it\u0027s own around the star. Hope that makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the rules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-No cheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-No hacking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-No glitches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Stock parts, DLC allowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Gravity assists are allowed, but only once per body (planet/moon/sun). Choose your path wisely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Must be manned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Command module only, no command chairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Must contain all scientific equipment for scans at the destination, and must allow for crew rotations of said equipment (mainly the lab), as well as communication equipment to transmit the data you find back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Must not lose power while on escape trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s it. Have fun, and boldly go where no one has gone before. To infinity, and beyond! (Yes, I know it\u0027s sort of already been done, but just try to have fun with this, for the sake of the KSP 2 hype train).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-25T21:42:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2019 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by M_Rat13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
