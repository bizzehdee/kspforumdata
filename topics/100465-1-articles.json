I use it to launch satellites within the Kerbin system.\n\n![sPXFrBq.png](http://i.imgur.com/sPXFrBq.png)\n\nThis is my new resupply tanker for my LKO station. It\u0027s essentially a modified version of my crew carrier, with the front cockpit, rear passenger cabin and inline docking port replaced with extra fuel tanks and a drone core. On the first test flight, it lifted around 360 units of liquid fuel and oxidiser to the station in its 100kmx100km orbit. Not a huge amount of fuel, but it consumed only 210 units of jet fuel to get there (plus a small amount of fuel\u002Boxidiser for rendezvous) so it\u0027s quite economical."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T21:53:16Z","Content":"Looks great! A nice, clean, minimalist design that does the job. Are those four radial intakes the only ones, or are you hiding more inside?"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T22:24:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are those four radial intakes the only ones, or are you hiding more inside?\n\nJust the four intakes on these planes- no part clipping here. Nevertheless, with the right profile (slight \u0027reentry\u0027 flames on the way up) you can get the jet engine to still be ticking over at near 50km. Then it just needs a slight push from the two rocket engines to make orbit. The limited space in the Mk2 cargo bays means it\u0027s only really good for small probes, but then the Mk3 parts are just too large. I\u0027d like to experiment with using \u0027old Mk3\u0027 sized parts to build a slightly more spacious cargo carrier. There might be some scope in fitting a few command seats inside the cargo bay to make an \u0027economy class\u0027 crew transport.\n\nI think in station construction, it might be more economical to send up fuel tank modules empty, then bring up the fuel separately with these tankers. That way less of a rocket is needed to lift the empty tanks, and the fuel itself is brought up in the cheapest way possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T01:17:52Z","Content":"Kudos for no part clipping! I guess I\u0027m using the wrong profile then, I tend to have a couple of shock cones per turbojet plus a bunch of structural intakes and still go to rockets at about 28km.\n\nI think the idea of an \u0027economy class\u0027 crew transporter is a good one. Here\u0027s my interplanetary shuttle, the Gliido, with jump seats for two in the experiment bay. The Mk2 is just deep enough to close the doors and not clip the kerbals\u0027 helmets.\n\n![L4CW84Z.png](http://i.imgur.com/L4CW84Z.png)"}]}
