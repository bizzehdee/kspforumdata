But I think a more interesting and arguably more logical progression is to make the default part 1.875m and available in the Basic Science node. For miniaturization, you get an upgrade to 1.25m, and in Precision Engineering you get .625m. Remember new designs generally start fairly big, and with lots of experimentation and engineering we make parts that are just as good, only smaller and lighter and therefore cheaper. So starting with a mid-size and having to do engineering to get smaller, lighter versions makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve been taking a bit more of a look over career mode over the past couple of days (in prep for an upcoming career playthough), and have already made a couple of tweaks to part locations / unlock costs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few things though are not in the current plans --\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nlimiting fuel tank lengths by tech tree; there are both technical problems that would prevent it, but it also goes against the main purpose of the mod (low-part count).\u00A0 I hate tank-stacking with a passion.\u00A0 No thanks.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdjusting the thrust of the SRBs -- not likely to the degree you propose.\u00A0 Their thrust is based on the scaled-down thrust of the 4/5 segment boosters used on the shuttle/SLS; just like all of the scaled engine thrust stats, it uses the same balance scheme as applied to the rest of the SSTU parts (square scaling; x * scale * scale).\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n45m x 3.71m - 4-segment - 12000kn = ~3000kn/segment\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n3.71m * 0.64 = 2.374 (round up to 2.5m)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n12000kn * 0.64 * 0.64 = 4915kn for a 4-segment 2.5m \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E at 64% scale\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n4915 / 4 = 1228kn/segment @ 2.5m diameter (which I\u0027ve actually reduced to 1050kn/segment)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n4915 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 1228kn for a 4-segment 1.25m \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E = 307kn/segment\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThey also have a much worse default/starting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E compared to the stock SRBs (170/195 vs 195/220)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWill do a more in-depth comparison vs. the stock parts in the near future.\u00A0 If they are -waaay- out of whack compared to stock parts, then I will do some adjustments (as long as it doesn\u0027t interfere with their intended balance/use at 2.5m scale) (or... more probably I\u0027ll just delete the stock SRBs in my patch setup and ignore their poor scaled balance)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nA few other balance/cleanup related changes I\u0027ve made this week:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe probe-core 1.875m unlock has been removed, as the PPC already starts with 1.875m max diameter (was an omission when the tech nodes were last updated, the extra upgrade was not removed).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E-U is being moved into AdvRocketry node (or similar).

I think I\u0027ve tried every winch \u002B dart, magnet grabber, and the grabber units and claws, and so far I give every one of them maybe 1/5 stars, especially the grabbers, which I have managed to trigger once in eleventy thousand attempts; almost all of the parts they tell me to go get are so light you\u0027d need to be moving fast enough to destroy the part to generate enough impact force to trigger the grabbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real head-scratcher for me is why none that I\u0027ve seen have a manual trigger. Anyway, I\u0027m sure you could make something better, what made me think of it was the fairly long procedural nose-cone with a smooth ogive. What I was thinking was a very large (compared to others) grabber that opens like an umbrella and then when activated to grab a part, tries to close down to its original long ogive. It could have an auto trigger, but I was thinking more along Konstruction lines where you have a UI for control.That big umbrella isn\u0027t meant as the final hold, that is just literally to grab and control the part so you can get it oriented correctly for its final hold.

And yes I forgot about the founding principle being low-count, not just uber-cool as I had been thinking, so forcing it down the path of high parts count stock doesn\u0027t make much sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReturning to something I asked about earlier, before I forget again: I love the multiple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E nozzles, but I\u0027d love them even more if they had different performance characteristics, as I\u0027m sure the real ones did. SSTU SRBs look an order of magnitude better than PP ones, but PP SRBs have one feature you don\u0027t, and that is chooseable ASL/Vac-optimized nozzles. I know you handle that function a little differently with SRBs intended from the start as launch or upper stage... but... all those beautiful nozzles are sitting there begging for them to have a least minor differences in burn time or thrust at various altitudes. Basically you\u0027re 95% there for another cool functional performance customization available to the players. I\u0027m sure with a little thought like you\u0027ve just put into the tech tree, you can come up with some interesting characteristics to choose from\u00A0in the nozzle options and that means more interesting choices for the players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand, the grabber request was a shot in the dark in case it was something you were already thinking about. And Unity physics is the reason I was suggesting a different approach - instead of trying to attach something (particularly with the attached thing attached to\u00A0something non-rigid), make a cage-type device that never attaches to the part you\u0027re trying to capture. Instead we just retain it near the ship non-moving, so a second step (EVA w/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, or something else) can get it oriented as desired and firmly attached for reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I settled on is a central harpoon/winch surrounded by a ring of 6 more harpoon/winches, either also aimed straight or gimbaled slightly outward if the part I\u0027m going after is big. If you get within 10m of your target chances are good more than one will stick, and three action groups let you shoot one half or the other or all of them at once. You\u0027ll still come down in a very un-NASA way with stuff flailing around everywhere, but it usually works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-05T01:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#8d9aa6;font-size:13px;padding:15px 10px 10px 0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#8d9aa6;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022vertical-align:middle;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#660000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERe:\u00A0\u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom:none;\u0022 title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0Thrust balance --- I think this pic sums up the situation regarding the\u00A0\u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom:none;\u0022 title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0thrust better than I can put into words(note the stock \u0027kickback\u0027 thrust and resource quantity; compare vs. the SSTU-\u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom:none;\u0022 title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0thrust and resource quantity;\u00A0 the stock SRBs are actually -more- powerful than the SSTU parts at the same size, and have higher\u00A0\u003Cabbr style=\u0022border-bottom:none;\u0022 title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E).\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022vertical-align:middle;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EHaving to do this the old fashioned way- I don\u0027t think any of the SSTU parts are inherently \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

Once you unlock survivability with your first launch, you should\u00A0be able to\u00A0unlock\u00A03-4 more nodes with the\u00A0second launch. This kind of makes it\u00A0a moot point and is why I put the decouplers together with the respective tank diameters on the previous balance pass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo go even further; when I played stock I just put an engine on top of the previous stage and that would decouple by blowing up the previous tank due to the heat. Heck my first launch is a four section \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E just stacked on top of each other where each one blows out the previous one on staging so I could get at least 2-3 biomes before splashing down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t get a 100% balanced tree, especially when using other mods; bluedog offers decouplers in the 2nd technodes as well, so anyone using that mod will get an alternative to the sstu decoupler (not even mentioning using tweakscale). When using CTT I remove the SSTU ctt folder as engines are spread out into nodes that are meant for atomic engines or near-future parts:\u00A0unlocking a J2X when you already have nukes and plasma engines is unbalanced in the opposite direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone needs to come up with a 100 node techtree so we can make single year development increments to mirror real world progression of technology.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBTW: If you\u0027ve played careers, you know your second launch will be an orbit mission or very close to it if you miscalculated, the 3rd launch is definitely an orbit mission around Kerbin/Earth with the 4-5th being moon shots already. The early techtree is unlocked in just a few missions. If you take a majority of the available orbital science around\u00A0earth and the moon, you have unlocked half the techtree already and about 1/3 of the CTT version. Moon landings will get you 3/4 into the stock tree and only CTT will need you to go to Duna/Mars to start unlocking the 1.000\u002B science nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I won\u0027t even mention using labs to do a complete cheat and get 6x the science, meaning a set of Mun/Minmus landings will unlock the complete stock techtree\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-05T03:13:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2017 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-05T03:17:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that no one ever gets 100% balance in any game more complex than checkers, and I started by saying these were minor quibbles.
