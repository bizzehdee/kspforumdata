I finished with the mission and went to the astronaut complex and noticed a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=735357064\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eproblem.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0As you can see if the bug wasn\u0027t there I would not have 10/12 on the top.
