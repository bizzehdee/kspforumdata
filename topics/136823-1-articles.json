You are a group of Kerbals sent to explore a new star system. Most of the game progresses the same way, except instead of funding there are resources that must be collected which will require exploration. This would involve bringing allot of the ISRU and life support mods into stock of course. Also, you have a science meter that you need to fill up to finish your mission, which involves lots of trips to the other planets with many biomes. You only get one set of Kerbals (you\u0027re not colonists) so they are a precious resource. Having more stay behind in KSC means better resource gathering and faster rocket building, having more go out on missions means more efficient science gathering. And finally, each time you start a new game the system is procedurally generated, and you are allowed to choose your starting resources (do you bring more equipment for fast initial science gains or do you bring more mining equipment? More engineers or scientists or pilots?) and home base (which planet do you choose? Some are easier for life support maintenance while others have lower gravity and others have more resources). The only part I can\u0027t figure out how to fit in is the tech tree, but maybe the computer you brought with you lost most of its memory so you\u0027re stuck relearning everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T05:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds a little like Sol 0: Mars Colonization but no supply drops and a little more in-depth to your crew.
