There are a number of mods that give them additional things they can do, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line is that in career mode, pilots become useless once you get your 1st probe core with SAS built in, and scientists become useless once you\u0027re done with the tech tree. Engineers, OTOH, only really become useful towards the end of the tech tree when you unlock the ore stuff, at which point they\u0027re the only type of Kerbal you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
