But when I put those rovers and modules on either Duna or the Mun, they simply won\u0027t dock even though I can bang the actually docking nodes off each other over and over again.

Your vehicles\u0027 ports all line up on Kerbin, but on different planets, the different gravity and different fuel loads will mean your vehicles rest differently than they do on Kerbin. This means your ports don\u0027t line up perfectly anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a tough problem, and you aren\u0027t the first to have it. The only good way around it is to include lander legs for docking. Since legs don\u0027t have suspension, they rest the same regardless of how balanced the fuel is. Just be prepared to get frustrated, it\u0027s not easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T19:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea the wheels won\u0027t sag as much. The only thing you can do if you want to stick to your design is to.. well.. redesign it to compensate. Or... ditch the wheel and make modules that sit on the ground or landing legs. But this requires a crane and kerbal attatchment system ( mod ). The crane can be tricky to design. I was inspired by boat cranes... Google that. Id post pics, but I\u0027m at work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T19:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend using KAS for surface transfers. Docking is not only completely unrealistic, but extremely difficult. You can test as much as you want on Kerbin, but when you actually land maybe the surface isn\u0027t perfectly even, maybe the fuel makes a tiny difference from your original design, if that happens say bye bye to your original plans. If you use KAS, it\u0027s way simpler and logical, you manually drag cables around just like when they refuel cars or planes or whatever. You don\u0027t dock your car to the fuel station do you?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
