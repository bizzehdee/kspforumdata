And since the two are from different buildings, I can\u0027t just stick one down, then launch another mission to check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the launchpad is not flat enough for far enough to check things there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do I do?

Launch a bit east or west of vertical, kill and decouple the booster and pop the chutes as soon as you\u0027re high enough for the chutes to open.

Even if you tested it to work on Kerbin by say, placing a rover on the runway, drive it off the runway, place the miner on the runway and then drive the rover back onto the runway to dock with it, even if the test work there\u0027s no guarantee that it will work on the Mun as 1/6 gravity will cause the suspension on the rover to be compressed to a different degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA vertical docking system (particularly if your docking thing is connected to a base by truss) means that you can build the docking port to be higher than the rover\u0027s top docking port on Kerbin.
