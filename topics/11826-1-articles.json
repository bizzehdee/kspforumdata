I seems that at the moment KSP\\\u0027s aircraft differ slightly from their real-life cousins because of this. If you can prove me wrong I\\\u0027ll glady edit the guide, I did however have someone \\\u0027in the know\\\u0027 take a look at the guide and okay it in terms of content.\n\nAfter reading your post I had to confirm things again just to be sure. Tested two aircraft, one a delta with canards and another conventional design with a T-tail. I built two variants of each aircraft, one with a forward CoG, one with a rearward one. Both variants are perfectly flyable, however the ones with the rear CoG just seem to turn better. I would attribute this to not having to create as large a control moment as you would with a forward CoG.\n\nAttached are all four aircraft, all stock except for MechJeb. They\\\u0027ll fly without it but much more enjoyable with KILLROT turned on.\n\nPlease let me know what you think."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T15:56:28Z","Content":"I have a question guys, how do you determine the location of the CoG and CoL?\n\nI have been caught short with some craft that, when when down to the last fuel tank, try to fly rear end first, so I\\\u0027d like to keep my CoG forwards."},{"CreatedByName":"Excalibur","CreatedById":12839,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T16:31:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have a question guys, how do you determine the location of the CoG and CoL?\n\u003E \n\u003E I have been caught short with some craft that, when when down to the last fuel tank, try to fly rear end first, so I\\\u0027d like to keep my CoG forwards.\n\nI just take a guess as to CoG/CoL at the moment as there\\\u0027s not definitive way to tell.

That said jhultgre\\\u0027s Engineer plugin is slated to have indicators in the SPH/VAB in the future.\n\nMy first attempt to fly a large aircraft to KSC 2 ended in disaster because of the shifting CoG due to fuel consumption that you mention. Got within ten kilometres before flat-spinning to the ground.\n\nWhat I usually do to counteract this is to initially disable the more central tanks via the context menu and alternately drain forward/rear tanks in an attempt to keep the CoG shifting as little as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"The_Russian_Concussion","CreatedById":23940,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T03:37:23Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ve just gotten hold of 15.2 and started to try my hand at crafting some regular jet aircraft.

I feel as if the powers that be at Jebwards AFB should be brough up on charges for wasting valuable materiels...and egregious loss of test pilots. Most interesting so far was a Me-163 Komet send-up (ugh!) consisting of 1 SRB and a cockpit and a few wing-ish doodads. Went straight up just like the genuine article and glided back down for about 6 minutes. Does anyone know of any good jets that fly well that I may download and put through some \u0027proficency runs\u0027?
