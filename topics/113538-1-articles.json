Kerbal Crew Manifest lets you name, set stats, and do some other things but IIRC it does not let you change role. Role and name are hard coded together, which is definitely a problem. I\u0027ll probably put in a support/suggestion later today about getting them unbound.\n\nEDIT: in other news, I got them to the roles I wanted with some middle initials."}]}
