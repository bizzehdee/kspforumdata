These don\u0027t fit into any other category. Adding a \u0022Audio and Visual\u0022 or some better-named category would help users answer their \u0022how do I get screenshots like that??!\u0022 questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho is responsible for deciding the available categories?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso to that person: the \u0022Recent Files\u0022 only shows the most recently uploaded, not the one for the most recent KSP version.
