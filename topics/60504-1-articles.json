About sixty kilometers out, I started hearing explosions, like thunder over the horizon.

Basically they handed us each an old seat-back safety card from a Koeng 707 and wished us good luck. My first paycheck bounced, and my space suit smelled of wet socks. I was a real kerbonaut!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first assignment was to be test pilot for the Hubris XIII, the spacecraft that Jebediah Kerman would fly his historic Mun mission in. When I saw it, I laughed out loud. It looked like it had been taped together out of cardboard boxes by a bunch of overly ambitious junior Boy Sprouts. The thing was leaning heavily against the launch tower; it was swathed liberally in duct tape, and it reeked of Bondo. It looked like a science fair project gone horribly wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I realized they actually expected me to fly in that thing! It took four beefy kerbals to haul me up the gantry and stuff me kicking and screaming into the command module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman was Capcom that day.

For a while they tried using me for P.R., but then they discovered that a life-sized model Kerbal with a hinged jaw was fairly believable and much less likely to make embarrassing statements on live TV. So they stuck me on the flight roster and tried hard to forget about me. I was sitting around the kerbonaut ready room when Jebediah Kerman landed on the Mun in the Hubris XIV, marking the moment with his historic words (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHey, did you know my space suit has a built-in bathroom?!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe turning point was the Eve mission. Bob was on vacation, Jebediah was on a bender and couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be located, and Bill had just developed a sprained elbow, thrombosis, and a wicked case of lumbago. That left me at the top of the flight roster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ship, the Phallic I, was absolutely enormous. It looked something you might purchase in an adult bookstore and promptly stuff into a brown paper bag, and it appeared to be held together entirely with bailing wire and duct tape. A sign affixed to the bottom stage, near a shoddy-looking winglet read \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153FOR AMUSEMENT PURPOSES ONLY. NOT FOR ACTUAL SPACEFLIGHT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t look so worried,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bill Kerman rasped weakly as he limped along next to me. The cast on his ankle had an odd habit of switching legs when I wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t looking. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThis is just an exercise. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s only a mock-up.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a mock-up, the inside of the command module was awfully realistic. The whole craft was vibrating in a manner that made my buttocks tingle. I strapped myself in, and Bill sealed the capsule door. I twiddled my thumbs, waiting for the simulation to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout warning, the main engines fired, making a noise like a thousand metal drums inside a thousand dump trucks colliding with a thousand freight trains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the radio, a much-healthier sounding Bill Kerman said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCongratulations Larry, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve won the booby prize. We all took a vote and you were nominated. We figured this way would be easiest.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153When I get back,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 I thought, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153I am going to kill Bill.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent the next two month in space. I suppose I should have used my time productively, studied a foreign language or orbital mechanics or something; but mostly I spent the time sleeping a lot and playing Ketris. Oh, and getting space sick. Every single day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the Phallic I slipped smoothly and seductively into Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s gravity well. I peered anxiously out the porthole. Eve hung suspended in space before me, a great purple poison apple. The planet Eve! I had come far, and through many adventures to see it, and now I did not like the look of it in the least!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry (why do they call it re-entry? I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d never entered before!) went as smoothly as one could expect: raw terror punctuated by moments of nausea and sphincter-clenching anxiety. My transfer stage peeled away like a prom dress as I penetrated the atmosphere. I discovered new heights of motion sickness as the Phallic tumbled through the viscous, smarmy air. I caught a brief glimpse of livid, purple clouds racing by, and then the windows got all steamed up. The parachutes performed perfectly, the retro-rockets did not, and I nearly forgot to deploy the landing legs. Thank goodness for sticky notes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the Phallic settled onto a fairly flat spot on the surface with a soft crunch and an exhausted wheeze. I shut down my craft and stepped out to have a look around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe place looked like some nightmare vision of a meltdown at a cough syrup factory. Twisted purple rock met goopy, sluggish purple ocean at a rather nasty looking purple beach. The thick purple sky above loomed heavy with purple toxic clouds. I shuddered, planted a flag, and collected a few purple rocks, eager to get back into my non-purple spacecraft and get back home. Much as I hate spaceflight, I was more than ready to blast off and get my green butt off this purple nightmare planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Phallic I was much reduced from its travels: charred and dented and slightly droopy, and notably shorter than it had been at Kerbin. Inside the command module, the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153stage\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 indicator light was flashing in a forlorn, lonely sort of way. I pressed it and nothing happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKouston, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got a problem.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat do you mean \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 olive-face?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was the response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked the flight manual. At the end was a sticky note that read \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153I.O.U one return stage.
