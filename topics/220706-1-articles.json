If it does then you lose that round. It will be tested in a recent version of bda\u002B and will have 3 chances. If it is 2-1 to you or better\u00A0 I lose and have to try and redesign my craft.\u00A0 i have attached a link to a photo of my craft and the craft itself for your own testing.\u00A0 Please DO NOT enter if this post is more than a month old when reading.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://postimg.cc/2qFKF3H7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://postimg.cc/2qFKF3H7\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://file.io/6vNvI4egurJ8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://file.io/6vNvI4egurJ8\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSend craft links here and I\u0027ll get to them when I can\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-08T16:59:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2023 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 8\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by idkgeek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarification on kind of challenge\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
