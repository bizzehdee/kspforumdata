I will attempt to confirm them myself, and would ask that other forumites also participate in the confirmation process.\n\nIf I view bugs to be sufficiently confirmed, I will add them to the following list:\n\n**Confirmed bugs:**\n\n-VAB symmetry bug ( confirmed and steps to reproduce here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118452-List-of-things-still-needed-in-a-hotfix?p=1891615\u0026viewfull=1#post1891615](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118452-List-of-things-still-needed-in-a-hotfix?p=1891615\u0026viewfull=1#post1891615) )\n\n---------------\n\nI have an extensive background in software/game development, so I will attempt to limit the above list to priority issues in a reasonable manner.\n\nThis second list I will maintain for unconfirmed items. I will either confirm them myself, or would ask others to look into it and post confirmation/steps to reproduce:\n\n**Unconfirmed Bugs:**\n\n-Are maneuver nodes still refusing to be placed at times (UI bug where mousing over trajectory doesn\u0027t show a hotspot to place a maneuver node unless the camera angle is fiddled with)?\n\n-Recurring recovery dialog: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118451-Rescue-Kerbals-recovery-bug](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118451-Rescue-Kerbals-recovery-bug)\n\n----------------\n\nHave at it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T00:30:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:34:24Z","Content":"I\u0027d thought the big ones were fixed, are there yet problems with 1.0.2?"},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:35:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d thought the big ones were fixed, are there yet problems with 1.0.2?\n\nWe\u0027ll see I guess.

Trying to nail down steps to reproduce as it\u0027s fairly random in when it occurs (at least from what I can tell so far). You can see it in action in the following screenshot:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![PF7jTjA.png](http://i.imgur.com/PF7jTjA.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nInstead of properly mirroring on the tank on the other side of the rocket (which was also placed via symmetry), like it normally does, it will mirror on the same part instead.\n\nEDIT: This is interesting: if I move the mouse cursor in from the right, just over the tailfin that\u0027s sticking out in the background there and onto the tank, I seem to able to reproduce it 100% of the time. Seems to be an issue with the part the mouse-cursor was \\*previously\\* over before moving to the current one.\n\nEDIT 2: More screenshots to show what I mean:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Mouse cursor off to right:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2OW81CL.png](http://i.imgur.com/2OW81CL.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Move mouse over fin (symmetry briefly switches to 4X to match fins which may be relevant):\n\u003E \n\u003E ![u8U0JyQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/u8U0JyQ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Onto tank:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![rEjQcgm.png](http://i.imgur.com/rEjQcgm.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nWhen you\u0027re just moving the mouse around quickly by building something you of course don\u0027t really notice you passed over something like the fin first while moving your mouse onto the tank.\n\nWill try to narrow it down to a simpler test case.\n\nThere we go. Super simple way to reproduce:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Moving mouse in from right hand side:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![3IwpbYL.png](http://i.imgur.com/3IwpbYL.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Onto tail fin placed with 4X symmetry:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![pTAyDKJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/pTAyDKJ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Onto tank placed with 2X symmetry:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![qDOvg7T.png](http://i.imgur.com/qDOvg7T.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nSo it appears to be a problem with your mouse passing over a part with a higher symmetry setting before going onto the lower messing up the way symmetry works. Which seems to be supported by this additional case where I used 3X boosters and moved my mouse over them in the same fashion:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![AAWHEx3.png](http://i.imgur.com/AAWHEx3.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nOf course, in practice you just have no idea what happened, and sometimes wind up not noticing it\u0027s even occurred until you\u0027ve placed several more parts and have a big mess on your hands.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T00:28:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:12:13Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had that symmetry thing happen when I try radial symmetry on something that was placed with the different SPH type symmetry."},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:23:20Z","Content":"warp-to is broken sometimes"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
