There\u0027s also the mechanical strain of spinning up or slowing down that much mass or just holding it all together, you can\u0027t really make any course changes or attitude adjustments with a centrifuge deployed and spinning, there\u0027s a lot more surface area to cover with radiation and micrometeorite shielding etc. and a lot more volume to keep at a pressure, temperature and atmospheric composition that\u0027s compatible with humans, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s only for Mars gravity, which is about as low as you can go before getting bone and muscle losses- to get full Earth gravity would be even more difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Single stage to ocean","CreatedById":210256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-05T22:39:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust long tethers made of Kevlar and really light habitation\u00A0pods could do this.
