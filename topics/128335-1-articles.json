Once I overloaded my game with mods and it ran so slow I couldn\u0027t play until I uninstalled almost 3/4 of the mods\u00A0I had installed!!! I\u0027m wondering about how many mods I should put in my game!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T15:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not quantity that matters, It\u0027s quality.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe total number of mods is completely irrelevant. It all comes down to what your mods are doing and how much memory they require. Three or four large part mods can effectively kill your game while your game might barely be affected by two dozen information mods or tweaks. Some mods actually improve game performance/stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-21T15:34:13Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2015 03:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tex_NL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"George2004","CreatedById":154303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T16:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for info \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58254-tex_nl/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002258254\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58254-tex_nl/\u0022\u003E@Tex_NL\u003C/a\u003E!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T17:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah... I run TONS of plugin mods (100-120), and usually no more than half a dozen small parts packs, with maybe one large one thrown in (Hardware limitations have a LOT to do with determining this)...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIts always best to install small groups of mods at a time... Say no more than a half-dozen... Start the game, and see if there are any obvious issues after each group... This helps narrow down any blatantly messed up mods...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I install the tiny, simpler, part-less plugin mods first... Then more complicated plugins (MechJeb, RemoteTech), and those with only a few simple parts... WOrk your way up, installing in smaller groupings, unitl you hit dedicated, decent sized parts packs, and install those one-at-a-time, again starting and testing the game between each install...\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, use Task Manager (or like) to keep an eye on RAM usage between groupings...\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, when you first begin, make sure you are aware of dependencies and incompatabilities between mods, so you can install them together... A little research and a simple spreadsheet can help organize things before installing anything...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know it sounds complicated, but once you get a \u0022core\u0022 list of mods that you feel you \u0027must\u0027 have, and always install, once you\u0027ve done it a couple times, it goes a lot quicker and easier...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
