I do appreciate that, although I\u0027m quite used to actually learn new games without being bottle fed (and I don\u0027t do tutorials either, I rather lose my first game). This whole \u0027being friendly to newbies\u0027 might be the reason for your (otherwise almost never useful) half-throttle at launch and your constant reminders that goo and material lab isn\u0027t going to work a second time after taking out the experiment in EVA. At least it is a strong motivation for some guys here in the forum to dismiss quite a lot of nice suggestions, because one has to know stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I think would help new players, and wouldn\u0027t hinder/annoy pros in getting things done a more complicated but fun way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKeyboard mapping\u003Cbr\u003EGuys, seriously? That\u0027s a BASIC in almost every game - hit ESC, go to settings, switch to keyboard settings and see what key does what (and change them if needed). Everything is already done - the only thing missing is the button in the menu. And now don\u0027t tell me that\u0027s a head scratcher, even if you do have to gray out all graphics settings because the engine isn\u0027t able to cope with such changes on the fly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReminders/Pop-ups\u003Cbr\u003EGood thinking. Sadly bad copied. I would like to see quite a lot of pop-ups during the game, helping newbies to know their way around. Go to the VAB, get told what this nice building is all about. Launch pad and a pop-up tells you how you actually start and fly your rocket, maybe even while pausing the game (for inflight tips). It all could be made to get rid of tutorials all the way (if that is a goal). But then you definitively don\u0027t forget the Holy Trinity of buttons: \u0027OK\u0027, \u0027More info\u0027 and - most important - \u0027NEVER show this tip again\u0027 (for I\u0027ve seen it a hundred times now and I STILL want to take the experiment out of the Goo container - that\u0027s why I\u0027m doing an EVA). And please do a \u0027don\u0027t show tips\u0027 option in the settings page. You want a perfect example for this: Sims 3. Small, helpful and not at all intrusive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDifficulty setting\u003Cbr\u003EATM you have 3 modes to play the game: Career, Science Sandbox and Sandbox. And there\u0027s people who suggest a Contract Sandbox, want science reports to work without having to do the science tree, complain about too much/too little money in career mode and so on and so forth. Have you ever played Civilization, Tropico, Anno, Star Ruler, Simutrans, Empire Earth...? All those games have in common they give you detailed options for a new game. You could do the same, let the gamer tick and alter certain parameters in the game, like \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEnable funds\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFunds to start with\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEnable refunds\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMultiplier on contract rewards\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Enable science reports\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEnable Research\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EScience points to start with\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Dead Kerbal respawn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Hardcore mode (no \u0027revert flight\u0027 possible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Enable stock rockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]Enable Asteroids\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMax. number of asteroids present\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would satisfy most players, and most values are written to the persistent file either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShare your thoughts!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-08T04:28:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2014 04:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by M3tal_Warrior\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Westi29","CreatedById":80595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T02:44:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T05:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeyboard mapping from esc menu is definitely one essential and most missing feature in game for all newbies.
