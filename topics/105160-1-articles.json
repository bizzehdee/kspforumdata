They smell, smear, leak and make too much noise.\n\nI don\u0027t like talking to people because most of them are really disagreeable.\n\nI\u0027d like to take each of you guys at squad by your smelly, sweaty hands and shake them.\n\nEven though it would mean touching you... I know.. disgusting.\n\nI\u0027d like to tell you guys something.\n\nEven though you might reply and start a conversation. Well shut-up and listen! I didn\u0027t write this for a chat. \n\nIf you feel some need to reply.. keep it short and don\u0027t expect a response.\n\nI want to tell you that I love KSP. Best game ever. Played it for longer than any other and I\u0027ve played a lot cos I\u0027m really really old. The only things I say to people nowadays is usually something like \u0022Get out of my garden!\u0022 or \u0022Go and play some where else!\u0022 or \u0022Well it\u0027s MY ball now!\u0022\n\nI paid for it. not enough, but I paid for it. I think it was less than 20 quid. If you guys bring out any official expansion packs, I\u0027ll pay for them too. I\u0027ll pay more than I paid for the game. I\u0027ve been playing it for around three thousand hours and now 1.0 is coming out so there goes a load more of my time.\n\nSo thanks Squad. Thanks for making KSP and giving me something to do that doesn\u0027t have to involve being sociable. \n\nGet on those expansion packs. I want to give you more money. \n\nStarting to feel like I cheated you... \n\nSee what I mean, you guys haven\u0027t even replied and you are already making me feel bad."},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:06:03Z","Content":"Well said.. \n\nThanks for all the hard work, Squad."},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:17:09Z","Content":"Yep, I don\u0027t think I have ever been entertained so well and for so long but for so little money.

I\u0027ve bought several AAA games and I\u0027ve felt cheated, but I bought KSP in a steam sale for about 12 quid and I feel like I cheated the devs. I totally agree with the OP for wanting to shake hands with the devs, even though it involves physical contact with humans, and give them money. Keep up the excellent work SQUAD!!!!!"}]}
