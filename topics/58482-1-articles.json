It seems to me, that it ought to be the same delta-V planning the route directly from Kerbin, as it would doing an escape from Kerbin, then doing the transfer after the escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought process is, no matter what, you have to escape Kerbin. In fact, it doesn\u0027t even matter which direction you escape it in. You burn just prograde until you just barely get an escape. If you only burn exactly that far you resulting orbit should be almost identical to Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the Sun. From there you plan your transfer, and do another burn using the more convenient solar-level maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy brain tells me this SHOULD be equivalent. There will be some Delta-V negligible losses if I overshoot my Kerbin escape maybe, or escape via Kerbin\u0027s retrograde when I need a planetary prograde burn, but the first step of going anywhere is to escape Kerbin, so why not just do that first?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne could argue time perhaps. If you work out the phase and such ahead of time, you wouldn\u0027t even have to sit around in space waiting for it, but most guides have you sitting in Kerbin orbit anyway. Why does it matter if my Kerbals are sitting in a convenient Solar orbit nearly identical to Kerbin orbit, or sitting in a Kerbin orbit when I start time warping to get the phase?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, I figure I must be wrong, and would be awesome to have someone explain why I am, because I\u0027m not hotting the Delta-V targets on this map at all:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Kerbin escape is around 1000 Delta-V, which is close to the map, but my Duna intercept is another 1000 Delta-V, and the map says that\u0027s 100.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is hard for me to test, as I get way too frustrated trying to intercept a planet directly from Kerbin to actually see if there\u0027s a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks ahead of time!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-02T17:22:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2014 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bane1998\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESeems to be answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T16:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOberth effect\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T18:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still need to do more research on the Oberth effect, thanks for saying that.

It\u0027s neat that speeding up from 20 m/s to 30 m/s gives you more energy than speeding up from 10 m/s to 20 m/s, but since it took the same amount of delta-v (the very definition of delta-v) and delta-v isn\u0027t affected by your velocity (assuming you\u0027re not in an atmosphere), that\u0027s all it is. The Oberth effect doesn\u0027t affect how far you can travel or how fast until those external forces come into play, and gravity is the most common external effect that we deal with.

The Oberth effect is about energy, and gravity wells are about kinetic and potential energy (at any point in an orbit, the sum of your kinetic and potential energy should be the same value). The Oberth effect is about how much delta-v it takes to increase/decrease your kinetic energy, which in turn affects your total energy.
