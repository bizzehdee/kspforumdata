The net effect is that the craft will try to pitch back until the thrusters balance again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-22T13:31:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2016 01:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Val\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T13:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGah, why the hell didn\u0027t I think of that.\u00A0 Exactly the same principal as a tailplane and pitch stability.\u00A0 Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"genericeventhandler","CreatedById":149557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T14:12:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the CoM is way away from the CoT tweak the engine thrust limit to bring the CoT towards the CoM.
