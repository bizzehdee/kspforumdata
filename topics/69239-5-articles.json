First, you have to consider electricity is roughly 1/3 of the energy in a developed country, electricity being quite expensive for things like heating and several industrial processes (smelting iron from ore for example). Then you have to take into account that renewables are expensive, not just the PV panels themselves, but the massive restructuring of the distribution network, the need for storage and for backup power plants. Because renewables are not reliable, you have to move electricity from place to place, the pattern changing regularly, and you need gas and coal plants everywhere for those days where there is not wind nor sun anywhere, so basically a complete production capability that is not used a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at Germany, they went from 6% in 2000 to 25% renewable today.
