It also holds you back with load times and initial startup times. But generally speaking, no, the HD is insignificant if any bottleneck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm a little late to the party it seems, but yeah, thats a good call. More ram is always usable. Beyond a given point it stops really showing any improvement, but what happens is that instead of having no more free ram and everything slowing to a crawl, you still have all that new ram to use. If you had less than 3gb of ram i\\\u0027d say te ram itself would make a huge difference. Since you made it pretty clear you have at least 3, and most likely 4, then yeah, more ram is useful, and has its perks, but its not the clearly evident increase you\\\u0027d be seeking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should see a pretty significant step up in the graphics card. More memory for the card is mostly useful at high resolutions, with antialiasing, and anistrophic filtering. two cards, otherwise identical, both play saw, WoW at minimum settings, and you will probably get near identical settings. Play something like Skyrim, or Shogun 2, max out the graphic settings and ensure that AA and AF are at 16x, and use a large resolution like 1920X1080, or larger, and I can guarantee you the 2gb card will get significantly higher frame rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving gone from a 4670 to a 6850 is an enormous jump. from the low end of the budget line, to the low end of the mainstream line and 2 generations newer. i think you\\\u0027ll be pleased.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-29T21:41:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always get nervous that I\\\u0027ll get a DOA piece of hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always feel like I\\\u0027m playing the lottery \u0026gt;.\u0026lt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh I forgot to mention that I cleaned out my pc while checking which RAM I had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoly freakin dust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve cleaned it out before and removed a lot of dust with canned air, but this time it\\\u0027s been about 4 weeks after my room was re-painted and everything got shifted around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to wait about a month just like I did so the dust could really settle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy god man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t even know how my GPU fan was spinning.

I thought about it, put it off a few times, almost didn\\\u0027t get one, and knowing what i know now, i feel like an idiot for having waited so long. its not the end of the world to not have one for gaming, they don\\\u0027t make that huge a difference there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt mostly reduces load times(which for games that load when needed while in game, it can eliminate potential stuttering....ARMA 2, im looking at you!). The single biggest difference though will be in general computing, you will literally NEVER wait for your computer to do anything involving its OS drive ever again. no more waiting for the sleeping HD to spin up. no more 1/4 second but noticable delays to the start menu opening. no more drives becoming fragmented and bloated and making the OS crawl. Probably the single best upgrade I ever made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a pretty wide margin between a good SSD, and a crappy one though, so do take some care to read around before choosing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T01:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if I could take out the SSD from the Cr48 and plug her into my Desktop Mobo...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etime to research \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah my only reluctance on SSD\\\u0027s is the price per storage unit.
