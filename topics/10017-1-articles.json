This has always been my bottle-neck of my system.

It also holds you back with load times and initial startup times. But generally speaking, no, the HD is insignificant if any bottleneck.\n\nIm a little late to the party it seems, but yeah, thats a good call. More ram is always usable. Beyond a given point it stops really showing any improvement, but what happens is that instead of having no more free ram and everything slowing to a crawl, you still have all that new ram to use. If you had less than 3gb of ram i\\\u0027d say te ram itself would make a huge difference. Since you made it pretty clear you have at least 3, and most likely 4, then yeah, more ram is useful, and has its perks, but its not the clearly evident increase you\\\u0027d be seeking.\n\nYou should see a pretty significant step up in the graphics card. More memory for the card is mostly useful at high resolutions, with antialiasing, and anistrophic filtering. two cards, otherwise identical, both play saw, WoW at minimum settings, and you will probably get near identical settings. Play something like Skyrim, or Shogun 2, max out the graphic settings and ensure that AA and AF are at 16x, and use a large resolution like 1920X1080, or larger, and I can guarantee you the 2gb card will get significantly higher frame rates.\n\nHaving gone from a 4670 to a 6850 is an enormous jump. from the low end of the budget line, to the low end of the mainstream line and 2 generations newer. i think you\\\u0027ll be pleased."},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-29T21:41:23Z","Content":"I always get nervous that I\\\u0027ll get a DOA piece of hardware.\n\nI always feel like I\\\u0027m playing the lottery \u003E.\u003C\n\nAh I forgot to mention that I cleaned out my pc while checking which RAM I had.\n\nHoly freakin dust.\n\nI\\\u0027ve cleaned it out before and removed a lot of dust with canned air, but this time it\\\u0027s been about 4 weeks after my room was re-painted and everything got shifted around.\n\nI wanted to wait about a month just like I did so the dust could really settle.\n\nMy god man.\n\nI don\\\u0027t even know how my GPU fan was spinning.

I sometimes wonder if most computers have an unstated design feature to keep your room clear of dust for longer by inhaling all of the dust themselves. Small heatsink/fan combos, like those on motherboards or graphics cards are especially good at it and CPU\\\u0027s aren\\\u0027t much if any worse.\n\nI\\\u0027ve only ever owned a single system that didn\\\u0027t excel at collecting dust, and thats my current system. I attribute that entirely to a lack of fans within the case however. Its water cooled, so only the PSU and radiator have fans for a total of 3 120mm fans, thats it. Every other system I have ever owned has made it apparent that canned air, or strong lungs are necessary.\n\nI wouldn\\\u0027t stress too much over DoA parts. Most places have really good RMA processes for such parts, so its typically fairly painless and reasonably quick to get things dealt with. When i dealt with Koolance they sent out my replacement pump by overnight air, i had it before the end of the next day after i mentioned it, not 48 hours from initial delivery to replacement delivery, and had a month to get the dead part back to them.\n\nI still visit stores for parts, but only if they price match now, or legitimately hold the lowest price, if not its online all the way.

Very incredible difference\n\u003E \n\u003E Sounds like my rear-exhaust fan is noisy though. ...But if not, any advice?\n\ni figured you\\\u0027d see a significant and worthy improvement from those.\n\nwell, there\\\u0027s any number of reasons for the fan noise, it could also be that its internal bearings are shot and its number is up. not much you can do if thats the case. i assume its a 120mm fan on the back. At the very high end of things for silent you can get a [Noctua NF-P12](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835608004). Damn near impossible to hear at more than 2ft away(or outside the case), and push a good amount of air while they are at it.\n\nI use a pair of them on my radiator, and my PSU is far louder than they(both combined) are, and I picked a near silent PSU that hardly ever breaks a sweat(the fan rarely ever does more than idle on it). its night and day from the basic 120mm fans Thermaltake had in this case when i bought it.\n\nSeriously, for $25, they are worth it imo. You can push more air, or you can get quieter, but good luck getting this much air pushed, and being quieter.\n\n[http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/Anatomy-of-Computer-Fans/1039](http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/Anatomy-of-Computer-Fans/1039) that might be a good read if your debating tearing apart your fan to get at and lube up its bearing(s)\n\nAnd yes, you will wonder how you ever used a computer without one the day you get an SSD. Its insane the difference they make. I STILL have under 12 second boot times, and I have to wait longer than most while the raid array initialises. If not for that, I would still be sub 10 seconds, and this is over a year after the initial install. I thought about it, put it off a few times, almost didn\\\u0027t get one, and knowing what i know now, i feel like an idiot for having waited so long. its not the end of the world to not have one for gaming, they don\\\u0027t make that huge a difference there. \n\nIt mostly reduces load times(which for games that load when needed while in game, it can eliminate potential stuttering....ARMA 2, im looking at you!). The single biggest difference though will be in general computing, you will literally NEVER wait for your computer to do anything involving its OS drive ever again. no more waiting for the sleeping HD to spin up. no more 1/4 second but noticable delays to the start menu opening. no more drives becoming fragmented and bloated and making the OS crawl. Probably the single best upgrade I ever made.\n\nThere is a pretty wide margin between a good SSD, and a crappy one though, so do take some care to read around before choosing."},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T01:30:38Z","Content":"Hm.\n\nI wonder if I could take out the SSD from the Cr48 and plug her into my Desktop Mobo...\n\ntime to research ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nYeah my only reluctance on SSD\\\u0027s is the price per storage unit.

For that you pair it up with a secondary drive, such as the one your currently using. Use the slower standard drive for mundane tasks like holding your movies, music, and other large things you just keep on hand on your drives\n\ngames and programs that you want to benefit from the SSD should be installed to the SSD, and its strengths will shine through clearly. I\\\u0027ve done ok with a 160gb main OS drive SSD, and 2TB of storage in the system. I don\\\u0027t actually ~need~ any more than that, although I do have over 10TB between all the externals and the internals.......lol, but thats the point.
