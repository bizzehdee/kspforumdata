As most of the bodies favor the current equitorial setup, that means more dV would be required early game for plane changes to other bodies making design and piloting more thoughtful. Taking it a bit further, this would allow being able to \u0022Rent\u0022 or \u0022Purchase\u0022 a launch site closer to or at the equator as an upgrade. Feedback would be awesome, curious what people think of this?\n\nUpdate: Found this, figured someone had thought of this before, would still like to see it done for stock though too [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105247-1-0-4-Kerbal-Konstructs-v0-8-4-You-Can-Tip-It](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105247-1-0-4-Kerbal-Konstructs-v0-8-4-You-Can-Tip-It)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T20:58:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Glaran K\u0027erman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Excellent","CreatedById":54949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T23:51:02Z","Content":"Thats actually an interesting idea that could add another flavor of difficulty to the game. Only problem I can see with this is changing how you play career mode. The devs balanced the game to give you science, money and rep depending on where you are in the game. Hard mode makes those rewards much less so you have less room for error and makes you have to have a more thoughtful \u0022design and piloting\u0022. Moving the KSC away from the equator would require a rebalance of the reward system so its actually possible to make it into orbit.\n\nOr maybe i\u0027m just overestimating how much it would scale the difficulty, definitely a good idea though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T00:05:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Excellent**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T00:05:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Or maybe i\u0027m just overestimating how much it would scale the difficulty.\n\nI think you might be. It\u0027s at worst \u003C200m/s more delta-V to get to orbit, and the latitude of the launch site is the minimum orbit inclination for a simple launch. It also requires a bit more finesse in timing launches for rendezvous with other objects in orbit, what time of day you launch suddenly becomes important. It would be more difficult, but not tremendously so."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T00:25:14Z","Content":"I would like to see this idea done *combined with* having non-KSC points of interest on Kerbin.\n\nSay there were three different potential launch sites: the Kerbal Space Center, Kerbopolis Spaceport and the Nezrelyy Kosmodrome. One of the three is your base of operations that functions the same as the KSC currently does, but the other two still have some utility, allowing better recovery percentages in their vicinity, and being potential destinations for tourists, VIPs or part recovery missions. Maybe you\u0027ll get paid $50,000 to recover such-and-such a part from Kerbin orbit, but you\u0027ll get paid $80,000 if you recover it right at the Kosmodrome - meaning you can get paid more for performing a more challenging mission by landing at a site far from the equator."},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T02:27:52Z","Content":"Nice, I think you guys see what I mean, just a little extra spice to the experience. \n\nTo Grumman, I like the part of that where maybe different locations lend themselves to different types of contracts.
