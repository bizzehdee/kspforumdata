Ironically the night I was planning an asteroid capture, the movie \u0022Deep Impact\u0022 was on if you\u0027ve ever seen that one (great AAA movie from the 90\u0027s recommend it if you never watched it). It inspired this rocket design I came up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt features two nuclear engines on the side with four smaller space shuttle style thrusters (can\u0027t remember the name of them in the parts list). The nice thing about the thrusters is, firing them I get 40 minutes of burn time with .36 TWR. It\u0027s nice for catching up with asteroids. The nuclear rockets can burn for 2 hours and 30 minutes so I can safely capture and control the asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing is, they are VERY HARD TO MOVE. But I did manage to capture this one and get it into a stable orbit. Kind of hard to see the shuttle design but there it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s18.postimg.org/pln1babzd/2014_06_28_00005.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014_06_28_00005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimage.org/app.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escreenshot\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T13:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just captured a class E, weighing just over 3000t. To give you an idea of what this might do to your available delta v, I had 2100m/s left on arrival at the roid, and once I had docked this became 42 m/s! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily I had intercepted it a good while before it entered Kerbin\u0027s SoI, so I only needed 25m/s to push it\u0027s periapsis deep into the atmosphere. Once that aerobraking captured it I had just enough left to push the peri high enough to buy me an orbit\u0027s worth of time to move a fuel tanker in and refuel the tug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also took a huge amount of monopropellant, but still ran out in LKO. These things turn like oil tankers; it was painful to watch. Took the best part of 5 mins to turn to a maneuver node, and each time I did so I burned stupid amounts of monoprop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid I only got 1 pic, during the aerobrake. What you can see is one of the huge 3.75m tanks, with what I think is one of the KW engines (the 3.75m one that has quite a lot of thrust but is still *reasonably* efficient). There was a big booster underneath this, but I had to use a lot of its fuel to get into LKO, so I refueled it there before using it to push the capture ship out towards the roid. Then I dropped it on the way and made fine corrections with what you can see in the pic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing with 4 claws didn\u0027t really work well. I had IR hydraulic pistons under each one, and the plan was to gently nudge up to the asteroid, until the first claw touched (but too slowly for it to grab). Then adjust each piston so all 4 claws are flush against the roid. Then reverse a few metres, and charge forwards with enough speed so all 4 claws lock. I tried it a few times, but the best I could get was 3 out of 4 locked. I used KAS to secure the other one to the roid with struts (ground pylons can be attached to roids), but they broke a couple of times, requiring more EVAs etc. The whole process took ages, so I would not recommend the 4 claws idea, unless you can execute it better than I was able to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck. Take more dv than you can possibly imagine you\u0027ll need, and have a fuel tanker in LKO ready to move in fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3C1SQJq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223C1SQJq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Batz_10K","CreatedById":4992,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T14:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is one I used to capture a fairly small (900t) E-class (with 90 degree inclination change and a retrograde-to-prograde transition...ok so I slightly cheated on the inclination change with a slingshot around the Mun...) - it gives about 300ms with full tanks and a 900t asteroid.

This design has 12 LV-Ns close to the attachment point of the claw as possible (note you do need to be careful about where you attach the claw to the asteroid so that you can pivot properly). There\u0027s also a large docking port at the back so that you can easily swap in extra fuel/monoprop tanks without having to undock from the asteroid. As Oafman mentions, you need a *ton* of monoprop and the asteroids are very slow to turn (the best idea is to turn off sas, get the asteroid rotating and then reverse the rotation as you come up to the manoeuvre node on the navball. then turn on SAS and wait for the oscillations to dampen down (it will take a while).... good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deepspacecreeper","CreatedById":84329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T15:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edo reaction wheels help reduce monoprop needed and do they do any better than monoprop in turning the craft?
