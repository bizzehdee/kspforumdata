I have to run this as a 64 bit installation in order to not memory crash (mods total over 5.5GB loaded). Thats partly because I\u0027m running the higher res options in Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack, which does nightmares on your memory usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is crashing on load. It gets near the end of the progress bar, then crashes. As a diagnostic, I created a new folder named \u0027Mod Holding\u0027 and moved all .dll files and folders except NASAmission and Squad into it. Launching the game again reproduced the crash. Obviously my desktop generates a native win64 crash which my laptop did not. I\u0027m attaching the error.log and output_log.txt for diagnostic purposes. These are the versions from the unmodded crash.

Problem identified!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 3: I\u0027ve identified the problem as my own laziness. In an effort to save work, I copied the sharedassets10.assets from my .24.2 into my .25 so I wouldnt have to decompile it and re-insert my modded sun flare but that was causing crashes. The original problem install is working now with that overwritten with a stock file.
