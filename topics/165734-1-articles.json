The core is a ship similar to an Aldrin Cycler, with power and habitation but only small propulsion systems.\u00A0The main difference is that the whole thing a) carries extra propellant tanks, and b) is structured such that it can point in a single direction and successfully, repeatedly aerocapture\u00A0at both Earth and at Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cycler is assembled in low earth orbit, and Earth-based shuttles (presumably the second stage of a beefy two-stage launch vehicle like New Glenn or ITSy) gradually fill the ship\u0027s propellant tanks, then re-enter for reuse. The cycler carries substantially more fuel tankage than oxidizer tankage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final shuttle takes the crew/passengers up, docks with the cycler, then uses the fuel that has already been placed in orbit (along with its own engines) to execute 95% of the transfer burn to Mars. Immediately after a Mars intercept is reached, the shuttle decouples, flips to retrograde, and uses a short burst of fuel to bring itself back to an eccentric Earth orbit, from which it can aerobrake in multiple passes back down to a safe re-entry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cycler uses its smaller engines to complete the transfer burn and make any necessary midcourse corrections. It aerocaptures at Mars, circularizes, then executes a rendezvous with the already-orbiting Mars-side shuttle. The crew transfers to the Martian shuttle and the cycler transfers all its oxidizer and a large portion of its liquid fuel, and then undocks. The Martian shuttle heads for the settlement or research station on the Martian surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce on the surface, the Martian shuttle deploys a solar array and begins cracking Martian atmosphere (CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E) into liquid oxygen. This can be done without the need for any drills, reprocessing,\u00A0or access to Martian ice reservoirs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the conclusion of a given mission, when the Martian shuttle\u0027s LOX tanks are full, it returns to Martian orbit using all but the last of its fuel reserves, and does a rendezvous with the waiting orbital station. The orbiter takes on a small amount of LOX and transfers most of its remaining liquid fuel to the shuttle, which uses its engines to execute 95% of the transfer burn back to Earth. Like its counterpart at Earth, it then flips, burns retrograde into eccentric Martian orbit, and uses aerobraking to return to a low Martian orbit, ready for the next mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbiter aerocaptures at Earth, circularizes, and meets up with a waiting shuttle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223178002\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165734\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221506103587\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wumpus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, wumpus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom memory, the delta-v requirements to Mars only become a problem when you have to apply them to a multiple-month habitat.\u00A0 Sending kerbals (or deeply sleeping astronauts) is pretty cheap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps some nuclear-powered ion engine could move your asteroid into position over the course of a decade or two.\u00A0 Assuming the cycler-station looked a lot like the ISS (since that is how we know how to build space-stations), it would only have to have an asteroid at one end, which would point at the Sun and block the radiation (presumably the solar panels would be either in front or beside the asteroid).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContrary to common assumption, the biggest dose of background radiation in space is omnidirectional.
