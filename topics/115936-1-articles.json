I have come to like and grow accustomed to seeing beautiful clouds, mists, auroras, rings etc.\n\nSo my question: are there more aesthetically pleasing mods, better looking ones, that work great with 1.0.4? I\u0027ve come across this one and am curious to try it: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102145-0-25-Astronomer-s-Visual-Pack-Interstellar-V2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102145-0-25-Astronomer-s-Visual-Pack-Interstellar-V2)\n\nAny other suggestions?\n\nPS: I\u0027m not using Real Solar System"}]}
