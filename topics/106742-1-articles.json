I feel heating even turned up to 120% isn\u0027t terribly challenging.\n\nOr am I the only one who\u0027s feeling a lack of challenge?\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, I love the update. I just like to challenge myself.\n\nI\u0027ve fiddled with the physics config a bit, but no matter what I do unless I drop straight into the atmosphere at 3,000 m/s I can\u0027t seem to use up the heatshield. I know re-using them isn\u0027t an option, but they\u0027re so pristine after re entry I\u0027m worried Jeb might try ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif)\n\nI\u0027m sure balancing will work itself out in the future, but if anyone has dove into part configs and tweaking the physics I\u0027d like your input."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:12:06Z","Content":"Try them on/after a Jool or Eve aerocapture.
