At around 50% higher speed it does take off, but only just, and if I stop pointing it upwards it does a nosedive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T16:11:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 04:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Resand\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged prefix\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T13:09:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMove the rear landing gear further forward to just behind the centre of mass \u003Cstrong\u003Eon both\u003C/strong\u003E designs.

That usually keeps planes pointed the way you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to landing gear position, there are 2 things to keep in mind here. First is that having landing gear as far aft as possible is usually a good idea because it keeps you from dragging your tail during takeoff and, especially rough landings. The wheels have suspension and the plane flexes, which can lead to the engine hitting the ground. But as Tex_NL says, this makes it harder to take off. So to solve that, make sure you arrange the wheels so the plane sits slightly nose-up when it\u0027s on the ground. For instance, if you\u0027re using all the same type of landing gear, put the nose wheel on the fuselage and the main gear on the wiings. If the wings are mounted on the centerline of the fuselage, its wheels won\u0027t stick down as far as the nosewheel and the plane will sit nose-up. Then the plane will usually fly itself off the ground without control input.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Resand","CreatedById":144173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T15:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI moved the landing wheels forward a bit, did help on the design, but it\u0027s not the problem as such. Good thing is that trying the plane a bunch more times, I finally figured out what\u0027s wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out the control surface on the second plane is inverted. So up is down as vis versa. So both me and SAS gets it wrong while flying. But I can\u0027t find a way to fix it, and I have no clue why it happens. It\u0027s the same wings as the first plane:huh:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried just picking them up and turn them around, delete and add new ones and start them deployed and inverted through the right click menu.
