Going interplanetary is your next big step, and once you master it, you\u0027re well on your way to conquering KSP (well, as much as one can \u0027conquer\u0027 this game).\n\nIf you don\u0027t already understand delta-V, I\u0027d start there. Designing interplanetary rockets pretty much starts and ends with knowledge of your delta-v budgets and thrust-to-weight ratios. \n\nNext, good piloting and maneuver preparation (e.g. using maneuver nodes, timing your interplanetary burn using an interplanetary window calculator-- Google it) can drastically reduce the delta-v (and thus, the complexity, size, cost, and weight) requirements of your rocket.\n\nOld tutorials should still mostly apply. Take your Minmus rocket and scale it up a bit. Assuming you get the interplanetary window correct, a flight from LKO to Duna will take around 400 dV more than a flight from LKO to Minmus, assuming you aerocapture/aerobrake to get into a Duna orbit. Then another 400 dV to return from Duna orbit to Kerbin, again assuming you aerocapture/aerobrake to Kerbin.\n\nGoing interplanetary is the point in which I would strongly recommend installing either MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer Redux so that you can know your delta-V during construction. Not absolutely necessary (of course, you can do anything in Kerbal without mods), but very, very helpful."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:31:42Z","Content":"Getting there isn\u0027t as big a problem as getting back.

Without a Delta V readout though, you\u0027re taking a bit of a risk. There is supposed to be an in-game Delta V readout available from an Engineer, but it occurs to me now I\u0027ve never bothered to find it. Hopefully someone else can shed some light on that. \n\nAre you familiar with how to perform the transfer itself? Here are some resources which should help if not:\n\n[Interactive illustrated interplanetary guide and calculator for KSP](http://ksp.olex.biz/) - Very helpful for executing the transfers.\n\n[Launch Window Planner](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) - Shows when the next transfer window will be. (You will need to input your in-game date for this to work properly.)\n\n[Cheat Sheet](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet) - Wiki page with Delta V map - ignore ascent values for now, they will be different. \n\nGetting into orbit and returning is going to be less of an engineering challenge than getting there and landing. Although Delta V values have likely changed since the update, landing on Duna can be significantly more costly to perform a powered landing on and return to space than the Mun. You can reduce or eliminate the fuel required to land by using parachutes, but remember that you need an engineer to repack them, and they won\u0027t activate via staging when repacking (you\u0027ll have to right click on it to deploy afterwards - assuming it still works the same as 0.90). Ike, Duna\u0027s moon, is pretty similar to the Mun itself though. \n\nBest I can do at the moment, when I can get in game I can put together a rocket for you to look at if nobody else has jumped in.\n\nedit- holy ninjas!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T18:48:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:56:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That would be amazing if you could do that.

Fast forward until duna is ~45\u0027 ahead of kerbin. If kerbin and duna were in a race, duna would be 1/4 of a lap ahead.\n\nNow, for getting interplanetary encounters *closer* to the sun, you want to launch on the side of kerbin that is facing the sun. \n\nFor interplanetary encounters *farther* from the sun, you want to launch from the dark side of kerbin.\n\nSo, zoom in.\n\n set a node on the dark side of kerbin (in the middle of the dark side), and add prograde until you have a kerbin escape. \n\nZoom back out, and you will see that your projected orbit (from the man node) will move in towards eve, then as you make a pass around kerbin, you will almost align with duna. If you fine tune the start of your burn from here, adding small amounts of prograde/retrograde, you can usually get a manual encounter. This will take ~1200dv fuel (haven\u0027t done it in 1.0.2 yet).\n\nIn .90, the entire journey took me around 12500 Dv\n\nRemember that duna has half the gravity of kerbin, and just slightly more than the mun.

The difference in DV from the node and calculator is gigantic, so I must be wrong somewhere.\n\nIt is impossible to execute the manoeuvre exactly as theoretically predicted.\n\nYou have to first make a general node in the direction with the approximate delta-v needed, then refine it by a few m/s using prograde/retrograde, radial/antiradial and normal/antinormal.\n\nUsually, using different directions has following consequences:\n\nPrograde/retrograde: moves encounter periapsis left or right when facing target prograde or retrograde (in front or behind planet)\n\nRadial/anti-radial: encounter sooner or later (use this if you see that your position will be in front / behind the one of your target at closest approach)\n\nNormal/antinormal: moves encounter periapsis up or down\n\nAnd then you will have an encounter but it still may disappear because of the game recalculating trajectories.\n\nSo after your first \u0022big\u0022 burn at Kerbin, you\u0027ll have to do a second one, about halfway to the encounter (or closest approach) to refine and to ensure you will actually encounter the target and get the periapsis you desire."},{"CreatedByName":"MajorThomas","CreatedById":94499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T20:34:42Z","Content":"What a great thread...such helpful people!\n\nRex, the trip planner not only gives you DV required to reach your target planet, it also tells you when your DV requirements are minimized, i.e., that\u0027s a good time to depart. You might have to wait 100-200 days (use time warp) for the relative positions of Kerbin and Duna to allow a good transfer. Kind of analogous to an orbital rendezvous, but with planets. If you wait until the right time, then you can get an encounter with your target when you setup your burn.\n\nAlso, remember this (rephrasing advice from Violent Jeb): To get to Duna, which is in a higher orbit around the sun than Kerbin, you need to leave Kerbin in the same direction that Kerbin is going around the sun. That will give you a higher orbit, which should intersect Duna.

The trips I\u0027ve made to Mun and Minmus were pretty much the same as before except for the re-entry, which is much more interesting, eventful and dangerous than ever before. The new aerodynamics and heating might make Duna landings more difficult--I dunno. \n\nIn the past I\u0027ve used drogue chutes, which slow you down part way, from a point higher up in the atmosphere. They worked well for Duna re-entry, which was typically a combo of engine burning and parachuting.

I recommend referencing a simple [Delta-V System Map](http://www.skyrender.net/lp/ksp/system_map.png) (values for going ground-to-orbit for bodies with atmospheres are outdated on that map as of 1.x, but the new values are generally lower), and using the [Kerbal Engineer Redux](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-2-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-16-6) plugin to determine the delta-v and TWR of each stage of your craft. No need to use any non-stock parts, just install the plugin and extra information appears in the VAB\n- Find your departure phase angle and ejection angle using the wonderful [Interactive illustrated interplanetary guide and calculator](http://ksp.olex.biz/)\n- Put your craft on the launch pad, go to map mode, and time warp to your departure window. Alt-F5 to make a named save here.\n- Launch to a standard 80km Eastward equatorial Low Kerbin Orbit. The launch stage(s) of your rocket should have between 1.2 and 1.8 TWR on Kerbin, and need ~4k (atmospheric) delta-v.\n- Go to map mode, zoom out, and set Duna as your target. Check your ascending/descending nodes, you want your orbit to be very close to coplanar with Duna\u0027s orbit. (Less than 0.5 degrees off, and better if it\u0027s 0.1 or 0.0 degrees off). Correct if necessary with a burn at your upcoming ascending or descending node (use a maneuver node to plan your burn, the pink handles are the ones you want for plane change. Perform plane change at the ascending/descending node only).\n- Put a maneuver node ahead of your craft, at the appropriate ejection angle.\n- Pull the prograde handle until your projected maneuver exits Kerbin\u0027s SoI. Zoom out, and gently push in on the retrograde handle until your plotted maneuver intersects Duna\u0027s orbit. You may see a projected encounter.  \n\n    - If your maneuver doesn\u0027t immediately show an encounter, likely it will show a closest approach. Note the \u0022target position at closest approach\u0022. If Duna is further along in its orbit by the time you get there, and you\u0027re missing it because you\u0027re late, zoom back in and advance your maneuver node along your orbit slightly (grab the gray circle, and drag it farther ahead along your orbit). Zoom back out, apply a bit of prograde or retrograde to your maneuver as necessary, and check where Duna is at closest approach. (obviously you go the other direction if you\u0027re arriving at Duna\u0027s orbit early, drag the maneuver node back a bit around your orbit).\n    - Repeat the above to tweak your maneuver until you find an encounter. If you\u0027re way off, you might try pushing the apoapsis of your maneuver (Sun apoapsis) out farther past Duna\u0027s orbit slightly, this will give you more intersection area to search with.\n    - Your maneuver shouldn\u0027t require any use of the blue or pink handles.\n\n    [\\*]Once you get an encounter, quicksave. \n\n    - As a check, this maneuver should cost around 1100 delta-v. Allowing 1200 to 1300 in your craft\u0027s budget is a reasonable safety margin for human pilot error.\n- If everything looks good, perform the plotted maneuver. (don\u0027t forget to quicksave).\n- Time Warp until about the halfway point of your interplanetary journey. Toss a maneuver node out in front of your craft somewhere (hours or days ahead is fine). Use this maneuver node to \u0022tweak\u0022 your approach to Duna. Toy gently with each axis, see if you can get your projected encounter down under 100km. It should take very little delta-v this far away.  \n\n    - Don\u0027t be afraid to just delete the maneuver node and make a new one, this is trial and error.\n\n    [\\*]If you\u0027ve got a good \u0022cleanup\u0022 maneuver plotted, warp to and perform it.\n\n    [\\*]Warp the rest of the way until you\u0027re about to enter Duna\u0027s SoI. Cross the Sphere of Influence boundary at time warp 50x or below.\n\n    [\\*]As soon as you enter Duna\u0027s SoI, turn off time warp, toss a maneuver node out in front of your craft, and do final cleanup of your approach. If you want to aerocapture, plot an intercept around 15km or lower. It helps if it\u0027s near equatorial (land near the equator, at least, or your return journey will require expensive plane-change maneuvers). Once you\u0027ve plotted an acceptable approach, Alt-F5 and make a named quicksave. You may want to come back and adjust for a higher or lower entry into the atmosphere (if you burn up, for example).\n\n    [\\*]Warp ahead until you\u0027re almost in Duna\u0027s atmosphere (50km). Let the atmo do its work, this is the exciting part! Take some screenshots.\n\n    [\\*]As you slow down and the heating effects diminish, deploy your parachutes and/or start your landing burn. Parachutes can help, but you\u0027re probably going to have to do a powered landing (I did).\n\n    [\\*]It should require somewhat less than 1380 (atmospheric) delta-v to do a powered landing on Duna, with a TWR of 2 or more (on Duna). You could land with a lower TWR (anything over 1), but the closer to 1 you get the more dicey your landing will be. I hate having to do a full burn from way up just to avoid lithobraking. The atmosphere will help you slow down significantly, and parachutes can help. Budgeting between 1k and 1200 delta-v for your landing phase should be plenty of margin.\n\n    [\\*]Piloting a powered landing on Duna is probably easier than landing on Mun, the atmosphere will help reduce lateral drift relative to the surface, and parachutes can help stabilize your craft.\n\n    [\\*]Touchdown! Take some screenshots, do some science, while away the time until your return window.\n\n    [\\*]Launch to an equatorial orbit of Duna. The atmosphere stops at 50km.\n\n    - Launching to orbit on Duna is much easier than on Kerbin, more like Mun. It has a lower gravity so requires less thrust, and the atmosphere is pretty thin, treat it more or less like Mun.\n    - Your Duna orbit stage requires a TWR of 1.2 or greater (on Duna), and about 1500 (atmospheric) delat-v to be safe.\n\n    [\\*]Check that your orbit is coplanar with Kerbin. (you can set Kerbin as your target).\n\n    [\\*]Warp to the appropriate return phase angle (you can warp much faster from the tracking station).\n\n    [\\*]Plot your return to Kerbin the same way you plotted the intercept with Duna. Put a maneuver node at the appropriate ejection angle, and fiddle it around until you find an intercept. Your return should require the same 1100 or so delta-v.\n\n    [\\*]Perform the maneuver, do a mid-course cleanup maneuver if necessary.\n\n    [\\*]Just after you enter Kerbin\u0027s SoI, plot a maneuver that lets you aerocapture (20km or so altitude should be a capture).\n\n    [\\*]Perform your final burn and/or landing site selection if you want to be fancy.\n\n    [\\*]Don\u0027t burn up, then pop parachutes and marvel at the blue and green beauty of Kerbin as you float gently down to the surface.\n\n    [\\*]\n\n[Here\u0027s the craft](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5r4Eq1EYOb6TUQwWWh6Z3pMWms\u0026authuser=0) I did the journey with.
