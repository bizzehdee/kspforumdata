But then I decided, maybe I can load my latest autosave, so I held F9... IT REVERTED ME BACK TO SOME SCENARIO MONTHS AGO!!! \n\nI thought since I see the (auto saving) light up every so often during a mission, that means its saving my game. I\u0027ve lost all my progress. I just want to go back to where I was. How can I get my progress back?"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T04:48:09Z","Content":"Press Alt-F9. AutoSaving is not a function of the game, it is a function of the mod and the F9 key doesn\u0027t go look for those save files so you have to load them manually.\n\nEDIT: Oops the AutoSaving message means it is saving the persistence file. That also occurs when you change scenes. But mods (I think Alarm Clock?) do an auto quicksave.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T04:52:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 04:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T07:20:19Z","Content":"Force-closing KSP before the quickloaded file takes over the persistence file might work."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T08:38:02Z","Content":"Yeah, sorry you had to learn it as late as you did, but the quicksave and the autosave are two different files. This is a good thing because then if you, say, make a quicksave before re-entry, it won\u0027t get overwritten by an autosave 30 seconds later when you\u0027re about to explode because you came in too steep.\n\nNow that you have learned, this\u0027ll sound like useless advice, but it is good to have at least one or two extra backup saves in case something bugs out or you make a tragic mistake."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T12:35:08Z","Content":"For completeness:\n\n**persistent.sfs** is the current game state. Autosaving updates the stored version of this. It is also replaced when you (quick)load a different state ...\n\n**quicksave.sfs** is the game state most recently quicksaved with F5. This is what F9 will quickload.\n\n**\\*.sfs** you can save any number of other, named, game states within a save by using alt-F5 (Windows, mod-F5 or whatever your control settings are). These are loaded with alt-F9 (although, since there\u0027s no difference in the file structure you can load quicksave.sfs or even persistent.sfs with alt-F9 as well, if you want to)."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T14:54:49Z","Content":"Have you made any named saves?

Some mods including Kerbal Alarm Clock back up saves for you, or else check whatever system backups you take.\n\nIf you don\u0027t have a backup your remaining option is to attempt data recovery. I use [PhotoRec](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec). Download it and save it to an external drive, then run it and tell it to look for text files and save them to an external drive (*not* the drive in your computer or you risk overwriting the files you\u0027re trying to recover!).\n\nYour ship designs are stored in separate files and they will not have been overwritten. If data recovery fails you might opt to cheat to catch up on the lost progress as best as you can remember it, either using the game\u0027s cheat options accessed by Alt\u002BF12 or with the Hyperedit mod."}]}
