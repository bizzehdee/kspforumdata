In the past it was more areo-efficient to NOT put nose cones on your rocket because the added weight meant the rocket performed worse in atmo. That is no longer the case. Adding nose cones now makes your rocket slice through the air like a knife, rather than ram through the air like a pancake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T05:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in my days Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere was so thick, you could bit off chunks of it and chew it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n*shakes his old man stick*\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T06:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the thickness of the atmosphere encouraged you to go straight up 10km before cranking over 45 degrees. That meant you burned a LOT of fuel fighting gravity. Now, not only is that unnecessary it can cause your ship to flip out of control (sharp turns in atmo are bad). It\u0027s far better to tap over after you get up to 50-100m/s and slowly tilt over throughout the climb, ideally still hitting about 45 degrees at 10km, but doing it gradually instead of all at once. Due to this you fight gravity far less and put your fuel to use giving you sideways velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t think this makes the game easier, by the way.
