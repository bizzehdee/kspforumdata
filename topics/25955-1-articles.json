Meticulous planning isn\u0027t nearly as effective in KSP as it is in real life, because we don\u0027t have the tools for it. We can\u0027t set up bi-elliptic transfers easily, we can\u0027t control the flow of fuel very well, and we can\u0027t throttle down one set of engines while keeping another at full power.

Too many things can go wrong, and if one does then you might have wasted a lot of time and effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing to remember is that in real life, space programs have access to detailed simulators before they send their actual missions, and they can calculate everything they need beforehand. For us, KSP is both simulator and \u0022reality\u0022; the only way to know whether a design will work is to try it out. I went through a half-dozen iterations of my Kethane refinery vessel, sending it to Minmus and trying to refuel it, before I perfected the version I\u0027ve used since.

The goal was to land on all four moons (Pol didn\u0027t exist back then) and return the crew back to Kerbin and without leaving any space junk in stable orbit anywhere and no ditching of LV-N on Kerbin or Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a mission of such size and complexity planning becomes essential. First you\u0027ve got to figure out the most delta-V efficient mission profile. Then you have to design and test each vehicle separately to know that they can handle their part of the mission, finally you got to design your ships in mind so that when the four are docked together the resulting combined spacecraft can actually be controlled (ie, the two smaller landers docked on the side have to be about equal in mass and geometry) to do Jool transfer burn and aerobraking. I took me something like a month to work out all the details of the mission to be confident enough to fly it for real. Even so I make a mistake in assuming delta-V to get back from Jool is equal to delta-V to reach Jool for Kerbin, Turns out due to Jool\u0027s massive gravity I actually needed 1000m/s more than I budgeted for so I had to improvise the mission and send a tanker to Jool to bail out the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wonder how I did the test, the mission profile I ended up settling on goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
