To be honest, the biggest thing I\u0027ve ever done was make a station in orbit of Jool, but that\u0027s another story. I\u0027m usually one to use cheats, but I did this one 100% legit. The only cheats I used were to get my test vehicles and prototypes in orbit of Gilly. I then encountered Gilly and landed on it myself with the final version. The craft I used was the third iteration: the Gilly 3. Name: amazing. Mind: blown. Anyway, this vehicle involved no part clipping of any sort. It ran on Xenon, with a small Ion engine on the back to propel it up some of the larger cliffs. I also used it to keep my craft from flying away by pointing it at the ground. It ran mainly using PB-NUK generators, but had it\u0027s own solar panels to give it a boost. So, I present my attempt at the Elcano : Gilly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1 \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003Etyre breakage throughout the whole trip (I used the tire like an anchor to kill my speed so I didn\u0027t spend more than 10 seconds in the air!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100% Stock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note: Path isn\u0027t perfect due to having to cope with Gilly\u0027s rotation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EAlso please note this before saying anything like \u0027You need to get there legit first\u0027.

These screenshots where taken after the mission to prove that there was indeed a capable transfer vehicle, and thus do not meet Eve, due to it being after the transfer window. However, please note that it would still connect with Eve SOI if Eve was in its correct place. Note it doesn\u0027t come with the final rover because that is a separate craft, a fairing was installed to cover up the 3rd stage and above, and all power generators are on the final rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RUub3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Being the smallest certainly doesn\u0027t make it easiest. The rules stated I had to stay on the ground for as much time as possible, which proved quite a challenge. If Gilly had a high density (making it heavier) then it would be less of a challenge. However, trying to keep your wheels on the ground takes more skill than Circumnavigating Vall, for example.
