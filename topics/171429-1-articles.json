KSP players are pretty bright, so I hope that we\u0027re able to avoid this.\u00A0\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe principle of evidence-based policy is that policy changes should be guided by research and show a clear relationship between the proposed change and the desired outcome. Evidence-based policy also iterates; the results of changes are integrated back within the model to gauge their effectiveness and determine whether additional changes are warranted. Key to the process of evidence-based inquiry is the idea that results inform response and that changes are validated or invalidated by results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPublic health crises have often been approached from a position of principle: e.g., \u0022We have principles and platforms which dictate our response to this issue\u0022 rather than \u0022What outcomes do we want to see, and what changes can reasonably be expected to produce those outcomes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe US has a public health crisis involving the proliferation of high-powered firearms and their use by domestic terrorists and the mentally ill. It\u0027s a big issue right now, and there are a lot of people talking about solutions. While I recognize that this is politically-charged and we may not be able to discuss this from a scientific point of view, I\u0027d like to see if forum-goers could have a reasoned discussion about an evidence-based approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo that end: what policy changes do you think should be implemented, what results do you think those changes would have, and how would you measure the success or failure of those changes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thoughts below, spoilered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRaise the minimum age for purchase of any firearms to 21. This should limit the availability of firearms to younger people, and we should see a decrease in the number of accidental firearm deaths among teenagers.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe ATF should produce policy identifying certain ammunition types with a high potential for abuse. High-velocity, small-caliber rounds like the 5.56x45 are designed to produce massive wounds with low recoil and were created specifically for the military. Ammunition types identified by the ATF as having a high potential for abuse should require a NICS check to be purchased, and be subject to additional taxes. This should decrease the general availability of this ammunition, prevent criminals from purchasing this ammunition, and limit the availability of a would-be shooter to stockpile ammunition with impunity. We should see a decrease in the number of crimes committed with firearms chambered in these calibers.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSemi-automatic firearms chambered for ammunition identified by the ATF as having a high potential for abuse should be subject to a substantial additional tax. This should discourage the purchase of these firearms by the general public and inhibit access by would-be shooters. We should see a decrease in the number of these firearms recovered from crime scenes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe purchase of any semi-automatic firearm should require permitting similar to that required for concealed carry, including safety training, expanded background check, and mental health evaluation. Semi-automatic firearms would be subject to additional taxation. We should see an sharp decline in the use of semiautomatic weapons in crimes, and a corresponding overall decrease in crime involving firearms generally.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLaw enforcement officers and public health officials should be enabled to place a flag on the NICS database to identify individuals they believe to be at risk for violent crime due to mental health or other established criteria. This NICS flag would be subject to administrative review but would prevent someone with this flag from immediately passing a NICS check. We should see an increase in the number of gun sales stopped due to NICS failures.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-26T15:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoy, let\u0027s see how long this is being suffered by the moderators :-) The discussion is imo only a political one ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a European, so this doesn\u0027t apply to me and i should up.

America is a very vast land with very vast wildlife. Think of Svalbard. In Svalbard, even today, carrying firearms are required when going to the wilderness. All for the polar bears, despite polar bears being a somewhat threatened species. Some American still have these thoughts, which isn\u0027t a wrong thing; but the level\u00A0and extent is definitely unique given how developed the country is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other parts of the world, firearms for hunting isn\u0027t exactly something unreachable. We still have them. People in Europe would have them (though probably not in the west, central, east or south). But the firearms are very small and limited in power. Usually, the bullet are just enough for very small birds, nothing more. They\u0027re not being used to kill wild boars in one shot or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest problem is that in your wildlife-thriving megaland, the power level and their availability extent would make everyone from everywhere else in slight disbelief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I would be honest, there should be a few things :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Concealed carry. People knows when you\u0027re hunting or whether you\u0027re just being... cocky. There\u0027s no need for this, unless it\u0027s a civillian-clothed officers or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Firepower. While you might want to kill a grizzly bear in Yellowstone or a deer with something that will torn them down in one shot, there\u0027s absolutely no need for civillians to have them in the human town. I propose for a safe in the national park themselves. You can carry these high-power beasts... but only in the park range. Leave them there after you\u0027ve done your feast. The only firearm you\u0027d have in town would be tiny pistols with those songbird-killing bullets, and then no concealed carry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Availability. Now, I have no way of proving this, but you need to step down the number of gun stores and their location. You don\u0027t need them in the middle of Manhattan; no, you don\u0027t even need them in the middle of yur vast suburbia. Maybe open them in places where your people would be happy hunting wildlife and not humanlife. Obviously, you\u0027ll need police corps with power to beat some AK-47 as they\u0027ll have problems buying rifles in town\u00A0again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Licensing and permit. I\u0027ll say that this is clear enough, unless if we want to escalate to general ID card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not saying using firearms is entirely a bad thing given your location.
