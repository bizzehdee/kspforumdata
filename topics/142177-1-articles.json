I went to Duna, and landed there, and after heading back into orbit and docking I ran some calculations and was tickled to find I had just enough fuel to also land on Ike. That didn\u0027t go quite as smoothly.. but the craft and Kerbal were well enough to make it back to the command module and get all docked up, and the crew are ready to prepare for the trip home.\u00A0So we come to my current situation. I\u0027m in a fairly low orbit over Ike, roughly 30km parked and my question is this: Whats the best way to get home from here? Obviously I\u0027ll have to make sure I\u0027m in a decent enough launch window but I\u0027m talking more about what I do in Duna\u0027s sphere of influence. Should I wait until Ike is at the ejection angle and burn directly from there? Or would it be best to drop myself into a highly elliptical orbit\u00A0around Duna and use the gravity assist to help me pick up velocity, again, obviously timing it to line up with the ejection angle. Or should I do a Hohmann transfer to a lower/higher parking orbit around Duna and go from there? I doubt that last one is a very smart choice... but I\u0027m no expert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-21T09:21:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2016 09:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SkippydaHippie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-21T10:03:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongrats on being interplanetary! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a physicist, my gut instinct is that choice #1 is best. Ike gives you a decent amount of free orbital velocity around Duna, and some Oberth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Option #2, to get to a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E around Duna, you would have to burn\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eretrograde\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0to Ike\u0027s orbital velocity -- so you\u0027d have to waste 400m/s of deltaV (or so)\u00A0from your engines\u00A0to escape Ike and lower your orbital speed. And Duna isn\u0027t going to give you much of a slingshot, since you are only slingshotting with the deltaV you pick up falling from Ike\u0027s orbit\u00A0and not at interplanetary speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 3 is very bad, agreed. You\u0027d waste all the Oberth from both Duna and Ike. If you burn to change\u00A0your orbit just to gain some Oberth, you never come out ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_Danger","CreatedById":159757,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-21T13:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I vote for #1 also.

It felt tricky, for a noob anyway, and I wasn\u0027t totally sure it would work. But it did, and will for you too. Like you said just wait until Ike is at the ejection angle and set your burn to send you off more or less (more, preferably) along Ike\u0027s prograde. You should be able to encounter Kerbin for about 600m/s. You got this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
