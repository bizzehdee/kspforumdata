Long time lurker and reader, first time challenge creator. Also, I\u0027ve streamed KSP on Twitch for like 500\u002B hours. Don\u0027t call it a first post, I\u0027ve been here for years. That seemed funnier before I wrote it down. Anyway, I\u0027ve been working on a little project since teaching keeps me from my usual shenanigans. For some reason, it got into my head that I could design a Single Stage to Mun spaceplane. After looking at the forums, I saw that there was indeed at some ancient time a challenge related to this endeavor. However, it was several versions ago (like in the days of .19 or so) and it had some pretty arbitrary restrictions that I didn\u0027t like (such as restricting certain engines or flat-out stating that you had to cut your turbojets off at a predetermined altitude, etc.) Plus the scoring, and therefore the planning/playing of the challenge involved math. After finishing my PhD dissertation that involved using statistics, I have concluded that math sucks. I have therefore re-written and expanded the original challenge to be less restrictive and more fun (read: requires no math for me to score or for you to plan your scoring).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, KSP and no math? That\u0027s crazy! But being crazy never stopped me before. Instead the basis of scoring AND the challenge itself is to create a single-stage craft capable of doing certain things during a mission. Let\u0027s call these \u0022Achievements.\u0022 Instead of having a big windy description of what I want you to do, we\u0027ll embrace the sandboxiness of the game itself and let you choose which Achievements you want to try for/think are reasonable for your skill level. The person who can bag the most Achievements in a single mission wins. In the event that multiple people do all the achievements in a single mission, then we shall have a lot of fun, because that\u0027s a lot of playing this wonderful game. The list of possible achievements can be expanded as people give feedback on the challenge. In cases where achievements are inclusive then both achievements are awarded. For example, if you achieve \u0022Return to Sender (land on the runway/within the boundaries back at KSC intact)\u0022 you also get \u0022Down Home on the Terrain (return to Kerbin\u0027s surface intact).\u0022 See? Two achievements for one--Blast! I just realized something. Scoring this challenge will require addition. Oh well. Nothing is perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround rules: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a) Stock parts only. *Exception for .24.2: You may use Spaceplane\u002B since that will soon be added to stock.* .25 and higher should use only stock parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Craft must be a single stage controlled by action grouping if you need to switch between engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E c) It can be either a spaceplane or a rocket or a hybrid of both (i.e. a VTOL).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E d) No refueling allowed. The only direction fuel may flow is out of your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You may use Kerbal Engineer Redux. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You may NOT use Mechjeb (at least for piloting--using it in the VAB/SPH is fine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) List of acceptable mods not lucky enough to get their own line in the rules: TAC Fuel Balancer (or equivalent). Docking-Camera or Docking Alignment Indicator. Enhanced Navball(s). Anything that adds ONLY visuals or sound effects (Texture Replacer, EVE, etc.) ScanSat. RasterPropMontior. Basically anything that doesn\u0027t add fuel tanks and engines or too much difficulty (or ease). This is to make entries comparable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) FAR and NEAR are allowed, but will be recorded on their own score board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) With the exception of payloads, you may not detach anything from your craft. This includes \u0022Litho-staging\u0022 spent tanks or engines by scraping them across the terrain in a controlled fashion. This also includes using over-heating to discard tanks/engines. This also also includes using action groups to \u0022Jettison\u0022 engines. Any attempt where a craft loses parts is considered a failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) A payload must have mass and (at least conceivably) serve a purpose. This means a \u0022payload\u0022 cannot be a Kerbal in a capsule that you will transfer to a station, as said Kerbal won\u0027t add mass to the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Acceptable payloads include but aren\u0027t limited to: Fuel tanks with docking ports left in an orbit (as fuel depots FOR OTHER CRAFT). Mapping or communications satellites (even if comms don\u0027t matter in the stock game), science modules that you literally drop onto the surface, mini-drone-based-lander-thingies (you know what I\u0027m talking about), or perhaps a little rover for Kerbals to tour around in. Again it must: serve a conceivable purpose and have mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) All landings must be done with the main craft--no sending a dockable lander!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) To submit your entry take a screenshot or video of any of the achievement conditions. Make sure the UI is displayed and Resources Panel is visible.
