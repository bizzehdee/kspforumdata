First the ability to select multiple craft either with ctrl or shift with the usual functions and then be able to terminate them all instead of doing the same actions repeated over and over (about 300 mouse clicks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like the option to make a craft be debris from the tracking station as an option when terminating so instead of just terminating (which I always imagine as explosive leaving no debris) I could make the craft just \u0060switch off\u0060 and turn into debris. I would imagine this would not kill the occupants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would mean I could select many craft and make them be debris or terminate with a single mouse click (two if you count the \u0060are you sure\u0060 requester)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0060Fly\u0060 button would be greyed out when multiple craft are selected of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T19:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryone wants the option to mass delete orbital junk for a while now.
