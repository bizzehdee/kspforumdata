I know mechjeb and the onboard flight computer can execute pre-programmed maneuvers, but what about things like deployment and staging?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay I\u0027ve got a lander on it\u0027s way to a Duna aerocapture. Before entry interface, I need to make sure the cruise stage is jettisoned, the antennas and solar panels are stowed, and the craft is in the proper attitude. Then the heat shield needs to be jettisoned, the chutes deployed, and the landing thrusters activated. Then after landing, the solar panels have to be re-deployed, and the antennas activated. All of this has to happen in the correct order, at the correct time, and all out of real-time contact. So how do you guys do that?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-18T07:18:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2014 07:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by brooklyn666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T00:21:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMJ can autostage, but I don\u0027t know if it can activate anything other than panels and legs while landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WafflesToo","CreatedById":71736,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T00:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen the cfg file, find the line that says SIGNALDELAY and set it to \u0022false\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously though, this sounds like a doozy.
