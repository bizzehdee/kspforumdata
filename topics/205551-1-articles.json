These were were not offered missions, rather active Research Bodies missions in progress. The bug part is that Research Bodies doesn\u0027t have an exact orbit, rather just 200,000\u002B. Diagnosed had to be Research Bodies because that was only missions offered or active by the RepoSoft company displayed on orbit mouse hover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-11-08T14:16:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2021 02:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by fragtzack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ediscovered issue\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"splashboom","CreatedById":213457,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-18T01:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely stock.
