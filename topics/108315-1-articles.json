And it\u0027s a 6-month stay now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, over the past few weeks I\u0027ve been working on a reasonable process for a SpaceX and Bigelow Aerospace-manufactured lunar landing by or in 2019. The destination? The lunar south pole/Aitken basin. It\u0027s called Artemis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt involves 5 Falcon Heavy launches, and it would accomplish the following goals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[I]1.

Set up a permanent outpost that can be visited by future missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E5. Prove that the Dragon V2 can be used beyond Earth Orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E6. Prove that long-duration lunar missions can take place safely.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E7. Use minimal non-existent hardware.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E8.

It will be used as a transit habitat and an Earth Departure Stage throughout the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next Heavy launch would be for the Re-Usable Ovoid Lunar Outpost Module (RULOM). It would be a surface version of the BA-330.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fourth Heavy would launch a Dragon-L. It\u0027s a Dragon filled with supplies and experiments with the trunk replaced with a new module: The Lunar Deceleration Stage (LDS). The LDS\u0027 purpose is to slow down the Dragon or Dragon V2 spacecraft to the point where it\u0027s main landing engines will be able to land it safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Dragon-L would then land close to the RULOM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few days later, the final Falcon Heavy, carrying a Dragon V2-L (Just a V2 version of the Dragon-L carrying 3 or 4 people) named Artemis I would launch. The V2-L would dock with \u003Cem\u003EGazelle \u003C/em\u003Eand then the two docked spacecraft would proceed to lunar orbit. The Gazelle would be placed in a very low parking orbit that will only last about a year, but it won\u0027t stay there for that long. The purpose of the extremely low orbit is because the V2-L\u0027s main landing engines still don\u0027t have the Delta-V to get to a normal lunar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe V2-L would then land in a similar fashion to the V1-L, near the RULOM and V1-L. The crew would then exit the V2-L and live in the RULOM for the next six months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter six months have passed, the crew would board the V2-L, ascend to low lunar orbit, and then depart for Earth. \u003Cem\u003EGazelle \u003C/em\u003Ewould be placed into a stable LEO orbit to be converted into a space station or re-used for another Artemis mission. Artemis I would re-enter and recover safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does everyone think of this new plan?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T16:00:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by _Augustus_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERe-did plan.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T02:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo. Unless they have a secret program we don\u0027t know about.

You could easily fling a Dragon V2 to the moon or Mars or pretty much anywhere in the inner solar system using a Falcon Heavy. Dragon V2 is already in the process of being fully certified and manrated (Falcon 9/Heavy already are), and even then there are absolutely no regulations stopping SpaceX from sending their own people (non-NASA astronauts) into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jonboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jonboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey\u0027ll need the Falcon Heavy and that won\u0027t be ready by 2019. Once they get the Falcon Heavy a lunar mission is certainly conceivable. For example, SpaceX could launch a cargo Dragon to the surface with rovers and supplies. Then a crewed Dragon lands next to that one for a stay that could last for several weeks.\u003Cp\u003EBut remember that they would have to build the Falcon Heavy, develop lunar spacesuits, modify the Dragon capsules for lunar landing and return, perform tests and dry runs to ensure that the procedures are safe and efficient.

Falcon Heavy will be flying next year. Elon Musk has stated that Dragon V2 is already capable of landing on the moon; all it takes are minor modifications. SpaceX could definitely land something on the moon by 2019, just not people. A SpaceX Apollo 8 mission is more likely imo, but who knows what Elon wants to do (certainly not me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpaceX doesn\u0027t plan missions or develop payloads.
