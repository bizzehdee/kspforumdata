If you wish to hold 20\u00B0 vertically while travelling east, face east and aim at 20\u00B0 then engage stability assist in surface mode. When the navball is changed to orbital mode then change the plane of reference back to its normal behavior (the way stability assist works now).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-30T18:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerfect.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-30T19:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you\u0027re saying is you want the \u0027stability assist\u0027 in surface mode to keep true to your flight path, instead of to your attitude in a straight line (not taking in account the surface curvature)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E in surface mode will fly a straight line when you set it to Stability Assist, however, the ground underneath you isn\u0027t straight but it\u0027s curved. So if you want to keep a constant vertical speed, you\u0027d need to keep pitching down to correct for that surface curvature. The effect isn\u0027t really that pronounced at low speeds, but if you\u0027re going really fast (approaching orbital speeds or even beyond that) you\u0027d need to correct for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never understood the current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modes in the \u0027surface\u0027 and \u0027target\u0027 navball modes anyway. Most of the time they serve no purpose -- the only modes that are useful are prograde (forward) and retrograde (reverse). Normal and radial (left, right, up, down) modes make no sense when flying across the surface because they will cause you to chase your own flight vector perpendicular to your flight path, which is a good way to start flying in circles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore sensible, context-sensitive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modes would be a good idea.

The desired behavior is that once stability assist has been engaged in surface mode your attitude stays locked to a single position on the navball. It may not be necessary to take surface curvature directly into account as you could just keep a certain angle and orientation on the navball, however if you did this whenever you approached a planets pole your vessel would get very confused and probably fall out of the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222781627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148999\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475265249\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139954\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stoney3K\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Stoney3K said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore sensible, context-sensitive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modes would be a good idea.
