At sea level, the temperature is nice and normal. Then as you go higher, air temperature drops a whole lot. The middle layer, the stratosphere, has very cold air. But what lies above the stratosphere? The so-called thermosphere. Sounds hot, doesn\u0027t it? Because it is. Air temperature in the thermosphere rises rapidly, and climbs very high. Much higher than at sea level. Eventually the thermosphere fades out into vacuum, which is cold again, but there\u0027s a temperature peak somewhere in the upper atmosphere. And since convective heat exchange is a thing that happens in KSP, that means that during reentry, you\u0027re dealing not only with shock heating but actually with hot air as well. And if you ever wondered why the heat load of your capsule goes down sharply as you pass a certain point on your way down: this is not only because you\u0027re starting to slow down more aggressively. It is also because you\u0027re transitioning out of the hottest part of the atmosphere into the coldest part of the atmosphere, and that literally air-cools your spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Shock heating and drag don\u0027t increase the same way with atmospheric density. At the edge of vacuum, drag starts lower, but it scales up much faster than heat does. This means that if you go lower down, you\u0027re trading only a little more heat for a large amount of extra drag. In most cases, this is a trade very much in your favor. The only thing you need to avoid is exceeding your part heat thresholds. If you\u0027re not near that value, it\u0027s often a good idea to go down faster, earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- For the most part, people think about the maximum allowable part temperature as a transient state when thinking about how much reentry heat they can handle. \u0022When I come down like this, things never get hotter than 1600 K, and my part can handle 2000 K, so I\u0027ll be fine because temperature goes away again after the peak.\u0022 This simplification is okay on a typical ballistic reentry of a craft that comes out of cold space. But when you look more closely, temperature is a little more complicated. Temperature is the result of X amount of heat energy inserted into Y amount of thermal mass. The skin of a spacecraft has low thermal mass, which means that it responds very quickly to reentry heat. In fact, it would burn up within a second or two if it didn\u0027t have a way to get rid of the heat that is flowing into it. Four ways exist for the skin to shed heat. Convection sheds heat to surrounding gas or liquid as it flows past the skin. This works best in the stratosphere and worst in the thermosphere (see point 1 above). Blackbody radiation sheds heat independent of its surroundings. Conduction sheds heat by transferring it to other parts of the spacecraft - and in particular, to the internal structure of the same part. Finally, heatshields can do pyrolysis, which is to say, they consume large amounts of energy to fuel the chemical process of decomposing a part of themselves and shedding the glowing hot mass that results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these ways share the same basic trait: they work better the hotter the skin is. And for the first three, it\u0027s specifically the temperature of the skin \u003Cem\u003Ein relation to its heat exchange partner\u003C/em\u003E. Convection works best if the air is cold. Blackbody radiation works best in the absence of incoming radiation (i.e. while in the shadow). Conduction works best when conducting to other parts, or to internals, which are cold. This has two implications. First, the hotter the skin gets, the more it resists getting even hotter. Taking a part from 90% to 100% heat load costs much, \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E more energy than taking it from 40% to 50%. That is why you sometimes survive reentry even though your heat bars look just about full - getting those last few degrees takes a lot of extra heat, because convection, conduction and radiation are all working at peak efficiency to transfer heat away from the loaded skin. Second - and this is the whole point I\u0027ve been building up to: the longer your reentry takes, the worse your tolerances get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you spend a long time flying with high skin temperatures, then that heat is going to go somewhere else. It\u0027s going to transfer to parts that are not in the airstream, and it\u0027s going to transfer to the internals of the parts that are in the airstream. Internals have the majority of the thermal mass of a part, so they can take in a lot of energy and only increase in temperature slowly. But as they increase in temperature, the difference between them and the temperature of the skin gets reduced. This, in turn, means that conduction of heat away from the skin slows down over time as your craft soaks heat. And with conduction slowing down, the skin is going to have a problem. In order to not overheat, it must have the same heat flux outbound as it is getting inbound from shock heating. And in order to maintain its outbound heat flux while conduction is slowing down, it needs to increase its temperature so that all the other ways of losing heat improve. So the skin gets hotter, even if the external heat load doesn\u0027t change at all. And hotter. And hotter. Of course, if there are other parts on the craft that are not in the airstream (i.e. if it\u0027s not just a single capsule), then those parts will also start shedding heat via convection and radiation as they heat up. So the craft may never actually soak heat to the point of melting to slag. But it still creates a situation where your heat tolerances shrink over time. You can\u0027t go lower, because your skin is almost maxed out; and you can\u0027t stay where you are either, because you\u0027re just soaking heat without really slowing down, and making things worse as time goes on. It\u0027s really awkward. In extreme cases, you can literally burn up in the atmosphere from being too timid during reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the case of an ICBM, as is the topic of this thread, heat soak while traveling through the thermosphere might cause the warhead to fail as it dives down towards its target, even if the heat load would nominally be survivable if the missile was cold. Therefore, I echo the suggestions given in favor of a suborbital hop outside the atmosphere.

Blackbody radiation only transfers heat if there is a transparent window to someplace really cold. This is why you will get radiative frost on a car on a clear night, but not on a cloudy night at the same temperature. So, when you are cruising along above 61km on Kerbin, your ship is merrily shedding heat to space through blackbody radiation. As soon as you enter a fireball, blackbody cooling shuts down. So you can cruise at very high altitudes for long periods and stay cold, even though you are in the thermosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, Streetwind is ignoring a very large fifth\u00A0sink for energy. Energy can not only be shed through drag (friction) --\u00A0the aerodynamics can also produce\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elift.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0If your ship has a 50% lift to drag ratio, then a third of your kinetic energy that you are shedding is being turned into lift, which does not cause any heating at all. Body lift during reentry is an extremely important phenomenon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, the faster you shed energy to your surroundings, the hotter the surroundings\u00A0will get. The plasma ball around a ship traveling at 1800 m/s will not be nearly as hot as the plasma ball around a ship traveling at 3100 m/s at the same altitude. So while a quick descent will\u00A0avoid\u00A0heating problems early in your reentry, it\u00A0makes them significantly worse later in your reentry. It is not a free trade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd all of this can be demonstrated empirically. You don\u0027t need to take anybody\u0027s word for it. Just try it. If you try a shallow reentry method, where you stay above 61km for a very extended period, does your ship heatsplode every time? And if it doesn\u0027t then doesn\u0027t that mean there is a factor that Streetwind\u0027s arguments are not taking into account? Because according to those arguments, staying high should be 100% fatal. Keep in mind, though, that you need to be doing some\u00A0productive braking while you are zooming along \u0027way up there.

Blackbody radiation only transfers heat if there is a transparent window to someplace really cold. This is why you will get radiative frost on a car on a clear night, but not on a cloudy night at the same temperature. So, when you are cruising along above 61km on Kerbin, your ship is merrily shedding heat to space through blackbody radiation. As soon as you enter a fireball, blackbody cooling shuts down. So you can cruise at very high altitudes for long periods and stay cold, even though you are in the thermosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs KSP\u0027s modeling that precise, though?

IF you have the heat tolerance for the worse part later-on. In the reverse view: you would gain nothing from performing a slow, timid reentry that peaks at 1600 K if your capsule is rated for 2200 K, or you have a heatshield rated for 3100 K with a massive amount of pyrolysis flux fighting the gaining of temperature every step of the way. Just get right down there into it, IMHO!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, there are factors of orbital mechanics that can work in your favor or against you. The rate of descent is slowest when close to AP and close to PE, and it is the fastest in the middle of the two. If you set your reentry up right, that fast descent rate in the middle of the apses will see you rush through the upper atmosphere, and the combination of body lift and careful periapsis planning will nearly arrest your descent rate once you are approaching the stratosphere. Then you have a short time of nearly level flight in a regime with survivable shock heating, cooler air, and significant slowing force, all of which will contribute to a fast, safe and consitent reentry with moderate g-forces. If, in the opposite case, you leave from a low apopasis right above the atmosphere, you will spend time with a slow descent rate in the upper atmosphere, where what little drag you get will mostly just drop your periapsis lower. And as the air slowly gets thicker, your descent rate picks up, your periapsis continues dropping because you\u0027re still only halfway there, and you can potentially run into a situation where you hit the stratosphere fairly steeply and get a sharp deceleration spike with high g-forces and peak heat near the end of the reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceplanes can usually prevent this, because they have the lift required to pull out of this dive; a capsule however lacks this lift, and such a trajectory is a very poor choice for it. Additionally, even a spaceplane doesn\u0027t gain anything from not making use of what heat tolerance it has available. It\u0027s just that their tolerances are much tighter to begin with, so it rarely comes up that a pilot says \u0022you know what, I could be more aggressive here\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222917955\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154821\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221484143138\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if it doesn\u0027t then doesn\u0027t that mean there is a factor that Streetwind\u0027s arguments are not taking into account?
