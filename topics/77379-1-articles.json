But if you want perfectly timed gravity slingshots you need a perfect launch window and a perfect initial position for the targets, which means sitting around in 100,000 times warp in the tracking station for at least as long (usually longer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t try to describe it in words, because I have several videos on the subject.

For an encounter to happen, you and your target have to be \u003Cstrong\u003Ein the same place at the same time\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst let\u0027s work on \u0022same place\u0022. To be at the same place as your target, your orbital path must cross the target\u0027s orbital path. Let\u0027s say you\u0027re at Jool and you want to get to Kerbin as per your example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you like, you can Just burn away from Jool (leave Jool so that your ejection angle is solar retrograde) for long enough that your solar periapsis gets down to Kerbin. Or, to save many-a-delta-V, you can slingshot off Tylo. But for now let\u0027s just say you burn your way down for simplicity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, now you\u0027re in a solar orbit with a periapsis near Kerbin\u0027s orbit, so if we look \u0022down on the map from above\u0022, your orbit lines will appear to cross. But what about if we look from the \u0022side\u0022? Where does your orbit pass above or below Kerbin\u0027s orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get an intercept, the point where you pass above or below Kerbin\u0027s orbit (ie, the ascending or descending node) must also be the point where you pass inside or outside Kerbin\u0027s orbit. So you need to make a normal plus or normal minus correction until the ascending or descending node moves around to the point where the orbits appear to cross when looking from above. Note that you do not have to match planes with Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so now your orbit line passes exactly through Kerbin\u0027s orbit line at one point, or in other words we have the \u0022same place\u0022 part all figured out. But what about the \u0022same time\u0022 part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, this is actually pretty easy. The time it takes you to complete an orbit depends on how big the orbit is. And you can change how big the orbit is by burning prograde or retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, we don\u0027t want to mess up that \u0022same place\u0022 part, so we\u0027re going to perform that burn right at that point we set up earlier, where the orbits cross.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a maneuver node down at the crossing point. It doesn\u0027t have to be absolutely perfectly there, just \u0022pretty close\u0022. When you place that down, you will get a \u0022closest approach\u0022 marker on your orbit, and a \u0022target position at closest approach\u0022 marker on Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow put down another maneuver node on your orbit. I usually place it 270 degrees in front of that first node. This represents a maneuver that happens after that first maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow click the \u0022one orbit ahead\u0022 button on that second maneuver. You will see the approach markers move. Keep clicking it until the two markers are \u0022pretty close\u0022 to that first node we put down at the crossing point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow all you need to do is change your orbital period until the two markers come together at that point. Do this by pulling the prograde or retrograde handles of the first maneuver, the one at the crossing point. When you see an intercept happen, use the second maneuver to tweak your trajectory into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere so you can aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall changes to the first maneuver will have big changes on the intercept, and it can be difficult or impossible to get a perfect encounter periapsis. But you can always get a perfect encounter periapsis using the second maneuver, and it is much less sensitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
