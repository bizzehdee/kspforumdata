Aesthetics are the main difference between a spaceplane and an ugly old rocket. They\u0027re what separate us from reptiles and lawn furniture.

This plane is supposed to be able to take off from Kerbin and go nearly anywhere in the system, most especially Laythe. If I need vertical-lift SRBs to take off from Kerbin, I\u0027ll need them on Laythe. And ideally, this plane should be capable of being refueled to repeatedly land on Laythe as needed; eventually, I\u0027ll have a space station there, with a plane for ferrying people up and down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIII\u0026gt; The principle of the thing. A lifting-body design with lots of control surfaces SHOULD be perfectly capable of taking off from a runway at 110m/s without any canards or rocket engines. It\u0027s 32 tons, with three turbojets, so power isn\u0027t the problem.

Laythe has a fairly large sphere of influence (3.7 Mm) compared to its semi-major axis (27Mm). If you do the math, that means each time you pass through Laythe\u0027s orbit on a hyperbolic orbit you have at least a 5% chance of intersecting its SOI. (Laythe\u0027s orbit has a circumference of 2*pi*27Mm, and about 7.4Mm of that circumference falls within the SOI at any one time.) The shallower your transfer, the better the odds get (scaling as 1/cos(theta)). And then the odds get even better if you come in on the prograde direction, because the planet will be sweeping along its orbit at the same time you are, effectively increasing the amount of time in which an intercept can happen. So it\u0027s not uncommon at all to encounter Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, Mun\u0027s SOI is 2.4Mm at a distance of 12Mm, Tylo is 11Mm at 68.5Mm, and Ike has the best ratio of all (1.05Mm at a distance of 3.2Mm).
