No gamebreaking bugs thus far, and the only \u0022pucker\u0022 situation I was in was entering a system with a handful of hostiles and the game slowing considerably during the autosave. I wasn\u0027t sure if things would recover but after a good 30-45 seconds the autosave finished and things resumed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I have a dual screen setup, I only use a single screen at 2560x1440. A mix of Ultra, High, and Medium settings has me generally above 60FPS. In the major cities that drops, on vegetation rich planets that drops even further. I\u0027m in no hurry to seek out a performance improvement mod or anything like that. I\u0027ll hold out hope that Bethesda uses the coming weeks and months for further optimization targeting the consoles, which will trickle down to PC. Other than some sync issue between PC and Xbox, it has been smooth sailing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want to comment on the story as I feel any reaction can spoil the experience - I just started to watch Starfield content in hopes of being out in front of any \u0022spoiler-free content\u0022 that winds up having minor spoilers. Gameplaywise, it\u0027s Bethesda from top to bottom with a space setting. If you like Bethesda games, you\u0027ll like this. If you\u0027re interested in space, you should like this. It builds upon systems that Bethesda has been using for a while - base building, companions, factions, stealth, clutter, etc. Now they\u0027re attempting to add depth via exploring the cosmos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExploration is largely... well, Bethesdaeqsue.\u00A0 A handful of activities dot the area. You should see a couple from your vantage point, and you\u0027re encouraged through intrigue to go to the places you see. Of course with moon and planet sized locales, they have to rely heavily on procedural generation. You\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Esee the same abandoned mine, farm, settlement, what have you, as you jump from place to place. If the potential for repetition turns you off, you might as well not even bother. But always bear in mind that just because it\u0027s out there, doesn\u0027t mean you have to go to it. I\u0027ve landed in many a location just to turn back around and get on my ship because I didn\u0027t feel like visiting any of the nearby points of interest, or it was just far enough of a trek to make it a task.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that got the internet in a tizzy was invisible walls on the planets. At first I was straying into that camp, however when you get hands on with it, it\u0027s not a big deal. The instance size they generate is quite large - double digit KM^2. Distance between POIs can be from 300m to 1200m, potentially even greater. Do folks really want to traipse across an entire planetary body on foot? I\u0027m not sure they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a similar note people were up in arms about the transition from space to planet not being seamless. I was slightly disappointed about that, however we all know that Bethesda\u0027s game engine isn\u0027t built for such a task. Now, when they said that you can land anywhere on the planet, they\u0027re actually almost right. Due to the size of each body being rather large I haven\u0027t had the motivation to attempt this, but you could theoretically land just about everywhere on the planet. The only limit seems to be how many instances the game is able to track - and given how many there can be (ship interiors, caves, buildings, you name it), this is really impressive. I\u0027ve chased ships from surface to orbit, boarded the ship, then went back down to the surface into the same instance state (sans enemy ship).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace combat is wildly difficult at the start. If you\u0027re outnumbered, which oftentimes you are, pray you had a recent save point.\u00A0 The default ship is woefully inadequate and you should expect to be chewed to bits and limping along IF you survive. And that\u0027s a big if, because there were times where I couldn\u0027t even drain the shields on a comparable strength ship before exploding. If you plan to do any fighting in space (it\u0027s unavoidable) save up your credits for weapons with higher range and better damage. After I got those upgrades then I was able to at least survive. Of course with as much time in as I have, I was able to put together a ship that\u0027s a big bully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShip Building is lego style, not that dissimilar to KSP. Thankfully no things like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, staging to worry about. You do need to keep an eye on mass and maneuverability, weapon power, overall ship power, cargo capacity, fuel capacity... Ok it\u0027s kind of a lot at the start, but they have a tool that checks to make sure your ship fits what the game will allow. It\u0027s an expensive venture, my first ship costing me every bit of my 160k credits at the time, but satisfying. Understanding how the modules fit together and will look once inside is is a different beast entirely. My first few attempts, and even now, the game constructed a convoluted maze to navigate through to get from the entrance to the cockpit. Fortunately reconfiguring is free so I\u0027ll be playing with the layout a ton more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGun play is pretty solid although I wish there were ways to peek around corners or properly utilize cover. I\u0027ve often taken damage behind what I thought was solid cover. As you might expect, stealth is the easiest way to play, but you can easily overpower the enemy as if you were playing as the commandos in General Chaos (throw back for those a certain age).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MIh4pwAjPYg?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Mega Drive Longplay [172] General Chaos\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrafting is... a chore. Sometimes complex recipes coupled with the ever present carry weight means, at least for me, crafting goes undone. This can be extended to base building. Building some of the modules is annoyingly difficult in terms of materials. It\u0027s a hard mechanic to want to engage in. I hoped to be able to extract resources and sell them, but they don\u0027t seem to fetch a high price, so I\u0027m confused. But at least base building appears to be entirely optional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pleased with what Starfield is and attempts to be. It\u0027s certainly a game I\u0027ll get a couple hundred hours out of without noticing. It doesn\u0027t change the Bethesda formula, but doubles down on it, for better or for worse. It will be interesting to see how the game evolves from here on out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-10T14:03:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224320592\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219071\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221694200763\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201293\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeadJohn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/8/2023 at 3:19 PM, DeadJohn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s probably a typo, but if exact would certainly add to the challenge of flight\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a typo.\u00A0 Don\u0027t forget, this is essentially a console game ported to the pc.\u00A0 The controls were not well ported.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor flight, I switched to using an XBox-1 Gamepad (made for pc), and it became a whole lot easier\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-10T16:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224321117\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219071\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221694354604\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a typo.\u00A0 Don\u0027t forget, this is essentially a console game ported to the pc.\u00A0 The controls were not well ported.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the horror of modern gaming.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know there is more money in Console, but if developers would just craft a good game for PC from the start, I would think it easier to dumb down to console than to try and port Console compromises to PC.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-12T16:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224321117\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219071\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221694354604\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/10/2023 at 10:03 AM, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a typo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour original post has the D-key doing 2 things as the same time.
