After re-entering the atmosphere, i tried to pull up, but the wings were torn off like paper. I was left with only the cockpit section, seconds from impact. I was ready to hit the revert flight button (Im not playing legit, just messing around), and the ship hit the water at 3kms. It managed to dive quite a depth underwater before resurfacing. I am assuming it was FAR that caused this, but i am surprised the ship didn\u0027t simply melt on contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not manage to get a picture of the wings breaking, but i managed to snap a quick pic of it underwater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://screenshu.com/static/uploads/temporary/pu/p9/gz/j696us.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022j696us.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://screenshu.com/static/uploads/temporary/2n/8g/a6/9lkidl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229lkidl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the full ship, Miyafuji 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://screenshu.com/static/uploads/temporary/96/uq/r8/wf5wn9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wf5wn9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything surprising happened to anyone else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"benjiful9000","CreatedById":38135,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T13:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[closed]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-04T19:11:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2021 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by benjiful9000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cesrate","CreatedById":57343,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T13:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, that\u0027s the error of physics calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T13:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022benjiful9000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022benjiful9000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s weird, but I have had similar things happen to me.

The old Bigtrak rover and its Cuttlefish lander for example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI screwed up the setup on the Cuttlefish, or staging it, or something, and lost the engine. So I bailed the rover out and went down with just the rover, just for fun. I bounced, skidded, tumbled, and rolled my way to a stop on the Munar surface, having lost most of the parts attached to the outside of the rover. I went on to deliberately crashing the still-closed lander into the surface in a power dive. Did the same thing on Kerbin right off the launch pad. Tried crashing it into the water. Literally nothing would destroy those bigtrak parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERan into this more recently with the super-large \u0027caterpillar tracks\u0027 module on a design one of my friends was having trouble with. I got it off the ground, but it didn\u0027t have enough lift OR thrust to fly, so it ended up in the water. Everything died EXCEPT the track module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry crashing that same plane into the ground, I\u0027ll bet the same bit of it survives.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-30T13:27:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2013 01:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T13:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis happened to me before, too, when I was messing around with dragless parts and hit the ocean at quite a speed.
