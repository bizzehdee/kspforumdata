Hmmm, this is not to dangerous, but then how did the universe get to this expansionary state. CMB, yeah but before that there was the opaque phase were energy became matter\u0026amp;anti and then photons and matter and so on until things spread out to the degree that matter could survive. This would have been to us a very violent phase. Prior to this the universe expanded at a temperature so hot, the temperature was immeasurable by any known method, because all known methods require matter. SO the acceleration takes place in inflationary phase which is too hot for any life, and then expands at a slower rate where matter is unstable and photons push out the boundaries of space and then everything cools down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about other good natural accelarations. We have acceleration into blackholes, black holes can make things change direction and move really fast. Not to shabby until the X-ray burst and gravitational gradiants tear everything apart.

So the warp drive can still operate. There will be \u0022side effects\u0022. Unless you want to be wasting huge amounts of energy to compensate, energy and momentum are going to be conserved throughout the warp. Which means that if you want to head out from Earth to, say, Mars, you will need to put yourself on a trajectory that can actually reach Mars\u0027 orbit before you engage warp. The trajectory itself will also be curved by gravity. This isn\u0027t exactly a requirement, but \u0022accelerating\u0022 warp bubble tends to interact with interstellar medium in a way that will also cause huge energy losses.

In fact, quantum theory predicts that it teems with virtual particles flitting in and out of existence. Although initially a curiosity, it was quickly realized that these vacuum fluctuations had measurable consequences--for instance, producing the Lamb shift of atomic spectra and modifying the magnetic moment of the electron. This type of renormalization due to vacuum fluctuations is now central to our understanding of nature. However, these effects provide indirect evidence for the existence of vacuum fluctuations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom early on, it was discussed whether it might be possible to more directly observe the virtual particles that compose the quantum vacuum. Forty years ago, it was suggested that a mirror undergoing relativistic motion could convert virtual photons into directly observable real photons. The phenomenon, later termed the dynamical Casimir effect, has not been demonstrated previously. Here we observe the dynamical Casimir effect in a superconducting circuit consisting of a coplanar transmission line with a tunable electrical length. The rate of change of the electrical length can be made very fast (a substantial fraction of the speed of light) by modulating the inductance of a superconducting quantum interference device at high frequencies (\u0026gt;10 gigahertz). In addition to observing the creation of real photons, we detect two-mode squeezing in the emitted radiation, which is a signature of the quantum character of the generation process.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, admittedly Nature does not have the best reputation for field specific referee process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhys Rev Lett. 2012 Mar 2;108(9):093603.Photon production from the vacuum close to the superradiant transition: linking the dynamical Casimir effect to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Vacanti G1, Pugnetti S, Didier N, Paternostro M, Palma GM, Fazio R, Vedral V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) predicts the generation of photons from the vacuum due to the parametric amplification of the quantum fluctuations of an electromagnetic field. The verification of such an effect is still elusive in optical systems due to the very demanding requirements of its experimental implementation. We show that an ensemble of two-level atoms collectively coupled to the electromagnetic field of a cavity, driven at low frequencies and close to a quantum phase transition, stimulates the production of photons from the vacuum. This paves the way to an effective simulation of the DCE through a mechanism that has recently found experimental demonstration. The spectral properties of the emitted radiation reflect the critical nature of the system and allow us to link the detection of the DCE to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for the production of defects when crossing a continuous phase transition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA key point is to prove the predictions, however it is my prediction that not all the predictions about energy in vacuum space has been made, there are other orators on physics with well known names that have posited questions about the fields that permeate evacuated space and Im old enough to sit back and hear their point of view. It is plausible that they may have teased something in a way that gets useful. The deficit in the argument in the paper above is that photons have no mass, but photons teased out of the vacuum produce virtual electrons and positrons and they have mass. Again I am not arguing that I know the answer or that I am even going to do the math (cause Im not) but I am saying that there is still breathing room in quantum mechanics. The point I was making about this Cannae drive is by theory pure vacuum fluctuations that would be exploitable would be so rare, that this drive should not scale up without scalar size increases. If they placed the drive in space, it should deplete all potential local reaction mass rapidly and all that is left is virtual mass to push off of and given the above papers conclusions this mass is going to be of the smallest magnitude. With a photon drive I can dump photons at liberty, creating a degree of thrust, this cannae drive should reach a limit for a given area of space and plateau. I could be wrong, his resonator may be able to both tease VP out and impart momentum . . . . . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut unlike magic reactionless drives\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint of debate I want to make clear here.

OK so lets apply the same stringency. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E, we understand the physics of warp. We can talk about what WOULD happen if we were able to satisfy the conditions. Even if it forever remains theoretical. Just like we can talk about what WOULD happen if Sun were to go Nova, or what WOULD happen if Earth got knocked out of its orbit, even if we have absolutely zero chance of making it happen.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne mans golden pond is another mans latrine. If the Sun were to go Nova earths orbital stats would be the least of its problems, we do know alot about Nova and some of the sequence, we do not know enough to proclaim the fate of inner planets left to orbit their star. The velocity of some Nova particles is so great that one could imagine the mantle layers undergoing a disintregative explosion into space as much of the lighter metal vaporized. Even before that sequence occurs earths orbit will degrade as the Sun expands into the inner planets, so Earth itself might be part of the implausible solar Nova. The problem with certain sciences were data is collected by examining one event after another is that they provide statistics, but if we look closely at the statistics the often lack critical details like confidence limits, the confidence limits and more important, the scrutiny of how they are determined are actually of greater importance than the discrete observation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Lest dive into the physics of warp a little bit just to see how much we actually know. The field width they are proclaiming is 10E-32 meters, 3 magnitude above the lower limit of comptom wavelength (extreme gamma), essentially its a length of ~1000 \u0027space pixels\u0027 across. It is thinner than the 50% confidence zone of a 4s electron orbital within a Xenon atom cooled to 0.1\u0027K. It is 12 magnitudes smaller than a measurable distance with the roughest precision. So to say we know how to create a warp when we can\u0027t even measure the required thickness is a slop of an argument. Yeah, Yeah, this if for warp 10, but what they are trying to define is a sphere of Euclidean geometry which has a minimum to protect the payload from warped space-time. Even for lower warp those fields appear to be far more confined than can be actually measured. I do remember a few long nights spent in front of a JOEL 100KV electron microscope focusing the beam to get magnifications or 30,000X don\u0027t remember ever being able to focus that beam to get 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000X. Maybe I know people who are working to get EM resolutions to 2.5 A on the EM don\u0027t know anyone who actually has the foggiest idea how to get 0.1A resolution, and that additional 21 magnitudes of 10 is off the horizon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The argument itself is easily a flim-flam handwaving argument. To generate the field a ship has to travel in advance and lay down a field of negative energy in front, but the ship itself has itself be moving at warp speed to create the field or the field could be laid out across space like a railroad track, but the track itself would have to have a near infinite energy density in order to keep a stable field. Still theoretically possible, yes.........no. But that\u0027s not the end of this theoretical pursuit. The types of particles discussed, Tachyons and Negative energy come strait out of sci-fi. Occam\u0027s razor should apply to this logic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Negative energy should exist because the Universe inflated. Well lets go through the very argument logically. The Universe may or may not have inflated. Inflation is the favored theory but multiverse can explain CMB without having to resort to inflation. The cosmic inflation theory holds that during the early Plank epoch that space-time had not resolved (space-time has now resolved), and that the Universe operated purely on Quantum physics (Relativistic and classic physics can be applied to most things now). At some point the universe was approximately infinite energy spread across one dimension (a point). Quantum mechanics suggest that the whereever that point was the pre-universe was also, and if it moved it statistically was all those points at once all the time. For whatever reason this state ceased and universe cooled. The bottom line is that the universe did not _need_ negative energy to inflate, it simply needed instability within the acting physics. This is a period of unification, the physics could allow many things or very restricted but unique physics. We get into bad logic when we begin to speculate excessively about what happened before CMB and negative energy as an explanation for inflation is just one such form of speculation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Tachyons might be used to generate the field. This is one of the most absurd arguments I have seen, tachyons, a theoretical field that only travels at the speed of light and whose lowest energy state is at infinite speed can be set out to create a field in front of a ship. This is one of the reasons that quantum mechanics has some wiggle room, because relativistic physics still allow form many things, but some of the these things don\u0027t exist, at least in any form which we can detect or utilize. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. That a field needs to be created in advance of the ship entering and the ship just catches a ride. This is an equally absurd argument and it really nails FTL, if the ship is not free to make the field and it therefore has to cross into the field, the field is a bubble (1/2 sphere is negative energy and 1/2 sphere being positive). The logic here is in order for the ship to move faster than light a third party needs to coordinate the movement of the bubble since the third party can\u0027t move faster than that speed it would need to be in front of the bubble signalling when each point along the path of travel became positively and negatively energized. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. Therefore the ship either has to cross the space-time warp at the back of the bubble or at the front, given the bubble is traveling the speed of light it cannot cross into the bubble, the whole reason for crossing the bubble is to gain warp, if it is already traveling at light speed then it does not need the bubble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. crossing the warp would not be an enjoyable experience since it represents the same types of forces encountered at the event horizon of bh. That is the whole reason for creating flat space with a thin warp shell, the thin shell is to avoid the forces of the warp on the ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. Once it crosses the bubble it has momentum in Euclidean space time it needs to immediately dissipate. So either it passes into a non-moving bubble slowly and stops in the bubble, or crosses a fast moving bubble and its momentum carries it out the other side. But the bubble\u0027s surface differentials are what make it move, which means for the ship to cross into a non-moving bubble, the bubble should not exist or be minimal. Once in the bubble the ship would have to signal the coordinator (at light speed) and the coordinator would then get the bubble moving. The alternative is the bubble is initiated from a point in space at a given time and progresses, the ship goes to that point and stops and waits, some other vessel at its target (say the next star) initiates the bubble and the ship moves. But the forces applied across these distances and at these resolutions are impossible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed. Therefore, the bubble velocity and ships velocity need to be the same and thus the initiation of the bubbles light speed motion cannot be accomplished, the ship \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; C and if FLT requires the warp field to be applied well before the trip begins then and traveling at C or more then:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee. FTL using warp field is theoretically impossible for interstellar travel it may be impossible for warping short distances. What makes it theoretically impossible is a ship incapable of reaching light speed and accelerating to such speeds instantly cannot insert itself into a moving bubble and expect to stop once it get there. There is no way to precisely coordinate the creation and progression of bubble across interstellar distances. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. For subluminal speed, it is probably still impossible, by stringent physics you use above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. Prove that negative energy exists and can be harnassed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. Show that positive energy space-time warps can be generated to any sufficient degree without also creating destructive gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. Show that such a field 1 Angstrom thick can move without also moving the mass energy equivilant that also created the field\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed. Since this questions requires proof of a, the question will be rephrased to accepts negative energies absence by doupling the positive energy requirement. Prove that any positive energy warp field capable of _moving_ any payload with 2X warp energy will not require more energy to create the field and move it than than the dV of the ship required to reach the same speed, travel and stop at its destination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T06:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs we think of objects (houses, cars, boats) need not apply.

Planets in the central part of the goldilocks would experience episodic xray emmissions a couple of magnitudes greater than the earths outer atmosphere.

There are claims that such strong episodic radiation would strip the planet of any atmosphere, it would be like a dim version of mercury. That is the bad news, it will be a main sequence star for the next 400 trillion years and getting out of the proxima system is alot easier than the solar system.

Indeed, understanding the physics of warp may very well tell you that a warp engine is impossible in practice, for all the reasons you mention.

It may be possible to create a field in some space laboratory and move something in that field a few microns per second. That is not what the proponents were arguing, they were talking about inserting objects in spherical bilaterally opposed energy fields travelling through space at greater than the speed of light where some of the essential components needs to maintain that field had not been discovered.

My opinion is that we don\u0027t, we may know alot about physics in the context of the observable universe, but the nature of the Universe argues that is not enough to complete our understanding. I have not brought string theory or highly exotic matter or any red herring into the arguement, I am simplly claiming that there is space to dot i\u0027s and cross t\u0027s and areas of discovery, however, minor that might shed light on the reaction-less drives function.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T13:34:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 01:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T13:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe deficit in the argument in the paper above is that photons have no mass, but photons teased out of the vacuum produce virtual electrons and positrons and they have mass.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is totally irrelevant.

As you point out why not other particles, however I was reluctant to go that far because these exotic virtuals may be so uncommon within a vacuum as not to be useful. So basically we are talking around each other, your thinking of virtuals is that they only are useful in explaining field transfers, like the binding of an electron to a proton. Whereas other people are describing VP that exist in space. Of course there is no space completely devoid of persistent ripples in the field like photons. So the argument is made complex.

I agree that there has to be some symmetry, the problem is not that its how. I am speculating that the assymetry created is tucked into vacuum space and handed of by other virtuals that appear later. In the Feyman diagrams the photon produced by the electron is a function of the electrons properties, so why not be the same, the VP appears and disappears, occasionally appears and hands back its momentum to another Fermion and then disappears. This is my basic contention, if this is a result of assymetries that are create in vacuum fields then they may cause feed back causing the apparatus to decrease thrust and eventually that energy may end up back in the devise itself as waste heat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the absolute minimum of energy you need to generate propulsion.

It means that for a period the momentum might have vanished. What I am proposing is that momentum is transferred by VP through the vacuum only to be dumped of an unsuspecting mass on the other side of the force detector. There is reaction mass, but that mass ends up not being on the ship. So if there is no mass to dump on what happens? Let me make an analogy - in a inflationary universe there was very high density of energy but there was no mass, you cant measure gravity and but with infinite energy binding the universe together it should have been incredibly massive. The paradox is that as the universe cooled universe lost energy and therefore potential mass but gravity becomes more apparent because there is more mass around. Gravity was one of the first of the forces to appear, but what inertial body can attest to the attraction. The highest gravities in the universe paradoxically are apparent after it has cooled and mass has coalesced into black holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain we need to see the devices performance with no possible mass to push off of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to break it down to every single point, because I can stop it on the very first one.

And so on, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor every single one of these sentences, there are precise mathematical formulae.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you are proposing handing these off to virtuals? Handing what exactly? The mathematical group? Or the formulae? Do you want to write down these equations on the paper and pass them off to virtual particles as notes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour first order of business needs to be to stop using words you do not understand. Second, if you want to actually understand how something works, which is a prerequisite for discussing it, you need to learn formulae that go into it. You then need to learn to structure your sentences to reflect the mathematical relationships between concepts you are describing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if I was going to tell you that for small amplitude, the period of oscillation of a pendulum depends only on gravity and length of the arm, what I am really saying is that given a mass m suspended by an arm of the length L, making a displacement angle x with the vertical, the equation of motion for the pendulum is mx\u0027\u0027 = -mg/L sin(x), which can be approximated for x\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1 as x\u0027\u0027 = -x g/L, which has a period of 2 pi sqrt(L/g). There is a precise formula that goes with the statement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to talk about any scientific principle, you have to communicate in just as precise a fashion. Because if you do not, you are just making stuff up and make yourself look bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI get why they require negative energy\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, you do not. You have more words to go with it that have zero meaning. To get this, you need to be able to compute it. Can you compute energy density associated with Alcubierre Metric?
