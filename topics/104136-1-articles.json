I know because earlier versions didn\u0027t have an airbrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I thought of myself is that maybe at a high AoA the CoL changes because the lifting body effect becomes stronger relative to wing lift.

What I mean is that maybe at 40 degrees angle wings don\u0027t produce much lift and most of what\u0027s affecting the plane is drag.

As your AoA increases, the percent of lift you get from your body compared to the your wings will increase, thus shifting CoP forward. This is why, for example, the SR-71 could not exceed something like 8 degrees AoA or it would become unstable (\u0022flip out\u0022 in KSPeze).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, especially because SR-71 has a long sharp edged body, which should create lift, compared to relative short wings at the back. It\u0027s the same vortex lift mechanism for the body. If I remember correctly they were very surprised during flight simulations that critical AoA is 14 subsonic and 8 degrees while in supersonic flight. But the transition between stable and unstable vortex lift isn\u0027t at a fix AoA. Eg. maneuvers like rolling can create non symmetric lift, which causes yaw torque at the body. But that doesn\u0027t mean, that the vortexes breakdown completly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said above the shape of the leading edge has a great influence to vortexes.
