One is crewtank for extra crew on the space shuttle.Another good mod is the Probodobodyne construction kit for solar panels and other things. Usually you need to launch it from the ground with tons of boosters and engines to get into orbit.Or you can use orbital construction to launch it from another orbiting spaceship,but you need to launch supplies up to build the space station so I can\u0027t recommend it. I don\u0027t have any advice on building it,but good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cby","CreatedById":26505,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T06:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Favourite is Kosmos spacecraft design Bureau.

The whole point of that mod is to launch several flights to bring the materials for assembly in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way is to build the station in the VAB or SPH, put it on the launch pad or runway, then edit the persistent.sfs file to swap its location with a different ship already in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
