I use extra-planetary launchpads and a plethora of other mods. At what point do you think I should allow myself to spawn in a kerbal konstructs\u00A0launch site? I was origionally thinking after I surpass 200 on-world residents. But I figure I need more requirements as that seems a little too easy. I need more input.
