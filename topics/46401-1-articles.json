They should be close enough so you can see the approach markers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen adjust your inclination to match the target\u0027s orbit inclination.

At their closes approach, enter live view and turn on the chase mode, click above the navball to set speed indicator to \u0022Target\u0022. Burn retrograde until that number is close to zero. Turn towards the target and burn to start approaching. Don\u0027t do more than 20 m/s, it\u0027s not necessary and you can overshoot your target. Periodically check the map mode to see what happens. The approcach markers should show, on pointer hover, decreasing distance. Stop burning at the indicated minimum approach distance.
