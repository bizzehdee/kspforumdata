The game play is a lot different early on, but once you get parts unlocked that\u0027ll let you do longer / more intricate missions, it\u0027s similar to sandbox. Except you can still create missions for yourself for science - in career you actually get the science and that\u0027s the reward, but in sandbox it\u0027s finishing the mission that\u0027s the reward.
