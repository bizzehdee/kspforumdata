(one of my friends views the game that way) It creates new interests for people who actually get involved with the game. My thoughts are so complex nowadays, about life, relativity (and I finally think I see it making sense now), the laws of physics, orbital mechanics, logic, how things can even be alive - you get the idea. Most people just take life for granted (that\u0027s changed for me now - life is really special and I am grateful to be living in this world). Orbital mechanics, for example - I never knew there were so many complex maneuvers, speed varying according how close you are to the planet. I thought space was orbit. It\u0027s not just orbital mechanics though. I feel as though I\u0027m really well rounded now, coming up with my own theories for everything. My brain is crazy now, I feel so special. But I\u0027m not alone. It\u0027s great to see that so many other people have been blessed by KSP as well. So many things have changed for me. I\u0027ve had some personal issues that I don\u0027t feel comfortable sharing yet, but KSP was helping me through a bit, even though I seldom got to play it. I have a huge passion for space and just science now, thanks to KSP. I follow everything in the space world. My friends always laugh when I say it, but KSP really did change my life. It\u0027s their loss for living dull lives where they\u0027re not really wanting to know and explore life and the universe. KerbalEdu is a great idea and hopefully it spreads the cause of KSP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding on to what Mulbin said, there\u0027s an obvious effect that results from playing KSP, if you play it passionately. You learn about space history and the various programs that people and countries have carried out. For example. before playing KSP, I never knew there was a whole Apollo mission plan with lunar orbit rendezvous, or a command module. I just remember the lunar module and never could quite figure out how they stored all that within the Saturn V. I always remembered the Space Shuttle as a kid and thought it was cool, but never really dove into the realms of space science. Now, I think I may want to pursue an interest in space for a career, but those are just dreams right now, there\u0027s still a long way to go before that happens. I really do question a lot about how the universe (or multiverse or cosmos, if that works for you) works, and I have to give Squad a big thanks for developing KSP. My family really likes KSP and thinks it helps me, too. Thanks a billion, Squad. And I mean that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-24T00:19:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2013 12:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Woopert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m1xte","CreatedById":53528,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T11:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI decided to take it for real and started to build RC airplane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T13:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I first just wanted a major in Astrophysics, when that time comes.
