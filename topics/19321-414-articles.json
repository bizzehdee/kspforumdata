In space, the problem is that there\u0027s not enough air to create a sound in to begin with. However, if you have say, some unreasonably large cymbals, and crash them together in very low orbit (definitely under 200km), they may still be able to make an audible sound, and that sound will still propagate at a similar speed to sound at the surface. Only similar, however, as it may actually travel faster, since the uppermost reaches of atmosphere can be hotter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: reconsidering, there\u0027s probably no orbital altitude where even unreasonably large cymbals could create audible noise, and the velocity of orbit would interfere. But say you were on a floating platform at 50 km or more - pressure is getting remarkably close to vacuum levels. Here, such cymbals may be able to make some audible noise - but it would only barely be audible. However, as suggested before, that sound would travel just as fast - by the graphs provided before, around 330 m/s at 50 km, versus 343 m/s at sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your other question, I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re trying to ask, honestly. A plane in a dive will experience a \u0022forward\u0022 force component from gravity as its flight path is tilted, and at any significant tilt, this will always cause acceleration. It\u0027s only possible to keep speed under control in a descent by taking it very gently - for modern airliners in a clean configuration, this can easily mean descending at less than a two degree angle, to keep the aircraft at a constant speed, because the airframe is so efficient that it requires that little forward pull from gravity to go forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T19:53:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Iskierka\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitspace","CreatedById":109786,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T21:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am talking about a situation where the indicated airspeed increases but not quickly enough and the true airspeed decreases because of the descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI heard that such a situation can help pull subsonic planes out of a mach tuck dive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second question here is that does such a dive situation count as aircraft acceleration or deceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we look at the indicated airspeed we see it increase rapidly and think that the aircraft has not reached its current terminal velocity because the air drag increases but the aircraft still accelerates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if we look at the true airspeed we see it decrease with altitude and think that terminal velocity is reached and the aircraft decelerates as the terminal velocity itself decreases with altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the aircraft actually reach terminal velocity and if yes then why the opposite statement is false and vice versa?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iskierka","CreatedById":2116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor IAS to increase as TAS decreases takes a very specific, very shallow (and notably, not dangerous) dive. Additionally, the dangerous mach tuck dives are caused when mach tuck reduces control authority on elevators to the extent that the aircraft cannot remain level - not only do you lose control and thus would be unable to pull into a safe dive, but you would likely over-stress and destroy the airframe in the process, so such a dive is something you\u0027d just avoid altogether by providing sufficient control authority. If your aircraft did survive, it most likely stalled, then being at very high alpha it\u0027ll have very high drag, so it\u0027ll slow down by itself, regain authority, and you\u0027ll just perform regular stall recovery manoeuvres, totally unrelated to attaining a specific dive rate that causes IAS and TAS to trade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd such a shallow dive would most definitely be deceleration - by all external measures, the aircraft is losing speed. IAS is not a measure of actual speed, only an equivalence for getting reference aerodynamic performance, as things like the maximum L/D point remain almost unchanged IAS across all altitudes.

I saw in a video from Scott Manley (though it was several versions ago) where a simple rocket without a nose cone would outperform a rocket with one. I decided to do my own testing now that 1.0.4 is out and have confirmed that nose cones and fairings do have aerodynamic benefits. While the rocket without a nose cone (or faring) will initially outperform the one without, the one with the nose cone will eventually overtake the one without since it has better aerodynamics. I don\u0027t know if that was the case in other 1.x releases. It seems like this test pretty much nullifies the first statement about FAR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShape-Based, Vessel-Centered, Aerodynamics\u003C/strong\u003E - Long, thin shapes drag less than wide, flat shapes, and smooth changes in body width reduce drag.

Current stock aero basically calculates the drag for each part based on attitude and stack occlusion and sums them; it ignores part clipping and has no stall effects or area ruling.
