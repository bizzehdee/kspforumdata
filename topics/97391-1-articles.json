Any mod that will display your time to apoapsis (KER, MechJeb) will help, because your velocity vector is horizontal at that point. You can even use the map screen to do this, it displays such time.

Are you playing with some aerodynamics mod that will tear apart your rocket if you point too far away from prograde?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike pincushionman, the best indicator I can think of is the time-to-apoapsis, modified by some experience. TTA can be seen in map view, and eccentricity too, so you\u0027re all set. You may want to start flying by TTA: during your next ascent, as soon as time-to-apoapsis reaches one minute, you start pitching downward to keep it at one minute. Once you\u0027re pointed at orbital prograde, you leave it there (skilled pilots can do that for you, or Smart A.S.S.) and reduce throttle to keep it at one minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little more advanced: in the end, your orbital velocity should be ~2200m/s. Take the difference between that and your current velocity, then divide by your acceleration (a simple calculation that can be done while flying). If TTA is so far in the future that your vessel can reach orbital speeds until then, you\u0027re safe. Actually, TTA may be less because as long as you\u0027re under power, you\u0027re constantly moving it forward. How much less, I can\u0027t tell. I guess it should be possible to calculate this (that would be the precise number you\u0027re asking for), but as for myself, it\u0027s a gutsy-feely thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flashcactus","CreatedById":103335,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T15:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, as was said before, a good guideline would be to monitor your time to apoapsis (with or without mods, doesn\u0027t really matter). The general idea being that if it decreases at some rate, then compare the burn time you have left and the time until it reaches zero. Note that this is a very rough guess, as it will start going up as you increase your orbital velocity and/or TWR (both of which will happen). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere probably is no mod that would actually integrate this for you, showing where you\u0027ll end up if you continue with the current setting and/or if you throttle up to full \u003Cem\u003Eright now\u003C/em\u003E. It should actually be pretty easy to write a script for a mod like Kerbulator or kOS that does it if one knows how to calculate this. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t know anyone who does :-/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to sum it up, your best bet would be either eyeballing it or figuring the correct profile out by trial-and-error (which is pretty much what I tend to do).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T15:40:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe general idea is to hold your Time to Apoapsis at a decided value. This all would be in the later part of the ascent (after you leave the soup-o-sphere) so it wouldn\u0027t differ too much between Stock and FAR... in theory, but I only use FAR so I have no pratical test of this. Works beautifully in FAR though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually aim for 1 minute to Ap. If you start getting closer to the Ap your going to fall back once you reach it and if your Ap isn\u0027t as high as you need it, that is bad. Likewise, if you get too far away, you burning too much fuel and you will end up with a sharper arc and a longer circularization burn. So you adjust your throttle to maintain 1 min to Ap while burning just ever so slightly above the artificial horizon. By the time you reach 80km Ap, you should have at least a positive Pe if you timed it right, unfortunately there is no exact science to this*, you just have to practice it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour circularization burn should only be around 5 seconds. In a nutshell, you use the same fuel to raise both your Ap and Pe, rather than using fuel to raise your Ap then more fuel to raise your Pe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*EDIT: In KSP, I\u0027m sure NASA has some exact science for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-22T15:53:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2015 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
