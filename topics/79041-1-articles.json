Starting a fresh space program with a fully equipped space center is a little odd from a gaming perspective. Though what buildings would get upgrades and what would those upgrades do for those buildings, I wonder...moreover, which buildings \u003Cem\u003Ewouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be there at the start and need to be built? The observatory, I guess, would be the most obvious building that would need to be built initially to find farther out planets and moons...upgrading it would allow you to see the very smallest or farthest out celestial bodies...but then, I\u0027ve always kind of hoped for orbital telescopes to become a thing as well. Hmm...maybe that\u0027s how you upgrade your observatory, by sending out an orbital telescope to orbit \u0027round kerbin...then the final upgrade would be a telescope orbiting kerbol, the sun @.,@\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, but other than that, I feel like now\u0027s the prime time for an overhaul to the aerodynamics and spaceplane parts...since SSTOs are rather important with the funding thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T20:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to be a killjoy, but there are already a few threads like this. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85560-What-do-you-want-to-see-in-0-25?highlight=0.25\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExample\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
