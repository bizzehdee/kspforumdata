I\u0026#39;m getting back into it and decided to include KSPI and KSPI-E into my mods. Unfortunately I decided to do this right as version 1.05 came out. KSPI-E is difficult enough to learn on it\u0026#39;s own, but even with the 14 November fix I\u0026#39;m still having some issues. I\u0026#39;ll try to list the major ones here and hopefully someone can address them in a helpful way. I hope I\u0026#39;m not the only one having these issues...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-No matter how many, or what size, radiators I put on my reactors my waste heat builds up to critical levels after only a few orbits. I\u0026#39;m still only using the first generation fission reactors, but even when I have 4 or more huge radiators on my satellite the waste heat ramps up fast. I\u0026#39;ve tried mounting the radiators to the reactors, and the generators. The radiators do respond to waste heat, they start glowing, and they change their rate of heat dispersion as they get hotter, but they never reach a point where they get rid of heat faster than it accumulates. I\u0026#39;ve tried this with pretty much all of the fission reactors and generators with similar results, though different rates of waste heat generation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Some reactors and generators just won\u0026#39;t mount to parts. Only one side will mount to anything, will the other side won\u0026#39;t mount. This makes it impossible to build a rocket (or nearly so).\u003Cbr\u003E\n-I see in many tutorials that while in the assembly building people use a tool to evaluate if they will be able to dissipate waste heat effectively or not. I do not see this at all. Am I just clueless as to where it is, or is this feature gone now? All of these tutorials were using the alpha and beta games.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-My game crashes every time I try to revert a flight, or go back to the space center. 9/10 times this won\u0026#39;t lose data, but sometimes whatever flight I was conducting is just gone with a loss of all the resources I used to create it. This only started happening after I loaded the 14 November fixed KSPI-E. Is this happening to anyone else.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-My KSPI parts are showing up as duplicated in the assembly building. There\u0026#39;s always the part I researched and bought in the research tree, and an identical one that is shown as available, but needs to be purchased for 0 money. If I do purchase it it looks like an exact duplicate of the part I already have, and then shows up again later as being unpurchased. I\u0026#39;ve been ignoring these parts, but they are certainly symptomatic of something going wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTonight I think I\u0026#39;m going to wipe all of the KSP files from my computer and reinstall everything from scratch to see if this fixes most of these issues. I had KSPI loaded up and then overwrote those files with the KSPI-E ones. Should I not bother doing that? Is it not necessary and causing some of these issues? My other big mod is Station Science. I have a maybe one other small mod still loaded that I\u0026#39;m not sure I even use (can\u0026#39;t remember which one it is right now). Does KSPI-E have known mod compatibility issues?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, this is just me not knowing how to really use KSPI-E yet, when you shut down a reactor how do you turn it back on? Does this require a kerbil EVA?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T15:59:28Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027soupmeister\u0027][COLOR=#4D5763][FONT=verdana]I\u0026#39;m having issues with getting a reactor to run at full capacity and / or getting my generator efficiency up.

As you can see from the screenshot, I am using a dusty plasma to generate particles and electric to power the nozzle. I believe the reactor isn\u0026#39;t running at 100% because the magnetic nozzle is only requesting 256MW CP, though I\u0026#39;m not sure why the magnetic nozzle is capped at that.

Why does nothing add up?!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I\u0026#39;m getting to play with (and get a headache with) a whole new set of toys. I got the magnetic nozzles and am trying to make them work. Now, I understand that they are intended to be a very low-thrust solution, especially at this tech level, but once again I\u0026#39;m having issues getting my generator to work properly. As you can see from the screenshot, I am using a dusty plasma to generate particles and electric to power the nozzle. I believe the reactor isn\u0026#39;t running at 100% because the magnetic nozzle is only requesting 256MW CP, though I\u0026#39;m not sure why the magnetic nozzle is capped at that. Any hints there would be welcome. I see that the Dusty Plasma has 45% efficiency when used with magnetic nozzles, but 256 is not 45% of any of the numbers that I see, nor are any other values!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven more puzzling is that my generator thinks that 31% of 657 MW is 12 MW. The GUI shows that 40 MW is being requested, so it\u0026#39;s not being limited by demand. Also, I\u0026#39;m not sure where that 40 MW number is coming from. Regarding magnetic nozzles, the table in the OP of this thread states that the magnetic nozzle needs 1% of its charged particle energy in electrical, so the (seemingly arbitrary) 256 MW CP should mean that it requires just 2.5MW in electrical charge. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL]http://i.imgur.com/Y43NnDz.jpg[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain I\u0026#39;ve spent a good few hours going around and around trying to figure this stuff out. When I\u0026#39;ve got it all figured out I\u0026#39;m going to make some Youtube tutorials and / or bang some time into the Wiki so others don\u0026#39;t have to go through this! Thanks again everyone, you\u0026#39;re awesome.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am unsure but I think part of the reason you are having odd numbers is possibly your magnetic nozzle and reactor are different sizes.... I know it does not make a ton of sense, but I think that can affect your performance. I have to be honest though that I have never built this combo.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: after a quick test I am fairly certain it was a size missmatch as my build works great\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url=http://postimg.org/image/pw1d468xt/full/][img]http://s8.postimg.org/61fbi1tqd/image.png[/img][/url]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T08:28:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 08:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Profit-\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gary85","CreatedById":131308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T13:22:59Z","Content":"\nCan thermal turbojet run on sth different than liquid fuel?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HerrGeneral","CreatedById":63453,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T18:25:00Z","Content":"\nMan the Advanced Science Lab is hilariously good.

You can actually get warp flight from the mun with the basic science lab if you take all the samples. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=silver][SIZE=1]- - - Updated - - -[/SIZE][/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027gary85\u0027]Can thermal turbojet run on sth different than liquid fuel?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy default it runs on atmosphere.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T19:51:06Z","Content":"\nWhen you upgrade the TTJ, they will run on every propellants.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"2-Zons","CreatedById":94850,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T23:07:43Z","Content":"\nI am using KSP-I for the first time.
