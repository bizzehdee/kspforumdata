Mostly this is based around A, at 0 and twelfth frets, starting on the A string, foraying into A major and some mixolydian runs thrown in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s a tricky concept to explain, but suffice to say that you can slide the minor pentatonic scale up and down the fretboard and the root note (in this case, the first note you play at the bottom of the scale) determines the key, so at the fifth fret on the E string that\\\u0027s A, at the hypothetical 0 fret, you have E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertainly learn the major and minor scales as well, and then go from there and learn to combine and run up the fretboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s the simple explanation, and a good intro to guitar and music theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll just link a few resources here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a reverse chord finder, which can certainly be a help.

You can play the pentatonic scale shape at any fret you like and it will be a pentatonic scale because the intervals are right, but then you can also play a pentatonic scale on one string if you like, or two, or move up and down the whole length of the fretboard, which is what I\\\u0027m doing partly in that particular piece of music. Definitely just learn the root notes first and play your scale from there and then start figuring that out though. You can do amazing sounding things by just staying within the same area of fretboard too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
