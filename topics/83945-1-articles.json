Sorry, but I can\u0027t find a direct link to the article.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a pretty good magazine but specialist-interest so no great news for Squad/KSP but the (short) review itself is good and doesn\u0027t have any glaring misconceptions, so there\u0027s a good chance the journalists even know what they\u0027re talking about, for a change ^^.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
