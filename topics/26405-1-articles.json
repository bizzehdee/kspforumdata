There might be a way to utilize M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6ssbauer Effect. That would let you receive recoil from annihilation event by an entire lattice, minimizing heat production. If you can figure out how to emit photons exclusively with this zero-phonon recoil, you can make 100% (or near enough) efficient photon drive of legend. That would be the most efficient reaction drive physically possible.
