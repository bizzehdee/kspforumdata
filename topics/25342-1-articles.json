The problem is, it only has 6 wheels, thereby invalidating the name, and also, it tends to tip forward with sudden stops. So I build a base with 8 attachment points for wheels. Unfortunatly, the pod wasn\u0027t in the center of the frame, and when I tried to move it, I found out that there\u0027s issues with moving your attachment point (big thanks to astropapi1 for pointing that out to me). So I turn to those who are smarter than me (hopefully), to help me figure out a shape that can keep the cockpit in the center of the frame, but still have 4 axles. Also, it needs to be drivable and stable. Here\u0027s my failed frame:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b296/Wraith0/screenshot24_zps24ed182d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot24_zps24ed182d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice how badly off-center the cockpit is. Also, for your information, I\u0027m going to be using the Rovermax Model 3 wheels (The huge ones), so it\u0027ll have tank steering rather than standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, help me find shapes.
