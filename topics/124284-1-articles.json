It will spin 2-3 times before it stabilizes in the opposite direction to what it was originally facing.

Any suggestions would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note, The spin is not caused by flame out as it happens even at low altitudes and none of the engines turn off, and the plane works perfectly fine at 325 mps and above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T12:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi jj5437, you might like to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline\u0022\u003Echeck out this thread\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, it\u0027s a little old but still very useful, and KSP\u0027s aero and drag models have improved since so planes fly even more like they should \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BenG","CreatedById":150816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T12:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny pictures?
