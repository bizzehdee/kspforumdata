Several more contracts down, and I decided that poor Helmut Kerbin had waited long enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, ole Helmut is orbiting without much maneuver room. After several burns to attempt to bring him to my rescue craft, I had to save and go to work. I came back home, and when I re-loaded the game went into the tracking building and noticed that Rescue 1 was listed as a sub orbital craft. I looked at my peri and it was 42km, and 20 min away. I burned to raise my peri to 74km, but it was a horrible position to make a recovery back to orbit. I still have plenty of delta-v. However, I had neglected to put a pv cell on my craft. I have a battery, and after several orbits I\u0027m only down to 136/150 electrical charge, but I want to make the recovery quickly.

If your AP is above his orbit, but your PE is below his orbit, it\u0027s quite possible that it would take a very, very long time for the two to meet up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would recommend is that you raise your PE to \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E Helmut\u0027s orbit, and likely above it. Often, I find it\u0027s easiest (not always most economical) for the rescue craft to have a circular orbit above or below the target. That way you can place a maneuver node that lowers the PE to match the target\u0027s orbit. Then increment the maneuver node an orbit at a time (by collapsing the maneuver node, and clicking the little icons at the lower left/right). Eventually the rendezvous flags will get close. Then you can grab the maneuver node and slide it back and forth till the flags line up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes in the process of sliding the flags, the maneuver node will not maintain it\u0027s orbit increment. In that case, timewarp forward a few orbits till you catch up to your maneuver node. Just make sure you don\u0027t warp past the next rendezvous window. (Paying attention to \u0022ahead\u0022 or \u0022behind\u0022 as WanderingKid said.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout your electrical charge...If you only have a manned pod (not a probe core) then your craft will only consume electricity when you are turning the ship. If you need to turn, you can save electricity by turning off SAS. Add a bit of yaw/pitch/roll to start the turn, then let the craft rotate on it\u0027s own till you get to the desired orientation. Toggle SAS back on and it will come to a stop. In this way, you can really limit the amount of electricity used per maneuver. If you have a probe core installed, then the craft is going to slowly drain regardless, and you\u0027ll have to speed up the rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starchaser","CreatedById":139724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T02:15:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had turned off ships on the display, to hide clutter from my 2 orbiting stations.
