IDK why it does this but it is what it is. once i set this to a 1, it allows me to record the game and only the game.\u00A0 but SADLY i can\u0027t record my gameplay in 3840x1620 the game wont allow me to. the game must run in fullscreen to record just the game. i can not set a custom res and record the game in borderless or window mode it just wont allow me cuz it always wants to record desktop. and frankly stupid and makes me laugh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
