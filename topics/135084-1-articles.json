A preliminary investigation into the failure yielded a chain of events that were likely responsible for the event.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI won\u0027t repeat all the times and dates of the various events, communication windows etc, because they remain largely unchanged from the ones posted above. The only major change is that the 6-second radio signal received at Santiago at 1533 UT on March 29th\u00A0wasn\u0027t actually from Hitomi, or what was left of it at that time anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe light curve\u00A0of the main piece of debris (presumably the main spacecraft bus) suggests a rotation period of 5.2 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe telescope started an attitude manoeuvre to switch from the Crab nebula to Markarian 205. The manoeuvre took place from 18:01 to 18:22 UTC on March 25th. At around 19:10, the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) detected a non-existent roll about the Z-axis. Usually, the star tracker data has the priority over the IRU data, which in this case was faulty, but star trackes were not being used at the time of the failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe IRU data indicated a 21.7 degree/hour roll. The flight control system tried to counter the roll by entering a roll of 20 degree per hour in the opposite direction. The torque was induced by the reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe momentum continued to build up from 20:49 to 01:04 UTC. The magnetic torquers attempted to dump momentum, but were ineffective. At 112 newton-meter-second, the spacecraft was near its saturation momentum of 120 Nms. With the IRU faulty data still showing a large roll rate, Hitomi switched to Safe Mode to use its sun sensor to dermine the solar vector and thus the attitude. The system should have then used the thrusters to point the solar arrays to the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, another error was introduced. The software uploaded after the deployment of the Extensible Optical Bench prevented the sun sensor from working correctly. Furthermore, the thruster algorithms were not correctly updated to match the new center of mass. The thrusters fired and increased even more the roll of the spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsequently, at 1:31-1:53, the spacecraft began shedding at least 10 pieces.
