Extremely eccentric retrograde munar orbits, Hohman transfer orbits, other planets, missions to rescue the astronaut with his capsule, etc. Also, be careful if you have any mods with capsules that do not have hatches, the engine may randomly spawn them. On one assignment I had to figure out how to recover a FuseTek Karmony module, which involved a clawed 3 meter heatshield and a dozen parachutes, and still took multiple attempts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T19:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, do take them for the rewards but read the contracts carefully, verify the orbits and be prepared for a challenge!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeh, I still remember the thread \u0022please recover this orbital FOREST\u0022.
