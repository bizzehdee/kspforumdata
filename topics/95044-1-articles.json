So I am going to use this as my introduction to the forums, and hopefully I can stay active this time. So before I end this, I wanted to ask one thing that is bugging me. Is there a way to get notifications from a thread you want to keep track of? Because I had made a thread about a problem I was having with 0.90.0 and I never got any notifications from it, so I had to keep manually checking back in. Well thank you for reading this and hopefully I enjoy my stay on the forum!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T22:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thread Tools\u0022, just above the first thread on a page. \u0022Subscribe to this Thread\u0022 option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelated welcome to the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T22:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome!
