The surface has no atmosphere, but the planet is also criss-crossed with valleys, and inside those valleys there is a thick-ish atmosphere (maybe with oxygen, so jet engines can be used). Landing outside of those valleys would be extremely hard, kinda like Tylo, but players can also use parachutes to land in the valleys. I think that would be a very interesting planet to go to and land on :]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I do realize there\u0027s another thread relating to new planets, but that thread just confused me.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dartonal","CreatedById":73000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T20:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like an interesting idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T23:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, new planets are on the [thread=36863]what not to suggest list[/thread], under \u0022New stars, planets, moons and asteroids\u0022.
