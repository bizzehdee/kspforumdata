Not as easy as I thought it\u0027d be. Now I did get it to orbit several times. I can tell the basic model is very stable. But there are a few issues - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1) I think the cockpit pod and the ASAS nosecone need more torque.\u003C/strong\u003E I flew it with Mechjeb attached to fly it both completely manually (MechJeb off) and letting MechJeb do its thing. A stock PX-2 seems to have a roll wobble over time. I noticed this when I had gotten the PX-2 Version 1 to orbit and had Mechjeb keeping heading, pitch and roll on a steady vector. The pitch and the heading stayed steady, but the shuttle kept rolling from side to side slightly and kept this up and it seemed to get worse over time with the oscillations increasing until it was rolling almost up to 40 degrees or so on each roll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point I decided to revert to the hanger and tinker a bit. I wondered if I had the right nosecone on. One seems to have no torque factor listed. The other has a Torque of 20. I decided to put that on just in case (and I re-did the RCS jets that were on the nose in the right place). Tried it again. Seemed to be a little better. But still had a little bit of roll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think - assuming no other changes to the RCS layout on a stock PX-2 - it\u0027d need more torque. I remember on the previous version I had made both the ASAS and the cockpit pods have something like 20-25 torque apiece and that held it quite steady. Haven\u0027t re-written that here yet because I\u0027m not done testing the stock version. But signs point to a similar need for torque. Well heck - it makes sense - it\u0027s a STONKING HUGE SHIP now! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Speaking of the RCS -\u003C/strong\u003E I tinkered with placing RCS units on the back end of the craft and the sides or wings to see if I could get the RCS to take over some of the attitude adjustment. It worked... sort of. It damped out the roll problem in station-keeping. But without the torque in the ASAS and the Cockpit, the PX-2 RCS pods are SO POWERFUL that they have a tendency for over-correction to an extreme degree, particularly if you\u0027re doing some wide manuevers like turning the ship around from pro-grade to retrograde. I tried that with the \u0022all-around\u0022 RCS and it went CRAZY. Tumbling all over the sky! I turned off the RCS and did some manual recovery and then let Mechjeb try it again with fine controls and no RCS. Took a painfully slow time, but at least it didn\u0027t over-correct. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m doing some testing with B9 and stock RCS pods as well as the Eagle RCS to see what does what. But maybe it might be a good idea to make some RCS pods for the PX that are not as powerful? Maybe have 3 options - 50 power, 25 and 10-15?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) All of the above is orbital manuevering you may have noticed. The atmospheric flying is much better. \u003Cstrong\u003ESurprisingly responsive and nimble for such an enormous bird. The \u0022batwing\u0022 versions have insane glide ratios!\u003C/strong\u003E I think I mentioned in a previous post (about the smaller version) that it\u0027s almost TOO good? As in hard to land? Yup. Kinda have to get used to it. I think honestly you could land just by mostly gliding it in and adjusting with the engines just a little bit - assuming a standard wheeled-gear landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) On that note - once you get it up in the air, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe VTOL thrusters are very easy to use.\u003C/strong\u003E But the wings kind of interfere with what I expect from a VTOL ship. As I\u0027m mostly an Eagle driver, you can imagine where \u003Cstrong\u003Emy\u003C/strong\u003E problems come from. I\u0027m not really used to the combo of wings with high lift and VTOL thrusters. See \u0022inability to land\u0022 above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5) the standard \u0022legged\u0022 PX shuttles I find hard to get off the runway in a stable manner.\u003C/strong\u003E When the VTOL\u0027s are activated, the whole ship for some reason wants initially to pitch nose WAAAAY down and lift it\u0027s tail! Assuming you manage to get it away from the ground and don\u0027t knock the nose off, it then settles into normal VTOL flight - see above for performance, which is good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6) The stock craft files I think ought to have included versions with standard wheeled landing gear for standard take-offs and landings.\u003C/strong\u003E The parts are there. I wonder why they weren\u0027t used? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- On a sub-note - \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe B9 landing gear is a nice match to the PX shuttle\u003C/strong\u003E, since the black versions are obviously meant for birds with heat tiles on the bottom and they pull up nicely flush with the bottom when retracted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) You\u0027re not going to be happy about this Devo - but \u003Cstrong\u003Ethat issue with the Kerbals getting stuck in the door? It\u0027s still there unfortunately.\u003C/strong\u003E Really bad. Still needs work. I\u0027ve got Crew Transfer mod so I\u0027ve set up an alternate hatch using LLL in the cargo bay for EVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Just to re-iterate a problem I noted in an earlier post - the ventral cargo bay version has that problem with the bottom platform being too thick now for rovers to drive up onto or for Kerbals to hop up onto. Needs ramps built into it or the sides need to be sloped down or the whole thing needs to be thinner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) That cockpit IS kinda dark. Still looks good, but I kinda miss the \u0022Disco\u0022 lights actually. might it be possible to have lighting coming from the control panels themselves? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E10) Oh - it makes an incredible Water Craft!\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027m not kidding. I decided to splash one down gently off the coast when I was having trouble getting it to land on land, and it settled down into the water nicely. Then I decided to fire up the engines to see at what point the PX shuttle parts would break in the water. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey DON\u0027T. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have the engines on at FULL power and driving the PX shuttle at 90 Meters per second IN THE WATER and it behaves like a well-behaved BOAT. All the engines sit well above the water and are not obstructed. It drives along without even a freaking WAKE. It\u0027s INSANE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou\u0027ve created a rocket powered gigantic speedboat, mate.\u003C/strong\u003E That\u0027s very \u0022Kerbal\u0022 of you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all of this I haven\u0027t yet tested the Rapier Engines. But I wanted a whole lot of \u0022control\u0022 data before I switched out to those new engines. So I\u0027ll be doing some of that soon (after Christmas most likely). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, It\u0027s a good ship, but it still needs some tweaking. Some of the existing problems can be solved with parts work-arounds. But they ought to be addressed in the design tweaks over time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T21:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
