Thanks muchos.  The OPM planets are at StockSun and, while Helios still exists, it has no planets.  You might want to include that config file in an \u0022options\u0022 folder as I\u0027m sure many OPM users would prefer things this way.\n\nAnyway, with that solved, I made my 1st interstellar trip ever over to nearby.  Using the small USI warp drive (with HyperEdit refueling it) twice, the trip took 3.75 hours of gametime done at 4x physical warp because using regular warp hosed the drive up.  So I played a lot of solitaire in another window while this was happening.  However, it was worth the trip.  Kalgol is spectacular with B\u0027s atmosphere being sucked into A.\n\n[![01 Kalgol Orbit](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/27331052716_af5b9351b6_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/HD9MLQ)\n\nI did notice a few issues along the way and after the tirp, however.  Some of these might be incompatible mods and not GN\u0027s problem per se, but I figured I\u0027d mention them for general knowledge.\n\n1.  Revert Flight Not an Option  \n\nOnce at Kalgol, I wanted to revert to launch but the revert option was not available when I hit ESC.  The option was grayed out.\n\n2.  Asteroid Issues  \n\nAs mentioned, I added GN to an existing save.  That save includes Custom Asteroids mod.  There were quite a few asteroids already in existence, 5 tracked and a couple dozen untracked.  Adding GN made all those asteroids jump to orbiting an empty area of space without a star, which I assume was the galactic core.  Oh well.  While I was making the trip to Kalgol, 2 new unknown asteroids did spawn in the Kerbin system.  But for some reason, I was unable to track them in the tracking center.  The buttons were all grayed out.\n\n3.  Kerbin Sky Issues  \n\nAnyway, from my ship at Kalgol, I returned to the space center and it was very weird.  KSC and the ground was illuminated as if it was broad daylight but the sky was black.  So I hit the button to warp ahead to the next sunrise, time passed, and the warp eventually stopped.  The sky was still totally black, however, with no sun in the sky.\n\n[![04 Kerbin Sky Issues](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7396/27088982850_5cf4aa7792_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/HgL7Qs)\n\nI went into the tracking center, hit the \u0022warp to sunrise button\u0022 again, and when I got back outside, the sky was blue but there was no sun in it.  \u0022Warp to sunrise\u0022 from the KSC view kept the sky blue like daylight despite a full day-night cycle passing on the clock, and the sun remained missing.  Going back into the tracking center and repeating the process turned the sky black again but the daylight level of illumination of the ground remained, and the sun never appeared.  I went out to the main menu and back into the game, but nothing changed.  The ground was still bright, the sky was still black, and there was still no sun."},{"CreatedByName":"TheAdmiralty","CreatedById":162676,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T00:40:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On May 30, 2016 at 2:30 PM, Deimos Rast said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That was actually the ***opposite*** of a suggestion, as it caused conflicts when I had it and Open\\_Worlds installed.

My thought is that crossing stellar SOI boundaries causes KSP to consider that you\u0027ve left the ship and returned to it, so revert doesn\u0027t work.  So I mentioned this for possible inclusion in the list of known issues.  To answer [@sentania](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/159400-sentania/)\u0027s concern, I kept the interstellar ship focused the entire time.

I have no idea about the tracking bug. Maybe you can try removing custom asteroids and see what happens\n\u003E \n\nWell, here\u0027s what I did.  In the same installation, I removed Custom Asteroids and started new game #1.  This had the stock asteroids appearing as normal and they could be tracked, terminated, and all that just fine.  So I deleted new game #1, quit KSP, installed Custom Asteroids, and started new game #2.  This time, no asteroids appeared at all despite timewarping a couple years ahead.  I then quit KSP, restarted it, and resumed new game #2.  Now asteroids are appearing normally, including all the funky ones from Custom Asteroids.  And I can interact with them normally.\n\nSo for some reason, it seems that if you have GN and CA installed, when you start a new game, you have to quit it and return before CA actually starts to work.  But once you kick CA like this, everything seems good.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Sigma88 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Issue 3: Dark sky\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also for [@JPLRepo](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/114736-jplrepo/)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you are talking about the KSC screen (the starting one where you choose which building to enter) then this is a Kopernicus bug resulting from the reparenting of kerbin\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you put a ship on the launchpad and watch from there, everything should be fine\n\u003E \n\nYup, that\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about and yup, the black sky goes away when I\u0027m focused on a ship instead of the KSC external view.

I made a small plugin that adds it\u0027s self (with a MM patch) to all parts containing a ModuleDeployableSolarPanel. It then, on load, crawls up the SOI chain looking for a body with a temp \u003E= 2000K and assumes that\u0027s the star, uses that to calculate a EC generation rate and adds it.
