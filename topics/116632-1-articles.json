Last time I tried this (didn\u0027t post it) I tried to figure it out by using specs from the Ion engine. I intend to do that again, but I will be looking at the propellant this time, not how much energy 2kN of thrust adds to a craft. The answer to that is that it gives quadradically more energy the longer it runs. (work = force x distance, and kinetic energy = 0.5 x mass x velocity^2) Let\u0027s start with some specs from the wiki.\n\nIon engine consumes xenon at a rate of 0.04849 kg/s.\n\nIon engine consumes EC at a rate of 8.7285 EC/s.\n\nIon engine has an Isp of 4200 seconds.\n\nWikipedia tells me that I can convert from Isp to m/s by multiplying Isp by 9.81 m/s^2 (why g? somebody explain?).\n\nThat, if correct, produces a speed of 41202 m/s.\n\nOne kilogram of mass will have 848802402 Joules of kinetic energy at that speed (0.5mv^2).\n\nThat mass will take 1/0.04849 seconds to expel and use 8.7285/0.04849 EC in the process.\n\nThat is 180 EC.\n\nDivide 848802402 by 180 to get to Joules/EC.\n\n4715568 J/EC? Somebody tell me what I did wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T05:10:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Somebody tell me what I did wrong.\n\nShould have used pirate-ninjas.\n\nHow come you want to work this out?

For rocketry, effective exhaust velocity is more intuitive/natural, but KSP went with a wacky unit that existed in part because people thought lb\\*s of impulse per lb of propellant was a good idea.\n\nI would not trust any EC to Joule conversions, since last I checked, they were all over the place, and would lead to things like vehicle lights consuming kilowatts."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T07:04:51Z","Content":"I believe you\u0027d be much more successful with solar panel efficiency vs [Kerbol luminosity](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbol#Temperature_and_Luminosity).

To come close to a decent figure you\u0027d want to consider all sources of information. Some have obvious problems though. Ion engines have been tinkered with for gameplay reasons. Reaction wheels are likewise strong for gameplay reasons, though if you treat them as control moment gyroscopes they may behave more sensibly. Wheels are outright unphysical in the way they work.\n\nA commonly used value is 1 Ec = 1 kJ. Taking that you get some reasonable values. Probes consume 10-100 Watts, not including their reaction wheels. The RTG makes 750 Watts, which is about five or ten times too high. The 3x2 solar arrays are about 1.5 kW, which I think is within an order of magnitude of what it should be. The lights are 40 Watts."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T18:42:14Z","Content":"Yep, arbitrary unit is arbitrary.\n\nThough on the solar panels--if you take 1EC = 1 kJ their W/m^2 is totally screwy (the surface area is too small), but their watts per kilogram is actually pretty spot-on.\n\nVoyager\u0027s RTG started at 470W so 750 isn\u0027t that far off..."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T19:39:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yep, arbitrary unit is arbitrary.\n\u003E Though on the solar panels--if you take 1EC = 1 kJ their W/m^2 is totally screwy (the surface area is too small), but their watts per kilogram is actually pretty spot-on.\n\u003E \n\u003E Voyager\u0027s RTG started at 470W so 750 isn\u0027t that far off...\n\nI think it\u0027s fair to say that RTGs are overpowered in KSP, but not as outrageously as some other things are.

This would have the advantage of being physically accurate, no matter what strange amounts of power various sources produce. Bonus points for then determining the luminosity of Kerbol from this and the size of the solar panels. Don\u0027t forget to factor in heat loss on each stage! Use heat dissipation, surface area, and the thermometer. Oh, and you should be able to figure out the halflife of the isotope used in the RTGs from their power production and mass.\n\nIt would be interesting to see exactly how ridiculous the in game numbers are.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T23:29:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 11:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Keldor**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T13:28:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Easy; it\u0027s just one unit of the area under a curve on a graph whose axes are pirates and ninjas.\n\nI thought it was a KWh/sol ?"},{"CreatedByName":"spudman2","CreatedById":84199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T14:42:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In reality, specific impulse is a totally redundant term that was implemented in rocket science for the sole purpose of facilitating research in a workspace with users of both the metric and imperial system.
