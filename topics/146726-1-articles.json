After that, everything inside my fairing has been obliterated; my rocket is falling back down onto the space center; it lands on the grass; and... Everything but the fairing breaks and explodes. Fairings are needlessly strong. Don\u0027t you think that my launch escape system (homemade, it packs 300 Kn of thrust) should be able to crack that fairing open and carry my crew to safety? We like explosions don\u0027t we? Don\u0027t we want to see the fairing explode and crack\u00A0into little pieces?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis last thing is much less urgent than the first two.\u00A0It\u0027d be really cool if we had multiple textures for fairings. Stock, solid white, grey, some kind of ability to upload your own (maybe?)\u00A0be able to add a flag and such. While still maintaining the ability to customize the shapes of your fairings, I\u0027d also like to see Procedural Fairings become stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGuyNamedAlan","CreatedById":162058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T06:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0@\u003Cspan\u003EJoeybafoey idk about ur problem. it\u00A0doesn\u0027t\u00A0really occur to me\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EpicSpaceTroll139","CreatedById":162839,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-31T13:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is a really peculiar problem.
