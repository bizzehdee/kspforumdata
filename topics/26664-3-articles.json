I remember lucking out with the placement of my RCS in my early capsules that when I put up a bigger one I just slapped on the RCS as usual and got into orbit and I was swearing like a trooper because the darn thing wouldn\u0027t do what I wanted. All the RCS were firing at the same time it seemed when I put SAS on. Tried turning and it would turn... tried translating AND IT WOULD STILL TURN. Trying to align with the docking port and KEEP aligned was near impossible. All because of poorly placed RCS ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here is a VERY good way to learn how to balance your RCS is to use the built in debugger. Yes, it is a cheat in a way but it DOES help you to balance your final capsule without flying it up into orbit. It\u0027s a bit like a simulation system for your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBuild your final payload but don\u0027t add on the boosters just yet.

Add a ring of \u0022Place Anywhere\u0022 RCS pods around the Centre of Mass (you can find the CoM by pressing the little weight icon at the bottom left of your VAB screen). These will be used for translating... ie up,down,left and right. Use 4 for small ships, 6 for medium ships and 8 for large ships.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow add a ring of RCS Quad pods around the ship, a third of the way from the top. 4 is fine for a small to large ship as all they are used for is turning the ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow here is the trick... Go into Action Groups and select one of the Custom slots. For this example we are going to use Custom10. Select one of the RCS Quads on your payload and then you should see it appear in the action group menu as \u0022Toggle RCS Thrust\u0022 Click on this and it will now be allocated to Custom10.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENOW SAVE YOUR SHIP. So many times I have got to launch and the game crashes so I always save before testing a new ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow that you have saved, add a couple of launch clamps to support your ship. These are just so it doesn\u0027t go boom if it falls over.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow go to the launch pad. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHere is the trick.

You will now be able to test your RCS without going into orbit. Turn on the RCS by hitting R and you can turn the ship with the WASD buttons and rotate with the Q and E buttons. For translating we need to do a little trick.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETo enter our translation mode hit the custom10 button (which is usually 0). This will turn our quad pods off and on.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWith the quad pods off you can now use the JKLI buttons to move left, down, right and up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETo move forward and back hit the custom10 button again to turn the quad pods back on and use H and N.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETesting the ship will probably show you some problems. If the ship turns when you are translating you may have to move the ring or place anywhere pods up and down the body of the payload. If the ship isn\u0027t turning fast enough when you are using the WASD buttons you can move quad pods closer to the end of the payload which will speed up the rotation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHere ends the balancing RCS tutorial.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis technique was given to me by others on this board. It works well and I\u0027ve just added the fine tuning ideas myself because I either had extra twitchy small craft going crazy or big craft that just wouldn\u0027t turn. You don\u0027t need two lots of RCS rings like a lot of people use (just look at the Apollo CSM if you don\u0027t believe me). I used to use way too many quad pods before I realised this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: I used to rant about docking too... now I feel like an idiot when I think back on it lol... It\u0027s just learning new stuff is all. In orbit it\u0027s all about relative speed and try and ignore what your brain is telling you when you see the other ship. TRUST YOUR INSTRUMENTS. Sometimes you have to burn away from a target in order to get closer. Sounds mad until you realise what you are doing is nulling out (ie reducing to zero) your relative velocity.

It took me forever to figure out that if you point the ship to dock to north, select the docking port as a target, and simply face my rocket south, that all I have to do is get my velocity marker on that stupid pink target symbol. No worrying about that damned port slowly spinning out of alignment or anything like that. Since you know the port is facing straight up, you know you\u0027ll be right on top of it when the pink target symbol is right on the south part of the navball, and then it\u0027s just getting that green velocity marker to be exactly on top of it.

You hafta burn so that you come out of Kerbin orbit either increasing the speed of your solar orbit and thus raising your apoapsis, or decreasing it and lowering your periapsis.. to go inward in the system, or outward. But there\u0027s the matter of timing: hitting the peri/apoapsis at just the right moment that the planet you\u0027re aiming for is entering the neighbourhood is far from intuitive. You can have to wait years of in-game time for the planets to line up right. Google for \u0027ksp interplanetary calculator\u0027 to see the recommended angles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
