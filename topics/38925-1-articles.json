A better TWR of your whole craft allows you to decelerate much more quickly, which makes landings much safer and easier. And the later you brake, the less fuel you need because you spend less time accelerated by the gravity of the planet. The same applies to the start: a high TWR means less loss of Delta-V due to gravity-drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, due to it length, the LV-N is hard to integrate into most lander designs, while the compact LV-909 is practically made for being placed between landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that while the LV-N has the best fuel-efficiency, it has by far the highest mass compared to its thrust. This doesn\u0027t matter much when you accelerate a mass of tens of tons during an interplanetary transfer, but when you have a small craft which weights just a few tons, it really starts to matter. Twice the fuel efficiency is pointless when it means more than twice the total mass.
