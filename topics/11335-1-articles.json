Don\\\u0027t design ships that naturally have an elevated nose.\n\n5) land on the Mun , come to a complete stop using the wheel brakes\n\n6) subsequently lift off again using the same vehlicle\n\nBonus points if you can do the whole thing with a spaceplane and land that back on kerbin"},{"CreatedByName":"Twinky827","CreatedById":17455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T03:36:50Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ll do this, but can you please give me some hints on how to get to Minmus...

I repeatedly saved and loaded until I had a trajectory that would put me down on a relatively flat stretch at a vertical speed of about 10 m/s.\n\nThen I pointed my ship in a retrograde direction, with my nose slightly higher to account for gravity and give me a little breathing room--in other words, about 5 degrees above the green \\\u0027X\\\u0027 on the navball.\n\nI made a first few tries to get a general idea of how long it would take to stop the craft. Then, I made a save shortly before the burn point with my ship already pointing in the right direction.\n\nThen it just became a process of trial and error. I\\\u0027d engage SAS every time I reloaded, so the only variable between attempts was the altitude at which I started my burn. After several attempts, I finally determined the exact altitude I needed to burn at to stop right before I reached the surface. My proper burn point ended up being only about 300 meters above the surface (!) though it will vary depending on your craft\\\u0027s thrust/weight ratio.\n\nIf I could land this:\n\n\u003E ![screenshot517.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6850538/screenshot517.png)\n\n...you should be able to land a more typical craft without much trouble.\n\nSpeaking of landing craft, the more thrust your ship has the easier it will be to land on the Mun. The faster you can decelerate, the shallower of an angle you can land at, so you might want to think about packing in some extra engines. Also, RCS thrusters below the nose of your craft really help, since you\\\u0027ll land at a slight incline and your nose will fall to the ground hard without RCS to stabilize it.\n\nAlso, this sort of landing uses far, far less fuel than a typical Mun landing. If the Mun has a gravitational acceleration of, say, 3 m/s per second, every second of descent takes means another 3 m/s of delta-v gone to waste. If your descent takes 5 minutes, that\\\u0027s 1000 m/s worth of fuel. If your descent takes 30 seconds, it\\\u0027s only 100 m/s of fuel. Once you\\\u0027ve tried a few high-speed landings, you probably won\\\u0027t want to go back to slow, floaty descents; the fuel savings lets you do so much much more on a mission. It\\\u0027s also way more fun and thoroughly Jeb-approved. Just remember to save before the attempt ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"dylan1234","CreatedById":22381,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T17:41:31Z","Content":"you know that video is your name on youtube sysysyg because that\\\u0027s who made that vid."},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T18:20:21Z","Content":"The no beyond 5 for the moon is near impossible. I have done a horizontal landing on the moon and it is very difficult because of mun\\\u0027s gravity, you have to have an upwards aim to keep the vertial velocity down. Just use 5 angle pitch, and is near impossible to maintain without doing little balerina spins to prevent de-orbit velocities. Since mun doesnt have the smooth ocean landing, a low velocity is required as well to prevent cartwheels. Will attempt, but probably going to have to break some rules.\n\nEdit: Read post two above this one, some good hints.
