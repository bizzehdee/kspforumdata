In 0.90, you could slap a couple of upside down basic jets on and lift pretty much anything off the ground. With 1.0 it became a challenge to lower weight, but still doable with the ability to create a practical craft. Then came 1.0.3 and boom, VTOl\u0027s became bricks. The basic jet is so heavily nerfed it\u0027s impractical for all but the smallest and lightest craft, and the ISP changes halved hovering time. Turbojets work better but the drag from a vertical turbojet in forward flight is hard to overcome. Even the new exhaust/ground interaction particle effects serve to make the fps drop when flying VTOls low to the ground almost unbearable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that the huge TWR of the 0.90 basic jets was hugely unrealistic, but they\u0027ve now been nerfed to the point of being pretty much useless for everything but early career and occasional small, slow craft. And without helicopter parts or anything else to allow vertical flight, they were the only real way to get the capabilities only a vertical takeoff craft can provide. I know I\u0027m not the only one feeling the impact of the 1.0.3 changes, and I\u0027m wondering what other people think should be done, if anything, to get some kind of practical vertical flight back into KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T10:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see a Mk2 piece similar to F-35\u0027s lift fan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/F-35B_Joint_Strike_Fighter_%28thrust_vectoring_nozzle_and_lift_fan%29.PNG/330px-F-35B_Joint_Strike_Fighter_%28thrust_vectoring_nozzle_and_lift_fan%29.PNG\u0022 alt=\u0022330px-F-35B_Joint_Strike_Fighter_%28thrust_vectoring_nozzle_and_lift_fan%29.PNG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T11:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe TWR of the basic jet engine is about right.
