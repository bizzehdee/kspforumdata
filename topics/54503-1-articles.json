I currently land my command pod and fuel for return on the surface, and blast off to get back to Kerbin, usually with no fuel remaining, and using all but about 30 units of mono propellant from 80 to start (I use some fuel and mono on the descent final seconds also, after detaching the main stage.

Are you certain that 4.5t of a pair of LV-Ns is actually better than a 2.5t Poodle, 1t of a pair of LV-909s, or maybe even 0.5t for a single LV-909?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, there\u0027s a minimum dV requirement before a LV-N is actually a real benefit. If you\u0027re using them for landing, ascending, then return to Kerbin, the transfer burn back to Kerbin probably makes them worthwhile. If they are only for landing and re-ascent, with a different engine powering the long orbital transfer burns, I\u0027m not sure they are the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA useful setup might be to use the same LV-Ns for orbital transfer away from low Kerbin orbit, landing, ascending, then transfer back home. Something like that might really allow the LV-N\u0027s efficiency to make a big difference, despite their very poor individual TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I like the LV-Ns for long transfer burns, but prefer the LV-909 or Poodle for landers, and for Apollo-style returns home with just the CSM. As far as landing with the return stage or not, I\u0027m not sure. I do like doing it Apollo-style, it\u0027s interesting and fun. Mun is probably about the heaviest gravity where it does make some sense to land with the return stage and fuel. My gut feeling is that it\u0027s really 50/50 which is better for Mun. Any heavier gravity, and the fuel for returning to Kerbin is probably better to stay in orbit, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T20:03:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48193-BSC-Two-stage-Lander-We-have-a-WINNER!?p=630643#post630643\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWho says you need two nuclear engines?\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/JeOwy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Just getting back into orbit from the Munar surface is 75% of the delta-v required for the entire trip home. Having a separate descent/ascent stage is even worse. I\u0027ve had to make custom tanks just so that my landing stage didn\u0027t have so much fuel it could land, take off, and go back to kerbin all by itself. The reason this worked well for the LEM is because the LEM was designed to cut every corner possible as far as mass went (I seem to remember it didn\u0027t even have seats), and there\u0027s no way it could have survived reentry. In KSP, we don\u0027t have a manned pod that can\u0027t survive reentry.

Every LEM-style lander I\u0027ve used on the Mun has had two identical engines, so I bailed on that design and went with drop tanks instead. The only exception to that is when I do a lander that\u0027s got enough delta-v to hit several biomes on the same trip, in which case I might throw a pair of 48-7S\u0027s on the bottoms of two of the drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVanamonde, if you want to improve that design, ditch the 909. The 48-7S may only be half the thrust, but it will still be more than enough, and at a fifth the mass, will easily get you more delta-v despite the lower ISP with tanks that small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T06:06:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Eric S, but that\u0027s actually one of my ships I built for newbies, so I always like to give them a little margin for error in thrust and fuel. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jananton","CreatedById":83920,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T11:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause in career mode one doesn\u0027t have all the parts available to start with, I\u0027m quite fond of this contraption, if I may say so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16919187/Screenshots/KSP_MunMin_lander001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_MunMin_lander001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial retro burn is done with the stage that brings the lander to Mun or Minimus so it crashes into the planet and the final descent is done with the lander with enough juce to spare to get back to Kerbin with all the science data gathered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreets,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJan\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-28T13:38:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2013 01:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jananton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T12:04:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis one is a little over-engineered, but it was designed for a contest on another forum, and had to be easy to fly for other pilots.
