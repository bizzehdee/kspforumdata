But my capsule exploded in reentry, i was going at about 2100 km/h . I even put a heat shield Under the capsule but it all goes up in a big bang.... What have i done wrong ? My first guess is that i must keep some fuel to brake before reentry ?

Next time, burn more horizontally so that you have a orbit with the Pe around 30 km.
