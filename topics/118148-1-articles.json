But my capsule exploded in reentry, i was going at about 2100 km/h . I even put a heat shield Under the capsule but it all goes up in a big bang.... What have i done wrong ? My first guess is that i must keep some fuel to brake before reentry ? What is the acceptable speed ?\n\nAlso sorry for my English..."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T20:28:46Z","Content":"My guess is that you were coming in too steep. 2100 m/s at a steep angle can be deadly. Next time, burn more horizontally so that you have a orbit with the Pe around 30 km. And don\u0027t worry, the Kerbals respawn after a day or so."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T20:36:14Z","Content":"First, speeds are in m/s not in km/h (just a detail) ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nSecond, normally, a capsule, even without a heatshield shouldn\u0027t blow up during LKO reentry. Your speed was more than acceptable and you don\u0027t need fuel to slow down for such a reentry.\n\nTo be able to help you, some information is needed (to get the cause of the explosion):\n\n- what was your reentry profile ? ie: how steep did you reenter, what was the height of your periapsis before reentring.\n\n- what did the \u0022crash\u0022 menu (don\u0027t know its exact name, it\u0027s the one that appears when you hit F3 or when your ship is destroyed) said about the explosion ? was it because the pod overheated ?\n\n- at what height did you explode ?\n\n- was there a service bay in your ship ? (they make excellent Kraken baits)\n\n- and anything else I forgot to mention, the more info there is, the easier it is to get the cause of the explosion.\n\nTry to recreate the flight and explosion to get this information if you don\u0027t have it yet, and, if possible, post a screenshot or video. With this, we might be able to determine the cause of the explosion.\n\nEDIT: also, this kind of post should go in the \u0022Gameplay Questions and Tutorials\u0022 section of the forum"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T20:58:41Z","Content":"Straight up = Straight down == too steep, not enough angle === burn up ==== kaboom!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n![Untitled.png](http://xyphos.altervista.org/Untitled.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T21:29:40Z","Content":"Yep. No more slamming into atmo at steep angle with speed exceeding 3000 meters per second, while returning from Minmus.
