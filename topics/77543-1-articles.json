I may have \u0027borrowed\u0027 much of that design from Kurtjmac\u0027s youtube series, but I added a built in jack. When the tires pop, I use the struts to raise the thing up off the ground like a race car\u0027s built in airjack thing, and I can repair the tire without it flipping the rover over in the low gravity. another shot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MWhN4usnw9s/U5ZlsRO5GII/AAAAAAAAChY/Wpv_oJEPUbk/w1598-h899-no/screenshot234.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot234.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a more advanced Jool mission ship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mth_Q5dSUVw/U5CyMQ3w_BI/AAAAAAAACes/b5q1ugNCHts/w1598-h897-no/screenshot104.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot104.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat had a lander for each one of jool\u0027s moons. They all worked (barely) except for the Tylo one, which was a miserable failure. The back end of the ship has detachable ion engine \u0027boosters\u0027. I used those to nearly get to a jool encounter and save rocket fuel. Then, I just release them and carry on with less weight and part count to reduce lag.

Your pics are awesomely professional. I\u0027m a true blue long time PC SciFi gamer who came across this game when browsing the SpaceSims Central web site. I downloaded the demo earlier today and am impressed with the story idea \u0026amp; script, graphics and gameplay. It appears that I\u0027ll purchase the full boat in the near future. Tell me Rufledt, since you\u0027ve been playing this game for a cupla months now, do you know the origin of the name \u0022Kerbal\u0022? I read the Credits, and none of the developers or crew have that first or surname. You\u0027d think that there would be a reference to it in the web site. Just curious.
