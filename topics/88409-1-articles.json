They are used to control attitude and for fine adjustments in final velocity. Example: Atlas sustainer has a 350kN engine, and two 5kN verniers. The main engine does gimbal, but since there\u0027s only one, it can\u0027t provide roll control. The main engine shuts off when the velocity is almost as desired; the low-thrust verniers then thrust for a few seconds to a few dozen seconds to provide the precise velocity desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUllage motors are either liquid or solid motors that ullage your propellants (i.e. provide a bit of acceleration so the propellants settle to the bottom of the tanks and the engines don\u0027t suck gas instead).
