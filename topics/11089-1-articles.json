I don\\\u0027t have enough experience to know, is the number of polys in the collider going to add \u0027significantly\u0027 to that performance hit? If I were to create, say, a 12 tri cube to surround the gear bay, would it boost the performance (measurably)? I\\\u0027m mostly referring to assemblies with many parts. Is the number of colliders more important than the number of triangles building up those colliders?

You can have multiple colliders linked to one rigidbody, and they will not cause a collision with each other. The forces of impact with another body will transfer to the core rigidbody. Essentially a wheel collider isn\\\u0027t a \u0027real\u0027 collider anyways.

The more triangles they have the more vertices that need to be checked against etc. Unless your model is perfectly convex and made of perfect quads, you can expect it to get a little messy when Unity processes it. In most cases its faster to use multiple primitive colliders, since the internal bounds are easily \u0027known\u0027. The case above is likely more efficient by far then a mesh collider would be.
