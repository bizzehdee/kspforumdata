I\u0027ve been a shuttle night launch as well and it is so bright it\u0027s like watching a sunrise, but it doesn\u0027t actually light up the shuttle itself the same way the game lights the spacecraft with point lights. The shuttle is pretty evenly lit because all of the light on it is coming from reflections off the ground and diffused light from the exhaust.\n\n![STS-88_launch.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/STS-88_launch.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"eodh","CreatedById":76746,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T22:57:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Have you ever been to a real night launch?

What you say would imply some kind of ambient light modification when the engines are on, which would be cool btw but not the topic I was talking about.\n\nSee what I meant in this comparison:\n\n[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/STS-116_Launch_%28KSC-06PD-2750%29_cropped.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/STS-116_Launch_%28KSC-06PD-2750%29_cropped.jpg)\n\n[http://a.pomf.se/popmwq.jpg](http://a.pomf.se/popmwq.jpg)\n\nEdit: Essentialy, what **Why485** says ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
