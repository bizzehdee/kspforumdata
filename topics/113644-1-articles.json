I managed to land on both mun and minmus that way. Now I downloaded kerbal engineer so I can plan how much delta-v I am going to need. I am trying to now send another ship to the mun to leave a rover, scientist, and mobile processing lab there, and bring the pilot back. Anyway, I sorta through a rocket together I thought might be enough, kerbal engineer said it had about 5700 delta-v, an after trying it out it was going to be a few hundred short of getting back. Looking at the delta-v charts online that seems pretty consistent, but then I loaded up my old lander from the first time I went to the mun without trying to bring so much with me, and it was barely over 4000 delta-v according to kerbal engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo am I going crazy? The new rocket has a bigger paylod, but shouldn\u0027t that be factored into the delta v calculation already? I know the way I designed it with my rover at the bottom of the final stage, about a third of the way from the top of the total rocket, it can be a little wobbly in stage two, but it shouldn\u0027t affect the efficiency THAT much. Also, according to what I have read it shouldn\u0027t even be possible to land on the mun and come back with barely 4k delta v. Maybe the save of my old rocket got altered somehow without me realizing it? I am confused.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T22:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no way to make it to the Mun, land, and and come back with 4000 m/s delta-v. That\u0027s just enough to make it into orbit and maybe perform a few orbital maneuvers in LKO. Maybe when you were new at the game and just testing things out, you enabled infinite fuel? For the first few landings on the Mun, it would make sense to not worry about fuel and just figure out how to get the controls right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bjb406","CreatedById":146715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T23:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t even know how to enable cheats. I think I figured it out though, maybe its just cause I wasn\u0027t breaking it down by which stage is going to be active where? I haven\u0027t really played around much with the options at the top o the kerbal engineer window. For the rocket that initially got me to the moon, with body: kerbin and atmospheric checked, it gives me a total dalta-v of 4061, but if I uncheck atmospheric, it shoots up to 7497 delta-v. With the new one with the rover on it, it starts at 5718 delta-v for atmospheric, and only increases to 6295 delta-v when I uncheck atmospheric. Should I just always have atmospheric unchecked?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T23:36:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should check your values again and pay attention to the \u0022atmospheric\u0022 setting in Kerbal Engineer. If it is activated it will calculate the delta-v based on the atmospheric density at sea level. If you use the \u0022vacuum\u0022 engines like the 909, Poodle, or Nukes, which have very low atmospheric ISP, your atmospheric delta-v calculations will be far off the correct value for your ship in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T01:26:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother example that a picture would show a lot more\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arkalius","CreatedById":40968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T04:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor all these values, atmosphere is unchecked in KER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to allow for about 3500 m/s for getting into LKO. Then you need about 1200 m/s to get to the Mun and insert into a low orbit. Landing and getting back into Mun orbit is about 600m/s each (more if you haven\u0027t perfected your Mun landing skills or have to hunt for a safe spot). Then you need like 320 or so to escape the Mun into a direct re-entry back to Kerbin. That\u0027s a total of just over 6200 m/s. That\u0027s all assuming you can fly the mission with decent efficiency with your maneuvers. You\u0027d probably want a little extra wiggle room there. You could probably do it with less if you\u0027re really good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the 6295, is entirely conceivable that you were simply inefficient at some point and ended up short some delta-V in the end.
