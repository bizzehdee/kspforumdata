For instance if you wanted to make the LV-N heat on it\u0027s own due to some kind of wear? Or just to heat at a faster than the \u0022heatProdution = xxx\u0022 specifies?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T13:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.

It also suffers from the same sort of odd inflation at high warp speeds that EC generation (such as from solar panels) seems to experience, making the situation even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
