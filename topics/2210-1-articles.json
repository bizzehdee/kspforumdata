It\u0027s been great fun. After a few test rockets, I managed to build one out of stock parts that made it into orbit (with a bit of seat-of-the-pants flying). I\u0027ve since built a bigger and better one (with some of Silisko and Sunday Punch\u0027s parts) and am looking forward to what the future may bring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBorn in \u002770, about the same time as Apollo 13\u0027s fateful mission, I\u0027ve been a fan of the real space program from an early age. One of the older books in my library, perhaps the first I bought with my own money, is an illustrated history of manned spaceflight up through Skylab and the Shuttle, which was then about to begin flight testing. I played some early Shuttle simulators on the Apple ][ and the Atari 2600 (by Activision!), but \u003Cem\u003EOrbiter\u003C/em\u003E is too much for me; KSP is more my speed. My forum handle comes from my years in charge of an online X-wing fan squadron, back around the turn of the millennium; it seemed to fit here as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-08T18:33:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
