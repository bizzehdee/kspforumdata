So, here goes another thread on the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a contraption which places a balanced rotating horizontal beam on top a free spinning washer just off the ground. It gets torque from ion engines near the end points.

The goal is to find out when it becomes too costly to keep building up additional rotational speed relative to other solutions. I have run the following test with Bill. The test was to strap him to an external seat and launch him into mun orbit and definitely not into the ground.

He had to use about 2.4 units of his personal fuel to get orbital after his initial launch. Yay Bill! You live to see another experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I\u0027d like to find is the effective Isp of this set up or alternatively I\u0027d like to be able to solve for the deltaV of a simple ion vessel spending equal amounts of xenon(900 units), supposing the vessel was idealized to just the ion engine, 4 6x1 solar arrays, a kerbal, a seat, and 3 xenon tanks for a total mass of .7 t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate any help with explaining how to solve the two questions above. Ideally, if I could understand the Isp equations, I could determine how to optimize this solution. Some obvious questions concern increasing the radius or adding more torque. The limiting factor on torque is rotational frequency because a single revolution must be slow enough for human reflexes to aim the release in the right direction. The initial purpose of this \u0027accelerator\u0027 was to overcome TWR issues by building up speed perpendicular to the pull of gravity while relying on the device to maintain elevation until release. This permitted less idle time for ships fighting gravity while also trying to speed up.

Ff is the Mass fraction of fuel of your stage. KSP\u0027s Xenon tanks have a Ff of 0.58, this means that, no matter your efforts, any given stage on your ship can NEVER have a Ff bigger than 0.58, and will likely range 0.3 to 0.5 tops (meaning 30 to 50% of the total mass of the stage is Xenon).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis saves you boring maths by telling you straight ahead what your max deltaV will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fourthmillenniumfoundation.org/images/logaritmic_rocketequation.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022logaritmic_rocketequation.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee this curve ?
