It is capable of slamming off the end of the runway without its landing gear giving way, so I assume it is capable of landing safely. The radial attachment point plus an RCS tank seems to work wonders as suspension.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent is pretty hairy - you have to keep moving fuel forward and the forward tanks must have their fuel flow off until the Skippers are activated. The way I got it into orbit, it began pulling up uncontrollably so I fired the main engines and shut down the jets, before getting control of its waving around. Having two Skippers instead of one Mainsail really improved the handling, and I didn\u0027t have to abort the mission like I might have needed to with one of the older Veto Aerospace 3-man spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent. [This is an older image, showing a version that lacks the three Basic Jets at the rear. However, it does show the six small radial engines on the nose that assist with takeoff. These are switched on and off with the 1 key using Action groups.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/g5ybvxt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022g5ybvxt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example of earlier versions\u0027 instability.
