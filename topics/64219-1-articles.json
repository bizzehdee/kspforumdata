It is true for usual lifters. If the rocket is big and heavy, a few nosecones will not make it significantly more stable and will add some weight. The worst idea is to put nosecones on SRBs near the bottom end of the rocket, deep below its center of mass - there they even make the rocket less stable. Reason is, the drag model in stock KSP results in forces moving parts with low drag ahead of CoM and parts with high drag behind the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are cases when adding a nosecone actually helps.
