The cure is to address at the core game level how KSP uses memory, it still loads every single asset into memory at the start, regardless of whether that asset is actually required. In recent updates that problem has been reduced by using more efficient textures, but the game still packs every single part (and it\u0027s textures) into memory at the start and they remain in memory, regardless of whether they are going to be used.
