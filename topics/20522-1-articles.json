While doing retrograde burn I accidently decoupled the capsule from the lander stage. I was able to EVA one of the kerbals out and land him on the moon. The other kerbals were gone. I was descending a little fast with the kerbal and he hit the moon at a high speed. He survived and eventually came to a stop on the surface. Right when I pressed a key for him to stand up however, the glitch happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/641/screenshot0gz.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img641/2543/screenshot0gz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0gz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zapy97","CreatedById":45133,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T00:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat\u0027s weirdbut post it in the bugs forum\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maple51","CreatedById":44771,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T00:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone can close this thread now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoved to support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T02:08:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EModerator Comment: Thread closed.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
