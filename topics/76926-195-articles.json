In the gps co coordinator module, click on the co ordinates you just sent so they show on the designated coordinate area. Then switch your selected weapon to the JDAM using the weapon manager and release it when the target is in the green targeting area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gaminglabrador5","CreatedById":149983,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T10:48:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhenever i install and then use this mod, i can build things with it, but when i press launch i am in outer space and i cant do anything in the game.
