This, combined with markedly above average efficiency at both sea level and in vacuum, and the increased versatility that comes with smaller sized parts, all contribute to this engine being, in my opinion, at least a tier above any other primary rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enot to mention that clustering mainsails in the same manner kills your aerodynamics\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-11T02:10:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2015 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by spikeyhat09\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T02:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...All of the 2.5m parts have gimbals on them, so I don\u0027t know where you\u0027re getting the idea that there\u0027s a good comparison to added weight for them there.

As for the rest of the stuff, keep in mind that this engine is a non-clustered version of the 4x KS-25 Mammoth cluster... which has a stupidly high TWR and is ultimately a better engine to bring along for most heavy-lift situations.\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for aerodynamics, they\u0027re so much weaker than they were prior to 1.0 that there\u0027s no reason to even consider them during a launch. The dV losses to drag are going to stay around 100 m/s at most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, I agree that its smaller size is a benefit. I wish \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E stock engines could do away with the tankbutts; the Mainsail could be half as wide, as could the Skipper. The LV-909 should also be able to be fitted in more places. The problem is that you\u0027re attacking it from the wrong angle: all engines should be that flexible, not the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Dart (aka aerospike) also can now be attached radially, with the same flexibility as the KS-25 Vector. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I checked the stats for the KS-25 awhile ago, in addition to it\u0027s size in comparison to the Mammoth, and it is essentially 1/4 of the Mammoth. The Vector has exactly 1/4 the thrust and about the same sized nozzle(s) as the Mammoth, 4 Vectors is 1 ton heavier than the Mammoth, and atmospheric efficiency allows the Vector to make up for the extra mass. Not to mention the radial attachments is offset by the fact that the Vector isn\u0027t meant for stacks, with the nozzle being bigger than the attachment point, meaning that the Vector is suited for shuttles/huge vtols and very expensive boosters, for when you have the budget for that. The Mammoth is efficient in-atmosphere too, highly priced because of it, and is also suited for expensive boosters, though it leaves more elbow room to add more within a certain budget. It can also be mounted on the backs of shuttles using the Mk3 to 3.75m Adapter. All in all, the Vector isn\u0027t any more overpowered than it\u0027s larger cousin, the Mammoth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Wait, spikeyhat09, where\u0027s your fairing? No wonder that would be a nightmare to orchestrate. And if those are clusters of five or six Vectors on those boosters, no wonder it could finally make it to orbit; you just forced it! A fairing would allow that payload to be lifted much more efficiently and much less forcefully (bringing it up more forcefully and fighting drag uses more fuel and requires more engine mass), which would most-likely allow Mammoths to easily take over the lifting job for that rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-11T04:11:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2015 04:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LaytheDragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
