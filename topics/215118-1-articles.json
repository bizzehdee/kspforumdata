Propellers are immersed in an ocean of reaction mass (water or air). Jet engines suck in a huge amount of air for reaction mass, then burn a little fuel in it to heat it up, which makes it expand and go shooting out the back. Rockets need to carry their own reaction mass, and then throw it out the back. The faster it\u2019s thrown, the more efficient it is. It can be thrown by thermal expansion either by running it through something really hot (NTR) or by using a fuel and an oxidizer as reaction mass and burning them together. Some compounds decompose exothermally, sometimes needing a catalyst.\u00A0Or it can be thrown electrically in an ion engine or rail gun.

If you divide 432.8 kN by 223 m/s, you get a total reaction mass flow of 1941 kg/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the thrust-specific fuel consumption of the GE90 is only 7.9 grams per second for each kN of thrust, meaning that its actual fuel flow is only 3.42 kilograms per second. So the bulk of its thrust comes from the ~1,938 kilograms (1.9 tonnes) of air it\u0027s pushing through the engine each second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat bypass ratio of 9:1 means that only 194 kilograms of air is actually flowing through the engine each second; the other 1,744 kilograms of air goes through the fan bypass. Without that fan bypass, the thrust would be much lower, but the energy going through the engine would be the same, and so the exhaust speed would be correspondingly higher. Do the math and you get an exhaust velocity of about 350 m/s with a total mass flow of 197 kg/s: 69 kN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what\u0027s the specific impulse of a pure turbojet without the bypass fan? Well, it would be 35.7 seconds. That\u0027s...terrible. Absolutely terrible. If your specific impulse is that low, you will not go to space today. However, a turbojet gets by because the only propellant flow that actually matters is coming from the fuel it carries, and the fuel it carries is just 1.52% of the total propellant flow. Subtract out the mass of the airflow and do the math again, and boom: your pure turbojet now has a specific impulse of 7,930 seconds. That\u0027s fantastic!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem, of course, is that your pure turbojet will only be able to maintain thrust at relatively low speeds. The faster it goes, the faster the airflow into it, and the less work it is able to do. Net thrust is the momentum of the exhaust coming out of the back of the engine MINUS the intake drag: the momentum of the air coming into the front of the engine. At 200 m/s airspeed, its net thrust is the 69 kN of thrust out the back minus 38.8 kN of intake drag or a total of 30.2 kN, and so your effective specific impulse drops to 900 seconds. At 250 m/s airspeed, intake drag reaches 48.5 kN and so net thrust drops to 20.5 kN, a specific impulse of 611 seconds. At the speed of sound -- 343 m/s -- intake drag is 66.5 kN and so net thrust is just 2.5 kN, a specific impulse of 75 seconds. At 355 m/s, net thrust is zero: all of the thrust out the back of the engine is being used to counteract the intake drag, and your specific impulse is zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, 355 m/s is only 4.5% of the velocity you need to reach orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can, of course, carry your own oxidizer (in the form of liquid air or simply liquid oxygen) in tanks. As your speed increases, you can slowly close the intakes to reduce intake drag, and you can inject liquid oxidizer into the engine to make up for the lost oxidizer. But now you\u0027re going to have to include the mass flow of your liquid oxidizer in the equation. And so by the time you\u0027ve completely closed your intakes and you\u0027re now relying entirely on liquid oxidizer, you\u0027re still only getting that same specific impulse of 35.7 seconds I calculated above. You\u0027ll need a much more efficient rocket engine to get to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T20:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224260225\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215118\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678987794\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA scramjet only gets 3600 isp because you aren\u0027t counting the mass of the oxidizer, since it\u0027s collected as you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re bringing your oxidizer with you, then you have a rocket, not an airbreather.

But once you\u0027re bringing along liquid air to operate your engine, you now have to count the liquid air in your mass flow, so you\u0027re no longer getting 3600 seconds of specific impulse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, now it has been suborbital space plane concepts using an rocket engine going from mach 2-3 up to 6-8 then you deploy upper stage in space and you don\u0027t need fairings.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is very similar an real rocket engine would have better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E but if you just need say 100 m/s to raise AP you could probably heat up lox and inject oxygen into the scram jet.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you want to make an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, stop it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Make second stage reusable instead.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell if you have high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E fusion reactors you can but it changes everything.\u00A0 Or you can build some support mega structure who only makes sense if you launch thousands of ton of payloads daily.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CBase","CreatedById":189476,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T20:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133381-arugela/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022133381\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133381-arugela/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Arugela\u003C/a\u003E for provoking \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157695\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sevenperforce\u003C/a\u003E great explanation into air fed engines \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T22:13:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224260417\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215118\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678999837\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022189476\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CBase\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, CBase said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133381-arugela/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022133381\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133381-arugela/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Arugela\u003C/a\u003E for provoking \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157695\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157695-sevenperforce/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@sevenperforce\u003C/a\u003E great explanation into air fed engines \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I didn\u2019t discuss above is the advantage created from ram air effect. A turbojet engine operating on the run away is using a significant portion of its reaction energy to compress atmospheric air and push it into the combustor. This creates a limit on the static thrust that the engine can produce. However, once the engine really starts to get moving, the air begins to be compressed simply by the forward motion of the engine forcing the air into the intake. This means the compressor doesn\u2019t have to do nearly as much work, which means the turbine isn\u2019t extracting quite as much energy out of the exhaust stream, which means higher exhaust velocity and better specific impulse than you would otherwise expect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the ram air effect really doesn\u2019t provide much help until you are starting to edge toward transonic velocities. Jet engines can be designed to fly at well above the speed of sound by using a much more fuel-rich combustion and thus pumping more energy into the exhaust. Even so, the region in which the ram air effect starts to provide a significant advantage tends to be rather narrow, because even the most energetic hydrocarbon fuels soon reach a point where they can no longer overcome intake drag. There are scramjet designs using liquid hydrogen to dump as much energy into the exhaust as possible and thus push the airbreathing mode to the max possible velocity, but hydrogen is fluffy and not great at providing thrust at the initial low speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
