Then I heard another, lower cat noise, and went around, turned the lights on, then went out to chase off another cat. I thought there were feathers all around Princess (that she was eating a bird), only to realize that it was her own fur. I knew what I was also seeing, but had my wife come to confirm it was indeed a pile of bowel. Hers. Wrapped her up in a towel, and took her to be put down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWife was not interested in talking to vet intern, so waited on vet surgeon to come in, then gave Princess a chance---wash off bowel, stick it in, close. If she lives, she gets to live. So far, so good. Cat lives. Kitty ICU, kitty step-down... kitty doesn\u0027t stand. They recheck films. Spinal injury they missed.
