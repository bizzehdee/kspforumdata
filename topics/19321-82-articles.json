Without induced velocities there are essentially no negative effects to canard designs and planes are slightly more statically pitch-stable than they should be, but are also less dynamically pitch-stable than they should be. Local variations in dynamic pressure would allow modeling deep stall for T-tail designs as well as better hypersonic modeling. Unfortunately, the only time I tried to model induced velocities in the current framework the lag went through the roof, so that basically necessitates a total recode to make things work better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD hasn\u0027t gotten in touch with me, probably because they either aren\u0027t considering how they would overhaul aerodynamics yet or because they\u0027re intending to overhaul it to be something different than what FAR is or because they\u0027re confident of their ability to code an aerodynamic model without me.
