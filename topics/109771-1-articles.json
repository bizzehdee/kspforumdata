The lunar regolith sifter is something I\u0027m still mulling over, obviously.\u003Cp\u003EThe main difference, as noted in the design document above, is the lack of \u0022holding\u0022 resources, for various reasons.

I\u0027m not talking about the resources themselves here but the placement definitions, where they show up in the world; I think we had a communication breakdown on this last time I approached you about it. There is simply no reason to have definitions for Kerbin when it doesn\u0027t even exist in the game once RSS gets a hold of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE: Although, tbh it may not even be worth the effort since people may want to use this with stock.

Very simple stuff. The converters are the interesting part of the mod, and you may have to truck certain resources along to make the process happen. So the difference is basically that I want very specific input mass and very specific output mass. I\u0027m assuming the stock system can handle that?\u003Cp\u003EIf stock is anything like Regolith then I will have very little in the way of coding to do and, if I do have to code, it will be very easy to extend.
