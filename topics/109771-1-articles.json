The aim is not total realism, as that would simply leave us with a few useful reactions for dealing with products shipped from Earth, but instead to extrapolate current and potential concepts and proposals that might be, or might have been had our species been more focused on space. Abstractions will have to be made for play flexibility and ease of use, but it can otherwise be considered to be a \u0022hard science\u0022 mod where everything has at least a solid basis in fact. You will find no magical unicorn poop herein.\n\nReal ISRU is *first and foremost* a mod for Realism Overhaul intended to be used with Real Solar System and Real Fuels, but it should work fairly well with KSP out-of-the-box alongside its dependencies. The Community Resource Pack has planetary resource definitions for many of the resources we depend on within this pack and if it doesn\u0027t have what you want, your desire is only a config file away.\n\n**Current Status**\n\nPlayable alpha. You can use certain reactions and parts on Venus/Eve, Earth/Kerbin, Mars/Duna, and Titan/Laythe. Right now the Kerbol system is mapped to Sol analogues for testing but when the mod is finalized we will remove the mappings and let the individual RSS/CRP planetary definitions stand on their own. This means that CRP and any other third party configs will eventually be responsible for Kerbol system resource placement.\n\nDr. Jet is working on some fantastic hex-style core frames with integral tanks to manage all of your equipment, along with an Elektron-alike water electrolysis unit and a resource tank to fit with it. You can see the development gallery below and check out the parts in-game.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

There are some placeholder tanks for ISRU while I square away configs for Firespitter Fuel Switch, Interstellar Fuel Switch, Modular Fuel Tanks, and Real Fuels; you can find them under the Utility tab in the VAB/SPH.\n\nSince Real ISRU will be used with Real Fuels we\u0027ll be integrating with CRP which means we\u0027ll have nearly all of the resources we need to begin with, aside from the three below, which have already been added to the mod:\n\n    C       Carbon          0.0021 (solid)CO      CarbonMonoxide  0.00000125NH3     Ammonia         0.000000769\n\nOnce this mod gets rolling I\u0027ll make a pull request to CRP to add these resources but, for now, they\u0027ll be custom.\n\nThere is one key abstraction for Real ISRU that will make modding easier; there will be no \u0022holding\u0022 resources, like \u0022regolith\u0022 or \u0022ice\u0022. Instead, collectors will be assumed to have the filtration/fractioning systems needed to pull in the raw elements from the environment and will be mass-, and heat-balanced accordingly. This avoids the problems of having \u0022MartianIce\u0022, \u0022MartianEquatorialRegolith\u0022, \u0022MartianPolarRegolith\u0022, \u0022CereanIce\u0022, etc... Once resources are brought into the craft and converted you will potentially need to liquify them for use as fuel (other resources will help with life support). The initial fuel scope is shown below:\n\n    Hydrogen    -\u003E      LqdHydrogen     0.00007085Oxygen      -\u003E      LqdOxygen       0.001141Methane     -\u003E      LqdMethane      0.00042561Ammonia     -\u003E      LqdAmmonia      0.0007021\n\nYou can also produce HTP (High Test Peroxide), NTO (Dinitrogen Tetroxide), and Kerosene (C12H26).\n\n**Future Plans**\n\nAdditional reactions:\n\n- Anthraquinone Process: H2 \u002B O2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 H2O2\n- HTP-Hydrazine Production: 2 H2O2 \u002B 4 C2H5COCH3 \u002B 4 NH3 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 4 H2O \u002B 4 C2H5COCH3 \u002B 2 N2H4\n- HTP Decomposition: 2 H2O2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 2 H2O \u002B O2\n- Anything else that represents a reasonable suggestion (in terms of equipment on-ship) or that has been proposed for ISRU will definitely be considered for this mod.\n\nYou will eventually be able to produce N2H4 (Hydrazine).\n\n- Additional converter configs.\n- Additional collector configs.\n- Liquifier configs.\n- Resource definitions for all bodies in RSS.\n    - Other solar systems will have their own, this mod will specifically work for RSS\n    - Our initial focus will be on atmospheric gasses and ice products.\n    - Asteroids will have to fall into the major classifications, perhaps the best place to start is to assume they\u0027re all C-type with water available for extraction.\n\n    [\\*] Part models, either custom made or selected and borrowed (with permission in all cases, despite license). Dr. Jet has already done some fantastic work in this area.\n\nWhere at all possible we will use stock systems and run off a ModuleManager-heavy setup, and I think this might be possible given the systems in stock.\n\nPlease note that this project will never itself broach the subject of off-planet construction or integrate with mods that deal in that. While immensely fun gameplay, mods like EPL simplify the processes, manpower, and infrastructure required to build off-planet facilities to such a degree that they simply cannot be considered \u0022realistic\u0022. Once the initial ISRU phase is complete work on greenhouses and algae farms will be considered, although at that point we\u0027d have to start modeling radiation, shielding, and health effects because getting people actually living off-planet for any length of time is Tough\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2.\n\nIf you\u0027d like to help out with the mod, please let me know, but be aware that this mod is specifically designed for RO/RF/RSS so if you\u0027re looking for stock/resize integration you will have to define planetary compositions outside of this thread/mod. I don\u0027t work especially fast myself but I\u0027ve had this on my mind for some time and am determined that it become A Thing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T17:16:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T06:17:35Z","Content":"Hey this sounds great - I was thinking to do something similar \u0027because I wanted to use it\u0027. I\u0027m happy to pitch in if you need extra hands - I\u0027ve not modelled anything, I\u0027ve only just started with using Module Manager to make some tweaked parts. I\u0027d been thinking about making some LH2 tanks as \u0027an intro to modelling\u0027 - but ISRU is what I really want.\n\nHere are some things that occurred to me as I was reading yr plan:\n\nHow about a stock-ish version (I imagine yr RSS is also RO?) (mainly they \u0027just\u0027 be different mass / recipe (power etc) but RO might need an actual powerful power source.\n\nIRL I read they were planing to use the \u0027left over\u0027 N2 after Sabatier etc as breathable buffer gas.\n\nWhat is the regolith sifter doing? baking O2 out of the regolith to combine with H2? Where there was regolith H2O (seems more and more a possibility) it could bake out the H2O directly? ( or use \u0027ore\u0027 container as \u0027regolith\u0027 container and bake the H2O out at a fixed plant. I see that goes against your \u0027no holding resource\u0027 plan - I don\u0027t understand the advantage - is it like you can use CRP to set H2O (say) content of regolith and avoid having \u0027WetRegolith\u0027 resource? that still lets you model lo water at the equator and higher at hi latitudes?)\n\nCan you do a PartModule that requires certain part(s) in order for others to function? e.g. you need refrigeration to have a non boil off H2 storage tank? though maybe one can do that give generators built into the tank that consume LH2 and produce H2 and another that is a chiller to re-condense the LH2\n\nHydrogen Peroxide can be a good RCS fuel if one was doing 2H20 -\u003E 2H2\u002BO2 - I mean sticking with a \u0027hydrogen ecosystem\u0027 rather than add N into the mix.\n\nSome of the \u0027gas intakes\u0027 I\u0027d read about IRL seemed pretty specific e.g freezing out the CO2 to make it pure - on the other hand some people want to use the ISRU chem reactions to tolerate the \u0027impurities\u0027 and as a side effect concentrate them for other processing.\n\nAre there any uses the heat from some of the exothermic reactions?"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T06:45:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How about a stock-ish version\n\nNo. Someone may take this work and re-do it for stock, or simply write an MM config, and it will probably work alright if someone added body resource definitions for stock, but this mod will not consider stock; it is purely for RO/RF/RSS. There are a wealth of ISRU mods for stock already.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E IRL I read they were planing to use the \u0027left over\u0027 N2 after Sabatier etc as breathable buffer gas.\n\nThe usage of N2 would depend on the life support mod. This one will purely concern itself with the gathering and conversion of resources.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What is the regolith sifter doing? baking O2 out of the regolith to combine with H2?\n\nEssentially, yes. Lunar regolith, and I think you could potentially use it on Mars, probably a few other bodies. Gathering straight H2O from ISRU is the job of an ice drill.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t understand the advantage - is it like you can use CRP to set H2O (say) content of regolith and avoid having \u0027WetRegolith\u0027 resource? that still lets you model lo water at the equator and higher at hi latitudes?)\n\nHow dense is Martian regolith? How dense is Cerean regolith? How does it vary by latitude and longitude? What is the makeup at certain latitudes and longitudes?\nHonestly I\u0027m not worried about holding resources and having additional parts to convert them because if we want to have a semblance of realism the holding resources would have to be quite numerous. The idea is to model the distribution and density of the resources across the body and then allow the specialized parts to extract them directly (mainly just O2 and H2O at this point, most everything else will be from atmospheric intakes).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Can you do a PartModule that requires certain part(s) in order for others to function? e.g. you need refrigeration to have a non boil off H2 storage tank? though maybe one can do that give generators built into the tank that consume LH2 and produce H2 and another that is a chiller to re-condense the LH2\n\nThat\u0027s out of scope, handled by Real Fuels.

There\u0027s a certain amount of abstraction going on to make this bearable to the modder and user already. It\u0027s interesting to note that intakes would be specific; I was mainly worried about additional part spam but it\u0027s probably the way to go.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Are there any uses the heat from some of the exothermic reactions?\n\nOut of scope. Maybe someone can make a Brayton-cycle mod or something, it\u0027s sorely needed for stuff like SAFE-400."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T07:30:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [1a] The Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction: **CO \u002B H2O \u002B Energy --\u003E CO2 \u002B H2**\n\u003E \n\u003E [1b] The Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) reaction: **CO2 \u002B H2 \u002B Energy --\u003E CO \u002B H2O**\n\u003E \n\u003E [2] The Sabatier Reaction: **CO2 \u002B 4 H2 --\u003E CH4 \u002B 2 H2O \u002B Energy**\n\u003E \n\u003E [3] Water Electrolysis: **2 H2O \u002B Energy --\u003E 2 H2 \u002B O2**\n\u003E \n\u003E [4] Methane Pyrolysis: **CH4 \u002B Energy --\u003E C (solid) \u002B 2 H2**\n\u003E \n\u003E [6] The Haber-Bosch Process: **N2 \u002B 3 H2 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC \u00E2\u20AC\u2122 2 NH3**\n\u003E \n\u003E [9] Carbon Dioxide Decomposition: **2 CO2 \u002B Energy --\u003E 2 CO \u002B O2**\n\u003E \n\u003E [10] [Solid Oxide Electrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Oxygen_ISRU_Experiment): **2 CO2 --\u003E 2CO \u002B O2**\n\nI have implemented them all in [KSPI Extended](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111159-WIP-0-90-KSP-Interstellar-Extended) IRSU already.

The base converter handles stock\u0027s ISRU, asteroid mining, generator code, etc.\n\nAwesome, thanks for confirming. I had played around with extending Regolith (wrote an He3 orbital collector as a proof-of-concept) and I expected the stock system to be just as simple.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So the question I would have - how would RealISRU differ from the stock ISRU process?\n\nIn truth, probably not very much, that\u0027s why I wanted to use the stock systems. Real ISRU will concentrate much more on atmospheric resources since they are far easier to access and work with on the (real) spacecraft scale, but ice drilling is very much A Thing. The lunar regolith sifter is something I\u0027m still mulling over, obviously.\nThe main difference, as noted in the design document above, is the lack of \u0022holding\u0022 resources, for various reasons. So we just access the resources directly, pump them into a tank, and let the converters do interesting things to them.\n\nAtmospheric composition would be uniform enough to not worry about tremendously, unless I wanted to write some sort of Martian \u0022methane plume\u0022 feature, but crustal resources will have specific concentrations.\n\nAlso, I\u0027d have to blow out any stock and CRP resource definitions in order to put our own, body-specific ones in place. I already have a method to do that with CRP/Regolith using Module Manager and I think I can adapt it for stock after a cursory glance. I\u0027m not talking about the resources themselves here but the placement definitions, where they show up in the world; I think we had a communication breakdown on this last time I approached you about it. There is simply no reason to have definitions for Kerbin when it doesn\u0027t even exist in the game once RSS gets a hold of it.\n\nE: Although, tbh it may not even be worth the effort since people may want to use this with stock. Previously in RSS we had to use the stock planet names which would have caused collisions in resource placement; with Kopernicus that may not even be a problem.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And it may be helpful to separate harvesting differences vs. conversion differences. then I\u0027ll be in a better position to answer questions.\n\nHarvesting is literally pulling resources from the atmosphere and some limited resources from the ice and regolith, if available. Very simple stuff. The converters are the interesting part of the mod, and you may have to truck certain resources along to make the process happen. So the difference is basically that I want very specific input mass and very specific output mass. I\u0027m assuming the stock system can handle that?\nIf stock is anything like Regolith then I will have very little in the way of coding to do and, if I do have to code, it will be very easy to extend.
