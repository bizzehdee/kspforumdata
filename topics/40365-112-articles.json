That engine is already easily the most overpowered one available, it even unlocks in the tech tree at the same time as the reactor upgrades that make it easier to meet its rather excessive power requirements and only has a relatively small drawback in that you can\u0027t use it near your other ships/kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason that it needs LiquidFuel though is to actually get some thrust from it. Even with a fission engine, you can design a method of using the nuclear particles directly to get thrust (fission fragment rocket), exhaust velocity goes up to 10% of the speed of light or so, while thrust comes down to 20N or so if you\u0027re lucky. To get even 10kN, which is still not a useable engine in KSP, you\u0027re looking at needing something like a 1.5TW reactor on your rocket at that exhaust velocity. So, every engine presented in the mod, uses some scheme for spreading out the energy from nuclear/antimatter reactions into a lot more hydrogen propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat gives you a lot more with a much lower exhaust velocity, so you become less efficient with respective to propellant but your rocket now has useable thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xentoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xentoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo power it you need yet to put on at least 5 normal Reactors and 6 Electro generators (and even than it does not support it stable). (I play with the R\u0026amp;D Tree and there are Antimatter Reactors far behind this engene so... \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou only need 1 reactor and 1 generator, provided you use the biggest reactor and generator and they are both upgraded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kenken244\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kenken244\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am having a strange problem when using the modular fuel system patch with the thermal turbojet. When it is in hydrogen fuel mode, the rightclick dialogue claims that the engine is using 0.00032 units per second, but the actual usage is 0.86 units per second, which is incredibly high for such a low thrust and high isp.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty much expected when using RealFuels. LiquidH2 has a really tiny density, meaning that you need to add lots and lots of hydrogen fuel tanks - much more than you would need with LiquidFuel in order to get anywhere. Of course, where the difference arises is mass, you can happily use several fuel tanks of Hydrogen in RealFuels for every liquid fuel tank you would have to use because it won\u0027t be any heavier. Basically, RealFuels won\u0027t change the mass of your rockets much but it will change their volume.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-03T12:56:58Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2013 12:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sanoj688","CreatedById":83090,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T12:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay so I had my duna science lab Working for over a year..

Since antimatter is supposed to be mined up in space or generated in the lab module... we usually start with 0 antimatter to run the antimatter reactors instead of nuclear ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, if we connect a single antimatter reactor with a thermojet engine, I guess something positively feedbacking the thermal power and fires up the engine and the engine works like the antimatter reactor is running at its peak efficiency. Of course, this is not logical since the reactor should not generate any heat due to lack of antimatter. But if one reactor-one engine setup is there, it generates cheat like power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if we install one of more antimatter reactors and engines attached to it, only ONE engine operates the bugged (or cheat) way. It happens in VAB vessels as well. But does not happen when you\u0027re using plasma ion engines since they are run by Megajoules instead of direct heat. Thus, no antimatter -\u0026gt; no heat -\u0026gt; no Megajoules -\u0026gt; no power for engine, and it makes perfect sense. But for thermal jet or thermal nozzle engines, no antimatter -\u0026gt; no heat -\u0026gt; but the engine has prevent flameout mode ON -\u0026gt; game logic thinks reactor must be running -\u0026gt; runs the antimatter reactor -\u0026gt; generates heat -\u0026gt; runs engine -\u0026gt; heat dissipates -\u0026gt; no heat again but the engine still has prevent flameout ON -\u0026gt; ... and so on(and this faulty logic works on ONE engine ONLY.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we cannot start the antimatter containment filled from ground, running antimatter engines from surface is not what the author intended, I think.
