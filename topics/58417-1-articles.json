Obviously you couldn\u0027t show any detail of the object due to the amount of processing power that would take, but I still think it would be awesome to be able to look up at the Kerbal sky and see your ships in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T22:32:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recall this being brought up before. It\u0027s a good idea, and I think that implementing a simple *something* would be very doable. Just a point of light would suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
