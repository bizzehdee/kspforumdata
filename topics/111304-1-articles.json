You might want to start using that Launch Escape System with this installed.\n\nDISCLAIMER - The intention of this mod is to destroy your spacecraft. Use with caution!\n\n**About**\n\nNASA requires that human-rated spacecraft have a probability of loss on ascent of no more than 1 in 500. The Kerbals of planet Kerbin think of this requirement as silly, so they have instead adopted a less strict policy of a loss on ascent of no more than 1 in 50 for their Kerbal Space Program. In fact, to save funds on safety measures, they have made their spacecraft to fail exactly 1 in 50 times.\n\nThis mod is not meant to compete with other part failure mods (I personally enjoy using DangIt! with Entropy), but to be an alternative for those that want that living on the edge feel for launches without having to worry about part failures and repairs beyond the initial launch.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Seems to be some audio FX issue with multiple explosions simultaneously. This was recorded with a pre-release version, but no changes have been made since except for the addition of the settings.\n\n**Current Features**\n\n- Launch has a small chance (1 in 50) of failure with explosions during ascent.\n- Failure originates in an engine, which will begin to overheat and have extra thrust applied to cause instability.\n- The abort action group can be set to auto-trigger once the initial failure occurs (custom setting; see below).\n- Explosion has a chance to propagate to surrounding parts, varying how catastrophic the failure is.\n- Tanks containing fuel are more likely to explode.\n- Failure checks end once the spacecraft has reached space (IRL, disasters mostly happen during ascent anyways). This is to prevent frustration for longer missions, to reduce the complexity of the mod, and to lessen the CPU usage for game ticks.\n- Custom settings (please see the [README](https://github.com/stevehead/ksp-KerbalLaunchFailure/blob/master/README.md) for instructions).\n\n**Possible Upcoming Features**\n\n- More \u0022descriptive\u0022 flight logs using optional and random technobabble.\n- More organic method of propagating failures using the stock heating model when it becomes more finalized.\n- Optional random failure of heat shield during re-entry, maybe.\n- Maybe more varying types of failures specific to ascent (e.g. loss of yaw control).\n\n**Thanks**\n\nMuch thanks to Ippo and Coffeeman for some inspiration behind a couple places in the code, and stupid\\_chris, whose source code on RealChutes helped me learn how to do the settings.\n\n**Links**\n\n[Download from Kerbal Stuff](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/856/Kerbal%20Launch%20Failure)https://github.com/stevehead/ksp-KerbalLaunchFailure/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n\nDownload from GitHub\n\n[Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/stevehead/ksp-KerbalLaunchFailure)\n\n[Original development thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117538)\n\n**Changelog**\n\n    v1.0.0- First production release.- Added custom settings.v0.1.0- Alpha release.- The part that starts the failure overheats and overthrusts to allow people time to react.- Auto abort action group trigger added.v0.0.1- Alpha test release for KSP 1.0.\n\n**License**\n\nThis work is released under the GNU General Public License: [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T21:22:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stevehead**\n  \nthanks"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:42:43Z","Content":"WHOA\n\nThis is GREAT!\n\nI\u0027ve been secretly hoping for a mod like this!\n\nN1, get ready to fail!"},{"CreatedByName":"Beetlecat","CreatedById":92207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T20:44:02Z","Content":"Awesome!\n\nThough the obvious joke is that we hardly need a mod to introduce random launch failure situations, but I \\*do\\* get the difference. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIt\u0027ll be good to actually \\*need\\* the abort button."},{"CreatedByName":"Exposure","CreatedById":188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T21:03:42Z","Content":"Does this apply to spaceplanes that launch via the runway as well?"},{"CreatedByName":"stevehead","CreatedById":137745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T21:16:38Z","Content":"Link to Kerbal Stuff download now available.

The config text seemed to imply that it would generate failures on any planet with an atmosphere, but it\u0027s a little unclear.\n\nTo be honest I don\u0027t know. I designed the mod so that whenever the \u0022onLaunch\u0022 game event occurs, it will start the failure script if the current planet has an atmosphere. I programmed it that way in hopes my mod will just work if other mods such as EL actually triggers this \u0022onLaunch\u0022 event, but if they don\u0027t, then my mod does nothing (i.e. doesn\u0027t break anything). I have never played with EL, but I have been wanting to get into it; once I do, I\u0027ll definitely look at compatibility if there currently is none.\n\nIn a nutshell: it \u0022should\u0022 work, but it may not.\n\nEdit:\n\nThere may be issues launching from orbit around a planet that has an atmosphere, which could involve instant explosions (does EL allow in-orbit construction and launches? cannot remember). Anyways, if that is the case I have a fix already in mind that I can add for the next release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T23:11:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 11:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stevehead**"},{"CreatedByName":"politas","CreatedById":119649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T09:35:53Z","Content":"On your idea for heat shield failures, you could have a heat shield failure occur when launching, be able to be discovered by a kerbal examining the heat shield on EVA, and then only take effect during re-entry.

Of course, it\u0027s pretty hard to examine a heat shield covered up by a decoupler and shroud, so the only easy opportunity for examining it is when you\u0027re already on a re-entry trajectory.\n\nI see three possible ways of doing it without getting out of scope of my mod (i.e. repairs and such):\n\n1) The easiest solution would just have a chance that the ablator resource on a heat shield gets reduced by a random percentage. Of course this would be easily visible in the resources tab.\n\n2) Program a new part module that would have a chance to attach itself to the heat shield during ascent. The part module would display a message such as \u0022Heat shield damaged\u0022 if you are able to inspect the part during EVA. Then I would detect when the spacecraft is reentering or undergoes a certain amount of stress (e.g. g-forces), and trigger the part module to reduce the ablation resource as in 1).\n\n3) A combination of 1) and 2) to vary the possibilities.\n\nUnfortunately, the stock reentry heating is underwhelming at the time, so a reduction in ablator won\u0027t make much of a difference with non-interplanetary returns.\n\nI like the idea of 2) since I have been thinking of converting a part of my code to a part module for the engine failures already. Doing so solves some of the issues I foresee going forward with new features and it will allow me to develop a core API to build more types of failures (or even scenarios) off of that people can decide to include or not... I wouldn\u0027t mind having an Apollo 13 style scenario that has a pre-set type of failures; something like this could be manually triggered for those that want to role play the situation."},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T23:36:26Z","Content":"@stevehead, I think you should stick with the core functionality of launch failures.

In my last post I mentioned changing the code around a bit. I\u0027m thinking of separating the core functionality out of what I currently have so that I (or anyone for that matter) can create their own failure plugins that would be loaded. This mod (Kerbal Launch Failure) would itself become an extension of that core API. Just some thoughts. More launch failure types are on their way though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)... there really needs to be an evil-grin emote.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Great mod, but I have just one suggestion that should be ridiculously hard to make (let\u0027s be honest here ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)).

I\u0027m not sure about the sandbox solution since so many people have different play styles that greatly vary the time between launches, but I do like the career mode suggestion. It makes sense to have some sort of reliability increase over time, but I don\u0027t want to over-complicate the mod or overlap other failure/reliability mods too much such as [Test Flight](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109901). I\u0027ve got to find the right balance between features and simplicity in addition to the extensibility I had mentioned in other comments.

More of an incentive to research it sooner ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). Death isn\u0027t guaranteed with a failure. During my tests, I\u0027ve had such a wide variety of explosions, but only a handful resulted in death. Plus you have to do ~114 launches to have a 90% chance of at least one failure on the default settings. The chances of Kerbals dying before you get the LES is quite small. If you are that concerned, you can always make your own makeshift abort system somehow... as long as you can get the capsule separated from the rest of the craft (the failures only propagate to parts that are attached), though that doesn\u0027t stop other randomness that my mod has no control over such as part collisions. I would suggest girders \u002B sepratrons (old school stock method) for a makeshift LES, but sepratrons are a higher tech level than the LES.\n\nAnd, overall, I\u0027m pleased that this mod has been well received so far!
