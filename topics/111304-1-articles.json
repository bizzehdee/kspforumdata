The Kerbals of planet Kerbin think of this requirement as silly, so they have instead adopted a less strict policy of a loss on ascent of no more than 1 in 50 for their Kerbal Space Program. In fact, to save funds on safety measures, they have made their spacecraft to fail exactly 1 in 50 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is not meant to compete with other part failure mods (I personally enjoy using DangIt! with Entropy), but to be an alternative for those that want that living on the edge feel for launches without having to worry about part failures and repairs beyond the initial launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EMoz4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Death isn\u0027t guaranteed with a failure. During my tests, I\u0027ve had such a wide variety of explosions, but only a handful resulted in death. Plus you have to do ~114 launches to have a 90% chance of at least one failure on the default settings. The chances of Kerbals dying before you get the LES is quite small. If you are that concerned, you can always make your own makeshift abort system somehow... as long as you can get the capsule separated from the rest of the craft (the failures only propagate to parts that are attached), though that doesn\u0027t stop other randomness that my mod has no control over such as part collisions.
