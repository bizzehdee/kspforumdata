That comes primarily from the mount, which needs to move when you want it to and stay still when you don\u0027t! Remember 50, 100, 200 times magnification means every little shake is also magnified 50, 100, 200 times. If you buy a Newtonian reflector, where the eyepiece comes out the side of the tube, then I advise an alt-azimuth mount, one where the scope points up and down, left and right. Newtonian reflectors on equatorial mounts tend to point the eyepiece in stupid directions as you move the scope around. If you\u0027re considering a computerised \u0022GoTo\u0022 scope, you also need to think about how easy it is to get set up and use the computer control, as well as battery life - you\u0027re usually best off with a rechargeable battery pack because most of them guzzle batteries otherwise and the scope can\u0027t be aimed manually without damaging the mount. Also consider size and weight, it\u0027s not much good having a telescope that\u0027s just too darn big and heavy to drag outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next most important thing is aperture, the width of the main lens or mirror. More aperture means seeing fainter objects and more detail. Useful maximum magnification is 50x per inch of aperture, but know that most observing is done at low and medium magnification anyway. A 3 inch scope will show the basics. 4 or 5 inches is better, but still considered a small scope. 6 or better 8 inches and you\u0027re into \u0022large telescope\u0022 by amateur astronomer standards. 10 inches and above starts to get heavy, bulky, and expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T19:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, my gut says a bigish dobsonian.

I have an Orion very similar to what you are looking at. I also have an 8\u0022 Dobsonian. The Dob is definitely easier to set up, and slowly slewing by hand becomes second nature\u00A0rather quickly. It is kind of big when hauling in a car. I will say, finding objects is a steep learning curve much like learning\u00A0KSP. Avoid an equatorial mount. They are extremely frustrating to learn. I trashed mine. Alt/Az is so much easier.\u00A0GOTO is nice once you get it level and aligned (different every time you use it). The Orion doesn\u0027t gather as much light and is more limited on magnification than the dob but honestly in our viewing conditions both work well. I think you would be happy with the 130. Just know it is not a planet killer. As mentioned, you need a good refractor for that. The trade off is the field of view is extremely narrow, limiting how much sky you see at once. Many deep sky object are surprisingly pretty big. All that said, my personal favorite way to observe is a decent set of binoculars. Mine are Oberwerk 15x70, so the lens is bigger than your present scope. This is at (or over) the upper limit of what most people can use hands free. When I want a steadier view I mount it on\u00A0a tripod. Scanning the Milky Way is way fun with binos.\u00A0\u00A0Quick scan on Amazon prices these at $159. I paid $99 back in the day. Finally, the best advice I can offer is find a local stargazer club and attend a star party or two.
