The point of the challenge is to use a Gemini replica, Apollo replica, or stock craft in a novel way. Build the MOL, perform the planned Apollo venus flyby, go to duna with a Learstar, whatever! The only requirements are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou must actually carry out the mission.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe mission must be novel, no using an Apollo replica for a Mun landing, etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe mission can be one that was planned in the real world.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTo qualify as a Gemini replica, the craft must seat two kerbals, look like a Gemini capsule, and be able to survive re-entry. It must be smaller than a mk1-2 pod, and must have a docking port.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTo qualify as an Apollo replica, the craft must seat three kerbals, look like Apollo, and be able to survive re-entry. A good guideline is that it should be about the size of a mk1-2 pod. It can be a mk1-2 pod. It must have a docking port.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou may use any of the proposed modifications to either craft, such as making a paragliding Gemini.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is no score, but if I receive too many entries to list conveniently, I will pick five finalists in each category to display. The remaining entries will be in spoiler tags.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMy entry coming soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
