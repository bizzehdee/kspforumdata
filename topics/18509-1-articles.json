BUT.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran into a bug. It appears that landing legs, when mounted partially on the Aerospike, are prone to self destruct!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a good landing... but after using the map button and then coming back, the engine/leg popped off!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KJyCM6Ljji8/UERg2L8AA-I/AAAAAAAAAKw/RhCF1-z8SE8/s731/screenshot125.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot125.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I managed to achieve orbit around the Mun, even with the engine cluster fully out of balance! (Skills, baby!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then it happened again... I went to the map view, and on return to normal view, I heard the engines and legs blow off! I suspect that it has to do with the legs being partially on the aerospike... but there went my engines, and my ticket home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how I found the second bug... collisions don\u0027t seem to work in accelerated time. I devised a daring rescue of my stranded Kerbonaut. After matching orbits, I managed to capture the capsule:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CdPXirKdxAs/UERg_KsXVZI/AAAAAAAAAK4/DGurA-1O-nk/s731/screenshot131.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot131.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Xbo0ODNHFHI/UERhFZp_U0I/AAAAAAAAALA/JDkckkSSUjo/s731/screenshot129.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot129.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then made a burn to take us back home... and following that, I entered time acceleration for the long trip, watching the captured capsule closely. As soon as I entered accelerated time, the capsule started drifting through my capture arms!!! All collision detection was apparently disabled. So of course I turned off accel, and that was a mistake. As soon as I went to 1x time, collision detection kicked back in, and with the capsule now encroaching into the rescue craft, it was violently ejected.... Crap! So I had to chase it down, and capture it again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I was successful and set the capsule to return to Kerban... and the rescue craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is where the biggest bug came in... I had two craft entering the atmosphere rather close to each other... and I hopped into the capsule to open the chute... worked great, then I needed to hop out, and into the rescue craft capsule... and IT WOULDN\u0022T ALLOW ME TO! Some error about not being able to change craft while in the atmosphere?!?! Needless to say, not getting in the rescue craft prevented me from arming the chute... and the craft was lost \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the lesson here is, if you need to bring two craft in...place the other one in orbit, and come in the next go around...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the best way to pass along these bugs/experiences to the KSP developers?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-04T04:41:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2012 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Ryder\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"voneiden","CreatedById":38803,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T11:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe post below is based on assumptions.\u003C/strong\u003E Feel free to correct me if I\u0027m guessing wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I can\u0027t verify this, but to me it seems aerospike part config file does not define the breakingTorque - this essentially means that Kerbal uses some default value for breakingTorque. The landing legs cause some torque on the aerospike, which I suppose, if the default value is very low, can make the aerospikes prone to tearing off like that. \u003Cstrong\u003EMight be a bug.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When under time acceleration, physics are not simulated. \u003Cstrong\u003ENot a bug\u003C/strong\u003E. The next version 0.17 will feature (was it up to 4x?) physical time acceleration. This means also that you cannot switch crafts when flying in atmosphere, because the engine simulates precise newtonian physics only for the active vehicle (and its debris?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther orbiting crafts are simulated simply through calculation of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eorbital elements\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why physics is not actively simulated, especially under time compression is basically a performance issue. If under 2x time compression you wish to maintain same mathematical accuracy as under normal game speed, you need to compute twice the amount of calculations during a given time. This might be still possible, but what about 100x time acceleration? If the computer can\u0027t keep up, one has to give up on mathematical accuracy. This quickly leads to unstable orbits that end up being hyperbolic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/forumdisplay.php/42-Bug-Reports\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBug reports go here\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kacperrutka26","CreatedById":18849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-03T11:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy did you rescue him like that?
