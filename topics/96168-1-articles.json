It\u0027s all or nothing with RCS/SAS, at least for now. It\u0027s possible there\u0027s a mod out there somewhere, but in my experience unless you\u0027re flying some absurdly large ship, it shouldn\u0027t be a serious issue to just leave both on while docking. It\u0027s rare that I don\u0027t have craploads of spare RCS fuel if I add RCS tanks to the ship - if I don\u0027t, then usually I can dock with just the capsule\u0027s fuel, but the margin\u0027s generally too close for my liking.
