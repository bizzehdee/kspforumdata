I just thought you meant they didn\u0027t update when you saved the Preset. If they\u0027re bad enough that you have to switch scenes after a tech is finished, then that\u0027s pretty serious and I need to fix that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna list all the sources of upgrades (that I can think of at the moment) and maybe we can pinpoint why the upgrades fluctuate so much. I\u0027m going to assume the default config\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Starting upgrades. That\u0027s 15 in Career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Tech Tree (likely the source of most issues). 1 per node that is unlocked (note: researching does not equal unlocked)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. One per item in the Tech List.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Temporary upgrades from researching tech. You get one upgrade after a tech finishes research that is lost on scene change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Purchasing upgrades with science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Purchasing upgrades with funds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Getting upgrades from clearing out the part inventory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issues are probably with 2, 3, and 4. The way I get the number of unlocked nodes in the tech tree is with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etotal \u002B= ResearchAndDevelopment.Instance.snapshot.GetData().GetNodes(\u0022Tech\u0022).Length;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich is a really stupid way of doing it but the actual Tech nodes are in a private variable and I have zero way of asking KSP for a list of unlocked tech nodes as a result. This sometimes returns zero for some reason I haven\u0027t figured out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 and 4 are related to each other (and to 2). Since researching a tech node doesn\u0027t count as it being complete, the above method of getting the unlocked tech nodes won\u0027t count any in-progress nodes. 3 and 4 work together to count those. 3 is pretty straightforward, 1 upgrade for every item in the Tech list (which doesn\u0027t include building upgrades, btw). 4 is the odd ball that accounts for the time after a tech node finishes and is removed from the Tech List (lowering the number of upgrades by one) and when the game is saved and the R\u0026amp;D instance updates (increasing the number of upgrades by one). With 4, you get an upgrade in a temporary variable that resets to zero on scene change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the temporary upgrades didn\u0027t reset to 0 like they were supposed to? I\u0027m afraid they might only reset if you switch to the Main Menu. That could definitely be at fault. It doesn\u0027t account for the huge negatives in upgrades that people are seeing sometimes (issues reading the tech tree I think), but might account for the smaller amounts that I think I\u0027ve seen reported.
