I\u0027m really hoping someone can point me to any instances of files that KSP might create / use so I can investigate them for corruption / replace them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m running into a serious issue with Kopernicus and I\u0027ve got no idea how to fix it. Things were working fine until last night, running the most recent stable version of Kopernicus on KSP 1.11.1. Then after an 8 hour session the game crashed... hard... I got some blank error messages with progress bars that did nothing except show that they were from Unity and one notification that there had been an overflow of some type before finally forcing me to alt-f4 / end processes to get rid of the messages. Anyway, ever since then, whenever I try to load a save from within the game, this is what I\u0027m presented with:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fztSQ4k.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fztSQ4k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wi0vVwz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wi0vVwz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first image where \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is underground is what always happens on the first reload, the second is usually what happens if I try to reload a second time, though sometimes the terrain is so low that you can see water below the floating space center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, these are from a bare bones install with just Kopernicus, ModularFlightIntegrator, and Module Manager and KSP installed. I\u0027ve tried reinstalling all of them, including KSP more than once, always with the same result. Additionally, I get the same results if I try to roll back Kopernicus and MFI to the bleeding edge version I\u0027d been using before the stable release. That all said, whats more interesting / frustrating about this is that it doesn\u0027t seem to be restricted to my main KSP install, but instead it affects \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E KSP installs on my system, even a completely fresh install made after all of this started with freshly downloaded KSP and Kopernicus archives. And that\u0027s where I\u0027m fresh out of ideas on how to fix this... I\u0027m not familiar with anything other than logs that KSP stores outside of its home directory and I don\u0027t know of anything at all that Kopernicus might store elsewhere that could have become corrupted, so I\u0027m really hoping someone who knows more about the way Kopernicus / KSP works can help me sort out what might be going wrong here because its preventing me from playing my main save as I\u0027m both afraid it could further corrupt if I try to press forward and the mission I was about to launch was a rover to drive around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S1zAyZwAQVDM6I9CyWc8ft3B9p2ofDBi/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELogs\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kU2CCew5giqmMXuFaqWxHTv_dxyrYCAh/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKopernicus Generated Logs\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Just to be clear, I only get these results when Kopernicus is installed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-10T09:27:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2021 09:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rambow_Ninja94","CreatedById":210641,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-05T16:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry running the games without any mods, then re-installing them 1 by 1.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou may find that one of the mods (probably \u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003EKopernicus\u003C/span\u003E) is out of date.
