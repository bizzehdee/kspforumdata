I thought for sure there\u0027d be some need to tweak the CFG. Some weird code issue that needed to be resolved. Some weirdness I\u0027d have to ask Devo about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOPE! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the basic parts for the Wayland Eagle work JUST FINE. And - the mods that I made for them ALSO work just fine. Even the modded cockpit interior with the FASA Gemini cockpit IVA works perfectly. Check it - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H0Pj2jB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H0Pj2jB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(You can tell it\u0027s KSP .25 because I have the new volumetric clouds from the E.V.E. pack and you can see them in these screenshots)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t even download new copies of the Eagle components. I just pulled the parts files directly from my .23 folder straight into .25. Boom. No muss, no fuss. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only minor issue I noticed is that the Gear no longer automatically links to the \u0022G\u0022 key. But that was easily fixable by just adding the Eagle\u0027s Gear pods to the Gear action group. After that - works perfectly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Eagle on the testing rig retracting the gear) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Kn4u4e6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Kn4u4e6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the same issues that the Eagle had before still exist - mainly the landing gear bug (that\u0027s why I started out on that test rig above). She\u0027s just as stable (or not) as she ever was. Which basically means that as always, you really don\u0027t want to fly the Eagle completely manually. Always fly it with Mechjeb assist. (But don\u0027t trust Mechjeb to land!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there are some issues with some of the other mods that have made up my Eagle Mission Pods. I\u0027m having some issues getting the game to work with the LLL Parts. Lackluster himself seems to have had enough issues he got frustrated and stopped updating his parts, which is a real shame. But others in that thread seem to have done some work figuring out what works and what doesn\u0027t and doing some updates for .25. So I\u0027m hoping to get that resolved. What I\u0027m going to do is concentrate on loading up ONLY the most necessary parts from LLL and making sure each one works without making the game crash. (At least not crashing any more than it already does, anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming I can get that resolved, then I\u0027ll make an updated parts, mods and pods package which I\u0022ll update in my signature link. I\u0027ll include everything needed to insert the Eagles and pods into the game in Sandbox mode. I have no clue about how to tweak the code to make the Eagle parts appear in career mode with the tech tree - so don\u0027t bother asking. If YOU want to take a try at it, and you\u0027re successful, by all means let me know how to mod the code and I\u0027ll add that to the package as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also need to find the latest version of quantum struts and see if that will work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - Devo - I registered over at your site. I\u0027ll be downloading the Oblivion pod for testing (and also to see if there\u0027s any mods to the code you made that might be usable or portable over to the Eagle parts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hey - I\u0027m just happy the basic parts for the Eagle work! They didn\u0027t get broken at all!

I don\u0027t care if no one uses it or likes it LOL... but I want to finish this thing. I have become such a better modeller thanks to KSP and even the Sulaco has been improved upon and improved upon many times over the years now, probably more hours put into that than any mod i\u0027ve made - but it still might be a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t know what do make next to be honest, I did the drone and bubble ship and that drained me a bit, mainly because they were such a pain to make aerodynamic and fly like the movie, ie the gimbal in the Bubbleship took days to model, boolean operation after boolean operation... cutting cylinders out of spheres etc... ergh. But.. end result was pretty close to the movie so was happy with that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.. any great suggestions? any ships you think could be made relatively easily or would serve a decent purpose to KSP? the LackLuster cargo bays were a perfect fit for the Eagle, so thats why I never finished my ones, his are excellent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-11T07:13:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2015 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Devo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T07:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just good to hear you\u0027re back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T12:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you could release the Pegasus X-3 as it is currently, and then we could help you fix any eventual problems with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, and something I\u0027d really like; a lower stack node for the mech-pod, and perhaps a docking port/parachute hybrid too.
