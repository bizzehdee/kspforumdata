Liftoff smoothly and straight up and start to really accelerate to full speed as you clear through the most dense lower part of atmosphere, and after you pick some more acceleration, about half the way out of atmosphere start to perform gravity turn (also smoothly and with no rush), also it is better to star go at LKO not lower 100km and at best 150km, as altitude of 150km is the easiest to achieve without making any mistakes. Basicly do not be a rushing buffoon and use a bit of that brain of yours =)"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T20:15:00Z","Content":"Bill is gone!"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T20:19:48Z","Content":"So disappointed to see that ugly white line on the horizon."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T20:27:22Z","Content":"My god.
