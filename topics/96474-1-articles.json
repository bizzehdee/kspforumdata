When I forcequit and restarted KSP, everything worked fine except that the new/save/load buttons in the VAB didn\u0027t work. After a little research I found that the problem was an error in the creation of the .craft file leading to KSP bugging out whenever it would attempt to preload that .craft file (such as inside the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution was to look at all your VAB .craft files (located somewhere like /\u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022/saves/$PlayerName/ships/VAB) and delete the malformed .craft file. Probably it is a lot smaller than the others, disproportionately smaller for its estimated part count than it should be, or created more recently than your other ships. If you suspect several files, move them out of your VAB folder, run KSP, and add them back in one at a time until you find the offender. Good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
