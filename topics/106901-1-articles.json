I actually think our new small landing gear, the fixed and steerable versions, almost reflect this sort of technology. After gaining a basic grasp on low-level flight and collecting Science, players would get access to jet propulsion, be able to break the sound barrier, and fly to the edge of space (maybe with some experimental plane rocket engines! X-15, anybody? ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)) and learn about how to handle craft at speeds and in low-drag situations. Then the player would be granted rocket technology and capsules to fly in space. Then the game would go on like normal.\n\nImmediately, I DO see the problem with this being Kerbal *Space* Program, and acknowledge that the majority of users will want to get to space as soon as possible. But still, the idea is there.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Maybe there could be a mod to rearrange the tree to make jets first, then unmanned tech, and THEN manned space tech?"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:49:44Z","Content":"Here you are: \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80977-WIP-KAP-Kerbin-s-Age-of-Pioneers-%28A-Career-Mode-Overhaul%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80977-WIP-KAP-Kerbin-s-Age-of-Pioneers-%28A-Career-Mode-Overhaul%29)\n\nNo idea what the current status of this mod is, but it sound interesting."},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:50:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Immediately, I DO see the problem with this being Kerbal *Space* Program, and acknowledge that the majority of users will want to get to space as soon as possible.

We would get turboprops and the equivalents for long range arctic exploration (more atmospheric aircraft contracts needed), simple jets for record breaking (more atmospheric aircraft contracts needed!), simple rockets for Me 163 Comet record flights/X-something suborbital flights and V2-like experiments and then all the associated wing and air intake parts. It would also require some oval fuselage sections to match the \u0027era\u0027 (something KSP doesn\u0027t actually show, even though the buildings clearly get more flashy).\n\nCould be good. Then again, turbopropping to places could take a lot of time. The early jets would have a shorter range to balance out their thrust/speed advantages.\n\nAdvantages, however:\n\n- quite a lot of parts to pick from, early game, thus enabling more creativity in how to approach the first few steps.\n\n- new atmospheric flight engines. Everybody likes that.\n\n- varied tasks and challenges with a few different possible approaches early on - that\u0027s kind of what KSP is about.\n\n- early rockets.\n\n- \u0027era\u0027 progression, reflecting how real space programs evolved from experimental military aviation to civilian rocketry.\n\nIf I could do modeling and animation, I would totally attempt to mod this into the game. But I am just a humble texturer...\n\nI don\u0027t necessarily think biplanes would be a good starting point though because there wouldn\u0027t be a whole lot of different things you could *do* that would make for consistently fun and varied gameplay early on. And because the contract and science possibilities (due to range, speed, maximum altitude etc) would be even more limited if you\u0027re flying around in Sopwith Camels, you would probably blow through those early tiers so fast that they wouldn\u0027t offer much substance anyway.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T05:54:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 05:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aanker**"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T06:27:41Z","Content":"\u003E - new atmospheric flight engines.

Imagine the length of the career and how much grind it would have. As for atmospheric flight engines, as far as I\u0027m concerned, an electric propeller for use in Duna and Eve plus a wing covered in solar panels to power it is enough for me, as far as additional atmospheric engines are concerned.\nMods could turn KSP into a sandbox flight simulator, and they already do to a point.

They were using stuff like B-52 bombers and later even the SR-71 for their own purposes. It seems to me, at least, as if atmospheric flight experimentation goes hand in hand with a space program, especially since as speed and performance gradually increase we approach the boundary of space and the line gets blurred.\n\nIt would also make for an overall nicer transition to spaceplanes than just \u0027boom! Space!\u0027.\n\nBut I did also dedicated a (short) paragraph to the prospect of turning this into a mod. I think it would work fine as that. But I don\u0027t see the problem with pitching it as a stock suggestion, it\u0027s not exactly going to happen with the next hotfix really.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t think it would be too grindy if you can use props, jets and early rocketry to carry out a variety of early missions... grinding to me implies performing the same task over and over again for some distant goal, here you would have multiple means of advancing in multiple areas.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T06:36:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aanker**"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:47:46Z","Content":"As much I\u0027d love to explore Kerbal\u0027s history of flight I think it would be more than enough scope for a whole new game in it\u0027s own right. \n\nSpecially seeing they need to put a lot of work into Kerbal lots of new airports and cities, places to go, sights to see. Ground and runways would need to have texture and grip not just colour difference and crazy bumps in the middle of them.

There\u0027s not a great deal you can do with early planes in stock right now - and those \u0027early\u0027 planes are fairly advanced jets. Beginning with prop-planes would make the early game very dull, or as Aanker says, something you blow through quickly on the way to the current technological starting point.\n\nIt would be a fun mod to try though and I\u0027d definitely be in favour of having more early game plane contracts in stock.
