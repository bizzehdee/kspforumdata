You aren\u0027t getting anywhere near the I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0of an LH2 rocket. Heck, you\u0027re probably not getting I\u003Csub\u003ESP\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0of kerlox out of it. But then, you don\u0027t need to lift this fuel out of a gravity well. It\u0027s \u0022free\u0022 fuel, so who cares if efficiency isn\u0027t great?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other part is pumps. Plumbing in general, I guess, but mostly pumps.\u00A0And I\u0027m way less confident on this. LH2 is stored at way lower temperature than hydrocarbon fuels. You\u0027ll also need to pump WAY more of it by volume to get the same mass flow. In contrast, hydrocarbon pumps have their own challenges, especially carbon buildup if you\u0027re using a turbopump. Building a system that can handle both seems like a technical challenge. But it\u0027s probably just going to be a heavier engine and higher price tag. Maybe that\u0027s ok? Also, for a lighter rocket with electric pumps, this might not be an issue at all. You just need it to handle lower temperatures and maybe live with a lot less thrust, which, again, for orbital operations isn\u0027t crucial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the tank\u0027s been mentioned, but I do want to point out that a tank for LH2 is way heavier than for methane, because it does need to withstand more pressure and cryogenic temperatures. Is that worth the savings you get on fuel you don\u0027t need to bring along? Maybe! This seems to fit an extremely specific mission profile, though. If you don\u0027t plan to burn a lot of fuel once in space, it\u0027s cheaper to just bring a bit extra for all your maneuvers than to build heavier tanks and engines to handle both types. If you plan to do a lot of orbital maneuvering, it might make more sense to just to deliver a stage to Earth orbit that\u0027s already built for hydrogen on whatever rocket you\u0027d like to use and just go from there. But there could be mission profiles that need just an option of versatility, and somebody\u0027s willing to pay to have it. I can\u0027t think of anything, but it\u0027s not that far out there to be completely implausible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow.

And weight we know is the main reason we rely on staging our launches. Just launching a big spaceship in one go reduces the payload siginificantly as most all the weight will need to be propellant just to launch the rest of the propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to say I can\u0027t make scifi with rocketry, but when I do not ignore how rocketry works, which is virtually similar no matter if antimatter or solid propellant, it is story and plot breaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne cannot expect a bunch of diverse missions for ONE explorer vessel. If anything rocketry favors sending out mulitiple explorer vessels, each with a specific mission, since launching and refueling are hardly trivial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, as kerbiloid mentioned it takes power to split hydrogen from water. What he did not mention was the time \u00A0it will take. Depending on how much LH we were filling up and how powerful our nuclear or other reactor is at powering the process, it can easily take several hours at least, while several days is even more possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while it is theoretically\u00A0possible to use warp induced gravity assists to change travel vectors and velocities, and it is possible to to refuel propellant, neither is conveinient for human\u00A0space travel since they both involve waiting and waiting costs food resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, the only way a large human or humanoid presence in space seems justified is if the travel times can be reduced by a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just do not see many signing up for missions that they know a robot could do better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, Star Trek would make a lot more sense if robot ships did the exploring, and humans on ships came later.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause let\u0027s face it, the only things humans can really interact with is an Earth environment.
