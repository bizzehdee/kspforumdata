Unfortunately it is, but I managed to come up with a more reliable rotor design. With this design scheme the rotors get stuck on mission start much less frequently. I\u0027m still not exactly sure why this \u0022workaround\u0022 works at all. Mostly just trial and error. I recommend quicksaving before spooling up, then if it does get stuck just reload and it should work the second time. You are free to modify/redistribute but I don\u0027t guarantee it will work properly if you change anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax speed ~55 m/s (level flight)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControls are mostly like you would expect them to be for a helicopter, except it uses throttle instead of collective, which makes the response time terrible. Just remember that lift depends on rotor rpm, not engine rpm or throttle. Hover is around 30% throttle with full tanks. The SAS helps stabilize a little, but it is mostly there for ballast. I have not tested landing with empty fuel tanks, so more ballast may be necessary for that. Be somewhat gentle on the roll controls, and don\u0027t try doing barrel rolls or rotor failure may occur. The limiting factor here that causes rotor failure is the angle between the rotor disk and the mast. The larger the angle becomes, the more undesired torque occurs at the hub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage is engines, the second stage ejects the rotor blades, the third stage ejects the cockpit (zero-zero capable), and the fourth stage is a parachute. If you try to blend the second and third stages, then the blades won\u0027t eject, and launching yourself into blades is generally a bad idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImprovements over my previous design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigher speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVastly less prone to rotor failure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore fuel (range)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore stable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design is mostly just for flying around for the fun of it.

Without it, they will bend around wildly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe green vertical decoupler allows the rotor blades to rotate relatively freely around the mast. Being connected to an I-beam seems to mitigate (but not eliminate) the new sticky bug. It acts like a periodic torsion spring, so really lightweight rotor blades will get stuck easily at low throttle.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe red horizontal decouplers are attached using symmetry so that they are equal distances from the axis of rotation. They allow rotation of the rotor disk relative to the mast to reduce out of plane torque on the rotor hub. Without it, rotor failure is inevitable. If you want to eject the rotor blades for some reason, these are the best decouplers to use since they will be flung away from the craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img89/9218/fv2x.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fv2x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor third image:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe red distance determines roll authority. The larger the gap, the stronger roll controls will be. Left roll input increases the lift on a counterclockwise spinning rotor and decreases the lift on a clockwise spinning rotor. Right roll input does the opposite respectively. For this reason, the left rotor should always spin clockwise and the right rotor should always spin counterclockwise (when viewed from above and behind). If you get it backwards, then your roll controls will be inverted.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe blue stack separator is not necessary, but it absorbs some of the shock between the rotors and the fuselage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u0027m not actually sure if the green decoupler does anything. It might mitigate the sticky bug, or it might not do anything useful.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, there is complete three axis control from the rotors themselves, and the contrarotation cancels torque. so RCS, SAS, reaction wheels, etc. are not necessary. If you are trying to make an SSTO, you might actually want to take all controls off of the rotors and just use wing parts on them, since control input may cause them to rotate at speed. If you are going high speed and the rotor tries to rotate, it will most likely be ripped off. You can also see how I put vertical stabilizers on one end of the rotor blades on my SSTO to help keep them from rotating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip: the center of lift of the swept wing part is at the root of the wing, so it\u0027s actually better to mount them from the outside of the rotor disk pointing in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-28T03:07:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2013 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by VincentLaw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iDan122","CreatedById":24439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T10:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWorks great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YQj5e3H.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YQj5e3H.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried landing on helipad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X8H7P0W.png\u0022 alt=\u0022X8H7P0W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFiled horribly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KissSh0t","CreatedById":57142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T20:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHelicopters just aren\u0027t my thing...

Reaction wheels provide only a tiny fraction of the torque that the jet engines produce, which is why I called them \u0022ballast\u0022 in the first post, They are not very effective for counter torque. RCS works if you give it a long enough moment arm, but it runs out of fuel quickly. mounting a jet engine sideways like a tail rotor works, but jet engines have too much thrust, so they have to be mounted on a short arm to provide the correct torque, which causes a large side force. using a small rocket engine has the same problem as RCS of bad fuel efficiency. One thing I have not tried is more fins at the rotor tips to control yaw enough for counter-torque. It would not make sense for that to work, but sometimes KSP doesn\u0027t make sense, so it can be worth trying ideas that seem illogical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem with a single rotor design is there is no way to control roll with a single rotor in KSP (unless you mount the cockpit vertically, then the controls act differently) so you would either need a ton of reaction wheels, or RCS for roll control. As you can see in one of my posts on page 2, roll input basically works like a collective that depends upon the direction of rotation, so if the rotor is mounted at the center of mass, it doesn\u0027t induce roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main advantages of a single rotor design would be lower part count, and lower chances of the sticky bug affecting the rotor (it seems to affect parts randomly, so less rotors means less chances of sticking).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T05:31:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by VincentLaw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iDan122","CreatedById":24439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T07:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest asking arotor with 2 blades.
