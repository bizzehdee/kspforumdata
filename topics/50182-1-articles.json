With a transmission rate of 0% if you are out of the antenna\u0027s maximum range or pointed in completely the wrong direction or there is an obstacle between the science vessel and Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - Add a very modest bonus to science for returning experiments, that is counted as a different experiment (after all studying materials in space is not the same as studying materials after they have returned from space).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 - Exceptions are: Crew reports, EVA reports, temperature, barometric and seismic scans, which do not have a return bonus, and surface samples which can only be useful if they are returned (which shouldn\u0027t be an issue since you will probably want to return your kerbal home anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 - (not essential) Remove the repeated bonuses for doing the same experiment at the same place \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I mean by being too realistic to be fun is that one could assume that the antennae can change their angle within reason and you don\u0027t have to be spot on, and a truly accurate routing simulation is not necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel that this will solve the problems I mentioned as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Early game, before you have a good Satellite network getting 100% of science will be so tedious that I doubt anyone will attempt it (I am thinking like 0%-5% instead of 20%-100%) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - The better antennae can now send more of the research and at greater distance which means there will be a reason to have them other than visual appeal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Once you have a satellite network doing science via transmission wont be tedious at all since you will be able to get 100% without much difficulty. Implementing #6 will make this also reduce tedium as well as the relative over abundance of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026amp;5 - Are the issues that this idea directly adresses\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 - Now there will be a point to having stuff in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minarkhaios","CreatedById":58867,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T14:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good suggestion and KSP have something very similar with the solar panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They automatically point out in the right direction (to kerbol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A ratio is computed based on angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I was under the impression that distance to kerbol also matters, but I might be wrong (and if I am, you need to also add it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReplace kerbol by \u0027kerbal space center\u0027, light by radio wave and solar panel by antenna and you have the same mechanism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekerbal space center became a new source of power, and antennas are radio panels that tries to get the more of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadio satellites can be sold as alternate source of power (maybe with a new \u0027repeater\u0027 part that act as a small sun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd atmospheres could shorten the distance traveled by radio \u0027power ray\u0027 so we\u0027ll need repeater in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems too easy, so it might not be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-23T14:19:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2013 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Minarkhaios\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MGyver","CreatedById":74116,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T14:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it.
