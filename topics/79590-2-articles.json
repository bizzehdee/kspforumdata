My thinking right now is to include just the parts for a complete 3.75m cargo launch vehicle with the 2m SLRB and matching nose cones (also in 3.75m dia.) for the initial release, then add the 2.5m spacecraft and matching 3.75m to 2.5m fairing adapter (I might do an iCPS upper stage equivalent, or I might not) and then finally add 2.5m parts and maybe 1.875m/2m first stage parts. I don\u0027t want to make too many parts for the smaller diameters, especially not parts that aren\u0027t meant as first or booster stages, because the idea is that the launch vehicle parts are going to support all the exploration systems I plan on making, which necessitate heavy to super heavy lift launch vehicles, or at the very least a medium lift launch vehicle if you want to do it in stages and/or launch departure stages empty and do on-orbit prop depots and refueling etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dragon01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dragon01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny chance of a 2m upper stage?

The various Russian HLV proposals have been a major inspiration for sure and I really like the aesthetic of a lot of them. That said I want a nice balance between variation, modularity and a moderate/not insanely high part count. Having 3-4 different engine parts for each diameter is going to rub up against the third category, but I\u0027ll think about it. As for the spacecraft I really, really don\u0027t like the look of older Russian (Soviet) spacecraft or things like LOK/LEK. I\u0027m going to try the PTK-NP style design for now.
