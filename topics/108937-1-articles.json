It has similar problems to the version with a wing, but not as severe. Still, I have no idea why it\u0027s spazzing out. Both crafts tend to go into a \u0022pitch-up/down-loop\u0022, unrecoverable. With the no-wing-version, it only happens when I change the pitch too fast. With the wing-version, it happens as soon as I look to forcefully at W/S (pitch).\n\nThe off-center-thrust isn\u0027t the problem, I think. I just hyperedited the craft into orbit, and while it starts pitching down a little bit under thrust, it\u0027s really nothing severe and can be corrected by the cockpit\u0027s SAS.\n\nWhat the heck am I doing wrong?\n\n![eqFHMRC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/eqFHMRC.jpg)\n\nEarlier version without canards, doesn\u0027t change much, though. Added them for better take-of.\n\n![pf1gqrI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pf1gqrI.jpg)\n\n![QhRSz37.png](http://i.imgur.com/QhRSz37.png)\n\nCraft-file needs:\n\n- [Mk4 Parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699-0-90-Mark-IV-Spaceplane-System-%2814-12-14-important-fixes!%29)(Air intakes)\n\n- [Scramjet parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119735-1-0-2-Instell-Incorporated-Experimental-Technologies) (Leech Scramjet)\n\n[Download from Mega.co.nz](https://mega.co.nz/#!TwsnVYaT!JJGJNUlFfSBWDoWgZU088MC4QI5EUAerY2KUrDkhX9Q)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:08:22Z","Content":"I\u0027d say you need FAR more wing area, like 3 to 4 times as much. Think bout it this way, in FAR and real life (I gather KSP now tries to model one of these at least) the maximum realistic wingload is around 0.5 tons per square meter. Now I don\u0027t know how much your craft weighs but I think you will simply have to add more wing are over all. Also, I assume you tried turning SAS off when it starts oscillating (stock SAS can be a bit crazy in the atmosphere)"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:16:08Z","Content":"Not enough lift. Plain and simple. Try the FAT-455 wings, that piece you are using was designed as a tail fin. While it can be used as a wing, it\u0027s not big enough for a plane that size.\n\nAlso, you effectively have Canards and Horizontal Stabilizers there with no actual wings. You need Wings at the center of mass or your roll is going to be very difficult.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T19:23:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:23:03Z","Content":"The issue you are facing is due to drag acting on the body at different angles compared to the center of lift for the wings and you are entering stall conditions at high angle of attacks where the wings no longer provide lift, but only produce drag.\n\nGiven equal surface areas, the wing furthest away from the center of mass will have the most torque. Your planes body also has drag and will apply torgue trying to flip it out, much like a rocket would if it didn\u0027t have tail-fins.\n\nEnd result - your forward canard, and rear-heavy rocket, gives the front end a lot of torque. This is manageable until you get too high an angle of attack where the nose-heavy drag/torque overwhelms your controls."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:57:26Z","Content":"You have no wings those are all controll surfaces. Yes they can act as wings but do you ever considered why real life planes doesn\u0027t have their whole wing movable. The moment you turn that thing it changes the lift so dramatically you loose your controll its that simple. Besides ksp controll surfaces are really powerfull now due to the new drag model. You need %90 wing %10 controll surface. Also lock the roll pitch and yaw from unnecesary controll surfaces. Like your tail for that plane should only work for yaw. And the controll surfaces you are using as wings should only be for pitch. So you actually don\u0027t have any roll movement atm. Roll can be done with wingtip controll surfaces."}]}
