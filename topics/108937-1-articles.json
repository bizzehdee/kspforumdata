It has similar problems to the version with a wing, but not as severe. Still, I have no idea why it\u0027s spazzing out. Both crafts tend to go into a \u0022pitch-up/down-loop\u0022, unrecoverable. With the no-wing-version, it only happens when I change the pitch too fast. With the wing-version, it happens as soon as I look to forcefully at W/S (pitch).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe off-center-thrust isn\u0027t the problem, I think. I just hyperedited the craft into orbit, and while it starts pitching down a little bit under thrust, it\u0027s really nothing severe and can be corrected by the cockpit\u0027s SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the heck am I doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eqFHMRC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eqFHMRC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarlier version without canards, doesn\u0027t change much, though.

Think bout it this way, in FAR and real life (I gather KSP now tries to model one of these at least) the maximum realistic wingload is around 0.5 tons per square meter. Now I don\u0027t know how much your craft weighs but I think you will simply have to add more wing are over all. Also, I assume you tried turning SAS off when it starts oscillating (stock SAS can be a bit crazy in the atmosphere)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot enough lift.

Yes they can act as wings but do you ever considered why real life planes doesn\u0027t have their whole wing movable. The moment you turn that thing it changes the lift so dramatically you loose your controll its that simple. Besides ksp controll surfaces are really powerfull now due to the new drag model. You need %90 wing %10 controll surface. Also lock the roll pitch and yaw from unnecesary controll surfaces. Like your tail for that plane should only work for yaw. And the controll surfaces you are using as wings should only be for pitch. So you actually don\u0027t have any roll movement atm. Roll can be done with wingtip controll surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
