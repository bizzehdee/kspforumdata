While in the VAB, putting a rocket together, I went to attach (4) AV-R8 Winglets to my \u0027bottom\u0027 booster tank \u0026 engine assembly (a Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank with Rockomax \u0022Mainsail\u0022 Liquid Engine). I made a mistake with the symmetry selection (set at 1), which I wanted to be (4). I inadvertently \u0027let go\u0027 of the winglet in-hand (dumped/deleted it), set the symmetry, and then selected the winglet again. When I went to place the winglet, I wasn\u0027t permitted. So, I let go of the winglet again, and then tried to re-select it again. I wasn\u0027t permitted to select it again, even though the winglet was available in the selections group.\n\nI then saved my craft, exited the VAB back to the KSC overview, and then went back into the VAB. My rocket, still sitting there ready for me to work on ... I selected the winglet again and placed the (4) I desired. After a few finishing touches and setting the desired stagings, I saved the craft and then selected crew and went to launch.\n\nAt launch the rocket liftoff was nominal, all systems \u0027normal\u0027. After gaining altitude and course to a point I was ready to set nav points to circularize the orbit in the Map View, I switched to Map View. When I returned to the rocket in flight, it was gone - invisible. I could apply thrust / shut engines off / even apply thrust and see results on the Navball ... but the rocket was invisible. When I went to scroll-wheel in to see if my view had switched (somehow) too far out, there was no reaction. I also discovered at that point that I couldn\u0027t right-click and drag the view around.\n\nWith that, I attempted to abort the mission, to return to the Space Center; but that option was not available in the Menu. All I could do was Resume or Revert... so I reverted back to the VAB. At that point I exited the game because things (*how can I describe it?*) didn\u0027t feel right - laggy sort of.\n\nWhen I went and checked the output\\_log file, it was filled with errors. There were a bunch of NREs, and a new one for me - AEs (ArgumentException), and they all seemed related to the winglet part with Unity doing the reporting.\n\nI have not restarted the game yet to see the result. I will do that after submitting this.\n\n**Logs:**\n\n[persistant file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a7fnclo2xyoz6xt/persistent-2015-07-26.sfs?dl=0)\n\n[output_log file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x18kxox2ksbfbq6/output_log-2015-07-26.txt?dl=0)\n\n[craft file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4w4iesuj7s3cgcm/KLab2M-2015-07-26.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T14:12:06Z","Content":"Went back into the game, pulled up the rocket again and attempted a launch. Midway through launch, checking the map view, when returning to the rocket it appeared to be switching through the view modes ... the view kept spinning and tumbling. Went back to map view, and on return the ship was gone. This time I was permitted to go back to the Space Center ... and there, sitting on the launchpad, was the rocket. This was not a revert mind you. I exited the game, it appears quite broken. ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nExamination of the output\\_log shows more of the same as in my previous post ... errors, hundreds and hundreds of them... the output\\_log file was in excess of 15mb in size.\n\nAlso, somehow, my runway got trashed/broken ... and the game will not repair it when clicking on it. I\u0027m running a Science game."}]}
