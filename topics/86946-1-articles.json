For example, spaceX offers commercial cargo to be sent up into space for about $300,000,000 for about 10\u002B tons. I believe that such integration into the game would make a good aspect, just like the addition of science and funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the addition of commercial service means that there are multiple sources of funds, and this drives people to build interesting ships and launchers. Also, commercial spaceflight means that SSTOs and Space Stations would finally come in useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, the specifics of the orbit of a commercial payload would make it very close to the real world counterpart, such as customers demand specific orbits for their payloads. This would widen the structure of funding and reputation. Also, players who completed unlocking all parts would have a reason for a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, i have some questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Would the payload be a vessel with specific parts that cannot be attached to or removed from? And does this mean that you must build a launcher around it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Does landing rovers fit into the definition of \u0022commercial\u0022? Unless the contractor requires you to set the rover as a \u0022payload\u0022, landing a rover would be more of a challenge, rather than commercial service.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What happens if you fail to send the payload to its destination? Would you lose funds, or reputation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, i have full support for this idea, and i really wish for it to be implemented into kerbal space program!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T10:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rovers one was an example.

Take for instance any mission you test a part for a company, that\u0027s a \u0022Commercial\u0022 contract. Same goes for any contract that is given by a company, go to the moon and collect science from orbit from Kerbodyne. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the ones you propose are what most people expect as a contract. I personally hope something of the like would appear in the end game. For now we are stuck with the ones, and im sure squad will expand on this at a later time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest thing to think about it how to keep the game flexible enough when asked to deploy anything. As you don\u0027t want to grind out sending pre built station parts over and over and over again, thats boring and not flexible what so ever. Which is one reason why we have the test this part type contracts, outside of the single part the contract gives you flexibility by allowing you to complete it any way you want (rocket, plane, SSTO, station anything)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carmoldu","CreatedById":109336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T00:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel the same about this topic.
