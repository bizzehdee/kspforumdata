Over the years I\u0027ve played lots of space games from arcades, simulations, strategy games, and pseudo-games such as Space Engine scale ranging in hardness from \u0027Science In Genre Only\u0027 to \u0027Speculative Science\u0027. Since I\u0027m sure that I\u0027m not alone in this respect, I\u0027m curious which ones you all have played and enjoyed, and which ones you think are particularly unique. What kinds of space games are you looking forward to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some of my thoughts for now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://joegotgame.com/shackleton-crater/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShackleton Crater\u003C/a\u003E. Did any of you guys hear about this one? I think the game was intended to be a \u0027hardish\u0027 Lunar colony building game based on current NASA design refrence mission architectures (speaking of which, did any of you guys try \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/national/ltp/games/moonbasealpha/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMoonbase Alpha\u003C/a\u003E?). It unfortunately didn\u0027t make its kickstarter goal, but the games I\u0027ve played by Joe Ybarra in the past were excellent. The Starflight series might be his most well known, but I particularly enjoyed Alien Legacy. Alien Legacy, was a curious combination of RTS and city building with adventure game influences. The atmosphere and world building was excellent, and it was one of the very few interstellar space games that played the \u0027slower than light\u0027 card straight, with the player\u0027s seedship the UNS Calypso being a Bussard Ramjet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://en.spaceengine.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpace Engine\u003C/a\u003E. A new version just came out! 0.97 adds comets, aurora and other things. This game wins hands down the award for most beautiful space game ever made (for me beating even Homeworld). If you want to marvel in a realistic procedural sandbox that is literally the size of the universe you should try this one out. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised it if influences KSP future interstellar development as well. Also, the developer has some damn interesting ideas to turn Space Engine into a hard-SF space exploration and colonization open MMO.

The base is basically the same for each area, but have rougher and more hilly terrain, which makes it more difficult to get around and do some tasks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is broken down into multiple phases, with each phase having specific goals to be done. After the \u0027work orders\u0027 for the phase are done, the player(s) can go to the next phase, or continue playing to try and increase their % rating. After a phase is ended, the next phase is started after a brief \u0027loading screen\u0027. The next phase has the base being expanded with more things in place, and with new work orders to do. In earlier phases, supplies are limited do a slower pace won\u0027t work well in the long run, but at around Phase 4, things are in place to start making the base more and more self sufficient, starting off with being able to produce food, as food (and medicine) are the main finite supplies at first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll sorts of factors need to be kept track of, such as oxygen, power, food, water, radiation, air pressure of the base, etc. Rovers allow for getting around, but fuel needs to be made for them, and caution needs to be had on hilly terrain, as they have trouble with steep includes and can take damage going to fast or otherwise sliding down a hill. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn later phases, mining can be done to allow for making replacement parts for things, and even acquiring minerals needed for other aspects, such as for creating fertilizer for the farm/greenhouse area. Plants can be grown, and a bio lab allows for raising of fish, frogs, worms, mushrooms and several types of algae. Stuff grown is not always for food, some types of algae and plants can be used to make plastics, some fertilizers and fish materials can be made into algae nutrients, another type of algae can be used to make medicines, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe overall goal being to eventually make the base self sufficient and producing resources faster than it uses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a demo for it also, taking place in Phase 6 (one of the later phases, where mining first takes place and food production stuff is all in place already), and has some limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is on Steam Greenlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only down point might be the fact it is $30, but so far I feel it could be well worth the money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother one I want to mention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Station Manager (and the \u0027followup\u0027 Short Hike, which I did not get a chance to play). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was about building and maintaining space stations in Earth orbit, dealing with things like expenses, crew numbers (some modules requiring so many crew to work), life support (habitation is useless without life support), power (solar, RTGs), heat (need radiator panels and such), and making money (research modules, communications modules, \u0027industrial\u0027 modules that also lessen module costs). Having service modules and spare crew helps lessen maintenance costs (only so many parts, larger stations needing more of each to help keep maintenance costs in check).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is basically a dead project now, I have not seen anything about it in some time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T06:22:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rditto48801\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rditto48801\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA few \u0027space\u0027 games come to mind for me.\u003Cp\u003EFirst, good old Outpost, by Sierra.
