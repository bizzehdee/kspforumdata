I quickly found out that they disintegrate at 90 m/s already. When I reach that speed at 1-2 km height they heat up and explode in like 3 seconds.\n\nYes they are placed pretty badly and have to take a lot of aerodynamic forces but melting at 90 m/s seems a bit excessive. This was my first test just to see how far I could go with this but this issue ended the trip a lot sooner than expected.\n\nIs this part of the new heating mechanic or is something in my game messed up? I\u0060m not sure how I could protect them if this behaviour is intended...\n\n![QEavIJC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QEavIJC.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T22:02:58Z","Content":"You might want to see just where the heat is coming from on the parts during launch, but it really DOES seem a bit much."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T19:20:33Z","Content":"What does the F3 log say is the cause of their explosion?\n\nIf it\u0027s an overheat thing: It may or may not be related, but I\u0027ve also seen some reports of mods causing some parts to explode due to overheat (mostly smaller things like batteries). I don\u0027t if the mod (or series of mods) has been figured out yet.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Keras","CreatedById":114511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T17:10:13Z","Content":"Yes, they did explode due to overheating. The day after that happened FAR also decided to stop working in the VAB. It wouldn\u0060t calculate any values or even display the debug voxels. Now I just removed FAR and everything is working fine. No overheating on the way to orbit at all.\n\nLooks like there is a bug in the newest FAR release :/"}]}
