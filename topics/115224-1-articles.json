I quickly found out that they disintegrate at 90 m/s already. When I reach that speed at 1-2 km height they heat up and explode in like 3 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes they are placed pretty badly and have to take a lot of aerodynamic forces but melting at 90 m/s seems a bit excessive. This was my first test just to see how far I could go with this but this issue ended the trip a lot sooner than expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this part of the new heating mechanic or is something in my game messed up?

The day after that happened FAR also decided to stop working in the VAB. It wouldn\u0060t calculate any values or even display the debug voxels. Now I just removed FAR and everything is working fine.
