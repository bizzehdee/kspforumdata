For the test, a special purpose platform was installed on the launchpad, and an H-2 rocket (with the nosecone removed) attached to it. This testing frame allowed for the measurement of the thrust that the motor is able to provide and at the same time provided a base to keep the H-2 on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the early morning, engineers installed the platform at the launchpad, and kept it circa 1 meter above the ground to prevent that eventual attrition will ruin tests data.

But let\u2019s dvelve deep in what happened today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur plan was to launch an H-2 rocket, as part of the Ancestry program, specifically the Ascent-2 mission. The mission was a test to conduct measurement on a vertical launch of the rocket, fueled with half propellant because we wanted to prevent a catastrophic explosion if something went wrong. The rocket was towed yesterday at the launchpad and the ignition was set to take place at 5.00.00. This was our first \u201Creal\u201D mission as the previous one was merely a test of the rocket motor achored at the ground, so we had the mission control hyped about testing the commlink between the craft, the tracking station and the MCC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the countdown, Gene Kerman, our flight director called for a delay as we had a no-go from our INCO officer (Integrated Communications) that experienced some problems in setting up the last parameter of the Graphotron CPU, the chip mounted inside the H-2 rocket control unit. Along the Graphotron, we also mounted on the H-2 a black and white camera, always under INCO responsibility with the intent of shots high altitude pictures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur engineer estimated that, with the propellant available, the rocket should have surpassed the 50,000 meters in altitude, so everyone expect to reach the high atmosphere and then see the rocket tiltind and splashing on the ocean, as we planned to have it guided towards east, to prevent it from falling back to the space center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe delay lasted 1 minute, and at 5:01:00 the H-2 was ignited and started its acent towards the sky, climbing rapidly and surpassing the 50,000 meters after 1 minute and 30 seconds. During the flight all the readings were nominal hence FLIGHT (the flight controller, Gene Kerman) allowed the guidance officer (GUIDO) to not call for the shutdown of the motor when we estimated that it should have surpassed the 50km and leaving the H-2 climbing anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 5:03:25, 2 minutes and 25 seconds after the ignition, the rocket touched the apogee of the flight reaching 71,666 meters, surpassing the so called \u201CKerman Line\u201D (the altitude where the space should begin) that is set at 70,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the H-2 started its descent and it was seen splashing in the sea at an incredible speed due to the aerodynamic shape and no parachutes to slow it down (it was a war rocket hence the reason why it should hit hard the ground). During all the flight we was able to take pictures from the onboard camera and all the readings were exceptionally clear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe outcome was so unexpected that we literally celebrate this first achievement, even Wernher Von Kerman did not expect this incredible performance of the H-2. Later measurement revealed that all our calculations didn\u2019t expect to have such an high momentum after the motor shutted down. During its flight, the H-2 reached the incredible speed of 977m/s (3,517 km/h) and it splashed 15km east of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, enduring in the process a total Gee force of 5.3G.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday\u2019s launch was a total success, and we plan to continue all our testing with this incredible rocket in the upcoming launches.

In the Uplift program the plan is to build our own rocket, basing our knowledge on the H-2 and the measurement that we recorded during Ancestry flights. This is an important step because it means that we have fully mastered the basic concept of the rocketry and we may be able to send one in an orbital flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on the minutes from the board, plans are to test various scenarios, like using liquid vs solid propellant and performing the first multistage tests.

The launch was planned for the 5.00.00 but as happened for the previous launch, it was delayed, this time only by 11 seconds by double checks on system integrity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plan for the mission was to acquire telemetry data of the flight of the H-2 with a trajectory that would have put the rocket in a situation where an orbital injection could have been made (not certainly with an H-2 rocket), henche the choice of, instead launching totally vertical, take a curved trajectory to improve the fuel efficency increasing the lateral velocity, the requirement for a stable orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the aforementioned delay, the H-2 was ignited and after a brief wobbling on the launchpad (that we suspect was caused by the fact that the H-2 can stay vertical without support, and when the engine starts the fuel flow was not optimal) the rocket climbed taking the expected trajectory and reaching an apogee of 80 km. During the ascent the guidance was perfect but at the apogee we had 3 seconds of fuel left and we wanted to test a prograde burn to mimic the initial phase of an orbital injection but the maneuver failed due to the fact that the rocket inclination was not optimal and the onboad core unit was not able to stabilize the H-2 nose before the descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that time, the mission plan was to retrieve the telemetry package from the onboard Graphotron but the unit did not responded, even after multiple attempt. At some point, the rocket entered a blackout that our scientist supposed was caused by the plasma generated by the heat of the rocket impacting the atmosphere. We were able to take a shot from the onboard camera some seconds before the blackout. Unfortunately, we were not able to restore communication with the H-2 (that was not built to accomplish this kind on mission however) and we receive news of a splashdown in the ocean minutes later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite the good ascent phase, the lack of precise telemetry from the rocket forced us to mark the mission as a partial success.

For this first \u201Cexploration\u201D phase of rocketry, our deadline is day 130 and then, if all the above goals will be met, we will spend the remaining 90 days allocated by the program roadmap to first develop a multistage rocket, and then create a rocket able to bring to space one ton of assets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis last goal, the creation of a \u201Clauncher\u201D rocket, will allow us to move to the next step, fill that ton with the first artificial satellite that will hopefully orbit Kerbin.

The goal was to retrieve the telemetry data that was lost in the previous mission, Ancestry-3. Today\u2019s, the fourth, mark the completion of the program and all the data regarding aerodynamics and propulsion of the H-2 is now elaborated by our engineers that now need to focus on developing a sounding rocket that we can equip with more specific scientific instruments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch today was performed exactly at 5.00.00 without any delay of kind. The rocket climbed in the atmosphere and we all the readings was nominal. At 5.02.59 the H-2 reached the space and some minutes later we retrieved all the telemetry data. During the ascent we observed an increase in the heating due to the air density, similar to the one happened during reentry that we were able to photograph. As for the previous launch, we incurred in the so-called plasma blackout but we were able to restore the communication before the splashdown on water, and we were able to observe that the aerodynamic fins was destroyed before the hit on the ocean. This is something important that we must keep in mind for future desings. The cause of the destruction is probably related to the heating or, eventually the high pressure that the fins are subject in the reentry that reached peak velocities of 1,630.6 m/s (5,868 km/h).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe now have in our inventory 2 H-2 rockets left, the first was the one disassambled for the Ancestry-1 engine test, while the second is the fifth that we received, that we want to keep intact for eventual future use.

With all the information acquired from the H-2 launches, they are designing our own first rocket that is planned to reach space on Day 35, an ambitious goal considering that they have less than twenty days to develop it. Based on what we\u2019ve learned from Ancestry, to keep it small they probably go for a multistage design from scratch, but we\u2019re pretty sure that we will see them testing assets in these days on the launchpad.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNOTE: We are trying to manage the goals and the deadlines better, current roadmap is mission-wise (Uplift-x do this, Uplift-x1 do that) instead our management is reconsidering the practice and set the goals with deadlines, while leaving the departments free to choose the optimal launch sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Aeronautics Labs are continuing their work on the Breeze program and the assembly of the first planes, and they are targeting day 60 for the first test, for this reason, our pilot kerbonauts, Jebediah Kerman and Valentina Kerman, are closely working with them at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and conducting specific procedures training regarding take-off, landing, and general handling on the planes.

They are the Dart and the Dart-75 sounding rockets. The Dart is the \u201Cfather\u201D of a new family of rockets developed with the sole purpose to test the knowledge gained from the H-2 rockets tests and the 75 version is a small counterpart that will be used in the first launches for testing that everything is working nominal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese rockets are made keeping in mind their purpose, testing, so they are quite simple to reduce the cost but they will be equipped with telemetry software and they also feature a small payload bay just below the nosecone that can be equipped with small scientific instruments. The rockets will be fired from the launchpad using a specific launch clamp that was designed internally. The 75 variant is expected to reach the edge of the atmosphere while instead the \u201Cfull\u201D Dart should be able to reach space and accomplish his main purpose of sending data back to the MCC, thanks to a small antenna that is smbedded in the core module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe also defined the first four lanches, three of which will made with the 75 and then, the fourth with the Dart itself.

Since the rocket didn\u2019t entered in the plasma blackout phase, no interruption of the data flows was encountered. The maximum speed reached by the Dart 75 was 635 m/s, gained obviously just seconds before the fuel got totally depleted. After telemetry review, our engineers think that the rocket could have performed even better, this because in the initial climbing phase the terminal velocity could have limited the speed gain, thus the decision to limit the speed of the rocket in the initial climbing phase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the next launch will be performed in two days and will see another Dart 75 on the launchpad.
