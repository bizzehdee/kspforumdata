What I\u0027d missed was how much fuel would be needed to rendezvous. The efficiency was terrible, netting only half a Rockomax 8 tank or less per trip. Refueling with Dixie Cups! Fortunately a lander with the capability of returning from Duna\u0027s surface without dropping pieces will have the ability to fly to Ike with a full fuel load.

(Not to be used with FAR, NEAR or any other atmospherics mod except RSS - without FAR, NEAR etc.) What that does as of its current release is just remove the mass of the fuel tanks\u0027 contents from the stock drag calculations. Logical, because what\u0027s *inside* a fuel tank should have no effect on the aerodynamic drag of the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESDF makes rockets accelerate somewhat faster and use less fuel lifting off planets and moons with an atmosphere. It has no negative effects on MechJeb\u0027s Ascent Guidance and I\u0027ve not noticed any major impact on Landing Guidance other than its initial Deorbit Burn seems to overshoot a bit, then it corrects and gets as close as it does without SDF. I need to get around to testing my old Duna landers with this to see how much improvement it makes on their ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESDF helps quite a bit ascending from Eve. Without it, my Eve lander barely makes it to 100KM orbit with part of one T400 tank. With SDF I\u0027ve gone to 118KM with the T400 full and about 2/3 of the T800 on behind that. No worries about running out of fuel doing rendezvous. (This is lifting a 2 man can, not just one Kerbal in a chair. \u0027Course it also uses lift bags to rise to ~24KM before lighting the engines.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SubM3ntor","CreatedById":120988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T12:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDownload links are down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat mod thanks for updating it guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brienne","CreatedById":59216,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T14:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your answers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CDK","CreatedById":114733,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-11T00:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022brienne\u0022 data-cite=\u0022brienne\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for your answers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the subscription!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tekener","CreatedById":117427,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-12T01:16:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what I do wrong, but I installed Kethan 0.9 (the first time using Kethane at all), and I got all the new stuff researched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m having a probe orbiting the Mun and the scanner is active (I see it moving and following the Mun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I learned in the net I should see a hex view on the map screen representing unscanned, empty and Kethane slots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I do not have any hex patterns on any planet/moon on my map. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere can I enable the hex map?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phazon8058","CreatedById":106981,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T22:34:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKH4?

Kethane is the only mod I\u0027ve installed so far (other than a brief stint with Mechjeb, didn\u0027t like it). It looks like Galane\u0027s solution is to make the refinery itself leave the surface and orbit to meet the hungry ships. Have most people gone this route? It certainly simplifies distribution, though I\u0027d be concerned about how much fuel is being wasted hauling all that extra equipment up and down.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need to decide on a standardized height for docking ports and place them in both the miner/refinery and your tanker. The tanker will have to be a rover as well for two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, and most obviously, you\u0027ll need to drive it to the miner\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, using landing gear when standardizing docking port height can be tricky - there are tutorials on that, I think it requires a base mover - because the gear suspension will sink more or less depending on the vehicle weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be hard to see in this screenshot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/20ayjhk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220ayjhk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck the rover in the center and the base at the right. In all cases, the docking ports are at the same height than a black rover wheel held on a strut. While such a low height might be inconvenient for building, it makes rovers that are easier to drive around. That base in the right is made of three different modules sent apart and the MK1 cockpit is an ion powered rover. It was all docked on the ground. Needless to say, docking in the ground is harder than in space so, really, KAS is the best way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Riph","CreatedById":111890,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T02:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022juanml82\u0022 data-cite=\u0022juanml82\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThen you need to decide on a standardized height for docking ports.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not just have Advanced Grabbing Units sticking out of the sides of the refinery?
