If you want SAS to do anything with a probe body, then you have to add one of the other SAS equipped parts, which include the Old ASAS 1m \u0026amp; 2.5m parts, or the Avionics nosecone thingy.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUhm. They all come with a reaction wheel built in. Except the \u0022EAS-1 External Command Seat.\u0022 Which has none. Probes have less then 1.5 torque with the smallest having a torque of 0.2. So why do the probes have torque if S.A.S. is not equiped?

I kinda wonder if there could be a bug in some of the command pods?? The one I tested with was the new cupola module and it seemed to work perfectly with my spaceplane.

In space, it will pitch up constantly under thrust unless I correct it manually (which is has more than enough manoeuvrability to do). SAS simply can\u0027t fly it.
