The reason its a waste is the magnesiun ~3.5 more momentum but 10 times as much energy. This problem can be overcome only if the an equvilent reduction if a 3.5 fold lower solar power weight. More so in mars orbect. The problem with xenon is that it has proportionally more neutrons and is harder to remove its inner most electrons relative to magnesiums inner shell neutrons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll it looks like we don\u0027t need a massive VASIMR, bad for them, we need much more power to weight generators.
