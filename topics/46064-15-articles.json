The way KSP handles charge makes it very difficult, there is no API specified. Anything which can store charge has a config section and 2 variables: how much it can store and how much it has right now. Things that want to use charge make a call to a KSP function saying \u0027give me X amount of charge\u0027, the function passes back how much of the request was fulfilled and removes that amount from storage. The same in reverse for generators. At no time does any object say what it is using or generating, only the KSP core knows what objects are calling it\u0027s functions and it doesn\u0027t track it or make it available. That means that the only real fact you can calculate is how much change happened since you last looked for the entire vessel but that doesn\u0027t help you a whole lot. I have some more ideas to test but I\u0027m not overly hopeful at this stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery mod maker seems to ignore charge interoperability and handles things their own way, almost always without outside access. So Fusebox makes guesses based on config files and hard coded values for various objects, some things are simply impossible to deal with because nothing of their workings is exposed to external components (reaction wheels, the lab). A minimal API would need to exist with 3 variables per object instance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EisActive: boolean\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EisGenerator: boolean\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eamount: float\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would make life easy and you\u0027d have a dozen mods overnight letting you track everything.

That will be version 2.0 when it comes out. In between I\u0027ll put out 1.X based on the current design. I might squeeze it into the current if it\u0027s simple and I get bored.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
