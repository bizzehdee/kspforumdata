We... OW.... finally going to start picking up some satellite contracts? Or are we... OW... trying for a docking? I think I\u0027ve got the hang of this rendezvous thing now -OW-,\u0022 queried Jeb, trying to referee a Ping-Ponk game between Bill and Bob. Neither opponent was terribly good at the game, so most of the shots ended up hitting Jeb instead of the table. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nope. We\u0027ve decided to send you to the Mun.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The \u003Cem\u003EMun\u003C/em\u003E? For Kol\u0027s sake, I\u0027ve only done one flyby! And that was on a dare!\u0022 cried Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, regardless, we\u0027ve got you penciled in for tomorrow. Today is all mission prep.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, as long as you\u0027ve got a design that can get me there and back. I don\u0027t want to have to wait for a rescue mission.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Would we be talking if we didn\u0027t?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022True.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSC LAUNCHPAD. YEAR 1, DAY 6.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill\u0027s voice came in over the comms, which everybody, myself included, were listening in on thanks to a couple of very loud ham radio enthusiasts. Personally, I wanted to hear the news, or maybe that techno station from Kurich. But it wasn\u0027t as if I had a choice in the matter. \u0022Alright, Jeb, if you do everything right, she\u0027ll have a bit of fuel left in the tank for you to do some biome-hopping. Just sit back, relax, and don\u0027t touch anything. The autopilot will handle everything... fantastic invention.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How much transit time are we talking about here?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not very much, really. Eet is only three days total there and back. Seence we do not have ze proper technology yit to do long-term research on ze Mun, ju weel speend at most five hours on ze surface of ze Mun.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022COUGH kaff. Apologies, it is my throat again. As I was saying, ze trip is only three days there and back again. You\u0027ll spend roughly five hours on ze surface of the Mun, and ze rest of the trip in transit. I would advise you to bring a book.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bit late for that, Wernher, seeing as we\u0027re at T minus twenty minutes...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Zen why dit ju ask now? Vhy did you nut ask fifteen hours earlier, vehn ve vehre strapping ju in? Das...\u0022 von Kermann\u0027s comms channel suddenly cut out. \u0022Sorry about that, Jebediah. Count von Kermann hit the brew a bit hard last night...\u0022 supplied Bob. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Eh, heck, whatever. As long as the rocket\u0027s fine, I\u0027m fine. Let\u0027s get it over with and launch this thing.\u0022 sighed Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, it\u0027s still T minus nineteen minutes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why not launch now? It\u0027s all fueled and everything...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Intercept windows or... something. Look, I\u0027m sure Gene had a very good reason for timing the launch like this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where\u0027s Gene, then. I want to talk to Gene.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait, I thought you knew where Gene was.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E19 MINUTES LATER.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022-and that\u0027s why you should never date a woman who claims to play the sousaphone. Anyways, folks, thanks for coming to the first Mun launch in history and HOLY KRAKEN IT\u0027S ON FIRE EVERYBODY RUN FOR YOUR LIVES WHY WAS I NOT TOLD ABOUT THIS!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe announcer had no idea what he was talking about. Everything went perfectly. Six LVT-30s fired in unison all the way up until they ran themselves out of fuel. Then BANG, something blew up. Then two Mk. 55s fired. Then they stopped. Then they fired again. Then they stopped. Then there was another bang. Then a single Mk. 55 fired. Then it stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ach, Krakenspew. He had to use a bit of the lander stage to circularize.\u0022 complained Wernher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently something went mildly wrong, but since a certain Gene Kermann was not available for color commentary, nobody knew. All they saw was rockets going on and off and exploding and on and off and exploding and on and off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen some time went by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESOME TIME LATER\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk. 55 fired again. This kept on for a tick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA TICK LATER\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk. 55 stopped firing. The signal on the little TV switched to a Kongressional budget hearing. Everybody, myself included, got up and left the stands. On the way out, I saw the ham radio enthusiasts slow-roasting their hams. Must be an expensive hobby. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDoes our intrepid reporter get fired from his job for idiocy? Does the KSC find Gene? Does von Kermann finally sober up long enough to design some Skippers?
