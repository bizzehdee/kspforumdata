Remember, adding a lot of meters of copper cable means adding a lot of mass that you\u0027re going to discard when the first stage is jettisoned. Basically just adding dead weight when you really don\u0027t want it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrew capsules usually have batteries or fuel cells and solar arrays to power themselves. The Space Shuttle is the only spacecraft that has turbomachinery to power alternators -- it has three APUs that are basically turbines powered from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E nozzles (aside from fuel cells). These are used to power the hydraulics and provide back-up power from launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
