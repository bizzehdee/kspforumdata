Instead use the smaller 1m ASAS and stick it on the top of your command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Instead of using the 3m decoupler, use the smaller, 1m decoupler and reinforce it with 2-3 struts. If you\u0027re feeling particularly adventurous, use the probe decoupler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Instead of using the big SRB, use the longest 1m Fuel Tank and slap on a T-30. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Do not use the disk shaped battery (the one with 500 charge). It has the lowest charge/weight ratio of all the battery packs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) 4 winglets on the main body of your lifter stage can do wonders for craft stability and maneuverability. Try using fins instead of a bunch of gimballing engines. This is especially prominent with engine clusters when you can use T-30s instead of the heavier T-45. I\u0027ve notice having 3,6,8 winglets can introduce lots of wobble. 2,4 is the sweet spot for winglets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut the winglets in-line with 000,090,180,270 headings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Poodle Engines are almost never the answer to your problems. 3-4 LV-909s have a lower weight, identical ISP (in vac) , and almost the same thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) You never really need as much mono-propellant as you think you need. 100-150 units of monoprop will last a journey to Jool and back while including docking.

Its a delicate balance between TWR/efficiency thats gives you your Dv. If a lifter has 1.2 TWR on its first stage and its says it has 4300 Dv, chances are if you do your launch right it will get you into LKO without staging it. As long as your TWR is above 1:1, it will lift you, and the Dv is calculated accordingly. Yes the less weight you have, the less thrust you need, but you dont need anything more than a 1.2 TWR to get launched. The more fuel you carry, the more thrust you\u0027ll need to launch. The more thrust, the faster it burns, the more fuel you\u0027ll need. Putting your 1st stage TWR above 1.2 is wasteing fuel, and in turn wasting Delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PolecatEZ","CreatedById":58008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T04:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Francesco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Francesco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to understand this, landing gear has mass inside the VAB/SPH but doesn\u0027t in the flight scene?\u003Cp\u003Eor is it a on the ground vs in the air thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding gear shows in VAB/SPH as having .5 tons each.

Then above that I stack my transfer vehicle: two LV-Ns with FL-800\u0027s. Payload goes on top. Total delta-V is in the neighborhood of 11km/s. (And I end up adding a bunch of RCS and tanks to the center rocket because the whole thing is so long it won\u0027t pitch or yaw in vacuum without help.) The Mainsails get me into orbit with enough left in the center tank for another 1200-1300m/s. Would it be better if I used clustered engines instead of the Mainsails?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the outer mainsails, no need. However on the middle one, if you want to keep using it in outer space, I recommend indeed that you would switch to an engine cluster. If you turn part clipping on and add the tail wing parts to the side of your tank, you could cluster up to 17 engines easily on your middle stage. So if you use 5 LV-45s for control and the rest are LV-30s, you can get up to 3580kN on the core stage \u003Cem\u003Efor the same ISP as the LV-30/45s have.\u003C/em\u003E Of course, you don\u0027t need to cluster so much of them, but if you cluster enough of them you will get pretty much the same TWR as with a mainsail but a much better Delta V due to a way higher ISP. Of course it\u0027s more parts and more weight but it can be worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonnally, for heavy lifting I use a design similar to this. I stick with mainsails for up to three pairs of double orange tanks in asparagus until it\u0027s not enough to get me in orbit. Then, I start to scratch off more delta V by making engine clusters. Or, if my TWR is too low, I switch to more powerful clusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainsails aren\u0027t evil, but stacking mainsail over mainsail is far from being the best thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nodrak","CreatedById":69231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T18:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot entirely true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7x LV-30 = 8.75 mass, 1,505 Thrust, 17.5 TWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1x MainS = 6 mass, 1,500 Thrust, 25.5 TWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5x LV-45 \u002B 12x LV-30 = 22.5 mass, 3,580 Thrust, 16.22 TWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd on the weight of whatever tail wing piece you are mentioning and its not worth it, from a TWR standpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a large lifter built already and need some extra detla-v, try adding some Areo-spikes on the main rocket that fire whenever the main rocket fires.
