A good debate always results in better understanding and often a better solution in the end.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo your first point. I appreciate your goals and desires. However, if you look at the interface of CLS, there is an override switch, that disable CLS completely. Why include this? Because \u0022someone\u0022 will need it for some reason, and because I can.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI never use it, but I do know it is there. It directly undermines the reason for CLS. In the end, it didn\u0026#39;t hurt to put it there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTO the second point and implied concern, The feature will off by default. this means that no parts will be altered by CLS other than by what is already defined in the various configs. When the feature is turned on, parts will be \u0022given the ablility\u0022 to be make passable. The filter is fairly limited, and exclude almost all obviously impassable parts, tho not perfect (nothing is of course as it can be subjective). So, with it off, you get exactly the behaviour you had before the feature was added, and the tooltips will only show for those parts with configs. with the feature turned on, those parts added by the filter will have a passable flag in the VAB/SPH and in the tooltip display with RMB.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo you really do get both worlds. Leave the option off and nothing has changed. turn on the feature and you can now \u0026#39;tailor\u0022 your living spaces in the vab/SPH.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T16:53:23Z","Content":"\nSo, to make sure I understand: in the default mode, for parts that are passable but do not have surfaceAttachmentsPassable (i.e., most passable parts), there will NOT be a tooltip to turn on passable surface attachments?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T07:28:32Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Fraz86\u0027]So, to make sure I understand: in the default mode, for parts that are passable but do not have surfaceAttachmentsPassable (i.e., most passable parts), there will NOT be a tooltip to turn on passable surface attachments?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCorrect. all \u0022customization\u0022 features added will be disabled by default.
