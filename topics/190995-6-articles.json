Nothing I have been able to repeat anyway, couple of one off weird things that I think were just KSP being KSP. the\u00A0Bureaucracy mod disappearing out of my save, when deleting another save, and needing to restart KSP, being one.

I\u0027m almost tempted to let it sit until 1.9 comes out now as we know it\u0027s close, but I have other things I want to move onto. I\u0027m going to let it sit overnight just in case, I\u0027m not going to get a massive amount of time after work today, and doing a release, getting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E sorted etc, all takes time.

I realize in this case, this mod is basically monthly budgets 2, as all the basic functionality is still there, with extras, but you never know there might be people that still want the old version with out all the extras. There are a lot of old mods that i use to use that died, because the mod authors left and no one could pick them up and keep them going, and while there are \u0022better\u0022 mods that may do the same or similar things, I still miss those old mods, and would use them if they were still around.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beetlecat","CreatedById":92207,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-24T21:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, plus it\u0027s there for backward compatibility for older KSP setups.
