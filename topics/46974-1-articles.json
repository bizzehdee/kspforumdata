This gives me about a thousand new reasons to go exploring. I would love to see terrain in this game continue to evolve. I think cave systems would provide tons of immersion and encourage new and unique vehicle designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I know that cave systems would not be realistic in certain environments like moons, however any planet with liquid on it in the past (Duna) or present (Laythe and Kerbin) could benefit from it. Also i could see large caverns existing inside other celestial bodies due to impacts or deposit imbalances (Lava Tubes on Eve?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It would be another awesome way to hide anomalies as well. Imagine finding the Kraken\u0027s body in a huge nested cave system! Not sure if this has been suggested before, just a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T11:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the way KSP handles planetary surfaces right now, (at least, caves the way you\u0027re describing them) are impossible.
