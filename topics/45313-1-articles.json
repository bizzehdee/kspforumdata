This way, in air-breathing mode, the engine burns LH2 along with intake air, and on the switch to closed-cycle rocket, it burns LH2 and LO2 with a vacuum Isp of 450 I think. Matches the real thing fairly well, though there is no pre-cooling component (though there is a \u0022pre-cooler\u0022 part, it is only structural \u0022filler\u0022), you can assume it there as the air breathing mode works well up to around 25-30km and around 2000m/s, it doesn\u0027t require any spamming of intakes (what is with that?
