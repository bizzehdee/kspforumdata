If I\u0027m in flight, I can\u0027t recover the vessel or go to the space center or even go to the main menu - not even quick save or load. If I\u0027m on an EVA, I can have -5 flags... If it\u0027s at the space center, since it is a sandbox save, I can only access the astronaut complex, but as soon as I do all of my astronauts (thankfully unsaved) lose their experience. If I\u0027m in an editor, I can do things like modify the vessel, scrap it, and load them, but I cannot save the vessel, launch, or quit. it just does\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enothing.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0The KSP.log and the console say: \u0022[ERR 21:14:34.298] PartLoader: Encountered exception during compilation.

It\u0027s definately\u00A0a mod conflict somewhere, and all of my mods are up to date save for Kerbal Engineer. I\u0027ve verified the cache, rebooted, reinstalled even, started a completely fresh, blank new slate of a save and literally nothing has work.

One thing I do minimize this issue, is make a backup copy of my KSP with mods. So when I do a bunch of upgrades at once, if I have issues. I can fall back to a known good version. Then add\u00A0one mod at a time till the issue reappears. With a 15min loadtime that can take some time. Compared to it being broken though, might be a time saver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you can post your log so we can look it over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
