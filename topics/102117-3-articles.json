Here\u0027s mine:\u003Cp\u003EI would very much advise a 0.99 update before going to 1.0 - I am working in software development as product owner and believe me: no matter how good the team is, there is always something they miss --\u0026gt; and it would get the community on your side and they would more easily jump to defend your product should reviewers \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. First and foremost: Get the performance snappy! Memory leaks etc. Make \u0026gt;1000 parts craft a thing not only for demonstration purposes but so you could actually build an orbital colony or something like that that really has a purpose. If that is only possible with Unity 5... well I would be willing to wait until that is included. Hell, I would even be willing to pay again (yes, again!) if need be, if you need more funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. General gameplay / immersion: That clouds mod (Environmental Visual Enhancements / Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack / etc.) does so much for immersion it is not even funny that clouds / weather has not yet been a feature of the game. Also: IVA on all crew capable containers/pods! And there should be something space stations are actually useful for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Aerodynamics / re-entry heat: Looking very much forward to that and I do say that it should make its way into 1.0 (including new fairings)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Contracts: Make them more worthwile! \u0022Put satellite in orbit x\u0022 gets tedious and boring. \u0022Do mission x to unlock mission y so you can get reward z\u0022 would be a concept that would keep players more engaged. At the moment I rather stick to science mode than career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Mining resources: Honestly? Put that on hold until the update after 1.0 - unless it is already increadibly reliable and fits smoothly into the game. Postponing it would also be an added bonus for people starting new with KSP who see \u0022awesome, I get a cool new feature just a few weeks/months after 1.0!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. UI/UX: The Interface looks like something from the late 90s/early 2000s.

Going specific instead of going wide.
