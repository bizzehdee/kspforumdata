I think working examples would be very useful. That said my modeling skills are very basic (to put it kindly) and time to help with this would be extremely limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T02:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
