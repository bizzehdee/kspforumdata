I didn\u0027t even really realize it it was so quick. But when I checked a bit later (shown in the video) I saw the status message. Thing is, by that time my G-force had become even greater, yet I didn\u0027t lose any more solar panels (except for the fact that I was ascending too flat and slamming through the atmosphere fast enough for DREC to overheat and eventually explode them all. Oops I should have left the fairing on longer...).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESo I\u0027m guessing it wasn\u0027t acceleration that damaged the panels but the fact that I was maneuvering in my gravity turn at the time? Or what? I\u0027ve already launched this same satellite (communication satellite) using the same launch vehicle, and I didn\u0027t lose any solar panels due to G-force although I mostly went straight up to stay over the KSC for maximum comm contact length. For the second satellite I was able to use the first to bounce signal and fly over the horizon on a flatter trajectory - too flat it would seem \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-14T10:29:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2014 10:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Gaiiden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T08:18:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis does not happen in the stock game.

I\u0027m as confused as you why that panel broke off at only 2G vessel acceleration, but maybe it had some other sort of force acting on it. Or AIES parts just are that fragile? I wouldn\u0027t know, I have not used them yet. My recommendation is asking in the Deadly Reentry thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T10:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOops.
