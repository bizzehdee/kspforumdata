Check their ejection strength. Try using radial couplers instead, they tend to push the empty stage away instead of just pushing it straight down. Mechjeb tends to start turning early at 10-12km, I assume your launch stage is still burning at that point so when it releases its hitting you from the side as its trying to drop straight down. Stack multiple radial decouplers on each other if you have to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Creat","CreatedById":27315,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T19:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Ziff: He uses the small ones that come with MechJeb. They are the grey rings that are in there \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell it\\\u0027s kinda hard to give you specific tips. I\\\u0027ve rebuild your design from your screenshot (as you didn\\\u0027t attach it). Also, I have no idea what your settings for the ascend autopilot are. What is the orbit altitude, when is it set to start/end the turn (click \\\u0027edit path\\\u0027 to see those \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom some test I can only guess that you the autopilot is still turning when the initial stage (meaning the four \\\u0027bosters\\\u0027) is separated, and that one of them ends up above, so the next stage basically turns into it, clipping the middle engine in the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously what \u0027Amoral\u0027 suggested won\\\u0027t work as you want mechjeb to be able to do the separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the tank right at the top (below the capsule) doing? Is it even connected to anything that uses fuel? There isn\\\u0027t anything on the screenshot...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are quite a few solutions to this, it\\\u0027s basically a bit of a dangerous design with such a long central stage that isn\\\u0027t separated with the surrounding ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Use different parameters for the ascend autopilot. The default settings turns way too early anyway (try 25 km turn start, 60 turn finish). Target at least 100 km orbit with those settings obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Use radial decouplers. They push away whatever is decoupled, so you\\\u0027re less likely to run into the stuff. The TT-38K (ejection force 120) is better than the lighter \u0027structural pylon\u0027 here. I tried this, but as long as stage separation occurs while the vehicle is still turning, it won\\\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) include the five tanks that make up your second stage in the top, meaning you have 8 tanks surrounding the center (well, it\\\u0027s one less, but whatever). You\\\u0027ll actually have more thrust (4*50 = 200 instead of 175 with the exact same fuel consumption for speed gained, basically 25 thrust for 1 \\\u0027fuel usage\\\u0027 unit). This works of course (also tried it). See screenshot and attached craft. Reached orbit @ 400 KM with about 1.4 tanks per engine remaining (meaning 5.6 total) so about out of the initial 9, 8 surrounding the center one which is drained first with the fuel pipes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) remove the central engine, not the tanks though. Connect them to the outer tanks with four fuel lines. Decouple simultaneously. Will use more fuel to reach orbit as your design (or as answer C) as the central tanks will have to push more weight. Keep in mind though that the final vehicle is lighter in comparison to option C, so it can do more with that amount of fuel. In my test it reached the same 400 KM orbit (also same settings for autopilot) with close to 4 tanks remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE) If you want to keep it at three stages, make the stage less long, but wider. Example also attached. will behave exactly like yours in terms of fuel consumption as it\\\u0027s the only change that is only arranged differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: forgot to add about option E, it only barely reaches orbit with the middle stage as it\\\u0027s a bit low on thrust. It will work as is with a higher \u0027turn end\u0027 though! Otherwise more thrust is needed as the gravity turn isn\\\u0027t completed before the initial Apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: also, the outer tanks apparently explode (due to colliding with each other) when they are dropped, so you either need to reduce the \u0027stage delay\u0027 or combine separation of outer tanks with ignition of middle engine. I\\\u0027ve updated the attached file accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidenote: what on earth are you doing with all those RCS tanks? why 5? isn\\\u0027t 1 enough? Only turn on RCS once you\\\u0027re out of atmosphere, it tends to slow you down (at best) before that... also I only see RCS thrusters at the bottom of the central unit, but not the top part. Intentional?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidenote2: you can use all basic engines interchangeable, they have exactly the same fuel efficiency (25 thrust per fuel usage). Bigger will burn fuel faster but give you the same total acceleration per fuel unit. This only applies to flying in space, where you have no drag, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
