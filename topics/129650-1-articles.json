flight waiting for all the green ticks to appear on the way down, deploy chute in the correct alt range (1000-6000m) but once i go under the 1000m range i lose the corresponding tick, and then as soon

theory, the only thing that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eshould\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E be misleading would be where it says \u0022deploy\u0022 because, as far as I\u0027m aware, it\u0027s not the fact that the parachute deploys but that you release it (and it then deploys) which marks the contract as complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I\u0027ve always taken the cheap and easy solution (command pod \u002B downgraded flea) just to get up to the minimal height before staging the parachute, so the question has never arisen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T18:58:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the contract specifically says \u0022haul\u0022

the contract display with all the ticked requirements) if it ever happens again, so you can post it here.\u00A0 That way, either you can definitively get it confirmed as a bug (and you can report it
