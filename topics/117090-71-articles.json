But I\u0027ll just wait for the release.\n\u003E \n\nI have been debating adding support for angled boosters.  The main problem I run into is angled boosters are intended to be used only on a specific launch-vehicle; the angle of the nozzle is set to run through the average COM of the main core stage to impart minimal torque and maximize usable thrust.  Obviously this would not work out with stock KSP mechanics and its randomly designed rockets.\n\nSo, I need to decide before I go any further on the nozzle/geometry end of things if angled nozzles is something I will support.  -IF- I do include angled nozzles, I will have to find a way to add an in-editor adjustment for them; there is no way around it.  \n\nSupporting angled nozzles would require specially compiled nozzles models (mounts) that include a reference thrust transform, gimbal transform, and information regarding acceptable gimbal range (both in-editor adjustment and in-flight gimbal range; which can/should be different).  Including the transforms is not a problem, as the models have not been built yet; but this would exclude using any \u0027generic\u0027 models as nozzles, or any other mods\u0027 models for nozzles, unless they included the proper gimbal and thrust transforms (though, I\u0027m not aware of any other mods\u0027 that add SRB nozzles, so... probably not an issue).   \n\nMostly this would require, in addition to the work that I\u0027ve already done on the plugin/config/etc:\n\n- Plugin-level support for adjusting reference angle for the gimbal while in the editor (adjustment slider, likely only on a single axis).\n- Plugin-level support for repositioning and re-orienting gimbal and thrust transform to match the reference transforms from the model.\n- Model-level support -- needs to have reference transforms for gimbal and thrust.\n- Config-level support -- need to have config data for each nozzle listing its gimbal range (editor adjust and in-flight use) versus the reference transform.\n\nAnd at this point if I\u0027m going through all the work to do that stuff for the nozzles, I might as well investigate adding variable ISP/atmo curves for each nozzle as well -- would result in a decent range of performance depending upon which nozzle/etc was selected.  Would need to find solid information regarding SRB performance stats for various nozzles.  Would also need to find a way to disable this mechanic when RO is installed.\n\nWill be debating over this stuff a bit today while working on the rest of the SRB geometry.  Will likely know in the next day or two how I\u0027m going to proceed.  What it might come down to in the end is \u0027how many nozzle models do I feel like making?\u0027  Honestly, even the existing/planned three is pushing my patience.  I mean... its an SRB...how many variants are really **needed**?  Only one....
