You can\u0027t force 2-way symmetry onto a 4-way setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are a few tricks;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- simply don\u0027t use 4-way to start with, use two sets of 2-way symmetrical placements and then you can add something with 2-way S onto one of the sets. Then it doesn\u0027t matter if there is a little offset in their placement, the craft will still be balanced. (use this method if the thing you want to add has enough mass to effect flight)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if its something relatively small that won\u0027t effect flight then use a marker object to help line up the manual placement (say for adding a light to 2 sides of a 4-way setup). First put the lights on roughly where you want them using 4-way S. Then add another object like a small cubic strut (also with 4-way S) so it\u0027s just touching the lights. Then take the lights off, switch symmetry off and manually place your 2 lights so they are lined up with the cubic strut and then remove the cubic strut when done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- another option is to extend something from the central object that uses 2-way symmetry and clips thought the things set with 4-way S to provide a mounting point. Say you have a central tank with 4 tanks around it, use a girder part (or a set of cubic struts) and attach it using 2 way S to the central tank so it clips through 2 of the 4 outer tanks. You may need to place the girder first and then add the 4-way outer tanks after, or zoom inside the outer tanks so you can see the central tank and place it like that. With the editor gizmos this is much easier than it used to be to get the right position and you can tweak it to be just flush with the outer tanks. Now you have a mounting point sticking out of 2 of your 4 outer tanks. (this way can cause problems if you plan to jettison the outer tanks. It may also require struts to keep it from wobbling. I\u0027d only use it for mounting lightweight things).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit - mostly ninja\u0027d.....mostly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow-to question moved to the how-to subforum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
