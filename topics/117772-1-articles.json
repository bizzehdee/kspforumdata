Needless to say, I was right before, and the contractor is stuck at a ridiculous altitude, with an orbit slightly larger than that of Plock from the outer planets mod.\n\nIt would take me 52 years just to get to that altitude as I attempted today, and I\u0027m simply not saving a stupid Kerbal if it\u0027s going to take so much effort.\n\nHowever canceling is an easy way out, so I was going to ask how I could move it to a more reasonable but still challenging orbit. I\u0027m thinking somewhere close to the Sun would make sense as with the second rescue-from-Sun contract I have, which still has high delta-V requirements without the ridiculous travel time, so how would I go about teleporting Phoalla Kerman\u0027s ship to a low Sun orbit, perhaps with some inclination to further the challenge, without breaking the mission or the save?\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T11:29:55Z","Content":"Have you considered to fly a high energy transfer, New Horizons style? Throwing sheer dV at the problem will greatly reduce your travel times.\n\nOf course, that\u0027ll require you to use ion drives, which some players don\u0027t like using, and some creativity for powering them that far away from the sun for the braking \u0026 rendezvous burn.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how you would edit the craft into a different orbit, considering the craft isn\u0027t actually an object in the game until you approach into physics range."},{"CreatedByName":"AndyMt","CreatedById":123144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T11:54:51Z","Content":"You could use Hyperedit and pretend it\u0027s sort of a \u0022teleporting device\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T12:51:14Z","Content":"He can\u0027t hyperedit the derelict craft to a different orbit, because it doesn\u0027t exist.

The contract only specifies that the Kerbal must be recovered successfully. You don\u0027t need to pass specific waypoints along the way, so it\u0027s irrelevant where you fetch them from."}]}
