I ended up hitting the hay just before midnight, expecting to sleep in till about 8am.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what happens? At 5-freaking-AM this morning, I woke up with the fully developed plans for a heavy duty Kethane mining rig to land on Minmus in my head. I mean, this thing had everything on it, An orange tank for fuel storage, big monopropellant tank, the large kethane storage tank, four drills, two converters, solar panels, RTGs, landing gear, VARIABLE rocket design so it takes off from Kerbin vertical, but lands horizontally on Minmus. Balanced RCS, KAS equipped with pipe \u0026amp; radial connector ports. Winches, spare pipe/port ends, spare pylons. lights providing perfect coverage, and even taking into consideration that the ladder from the Cupola Command Pod would have to be sideways to reach the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis as ALL ONE SECTION! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lifter vehicle, with asparagus staging, and initial SRB placement and timing for making the first gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all formed IN MY HEAD as I slept!
