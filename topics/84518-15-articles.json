I consider colonization as the endgame. but a colony can easily have 100\u002B parts. When I try to land a ship with a equaly large amount of parts near a colony like that, it lag and often it doesn\u0027t end well. The colony fall apart of I can\u0027t control the decent and crash. Also, when loading landed ship or colony, they often fly in the air on loading. The problem is, there is way too much stuff that rely on dynamic joints in this game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats why I am concidering by the idea of using static building to create colony. Static object are stable by nature. And I would like to reserve dynamic for stuff that need it. What I have in mind is a bit like what MKS is, similar in the sence that Kerbals are required to make the colony work, its not that I want to replace MKS, large and permanent colony would take allot of time to build, so its more like something that could be build on top of it. I am thinking of something of much larger scale, hundreds of colonists and more. But Unlike MKS, I think it shoud be oriented toward Macromanagement. Colonist, resource and production idealy would not be managed individualy. As a example, concider this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Colony is considered as a single entity. Kerbals are not assigned to a building, but to a task. They sleep in the barrack/housing at night, and go to their work at day without player care (obviously it would be cool to have random activity like the one in KSC, but thats truely optional.) A kerbal, when entering a colony, change state and is no more tracked by TAC. Just like what scottpaladin\u0027s Deep freeze does. Instand of TAC, Kerbal are taked care by a much simplier system: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA colony can host as many kerbal as it can support. If its in balance, the player don\u0027t have to care about anything, and can go do something else. If it as less kerbal than its support capacity, excess of production will be stored in a warhouse and disposed as the player see fit. If a colony that have more colonist than its capacity. The last kerbal that entered will be concidered as guess and will concume the stored resources under the TAC system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes for other resource their respective production facility. To support a said amount of kerbal, a colony need a minimun mining capacity of each resources, excess of resource is stored and can be used to improve the colony, and later on, when the colony is big enough, build rocket hangar. At start, it will just store them like allista\u0027s hangar mod. And eventualy, build new rocket. Unlike Extraplanetary Launchpad, it would cost something as local worker would have to be paid. Also, I would like to use the same limitation in volume that allista\u0027s hangar mod have. To build bigger rockets, you would need a bigger assembly hangar. Price of parts could be multiplied by how technologically advanced they are. To reduce cost, industrial building would have to be upgraded. Upgraded industrial building would require more kerbal, and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColony would heavily depend on whats available localy. If the extraction sites are far, a rover hangar would be required to carry resource from the mining outpost to the main colony as well as the workforce required to operate the mine. The player would have to build a rover (localy or not) and drive it to destination and back once. Then its stored in the rover hangar to protect it from the kraken. Same for if the mining on a close celestal body, but with a rocket hangar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo had some flavor, there could be contract linked to this. Not just colony construction, but colonist transfer as well, Kerbal could wish to go back to kerbin after a while. It couldbe influenced by courage I guess. Or, a simplier solution would be to have a precentage of colonist that request to go back every year. That precentage could be influenced by some thing like a recreational building or confort level base on how crowded the colony is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHummm.... now that I wrote all this. I realise that it could be done with massive single part colony module designed to be built instand of transported. Its starting to look much more like roverdudes MKS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T18:05:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ev0.5\u003C/strong\u003E is now available from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/165/Kerbal%20Konstructs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalStuff\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChangelog:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIntroduces stage 1 of a base management strategy layer to career mode.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to pay funds to open bases in career mode, open \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbalKonstructs.cfg\u003C/strong\u003E and set \u003Cstrong\u003EdisableCareerStrategyLayer = True\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaelum","CreatedById":128879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T19:41:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould there be a way to build your own space centers on different planets?
