Personally I don\u0027t particularly like single-launch missions usually; I much prefer missions that end up with a large fleet of spacecraft, several of which need orbital assembly from several complex modules. But, of course, plenty of people do like single-launch missions, and they are definitely effective in some cases (and often similarly impressive), so there\u0027s no real way to criticize them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coolinee Kerman","CreatedById":175051,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T21:41:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds cool!
