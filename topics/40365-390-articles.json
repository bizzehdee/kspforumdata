I send 5 probes however. 1 probe usualy perched on the central stack is beefier than the rest and comes equiped with a small reactor and an antinna. I normaly land this one somewhere near a pole as it is over engineered compared to the rest. This one is the probe responsable for transmiting the data home. the remaining 4 are little more than a probe core, an RTG, the seismometer, and sufficient engine/fuel to soft land itself. those 4 are droped off 1 after another around the equator and soft land 90 degrees appart or close as I can get without puting MJ on there to do it for me. 4 probes makes things rather convenient from a symetry standpoint, both on the rocket and for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImpact drones are just a core with the small rockomax and a big enough fuel tank to deorbit.
