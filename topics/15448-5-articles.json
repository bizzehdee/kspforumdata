I don\u0027t use Mechjeb as I see the game as ~50% rocket design, ~40% getting the rocket to go to where you want it to go as efficiently as possible, and 10% ~building things like munbases. Mechjeb hence removes a large part of the game for me. Other people weight these factors differently. There seem to be a lot of people who really enjoy building fun things like a satellite network, or a munbase with rovers, and I imagine for them Mechjeb removes a less fun part of the game to allow for more of the fun part. Other people want to see how efficiently they can make a rocket complete a mission, and for consistency and efficiency they use mechjeb to remove a load of variables when optimising.

The orbital information MechJeb gives you is likely on par with what a computer could do at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith today\u0027s tech, we can very much automate it completely if we wanted. Heck, we just completely automated landing on Mars with a crazy \u0022skycrane\u0022 maneuver, something that would be impossible with 1960\u0027s tech. So if you want to emulate today\u0027s tech, I\u0027d say MechJeb would be perfectly legitimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Its at least a game and peoples should play it how it is the most fun for them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed - it\u0027s a game, and you should do what\u0027s fun for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started out without MechJeb and got to both the Mun and Minimus, so no I didn\u0027t really \u0022cheat\u0022 IMO. For the most part, I\u0027m using MechJeb to perfect my designs for missions to the other planets in 0.17.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a feeling that MechJeb is going to pretty much be required for the other planets. I don\u0027t imagine I\u0027ll be very good at transfer orbits between major planets without it. I\u0027d time it poorly and waste a lot of fuel. I\u0027ve done a test transfer, and it does take a fair bit of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v to transfer to another planet. I won\u0027t want to waste a lot of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T14:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMech-Jeb comparing to Apollo guidance are very basic... heck, ALL manned spacecrafts (mercury and vostock too ;p) were fully automated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T15:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAutomation was a bigger part of the Apollo mission than you might suspected.
