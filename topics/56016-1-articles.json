Everything in KSP is based off of a very precise Fuel-to-Oxidizer ratio, get it wrong and you end up with an excess of either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, lets say I wanted to launch a half-full Jumbo tank. I would slide back the amount on the context-menu, but would be hard pressed to get it exactly right, which means that I\u0027ll be carrying dead weight. The \u0022hold Ratio button\u0022 would lock the fuel and oxidizer, so that i could just dial back on one slider and the other adjusts accordingly. This also has the advantage of letting me lock it at other manually set ratios, should i want that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T13:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 need this for huge space planes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T13:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, but I guess that it\u0027s too late to add it for 0.23(unless the dev have surhuman capability); I will use my calculator more often(and make another KSP program on it)!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
