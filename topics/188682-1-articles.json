I love Realism Overhaul, except for that little piece of it. Any pointers would be very much appreciated.

The main benefit of that approach is that you can install and uninstall mods at leisure and don\u0027t have to worry about what happens to the game\u0027s data files in your install: they remain unchanged at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModuleManager creates a file named \u0022ModuleManager.ConfigCache\u0022 in your Gamedata folder. That\u0027s the complete config with all patches which is then loaded into the game. Keep that in mind. Whenever you try to mod something and it doesn\u0027t work as expected, checking the ConfigCache is a first step in finding out what went wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your specific question:\u003Cbr\u003E\nLook at \u003Cstrong\u003E/GameData/RealismOverhaul/RO_SuggestedMods/Squad/RO_Squad_Engines.cfg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsearch for \u0022ionEngine\u0022 -- there\u0027s a set of patches doing stuff, you\u0027ll probably be most interested in the Thrust values. Tampering with that file may or may not work for you, depending on whether there\u0027s later patches that overwrite the values you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealism Overhaul is a whole layer cake of patches, it\u0027s not uncommon that a part is patched several times over. Some are changed beyond recognition. If your part belongs to that class, don\u0027t try to unravel that knot. That way lies madness. Just write another \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch of your own, and make sure that it\u0027s applied after everything else:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@PART[name]:FINAL{ ...stuff... }\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadModder54","CreatedById":196812,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-07T04:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, you just made my Neptune orbiter not cost me chromosomes!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
