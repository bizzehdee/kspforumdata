Can enter the Mission control, though upon clicking exit the mission control screen remains and nothing responds. \n\n**Fixes/Workarounds:**\n\nNone so far\n\n[https://vid.me/z2Fl](https://vid.me/z2Fl)"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T20:18:20Z","Content":"If you started the save as 64-bit, then had to switch to 32-bit, I believe that might be a cause. Squad doesn\u0027t support 64-bit any longer (and it was very much *not* recommended when it was available)\n\nHave you tried starting a new save to see if the issue still occurs?\n\nA long shot, but did you happen to move any files around or delete stock craft, or anything like that?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyverus","CreatedById":140893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T23:42:30Z","Content":"The issue had occurred in 64bit alone though. I\u0027ll play some tonight with 32bit and see what happens. Just unchecking the launcher part that says \u0022play 64bit\u0022 switches it correct? also why have that the default setting if its so useless? lol (not expecting an answer just rambling). And no i didnt move/delete any files prior to the error beginning."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T18:51:10Z","Content":"Squad never 100% supported 64-bit from the start: it\u0027s always been there as an option, but it\u0027s always been much too unstable for them to *officially* support it. It\u0027s there kinda as a \u0022use-at-your-own-risk\u0022 deal.\n\nI believe they recently made an update that removes 64-bit entirely.\n\nI personally launch from Steam, and as such am not familiar with the functionality of it, but I assume if you have the \u0022play 64bit\u0022 box un-checked, you should be launching the supported 32-bit version. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
