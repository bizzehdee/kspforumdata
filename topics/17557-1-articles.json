Title says most of what I\u0027m going to. my early launches were under powered, so I figured \u0022MOAR POWAH\u0022. I trapped a good 4 or 5 flights in solar orbit because I REALLY over shot just normal orbit. My design\u0027s a little over powered still so I\u0027m usually doing polar orbits, and just adjusting one there. Anyone else have that issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T22:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHiya JoeSolo, and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOAR BOOSTERS never hurt anyone, but maybe your aiming is a little off? If you watch your map screen (M) you will see when you go over 70km, you can kill your thrust (X) then coast to Apoapsis, where you can thrust some more to round out your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get good at that you can try for a trip to the Mun, just wait till you see the Mun rise over the horizon and fire your engines, keeping an eye on your map to see when you reach the Muns orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSolo","CreatedById":38104,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T02:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso THATS the trick. i would get to around 100k then try to round it out. no wonder i had trouble XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the advice.

The most essential parts to orbiting are prograde and retrograde markers. Prograde is the yellow circle on your navball, while retrograde is a green circle with an x in it.

Going from zero to ~2200m/s just gets you to Kerbin orbit, but then just another 800m/s will get you all the way to Minmus. So I suspect the trouble you\u0027re having is that you\u0027re keeping the heavy thrust going too long. Once you get up to about 70,000m/2000m/s, the curve of your projected orbit will start changing more quickly, so watch it on the map screen and back off the throttle as you approach a closed orbital curve, and then you won\u0027t overshoot so much. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
