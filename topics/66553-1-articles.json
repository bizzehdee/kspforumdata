I could make another post explaining why newbies would use MJ as a learning tool, but I\u0027ll finish up my coffee until then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T12:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA kind reminder to focus on discussing the topic at hand, and not make off-topic remarks or revert to argumentum ad hominem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: thread moved to the Add-ons discussion forum\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-23T12:46:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2014 12:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
