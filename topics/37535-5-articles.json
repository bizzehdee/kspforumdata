Unless you have the normal large gimbal range (which would make the pivot redundant) the pivot will probably need to move quite a bit during ascent as different stages activate and the fuel distribution changes. It will be difficult to get the correct movement without a flight computer controlling it. I could write a custom solver for it, but that would take time. On the other hand, at least the gimbal range itself would no longer need to be anywhere near as large if the pivot is managed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helldiver","CreatedById":74755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T08:24:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EZRM no need for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe player just sets the vector angle manually using action groups and then leaves it alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gimbal is done by your program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new updated Thrustmax with full gimbal range nozzle.
