I just got done trying to build a Duna base by connecting modules around Kerbin orbit using docking ports and transferring everything as one piece to Duna. Unfortunately it was either too ambitious of a base, done incorrectly, or just not a great idea. Whatever the reason for it\u0027s failing, it was a very expensive lesson and now I\u0027m back to looking for contracts to make enough money to make another attempt. Having a consequence is what makes it fun. I tried playing in sandbox mode but it\u0027s easy to ignore expense, inefficiency, and not be phased when a plan explodes. So I want the risk of going broke, have steady income, and follow my own missions outside of the contracts window and be rewarded for it.\n\nSo what about..\n\nPublic Funding\n\nPublic funding will add another revenue path that reoccurring. It\u0027s the best of both world in my opinion. Once you\u0027re far enough along you can make money without doing contracts, but you still want to make your rockets efficiently and inexpensively so you don\u0027t run out of money. Additionally, if you are careless your budget will get cut. \n\nBackground\n\nIt is believed to be in the interest of the USK (United States of Kerba) and the USSK (The Union of Soviet Socialist Kerbals) to have a space program for whatever reason. Each with their own perks, you can accept which state funding works best for you. With state funding, your organization will be scrutinized every fiscal period and funding may be increased or cut depending on your performance and the state\u0027s confidence in the program. Random global and economic events may also have an impact in your budget.\n\nGovernment Contracts\n\nWith no track record, private contracts will be non existent when you start a new game. The government will issue you contracts that you must except. The only reward for these contracts is increased public opinion or state confidence. There may be multiple paths or benchmarks for exceptional or poor performance that will modify the public opinion or state confidence. If you fail the contract you will receive a penalty to your public opinion or state confidence or both.\n\nPublic Opinion / State Confidence\n\nThere are 2 new metrics. The funding you receive is determined by both the public opinion and state confidence. Achievements and failures affects these metrics. Depending on the government you choose, one metric may be more important than the other in budget reviews.\n\nAs far as reputation goes, consider this more like reputation in the free market. It will not affect state funding.\n\nPrivate Contracts\n\nPrivate contracts still exist and function in the same way. They may have a small affect on public opinion but won\u0027t affect state confidence.\n\nPermanent Modifiers\n\nWhile reputation may go in either direction, so can public opinion and state confidence. However, certain achievements can add a permanent modifier so state confidence and public opinion cannot drop below a certain point. This means at some point you would not need to take on additional government contracts to stay afloat.\n\nState confidence can be modified permanently by having more satellite coverage over Kerbin and other planets. Having surveying equipment on these satellites may also be necessary. They wouldn\u0027t want to cut your funding if they need those satellites!\n\nPublic opinion can be modified through the use of Kerbals. Peoples hearts don\u0027t pour out for satellites or robots, but having a space station with Kerbals onboard will fascinate the masses. Manned missions and bases to/on other celestial bodies will also have the same affect. The public also favors non-military research. Not only will each Kerbal in space gain public favor and fascination, but having science centers on space stations and on other planets will also boot public opinion.\n\nPenalties\n\nFailing or ignoring government contracts will affect state confidence similar to reputation penalties for failing private contracts.\n\nKerbal death will have a huge impact on public opinion. Kerbals love Kerbals. That\u0027s someone\u0027s mother/father/son/daughter.\n\nEveryone knows going to space is difficult. The mishap here or there is understandable. But too many consecutive destroyed vessels may also have a consequence to both state confidence and public opinion.\n\nGovernments\n\n**USK: Unites States of Kerba**\n\nThe peoples opinions play a larger role in the USK. Use of Kerbals will have greater rewards while Kerbal death can be devastating. The USK is larger economically then the USSK and starts with a lower percentage to your budget but the net income is larger to start.\n\nGDP: 80 mil\n\nBudget: 16 mil (20% of GDP)\n\n% of Budget: 0.5\n\nTotal: 80 k\n\nSC Modifier: 1\n\nPO Modifier: 2\n\nSCP (Penalty) Modifier: 1\n\nPOP (Penalty) Modifier: 3\n\nNet: -1 [sC\u002BPO - SCP\u002BPOP]\n\n**USSK: The Union of Soviet Socialist Kerbals**\n\nThe USSK government is less concerned with the people opinions. They are generally more secretive about their operations so Kerbal death will not be as widely observed as in the USK and as a result does not have a large impact on public opinion. However, failing a government contract will have more severe consequences.\n\nGDP: 10 mil\n\nBudget: 2 mil (20% of GDP)\n\n% of Budget: 3\n\nTotal: 60 k\n\nSC Modifier: 1\n\nPO Modifier: 0.5\n\nSCP (Penalty) Modifier: 2\n\nPOP (Penalty) Modifier: 0.5\n\nNet: -1 [sC\u002BPO - SCP\u002BPOP]\n\nCheesing\n\nTo prevent cheesing. State confidence and public opinion would decline slowly with each passing year and reach a point where no public funding is acquired (unless you have permanent modifiers)\n\nNew Contracts\n\n**Ballistic Missiles**\n\nWe\u0027ve heard rumors that the USK/USSK have been experimenting with rockets to deliver explosives to our shores! We think it\u0027s very kind of them for wanting to share their bombs with us and we\u0027d like to return the favor. Build a rocket and attach the supplied \u0022care package\u0022. Take it in a suborbital trajectory within 5km of the target.\n\n**Recoverable Parts (once)**\n\nBuilding rockets is expensive. We\u0027re not telling you how to run your organization but we would feel more confident in your abilities if you could recover some of those early stages. Build a multistage rocket that takes the supplied payload into orbit around Kerbin. Then recover any of the earlier rocket stages. - Kelon Musk\n\n**Low Orbit Mining (once)**\n\nAnalysts estimate at this rate with the amount of kPhones being manufactured and sold we could run out of precious raw materials by Khristmas! If that happens it\u0027s likely plans for the kPhone S will be scrapped next year. We can\u0027t let this happen. Our analysts also believe there is useful ore in astroids but they are too far away to be of any use. Build a mining rig on any sized astroid in an orbit of Kerbin no greater than [n]km away.\n\n**Sciency Bits**\n\n*[Contract requires there is a space station in orbit of Kerbin] [Possibly need Inventory System mod for this]*\n\nOur scientists would like to see their sciency bits on a space station orbiting Kerbin. We\u0027re not sure how important this really is but to be honest we\u0027d rather their \u0022bits\u0022 be as far away from us as possible. Add the supplied parts to your inventory in your next trip to the space station and move the parts into the inventory of that space station.\n\n**Homesick**\n\n*[Contract requires there is a space station in orbit of Kerbin]*\n\n{name} Kerman is homesick and the media insists we get them home for the holidays. Unfortunately we really need their services as a [pilot|scientist|engineer] up there. Take another [pilot|scientist|engineer] to the space station and return {name} Kerbin home.\n\n**Konjugal Visit**\n\n*[Contract requires there is a space station in orbit of Kerbin]*\n\nI can\u0027t believe we\u0027re doing this but {name} Kerman is having a breakdown and is requesting a visit from his/her wife/husband to the space station. Have {name} Kerman visit them on the space station for... Therapeutic purposes. And then return {name} Kerman to Kerbin.\n\n**Understaffed**\n\nWe have been reviewing your crew and believe you require more skilled Kerbanauts. Hire a new Kerbal of [Any|Pilot|Engineer|Scientist] profession and promote them to Rank [1|2|3|4|5].\n\n**Garbage Collection**\n\nWe\u0027ve always said the best part about space is that it\u0027s one big landfill. Apparently \u0022space rights\u0022 activists don\u0027t think so and are picketing outside government buildings. Remove as much existing debris from Kerbin\u0027s orbit by year [year] and we\u0027l pay you [funds] for each piece.\n\n**Space Race (once per scenario)**\n\nThe {USK|USSK} are going to {any|eva|manned-flight|unmanned-flight} {flyby|orbit|land-on} {celestial body}! We can\u0027t let them do it before us. Kisney Studios has already produced a very convincing video showing we\u0027ve already done it, but while there\u0027s still time we should try to do it legitimately. {any|eva|manned-flight|unmanned-flight} {flyby|orbit|land-on} {celestial body} before {year}\n\n**Crash Into the Sun (once)**\n\nThere is a new director of space operations. He says to... Crash into the sun. Well, what are you waiting for?\n\n(After completing contract it\u0027s revealed that the director of space operations was a {USK|USSK} sympathizer and was immediately taken into custody)\n\n**Escape The Solar System (once)**\n\nNo one is sure what lies beyond the solar system. Well, actually that\u0027s not true, we have telescopes. But someone thought it might be nice to get something out there just to say we\u0027ve done it. Couldn\u0027t think of a reason why not.\n\n**One Big Runway (once)**\n\nWe think you\u0027re just not being creative enough with reentry of vessels from orbit. Safely land a vessel that has been in orbit of Kerbin WITHOUT parachutes.\n\n**Furious Space (once)**\n\nKerbals fascination with space is at an all time low. The blockbuster hit, \u0022Too Ferociously Fast 9\u0022, makes us think they are more interested in cars than rockets. We\u0027re not saying build a car. We\u0027re saying build a space car, take it to the Mun, and use it to travel {d}km.\n\n**Furious Space 2 (once)**\n\n[Available once Furious Space has been completed]\n\nOur land rover stunt was a huge success! But I think we can do better. Actually perform a land rover stunt. Take a land rover to the Mun and jump it. Get {d}m of height from your jump. If that doesn\u0027t work, I really don\u0027t know what will.\n\n**Furious Space 3 (once)**\n\n[Available once Furious Space 2 has been completed]\n\nRemember how I said \u0022If that doesn\u0027t work, I really don\u0027t know what will\u0022. I was lying; I knew exactly what we\u0027d have to do. But it\u0027s just too dangerous and WE should not attempt it. That\u0027s why YOU will do it. Take a land rover to the Mun, jump it, and while in air do a 360deg rotation in any direction. Yeah, you\u0027re gonna flip it.\n\n~\n\nI could come up with more. But there\u0027s a start.\n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T06:20:48Z","Content":"I like it.

The SC/PO modifiers can just be applied to reputation.\n\nMy thought was, I didn\u0027t think private contracts should have an affect on state budget so a different metric would be needed. But maybe I could consolidate SC/PO into one metric.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Love the idea. What about People\u0027s Republic of Kerba?\n\nThought about that as well. I don\u0027t know as much about Chinese space program as US/Soviet/Russian.
