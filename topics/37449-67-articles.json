Also, what are your starting assumptions - like the mass/metabolism of a Kerbal compared to the mass/metabolism of a human? TaranisElsu has exhaustively documented his math and starting assumptions, with Kerbals using 25% of human values. The numbers are based on Nasa\u0027s Advanced Life Support Baseline Assumptions document, which is the most recent publicly-accessible document with human values based on the actual space programs of NASA, ESA and RSA. There\u0027s certainly room for alternative interpretations, and the mod allows one to input one\u0027s own values in terms of liters/second of consumption - if you\u0027re advocating others use your numbers, it would be helpful to have those figures in units of L/s.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t redo TaranisElsu\u0027s work.
