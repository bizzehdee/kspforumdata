Well with some help from research and a friend we have figured it out! Its actually pretty simple just follow these steps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Have a recording program capable of reversing a track and changing the pitch (I use audacity personally)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Record what you want to say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Reverse the track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Make the pitch higher, for my voice I had to increase it by roughly 43% \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Listen and make adjustments to the pitch as needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t like using your voice because you can\u0027t get the pitch right? Well here is an alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Still need a recording program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Go to google translate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Type something and translate it to Spanish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Google translate has a button where you can listen to the translation, listen to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Record google talking to you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Reverse the track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Change the pitch 15% up. (this is the best value I found to sound \u0022Kerbalish\u0022) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found the need to have some Kerbal talking sounds when I started working on a video project and could not find any that were not distorted as if they were transmitted over a radio. I needed something like a Kerbal narration so after some brain storming and research came up with this!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T03:15:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is that moment you realise speaking spanish is great. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatKerbal","CreatedById":98809,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T06:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022astropapi1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022astropapi1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is that moment you realise speaking spanish is great. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll is right with the world! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3mon","CreatedById":83138,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T07:26:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E{{The mods strike once more}} se labrek ne ralbah!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-30T13:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2013 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sjwt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
