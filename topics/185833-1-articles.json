The pistons won\u0027t deploy at the same rate\u00A0(even if they\u0027re set to the same rate and damping), they don\u0027t always extend to the full programmed length, and they just aren\u0027t very sturdy when extended. My hinged experiments have been much simpler, pairs of wheels attached to the hinges by the long girders, but when I trigger their action group they don\u0027t move. They swing up eventually, but not all of them. At the moment my experimental base has about 20 pairs of upswinging powered\u00A0wheels, and maybe my computer can\u0027t handle so many movements. Has anyone else had better luck with retractable powered wheels?\u00A0I\u0027m trying to develop an amphibious base for Eve, so the wheels pretty much have to be the TR-2L Ruggedized wheels and the experimental bases mass in the 90 to 200 ton range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022z21V7ZE.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/z21V7ZE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I\u0027m doing with hinges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022ZPrNGRP.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZPrNGRP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is what I\u0027m trying with pistons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-26T02:53:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2019 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Zosma Procyon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-28T19:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh geez, you\u0027re combining the 3 wonkiest parts ever:\u00A0 cargo bays, wheels, and robotics \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0 That\u0027s probably going to cause problems....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what I think is happening is that your sets of wheels are too close together.\u00A0 I\u0027m thinking the colliders of 1 set are overlapping with the adjacent one, so that one robotic part or the other think\u0027s it\u0027s blocked from moving even when it shouldn\u0027t be.\u00A0 Have you tried this on a smaller scale with fewer sets of wheels spaced out farther apart?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
