Your idea is lovely. I wish more companies acted the way you\u0027re asking them to act, but as I said, refunds would have happened by now and there is nothing additional to offer to console players at this time. So, besides a refund, there is nothing KSP-related with which to compensate a console customer that currently exists or that has been announced. I am saying you are unlikely to get what you would like to get for that reason, whether I believe you should get it or not. That\u0027s just the reality of the situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m glad you\u0027ve had good experiences with Take-Two in the past and I sincerely hope this turns out to be a net positive experience for every console customer, but in this specific instance what could they offer to console customers that would make sense?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA console exclusive feature is a nice thought.\u00A0Heck, it could\u00A0even be a nice compromise to the fact that modding is PC only and likely to remain that way. Besides two Bethesda games, does any game support mods on consoles yet? Whatever\u00A0it might be would likely come to PC eventually\u00A0even if only in the form of a mod, but for a time the console versions could have something exclusive. But what would that exclusive be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA console exclusive might be a bit of work\u00A0and therefore could be a long time coming since work hasn\u0027t begun on anything yet (unless they\u0027ve already planned a surprise for console customers), so what else would be reasonable compensation? This isn\u0027t criticism of your idea; now I\u0027m genuinely asking what would work in absence of any current or announced products.

I wasn\u0027t aware of what that title\u00A0did, but it sounds\u00A0pretty similar to what I was saying about an in-game mission browser.\u00A0Though the big difference between a title like that and KSP is that Halo Reach launched as an already\u00A0online game with existing servers. KSP has no current online functionality (unless someone wants to be pedantic about sending usage data to Squad being online functionality), so work would need to be done\u00A0and mission data servers would need to be implemented, operated, and maintained.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do think that this is the most user friendly way to implement mission sharing, but since no word of how sharing will work\u00A0has been announced yet we\u0027ll just have to wait and see. The quickest, easiest, and least expensive\u00A0way for Squad to implement sharing missions, having creators upload them wherever they want like they\u00A0do with mods and having users download them and install them like mods, is also the least likely way for Microsoft and Sony (especially Sony) to allow in my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause it\u0027s quick, easy, and cost-effective, the treating-mission-sharing-like-mod-sharing method is my best guess for how Squad has been thinking about sharing. I would\u00A0love to be wrong, but the pros out weight the cons from the development side of things.\u00A0If it does go that way, at least on PC I can imagine a community-made\u00A0website will be adapted or created to handle mission sharing, possibly (probably) complete with a search and download manager similar to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. Then again, Squad could have the PC audience do sharing the way I\u0027m expecting, and\u00A0have\u00A0the it\u00A0function differently on consoles by making use of the servers that Microsoft and Sony operate for online functionality. That seems like a pontential solution, and console-specific mission sharing could be implemented during the likely necessary console port work for the Making History DLC. That would mean that consoles wouldn\u0027t get the DLC until much later than PC, most likely, but at least it could arrive with feature parity. Also, having mission\u00A0 sharing\u00A0be on Microsoft and Sony servers means it\u0027ll last at least until their current consoles are no longer supported\u00A0which is actually a huge positive point for doing it that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this is just dumb speculation on my part, and\u00A0all of this is\u00A0moot if the DLC never makes it to the consoles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-25T13:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223202675\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153466\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221508880007\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269375\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mako\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Mako said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA console exclusive feature is a nice thought.\u00A0Heck, it could\u00A0even be a nice compromise to the fact that modding is PC only and likely to remain that way.

My friend was insulted with words that would get me banned/suspended from these forums if I repeated what the commenters\u00A0said to him. Some even told him to kill himself for requesting that. 50\u002B negative/insulting\u00A0replies to his comment and just a few\u00A0positive replies, all within a few hours. I wrote something similar\u00A0on their website and was met by the same result as my friend (no where near as bad as the replies he got, though).

We only play PvE so no, we would not have an advantage over other players\u00A0if we were allowed to transfer our characters.

It would be nice if they offered something to console customers, however I have limited expectations of them doing so. I like to deal with realistic expectations, and it\u0027s probably egotistical of me but I like to try to help others have realistic expectations. I find that so many disappointments and disagreements, both online and in the real world, stem from poor communication and poorly-managed expectations, so I open my big mouth (probably way too often and if you all haven\u0027t caught on by now I love to hear myself talk [or in this case\u00A0type way too much]). Furthermore, I don\u0027t believe Squad to be under any obligation to offer the things you\u0027d like, and as long as they do deliver a working console version I don\u0027t believe anyone is entitled to anything more. In fact, if Squad had left the console version as broken as it was, all any customer could do is try to get a refund,\u00A0say \u0022Shame on Squad!,\u0022 and complain on the internet about it, but that would be the end of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis kind of thing happens all the time with all kinds of products. Some companies offer warranties,\u00A0others offer satisfaction guarantees, and some offer easy return policies,\u00A0all so you feel good about your purchase. And still other companies don\u0027t offer anything as a sign of good faith that you\u0027ll like your purchase, and when you buy from them and are unhappy, well, it\u0027s very unpleasant and unfortunate, but that\u0027s it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now Squad is a company that doesn\u0027t\u00A0have any products of their own, and doesn\u0027t own the product they\u0027re working on, so they\u0027re in no place to really offer anything besides an apology. I pretty much\u00A0accept the work they\u0027re doing on fixing the console versions to be an apology. What do you really care about at the end of the day: a working console version or an apology? Personally, I\u0027ll\u00A0take the working version every time.

My friend was insulted with words that would get me banned/suspended from these forums if I repeated what the commenters\u00A0said to him. Some even told him to kill himself for requesting that. 50\u002B negative/insulting\u00A0replies to his comment and just a few\u00A0positive replies, all within a few hours. I wrote something similar\u00A0on their website and was met by the same result as my friend (no where near as bad as the replies he got, though).

We only play PvE so no, we would not have an advantage over other players\u00A0if we were allowed to transfer our characters. And yes they DO have the\u00A0power to at the very least give you the amount\u00A0xp you earned in legacy servers to a new character in the new official servers, but they refuse. Yes, I heard its not hard to level up in Ark, but some of us have jobs and college that prevents us from spending hours upon hours of grinding.

In all fairness, mods like MechJeb and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E do not interest me, since I much prefer playing my game, not watching it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, I like having to plan my orbital burns and calculating where and for how long I need to burn to dock.

It allows you to have several missions going on at the same time. Depending on your play style, I can see how that can become indispensable.
