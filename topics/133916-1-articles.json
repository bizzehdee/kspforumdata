Maybe i\u0027ll try life support so bases need means to re-supply or to have ships for long missions actually differ more from the ones for short flights apart from the amount of deltaV...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also like some logical progress while i play...no kerballed flights to Mun, Minmus or Duna until i had some scouting missions in forms of satellites or probe landers. My Kerbals don\u0027t like beeing sent into completely unknown realms, you know. Communication is also an issue. Once in a while, my ships should be able to communicate back to KSC, so i set up communication networks with the required or affordable coverage. Never actually tried RemoteTech, because most of that is just roleplaying for myself and i don\u0027t want mission failures because of actual communication loss or signal delay. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 aspects of my playstyle....not really dangerous for themselves, but now combine these 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\nResult: My itch to have communication networks, GPS-Networks, multiple satellite probes and interplanetary missions/bases at once with a rather grown library of mods finally exceeded the magical 32Bit memory border of KSP.
