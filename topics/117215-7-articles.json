I\u0027m going to have to mess around with how much hydrogen the parts can hold (I deliberately set it low so that the shuttle parts wouldn\u0027t be too OP, but it turns out to make setting up a Jupiter III like this rather difficult as the vast number of 1st stage engines burn through the external tank fuel before the SRBs are spent). I\u0027m also playing with SRB thrust curves with varying results. \n\nThe 7.5m parts also still need decouplers, a proper fairing base, some thrust plates and some new hydrogen-fuelled engines to be in the second stage (the first stage SSMEs drop away to reveal J-2X engines)."},{"CreatedByName":"StarStreak2109","CreatedById":118557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T12:06:41Z","Content":"Awe inspiring!!! ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif \u0022:0.0:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T02:59:21Z","Content":"CAN\u0027T WAIT TILL the first component is out!!!! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T21:19:56Z","Content":"In case you haven\u0027t already seen it, I stumbled upon [this presentation](http://chapters.nss.org/ny/nyc/Shuttle-Derived%20Vehicles%20Modified.pdf) outlining various potential Shuttle-Derived Vehicles.

(In fact after playing with it in the VAB, I may have deleted all the runner\u0027s up, I liked it so much!) A few things:\n\n- I\u0027ve already mentioned how much I like your texture work in other threads, and again that\u0027s the case here. I also like really like the orange you went with (and the whole 5m tank selection). Names are great too.\n- A minor disappointment with the usage of the stock SSME, but that\u0027s mainly because I\u0027m using Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp, and for some reason it\u0027s causing conflicts (that\u0027s a \u0022me\u0022 issue). I have Nertea\u0027s most excellent Cryo Engines anyway, so I\u0027ll probably just use those. I suspect that\u0027s the idea, as suggested above.\n- As I suspect you know, the Podcockpit IVA is a 3 person, whilst your pod seats 6. If you\u0027re \u0022shopping\u0022 for IVAs, there is the Taurus Pod IVA (at 7 with a two deck configuration), and Nertea\u0027s NFSC Inline Command Pod (at 6). Both are size3. Unlikely you\u0027d want the added dependency, but it\u0027s a thought.\n- The weight of the \u0022small\u0022 Kronos fuel tank is 9, same as the medium one, while the large sits at 17.\n- The bulkheadprofiles on the fairings both read size3\n    - nCollidersPerXSection ???\n- Will we be seeing any more 7m parts?
