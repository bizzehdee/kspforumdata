NOT a programmer so idk what is wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have stated ALL OF THIS already. All I have gotten by and large is derision and mockery. I went directly to seek help to no avail. I will make two statements implicitly clear again. This is GAME BREAKING for me and as such has rendered the game unplayable. I am NOT A PROGRAMMER. Editing code is not an option for me. Flying with out mechjeb is not possible as it is a CORE element to my value in the game. I have faith that either you sarbian or r4m0n know what is wrong. It is my faultering hope at this point you know of a fix for this because until one comes this game is not playable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe described behavior is consistent with something issuing spacebar characters at random times. My experience with MechJeb 2.4.2 and KSP 9.90 has been no worse than the earlier releases. I have successfully completed the career mode through researching all of the tech tree and getting three kerbalnauts to level 5 (1 pilot, 1 engineer and 1 scientist). Admittedly I run a rather clean game with only ModuleManager and MechJeb mods installed (and a few customized parts). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eskips\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
