Some weird electro-magnetic disturbances had been detected in their eastern sea. Under orders from Lieutenant General of the PRAAF (People\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s Republic of Aries Air Force), a Tashoya-Ostrachiv (ThO)-17C was kept airborne at all times, with a regiment of 60 ready to launch at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDavis checked the mission briefing, and noticed something unusual, about this mission. He was ordered to carry four IM-8C semi-active radar guiding missiles, two IM-5E infrared-seeking missiles, the 40mm cannon, and an experimental radar-pod. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Chief Iato, what is with the radar-pod?\u00E2\u20AC Christopher asked the Chief Engineer, as the engine of the fighter started up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Intended to act with the missiles to assist with target-locking from what Command has told me sir,\u00E2\u20AC Iato replied, as the engine of the ThO-17C started up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDavis shut the canopy, and slowly throttled the engine up. He turned the fighter on the runway, and increased the throttle forward. The aircraft ascended rapidly as Lt. Davis headed to his area of patrol. The radar pod was already doing wonders as it extended up to 250km away. Davis armed the six air-to-air missiles, in standard air procedure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Attention, we need airbounds to the capital of Avienne ASAP, there is a crisis, and they need our help,\u0027 the radio squawked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027This is Lieutenant Davis, I am inbound,\u0027 Davis responded, as he sped towards the capital, on full afterburner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter II\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELt. Christopher Davies kept his eyes on the radar, as the interceptor roared toward the destination. He was showing green-lights on all missiles from the screen as the aircraft continued to approach. The 40mm GA-16 cannon was working after a single burst. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Wonder what happened?\u00E2\u20AC Davies asked himself as the aircraft continued on path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, Davies saw the radar flicker off, and he noticed the aircraft felt lighter. \\\u0027Please don\\\u0027t be the radar!\\\u0027 Davies thought to himself urgently, as the rear camera showed the radar pod fly away into the water. \\\u0027God damn it!\\\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout the radar, Davies continued to close in at the destination. With the radar disabled he was only able for visual approach, something not good with missiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153This is Aries Delta-X-Ray, heading for assistance with crisis, request location,\u00E2\u20AC Davies asked in the radio, as he approached the coast around 2,000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no response, as Christopher continued on course, with his fuel running low. As he started to turn to port, he saw a fast approaching jet and helicopter. He was wondering, \\\u0027That\\\u0027s not usual, wonder what it is...\\\u0027 And as he thought about it for thirty seconds, he realized that, \\\u0027Oh Christ! They are the guys I\\\u0027m running from!\\\u0027 And with that, Christopher pushed the aircraft to the ground, to hit the helicopter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Missile lock,\u00E2\u20AC the aircraft kept saying, as Christopher saw a missile detach and roar towards the aircraft. Christopher, knowing the tactics of Avienne aircraft, fired two IM-8C\\\u0027s at the missile. He saw both roar towards the Avienne missile before it exploded, and the aircraft was hit with shrapnel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\\\u0027Time to take out that chopper!\\\u0027 Christopher thought, as he aimed up for a perpendicular attack on the helicopter. He aimed, and opened fire with the cannon as it struck across the lateral of the chopper, over 50% ripping into the tail, shredding it into cheese. For good measure, \\\u0027Hell it\\\u0027s overkill!\\\u0027 he released a IM-5E, exploding near the tail, and wrecking the engine mount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Control Surface Failure!\u00E2\u20AC the aircraft was screaming as someone on the helicopter fired a machine gun, striking the hydraulics. Christopher looked worredly as the aircraft struck the helicopter, the vertical stabilizer ripping off and fluttering to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153This is Delta-X-Ray, bailing out!\u00E2\u20AC Christopher yelled as he threw the ejection handle, and he roared out of the aircraft. As he gazed, he saw a missile roar on his abandoned plane, destroying it in a cloud of shrapnel. Christopher gazed at the helicopter, as it flew out of control, heading to crash. \\\u0027Bless you men,\\\u0027 Christopher thought, as he slowly glided towards land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe jet turned around and started to aim itself at the farther parachute, before loud music was heard. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Of course, Avian Air Force with their loud music at any time,\u00E2\u20AC Christopher muttered as two jets roared, with both releasing missiles which tore the jet apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlowly, Christopher landed on the ground, and could see a house nearby, as well as the abandoned parachute. \\\u0027So this maybe one of the people who captured him...\\\u0027 Christopher thought, as he grabbed the IAR-26 from his pack, and slung it on. He jogged around to the front door, and knocked for a minute. After hearing some sounds inside, Christopher decided he needed to get inside that house.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe twisted his rifle around, and smashed five times, before the door broke down, and collapsed. \\\u0027Alright, now where is that person?\\\u0027 Christopher thought. Seeing that the house had no basement, he turned the corner, and heard the shots of a rifle. It took him a second to realize that he had been shot in the arm. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153God damnit!\u00E2\u20AC Christopher yelled, before he hid behind a wall, and started to wrap his arm up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart C:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChristopher heard the man walk down the stairs, heading towards him. He knew the man was armed with an Avienne rifle, and had to react quickly. \\\u0027Goddamn it, think man. You\\\u0027ve been in worse scenarios,\\\u0027 Christopher thought rapidly. Quickly, he drew his sidearm, and stood up, heading to the man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Put your hands up now! Put the gun down!\u00E2\u20AC the man yelled at him. Christopher looked at the man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Excuse me, sir, but I am Lieutenant Chr...\u00E2\u20AC Christopher started to say before the man turned the gun around, and slammed the butt of the rifle against his face, sending him backwards, and breaking his nose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe saw the man run out the door. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153God damnit!\u00E2\u20AC Christopher yelled, as rifle in hand, he charged out of the door, to see a pick-up driving fast away. Christopher\\\u0027s eyes and eyebrows twitched, as he saw the car drive past him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\\\u0027Alright, what to do, what to do...\\\u0027 Christopher was thinking, when he saw a car right next door, with a man in the car. Quickly, he jogged over to the car, and opened the door, pointing the rifle at the man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Excuse me sir, but I need this car for offi...\u00E2\u20AC Christopher started to say before the man quickly got out of the car, and entered the house.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\\\u0027That was easy,\\\u0027 Christopher thought as he quickly backed the car out of the driveway. After backing up, he put in car in forward motion, and smashed the gas pedal down like he had a lead foot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe car quickly raced forward, on the road as Christopher tried to follow the man he was ordered to. He adjusted the mirror, to suddenly see the house explode in a fireball, with a helicopter right behind him. Christopher\\\u0027s face contorted to a face of anger and he shouted, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Oh come on! Does my life have to be this crazy!?\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, the pick-up he was chasing, turned sharply into the underbrush. Christopher, hit the brakes, and turned sharply. As the car skidded, he gunned the engine, roaring forward, with the helicopter striking a telephone pole, before crashing and starting a major fire. Christopher saw the pick-up swerve on the road, and Christopher pulled out the sidearm, started to fire, at the car.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Okay, whomever you are, I am sick of this. I am now going to stop you and figure out what the hell this is all about.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe man from the pick-up pulled out an automatic, and then he fired it behind him. Christopher ducked, and all above him, the windscreen was shot out, the glass falling towards him. Christopher raised his head, and quickly emptied his clip, four bullets striking the right rear tire, and two in the right fore tire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Holy shit! I am a very good shot apparently. Wonder why I did so bad when shooting during training...\u00E2\u20AC Christopher yelled as the car swerved and smashed right into a tree, the engine quickly lighting into flames.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChristopher hit the brakes, and jumped out of the car, and ran to the pick-up. The man seem to be dazed, and Christopher smashed his arm against the driver\\\u0027s window, breaking it. Christopher grabbed the man, and pulled him out of the burning car, and onto the road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the man slowly sat up, Christopher started to yell at the man, \u00E2\u20AC\u0153God damnit! Why is it that whenever I get something very simple, it always turns complicated! I am sick of this shit!\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Okay... now can you tell me exactly why you came in my house, and shot me while I was on the road?\u00E2\u20AC the man asked Christopher, as he slowly stood up, leaning on Christopher\\\u0027s car.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Alright, first tell me your name.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Ethan, and yours?\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Christopher. Okay, Ethan, I am a Lieutenant in the People\\\u0027s Republic of Aries Air Force. I was assigned on a patrol, and ordered to try to rescue you. I then proceeded at nearly Mach 2 to get to you. My aircraft lost the radar-pod, thus losing my radar, requiring visible identification. After half-an-hour, I saw your helicopter and aircraft. I brought my aircraft in a perpendicular direction to shoot down the helicopter. A gunner from that helicopter shot my aircraft, requiring me to bail out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153The rogue jet was shot down by your air force. After I landed, I saw your parachute, and proceeded to follow the steps to your house. I knocked on the door, and with no response, I broke the door to the house down. I came inside, and checked the first floor, and seeing no one there, I proceeded to go up the stairs. Then you bloody shot me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153After you headed downstairs, I attempted to speak to you who I was, but you shoved your rifle butt at my face. I raced outside, and seeing your pick-up gone, \\\u0027borrowed\\\u0027 a neighbor\\\u0027s car, and chased after you. Your house exploded just after I left, from a helicopter, which then crashed. I then chased you, and shot you, and then you crashed, so that is the situation right now,\u00E2\u20AC Christopher finished, sitting down on the ground, looking at Ethan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153I understand, now can you please give me the car so I can head to Briscanny Airport, right away,\u00E2\u20AC Ethan responded, appearing to not have listened to any of the conversation at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Why do you need to head to the airport? I need to report the situation to my commander, as well as the Head of the State,\u00E2\u20AC Christopher retorted, reloading his side-arm. Ethan pulled out a note, and shoved it at Christopher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Alright, what is this?\u00E2\u20AC Christopher muttered as he opened the note, and read it. He suddenly dropped the not yet loaded pistol, and send a set of prayers rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153That is why, Lieutenant. And I technically outrank you,\u00E2\u20AC Ethan replied, smiling a bit, as he told him he outranked him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Shit, man didn\\\u0027t know, and you can borrow the car, but I am coming with,\u00E2\u20AC Christopher replied, his eyes showing a dangerous glint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Alright, and I\\\u0027ll drive,\u00E2\u20AC Ethan told him, rounding to get in the driver seat, while Christopher ran in the passenger seat, and started to prepare for the situation at the airport. Christopher thought to himself, \\\u0027Well, what a wonderful situation this turned out to be. Worse than the Carteny Crisis.\\\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Wasteland","CreatedById":14093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T19:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone want to comment on this at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T19:54:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, take no reply as a reply too, either people are speechless or don\\\u0027t care at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you refrain from bumping yourself/double posting due to lack of response.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HOC","CreatedById":4374,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-08T08:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOuch... harsh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I read it, and it\\\u0027s certainly action packed! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
