Specifically, ascent profile depends on 2 things: jet TWR and wing loading. The higher the jet TWR, the steeper you can climb to start with and the faster you pick up speed. The smaller the wing, the faster you have to be going for it to generate enough lift to keep you up as the jet TWR decreases with altitude. Relatively small spaceplanes without much wing for their weight but with big engnes really can only work with a steep initial climb relying mostly on thrust instead of wing. Because this is the most common type of spaceplane, this sort of ascent profile has been enshrined as dogma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, big, heavy spaceplanes have to do things differently. Generally, they don\u0027t have enough TWR to climb steeply so they have lots of wing instead. Spaceplanes like this make long, gentle climbs relying on lift to gain altitude instead of thrust. One big spaceplane I made climbed the whole way with the nose only 10^ above the horizon because it had so much wing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
