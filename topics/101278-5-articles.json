I think I\u0027m going to use it more often now that I have it.\n\u003E Secondly: My entry to this challenge. Took three shuttles before we had a successful completion. \n\u003E \n\u003E Inexorable got creamed in orbit when I separated from the main booster tank and didn\u0027t really think before doing any sort of manoeuvring leading to a collision between orbiter and booster tank, RUD swiftly followed, but the crew capsule was still intact! And it probably had the best launch profile of my two exoatmospheric attempts. Was on course for a 230[ish] AP with only around 130dv to circularize on the OMS.\n\u003E \n\u003E Implaccable (inadvertently misspelt), was looking good. Until during booster separation and staging for their parachutes... When I got back to Implacable, I hit space bar again and staged my booster tank, I was in that staging blood lust fury frenzy zone. I wasn\u0027t even going to attempt the abort portion so I didn\u0027t read the rules for that. I got it back in one piece onto KSC Island, but I did dump the fuel tank by decoupling and rolling her inverted to throw the damn thing out, not realising I could use its contents to return. I guess I\u0027ll have to revisit this and then get it above 300km for the Commander bage.\n\u003E \n\u003E Third time\u0027s the charm with Indefatigable. Fuel Pod delivered to 211,489m x 211,589m orbit in Kerbin. It actually got closer than that, but I only have a screen shot of it with the 100m error. Returned to KSC Island - overshot so had to fly a downwind and a baseintofinal approach.\n\u003E \n\u003E So as I understand it, I have met all requirements for Maiden Mission and have a valid entry for Fuel Pod delivery completing Mission Specialist and Pilot I. \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/cMmbr](http://imgur.com/a/cMmbr)\n\nA most excellent mission report!

This mention gets included in your roster listing: \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC \n\nYou have been awarded a \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC  Special Commendation for rescuing the shuttle during an unplanned staging event between the orbiter and external tank during liftoff, having recovered safely all crew and equipment and returned it to a prepared or marked emergency landing site (KSC Island).\n\nCongratulations Commander!\n\nFeel free to complete more missions and award yourself with higher ratings! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is not much of a challenge, but wow: what a shuttle. It practically flies itself. Having tried to build a shuttle of my own that never flew very well, I was amazed at how well this STS-4 handles. I tried it in stock KSP, and it remained nicely balanced all the way to delivering the fuel pod to a perfectly circular 150x150 orbit. I ditched the tank with fuel to spare, so could easily have gone higher. I like the way the fuel tank empties from the bottom and the boosters empty from the top - keeping everything nicely balanced. Why didn\u0027t I think of that?\n\u003E Reentry and landing was also a breeze. I was a bit short of the runway, but as I still had half my monoprop left I used that to push me through. The empty craft glides amazingly well with a nice 10:1 glideslope at an insanely slow 32m/s. It literally lands itself.\n\u003E \n\u003E The STS-4 Dauntless is now definitely part of my fleet.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks.\n\u003E \n\u003E P.S. Sorry, but I didn\u0027t take any pictures.\n\nNo worries. Your statement is good enough to get listed in the roster!
