As the cabin rumbled and vibrated, he saw a faint pink glow out the window, and as it grew in intensity, the vibration grew as well, until it dropped off as he slowed down enough. Just as he hit the button to open the parachute, he heard a jet roar over him to swing around and pick him up.\n\nSo how do I finish this?\n\nThanks again!\n\n-Slab"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T18:35:13Z","Content":"I just want to say you have a great teacher and any subject with KSP in it is a sure winner.

I don\u0027t know either, but in my paper with microsoft word I changed the font so that those lines were different.
