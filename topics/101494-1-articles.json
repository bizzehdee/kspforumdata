Aside from the fact that crew pods have some monoprop (which i myself drain as nothing uses it on most of my craft), is there any good reason not to use a vernor thruster? It doesnt even weigh much more (.08 vs .05, not that being massless matters at all), provides much more utility, and can be used as a backup engine when you have had your main engines shot apart by enemy ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for very very small craft i guess they make some sense, but above 10t i fail to see why anyone would use the smaller rcs.

Then youd technically only need 1 more to get the last axis, making 2 parts to control an extremely lightweight craft. Still, vernors are 5 parts to control any ship up to the 200t levels. 1 backwards, and 4 to each side (forwards can be achieved via main engines). Also, the 4 directionals dont give thrust in any direction, just in 4 directions. From a part count perspective this can be good or bad, depending on what else you need to bring along (monoprop needs dedicated fuel tanks, whcih can be extra part count if you need enough of em).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center of mass in my designs isnt usually an issue, as many of my craft have offcenter thrust to begin with, forcing em to use at least 2-3 reaction wheels to keep it going where i want to.

For example suppose your ship has a command module without fuel and a service module with the fuel, separated by a decoupler; Vernors won\u0027t work on the command module without additional workarounds. RCS thrusters use monopropellant so you can add them anywhere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that\u0027s so about the Vernors. The regular LFO fuel flow rules are overridden for them and they draw LFO in the same manner that monoprop RCS thrusters draw fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T02:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the whole \u0022every ship that needs to dock should be lightweight\u0022 isnt seeing the big picture.
