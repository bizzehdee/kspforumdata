But these are not modular like most ksp parts which kinda is not right since this game is a building game and most parts are modular so I decided to draw a concept for a modular spaceplane parts mod which fits in with the stock cross sections. The mod would also need custom landing gear as the stock ones don\u0027t really fit in as much.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dSxd23o.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002254.58\u0022 height=\u0022654\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dSxd23o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-10T12:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved to General Mod Development Help and Support\uFEFF\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
