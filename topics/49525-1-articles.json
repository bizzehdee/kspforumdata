Got one goo canister? Take a reading and send it off. While that is sending you can take another goo reading and send that off on a second antenna at the same time. If all antennas are busy you have to wait for the retract animation to finish before you can use that antenna again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AletzN1","CreatedById":65154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T02:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell thanks for the answers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T03:04:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe actual numbers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe middle antenna takes 80% as long as the -16, and 50% more power for the same amount of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big antenna takes 60% as long as the -16, and 100% more power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that if you don\u0027t have enough power to at least keep the antenna mostly active (transmitting about 80% of the time), you\u0027ll actually transmit the data faster with a slower antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means that multiple -16\u0027s are almost always better than fewer of the other antennas provided you\u0027re continuously generating reports, not doing one huge batch. The reason for this is because the queueing isn\u0027t done very reasonably, if all the antennas are busy, the new report gets queued to the first antenna that was found, which means that if you do a big batch of reports where you finish queueing them before any finish sending, you\u0027ll get one report each to all antennas other than the first one, all other reports will go out the first antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robsr3v3ng3","CreatedById":18051,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T09:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso there is the weight saving with using the smaller ones instead of the larger ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
