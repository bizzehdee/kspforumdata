Take off is made running on the two Turbo Jet Engines. \n\nClimb out to 14.8K - 15k altitude and a velocity of 400 m/s \u002B/- 50m/s before igniting the Aerospike.\n\nPitch up to 85 degrees and running on both engine types until the Turbo Jets reach 0% efficiency and shut them down. \n\nContinue the burn until AP hits 70K and coast to it. \n\nCircularize the orbit.\n\nIf all has gone to plan you should have just enough left to deorbit.\n\n[http://www./i/?ac9e5aeev02t8jb](http://www./i/?ac9e5aeev02t8jb)\n\n[http://www./i/?d28qw6wt5qp2i6a](http://www./i/?d28qw6wt5qp2i6a)\n\nAnyways, let me know what you think ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nEDIT: Tweaked for better all round handling and orbital maneuvering."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T00:49:00Z","Content":"How big is it?\n\nMy SSTO *Vulcan* is classified as a \\\u0027Heavy\\\u0027 spaceplane.
