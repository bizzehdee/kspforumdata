After mounting twin turbojets on the back of 2 nuclear thrusters, an all liquid fuel space plane was born. It was extended to have a small cargo bay and MK2 docking bay. Despite its ugly look, it managed to reach slightly beyond mun range and (crash) land back on kerbin.\n\nWithout needing oxidizer, the size was able to be kept down to that of a leer jet. Note that this was created with about 50% of the tech tree researched in science sandbox mode.\n\n[Front View](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531769445573508487/962402E34F04375CD8C93B48B85D793EB3545B82/)\n\n[Back View](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531769445573508007/049F1483AA991B63A87B8C27C128146CBF6EF387/)\n\n[Mun Range](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531769445573509355/CAECF7C59E127FF97E9E9E8737A2E5B6175BB880/)\n\n[Cargo Bay](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531769445573509573/0B3790B096FCF73EFE53CED69EC42B545B0741B2/)\n\n[Com Device in Cargo Bay](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/531769445573509909/9EC7D3599B60645FC1AE2032421203969566DAB8/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T02:05:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by evader**\n  \nmissing / broke images"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T14:21:36Z","Content":"Nice work!

To my kerbal\u0027s horror amazement, the space plane just kept going \u0026 going without stopping over or refueling in space. It came to a hair\u0027s length from Eve\u0027s orbit. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nI think it\u0027s the smallest space plane I\u0027ve seen to reach that far, if not counting fuel manufacturing or refuelling (though I did not look around the forums that much).\n\nOn the downside, it\u0027s much harder to take off since it became heavier and much less stable. Fuel transfer between parts must now be micromanaged while exiting the upper atmosphere so it doesn\u0027t flip over.\n\n![a\u003E]()\n\n![a\u003E]()\n\n![a\u003E]()\n\n![AF1AECE7386E0472BF5BEA71B94E22AE1EC97F3B](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/511504951418982262/AF1AECE7386E0472BF5BEA71B94E22AE1EC97F3B/)\n\n![02D39C6F8F51D685F1B2D7E2D8A1F266598E8B5E](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/511504951418982063/02D39C6F8F51D685F1B2D7E2D8A1F266598E8B5E/)\n\n![9D5AC9A70A9159F95A34957DB101A1E9640C6C3B](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/511504951418981811/9D5AC9A70A9159F95A34957DB101A1E9640C6C3B/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T02:31:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by evader**\n  \ninserted images using editor toolbar"}]}
