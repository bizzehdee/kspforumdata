We know angle A = (dish cone angel / 2) degrees, H = 90 degrees, and |AH| = h = min/max distance between Kerbin and Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this info, I should get the correct altitude at which the probe will stay inside the cone of the dish (will call this \u0022y\u0022) from Kerbin, by finding: |HB| - Eve radius (we\u0027ll call this \u0022t\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe total formula should there for be as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex = (((h*sin(y/2))/(sin(180-((y/2)\u002B90))))-r\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the numbers I\u0027m getting doesn\u0027t fix what I see in game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that the minimum altitude, that is the altitude when the two planets are closest, i should 80,573,164.77 meters. However at the moment of testing, the planets are pretty much at the max distance, yet here the cone Barely cover a 78.000.000 meter altitude. Needless to say something is going wrong, either in my assumption about how the cone works, or the way I did the math. Its probably an obvious mistake, but I can\u0027t find it. Please help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Even if I correct for degrees, the result is still absolutely wrong. This is frustrating beyond belief\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Never it was a typo that made the whole thing miss up. I got it now.
