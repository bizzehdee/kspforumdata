Ultimately:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy does the MK3, MK2, and their attachments only come with liquid fuel. The MK2 makes some sense, but the MK3 is so massive that it would have to be an enormous ship that would require far too much fuel since only a single MK3 makes balance an issue (because of ship length)...But then, if you want it to travel into space or in space at all, you need to include, on top of all that liquid fuel, a mix fuel source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thought is, more fuel is used in space than in the atmosphere, so why so much liquid alone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about this...Consider making the MK3 come in 3 different versions?:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. with a cargo hold\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. with just liquid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. with a mixture\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T03:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eor when more advanced tweakables come a fuel version and a cargo version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T03:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027s like that because those parts were introduced in 0.15 and the devs haven\u0027t updated them.
