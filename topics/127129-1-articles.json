Going there will greatly increase science and cash (and hence, more over-priced science tools for even more science and cash), and will give you a few very lucrative - but potentially quite difficult - contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as you get the OKTO core and photovoltaic panels, you can send light probes to the Mun and Minmus.

Jeb will be able to fly the ship (SAS) and Bob will be able to reset the Goo and Jr, assuming he can EVA (upgrade Astronaut Complex). Get up there, and biome hop around a little until you\u0027re almost out of fuel and then come home. Don\u0027t feel bad about alt-F5 to drop named quicksaves, so you can get home even if you pushed the fuel envelope too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat can get you hundreds, if not a thousand or more, science.
