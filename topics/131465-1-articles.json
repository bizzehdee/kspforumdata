That would mean an extra part / plane... I rather play puzzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy solution was to add decouplers on the rocket and a jet-fuselage on it. Than I took the plane apart, and saved the back and front segment separately to put it back together in the VAB. That way it could be saved as subassembly grabbed by the \u0027coupler. Pretty counter-intuitive way - not that it\u0027s a construction I can justify to build every day. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022^_^\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T23:55:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why I prefer the merge button now.
