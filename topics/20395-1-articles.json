I was just messing around with the EVA in space when all of sudden I realized I was almost already in an orbit. So, I did a bit of panicking and managed a pretty much circular orbit! Sadly, since I was just messing around, I don\u0027t have much in the way of pictures, but I\u0027m pretty proud of myself.
