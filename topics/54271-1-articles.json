However as of the later Kethane updates the scanning interface was changed to the new hex map system displayed over the entire planet on map view. I swear I\u0027m literally the only person playing ksp who wasn\u0027t a massive fan? I mean I know the original 1 pixel scan width was ridiculous, but I still preferred the UI window :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAY to the point... I was hoping someone might be able to inform me of or advise me how to get the original scanning UI window back in the 0.9 kethane mod for ksp 0.22! (or a better version somehow)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to do all my scanning from one view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m one for realism and tech\u0027y stuff including my interfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m slightly OCD about my scanning windows and UI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the map view shouldn\u0027t have to be switched to for viewing scanning progress unlike any other scanning mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!
