Surprisingly it did not immediately crash. I played a few more seconds and got a second stack overflow then it did freeze and crash. PC still working normally after KSP was closed. Craft selected was \u0022Citadel\u0022 outside Duna \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E which has 700\u002B parts and gets constant yellow clock. I\u0027ve never seen a stack overflow error before, but I have been ignoring some other errors (from mods I believe) just\u00A0hoping\u00A0they were not critical. I am using MemGraph, which does affect memory but I\u0027ve used that for several sessions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rmn38j75febnp9w/Player%20-%20Copy.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rmn38j75febnp9w/Player - Copy.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
