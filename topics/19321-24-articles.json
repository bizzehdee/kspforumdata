It tells you what angle for each control surface. They are all individual, each potentially different. It is safer to set your deflection to the value is warns you of, but testing the plane yourself is the best way to know what will happen. For some planes it doesn\u0027t seem to matter too much. But FAR gives you the flexibility of choosing what to do with each surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight assistance settings : you can get familiar with the value they start with by default, (They work well for most planes) and then if it doesn\u0027t seem to do much, try doubling the value and see how the plane responds at various speeds, all the way to the plane\u0027s theoretical maximum speed. If a very high setting causes the plane to go crazy immediately, then I find that increasing won\u0027t help - you can try halving it and seeing if that is more stable. While the assistance systems are pretty stable, they can sometimes kind of reveal a plane\u0027s natural instability if they start to freak out. You can try flying the plane without assistance to get an idea of how much correction it has to do, to get an idea of how reasonably controllable a plane is..I noticed that if I needed a very high wing leveler setting, I could imagine what part might be causing trouble especially if it is an unfamiliar (mod) one, or a strut was causing a constant rotating force on the whole plane (a ksp/unity uh..peculiarity, not FAR)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doomydoom","CreatedById":2178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T04:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe higher ups said they needed a business jet that \u0022looked cool\u0022 and could \u0022do all that 10g ****\u0022 but not blow up.

The supersonic lift model has it built into the design, simply because wings can be more effective in supersonic flows if they have some thickness.\u003Cbr\u003ECamber isn\u0027t accounted for for two reasons: first, the way KSP handles mirrored parts is not to actually \u0022mirror\u0022 them; it\u0027s to flip it upside-down. This means that if I were to add any modeling of camber effects planes would spontaneously roll, which while amusing the first time, would get boring very, very fast. The second is that camber doesn\u0027t create lift at supersonic speeds, only drag and pitching moments.

More refinements are planned, but there\u0027s a lot of data for me to go through and the lift of blunt bodies is a very complicated problem. It\u0027s actually a bit harder to deal with than wings due to the flow characteristics (large amounts of flow separation, large pressure changes, pressure drag dominating skin friction drag). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWings detect fuselage interference in the same way they detect wing interference, so the effect is there. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Dirt_Merchant: \u003C/strong\u003ENo hotfix, since I\u0027ve changed how cargo bays are handled and I want to make sure that is working right before I release it. As for most of the control surfaces you ask for, the physics are there for them, though the code doesn\u0027t allow for spoilers for roll control (I\u0027ll admit I don\u0027t quite understand the design reasoning behind choosing spoilers over ailerons, unless it\u0027s easier to maintain or build). You can actually set up a control surface as a flap, attach it to the front of a wing and it will act as a leading-edge slat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll admit I don\u0027t particularly like the use of control surfaces for multiple roles, mostly because then you can get control inputs working a cross-purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Doomydoom: \u003C/strong\u003EThe reason forward swept wings are more likely to rip off is because of the way the wing bends. If the wing is unswept, bending is independent of torsion; it doesn\u0027t affect the higher angle of attack at the wingtips that cause the wing to tear itself apart. If the wing is swept forward, it exacerbates the problem; when the wing bends the wingtips end up at higher angles of attack, which means more torsion and the wing is more likely to tear itself apart. With a swept back wing the wing bends in such a way that if counteracts the problem; bending reduces the angle of attack and fights off torsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA properly swept-back wing can actually ward off all problems of static aeroelastic divergence, only having to worry about flutter. Of course, this is assuming the material is isotropic (acts the same in all directions). Anisotropic materials (read: composites) can be used to counter this. This is why swept forward wings had to wait until composites came along and for most purposes there\u0027s no reason to go with forward swept over backward swept wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design you\u0027ve posted should actually be good; the only problem that I can see are limited to the typical supersonic aircraft problems: with very low aspect ratio wings and most of the mass in long, thin tube your vehicle will be prone to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_coupling\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Einertial coupling\u003C/a\u003E. Now, this doesn\u0027t mean that it will spontaneously explode, it just means that you\u0027ll have to be cognizant of the fact that yawing motion might cause it to pitch up like crazy. The other problem is that it wouldn\u0027t follow Richard Whitcomb\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_rule\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Earea rule\u003C/a\u003E which (in the real world) would determine how much transonic drag it would run into.

As far as spoilers go, or more accurately spoilerons, they are less complicated than are ailerons though this benefit isn\u0027t usually required on small aircraft, but is very apparent on larger, heavier craft that see much higher forces on the control surfaces during deflection. For full details regarding their use, I\u0027d need to do some additional research. As for their use in KSP, I\u0027m not really sure where I\u0027d use them, but given the option, I\u0027m sure I\u0027d come up with some goal requiring their use.

I\u0027m putting together a pair of spaceplanes, using mainly B9 parts. However, the interesting part is this: If I use symmetry to attach paired parts, the CoL invariably twists. \u0022Recalculate CoL\u0022 will occasionally shift it, but the twist remains. If I then separate the symmetry-attached parts by selecting a closer stack part to the root, (usually in my case a fuel tank somewhere near the middle of the central hull) and then reattach it, it\u0027s fine and straight! After this, also, \u0022Recalculate CoL\u0022 resets the CoL to a straight position. But if I then fiddle with a symmetry part again, well, back to twisted it goes. Struts do not seem to have material effect, either. (Incidentally, this also greatly affects my stability derivatives: \u003Cem\u003EXw\u003C/em\u003E refuses to be negative with a twisted CoL, while with a straight one it goes negative without fuss. Also, the state of CoL at save determines whether the plane will fly at all, or start dancing a jig halfway down the runway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt smells of there being a bug somewhere, but I couldn\u0027t really say whether it\u0027s with FAR\u0027s CoL calculation, or in the B9 and/or pWing parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-12T11:20:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2013 11:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Autochton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"grom","CreatedById":57418,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T08:32:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ferram4 expect I\u0027m having it flip out on south/north rotation, so it\u0027s matching the CoL in VAB\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR4Y","CreatedById":66897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T10:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having a interesting and weird thing happening.
