I know that the mod says it\u0027s for 0.25 but the majority of them work fine because the individual mods themselves have mostly been updated to 0.90, if I could find out which mod is being the problem then I can remove it and I\u0027m sure the others will work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can install parts 1 and 2 just fine, it\u0027s just that part 3 - the \u0027Core Mod\u0027 - makes the game crash once the loading screen finishes. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://tny.cz/55884291\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the output log\u003C/a\u003E.

I have no idea what I did, I just installed the rest of the mods to see if I was just missing a piece of the puzzle and it just worked..? I had tried installing them all at once initially and it crashed so I have no clue what fixed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now there\u0027s another problem, there\u0027s a weird flickering texture above all the atmospheric bodies, I got this gif from the title screen as an example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/e8BBGMw.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022e8BBGMw.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look carefully you can see this irritating white flicker over the upper atmosphere and it really kills the immersion of the game when you\u0027re looking at planets from a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYET ANOTHER EDIT: I went in-game and took control of one of my ships in orbit around Kerbin and the flickers are blue now, which I think is meant to be lightning texture. However it\u0027s really odd that it\u0027s flickering equally everywhere and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s meant to be like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T01:05:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 01:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
