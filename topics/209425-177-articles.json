The aforementioned AI Suite 3 is, among other things, an overclocking for dummies application (you can get a faster and more efficient OC manually, but the automatic system does seem to work). The fan controls are handy as well.

As has been discussed many times in this thread before, there is a lot of wriggle room in the definitions, allowing manufacturers of cheap power supplies to put numbers on the stickers those power supplies will only be able to supply for a few milliseconds. Due to these deceptive practices, video card manufacturers tend to massively over-estimate the required power supply needed, just to be safe. Reality is that running a cheap badly built power supply is not a good idea whatever is on the sticker and no matter how much headroom they pretend to have left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood power supplies will provide their sticker capacity over sustained periods of time and often much more than what they are rated for. Also, if and when they fail, they tend to fail more gracefully, preventing damage to the rest of your hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong story short: the manufacturer and model are as important as the number of watts on the sticker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Budgetspaceflight","CreatedById":177250,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T16:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot an old t5088 desktop I\u0027m looking to run ksp on.
