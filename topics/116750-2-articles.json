The most popular mods generate something like 30-50k downloads for any given version (the total download count is a more a reflection of how many versions of an addon exist, rather than just popularity), and how many of those downloaders actually use the addon is a different question. Given the numbers for KSP sales that have been thrown around this suggests that mods aren\u0027t nearly as popular as forum users like to think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo having a relatively user-friendly version of a popular addon incorporated into the stock game is a good thing.

Again, it\u0027s not a player limitation, nor a thing a mod can fix. The base game itself demands that the only part of the universe that can currently operate with the full simulation environment is a small sphere within a near distance of the camera. Everything else is frozen on rails. You can write all the station-keeping code you feel like in something like kOS and it doesn\u0027t do a bit of good unless you occasionally interrupt yourself every few days of gametime to re-focus the camera on the satellites so the KSP game engine will actually allow them to get off rails and do adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be handy if the main game allowed you to sync a few satellites in orbit to each other and lock them on rails TOGETHER as a locked SET, to simulate the stationkeeping that the game engine\u0027s limitations currently makes impossible. It could have tight narrow tolerances and say that before you tie them together into a locked set, you must first put them within very closely the same orbit, just differing by phase angle only - then it could put them all on the \u0022same rail\u0022 - remembering their phase angle offsets and locking them all to one satellite (i.e. remember that satellite C is 120 degrees behind B, which is 120 degrees behind A, and then just calculate A\u0027s position on rails, and derive B\u0027s and C\u0027s positions as being locked at 120, and 240 degrees off from wherever A is.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel Kola","CreatedById":147216,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T06:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d prefer they work on a logical, more in-depth contract system so that THIS comm system has more purpose and not just \u0027hey, look its Remote Tech Lite and you can already do this stuff with half a dozen mods and even better\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContracts should be their #1 priority.

No amount of knowledge of autopilot coding, no amount of expertise with C# or kerboscript, will help fix the fact that KSP itself cannot have multiple vessels all being \u0022active\u0022 at once, all self-correcting themselves like a realistic set of satellites can do. Again, it\u0027s not a player limitation, nor a thing a mod can fix. [...]\u003Cp\u003EIt would be handy if the main game allowed you to sync a few satellites in orbit to each other and lock them on rails TOGETHER as a locked SET, to simulate the stationkeeping that the game engine\u0027s limitations currently makes impossible. It could have tight narrow tolerances and say that before you tie them together into a locked set, you must first put them within very closely the same orbit, just differing by phase angle only - then it could put them all on the \u0022same rail\u0022 - remembering their phase angle offsets and locking them all to one satellite (i.e. remember that satellite C is 120 degrees behind B, which is 120 degrees behind A, and then just calculate A\u0027s position on rails, and derive B\u0027s and C\u0027s positions as being locked at 120, and 240 degrees off from wherever A is.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoo... I was actually thinking of writing a mod to do this. I was going to call it the orbital correction device, or OCD for short. I don\u0027t have time to do it now, or anytime in the near future, I don\u0027t even have a C# environment on my computer at the moment. But I don\u0027t think it should be too complicated. I don\u0027t feel any ownership of it and most certainly would not object to someone else making it based on the approach below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP stores orbital information as Semi-Major axis, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of PE, longitude of ascending node, mean anomaly at epoch and epoch. Of these, only the semi-major axis has any affect on orbital period. Vessels with the same orbital period maintain station relative to each other, and this is represented accurately by the patched conics used in KSP. There is no need to maintain a list of other satellites in the constellation or fix phase angles, it is sufficient to give them all the same SMA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe code would execute every time a vessel is unloaded, and would look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ea = semi major axis of orbit of the vessel being unloaded\u003Cbr\u003EMake a list of other vessels orbiting the same body\u003Cbr\u003EFor each vessel in the list\u003Cbr\u003E    b = semi major axis of orbit of the vessel from the list\u003Cbr\u003E    if |a-b|/a\u0026lt;0.0001 then\u003Cbr\u003E        a=b\u003Cbr\u003E        Break from loop\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are probably a few other useful features, like syncing SMA with that of celestial bodies as well as vessels (this would make stable quasi-lagrange points at L3, L4 and L5). It might also make sense to tune the 0.001 threshold above to different celestial bodies and altitudes to make sure it is always neither trivial nor impossible to achieve.
