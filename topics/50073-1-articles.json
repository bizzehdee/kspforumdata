I\u0027ve looked around for help on how to start researching things and everyone shows launching rockets or just dumping your command module out on the launch platform. The problem I had was that the command module was not in my list of available parts. Looked around for solutions to this and never found any. Finally, it dawned on me that I have MechJeb2 installed. Not sure how to uninstall it, I did a fresh install of KSP .22 and there was the missing command module!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to start playing, now!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toomuchbrew","CreatedById":57346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T18:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are not the first person posting about missing parts on the initial career mode start. I have mechjeb running (someone made a hot fix so it works in career mode). I have done everything at least once before I installed mechjeb. It is much better and more rewarding to be able to fight your way through and perform each challenge without the help of mechjeb. Once you do that, mechjeb makes playing time more efficient. I don\u0027t get a hell of a lot of time to play, so taking care of the mundane stuff while i do something else is a real blessing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre my ribbons showing up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: never mind, there they are.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-22T18:56:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2013 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by toomuchbrew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFound them\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
