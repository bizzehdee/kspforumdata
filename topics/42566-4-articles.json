With Negative stability, it\u0027s already trying to turn in any direction it can get the tiniest start in, and the only reason it doesn\u0027t is the computer making constant adjustments to keep it flying straight. So when you actually command a maneuver of some kind, it pretty much literally LEAPS into it. As opposed to a plane with Positive Stability(which you have to drag kicking and screaming into the maneuver) or Neutral Stability (which just sits there unresisting as you move it around).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on ANY plane with fly-by-wire, you\u0027re not actually in control of anything. Your inputs just tell the computer what you want it to do, and it figures out how to accomplish that and carries it out (within limits, in most designs). The F-16 for example. The original version of the F-16\u0027s Side-Stick didn\u0027t actually move, at all. (I guess it uses strain sensors or something?) The pilots had tons of problems with that, so it was modified to have an EXTREMELY small amount of play in it. I also gather from things I\u0027ve read that the computers actually limit the maneuverability on it, and that there\u0027s some kind of a toggle that can set the limit to either a higher or lower setting as desired.

Parachutes are extremely finicky to make and pack (and repack), needlessly complicating and delaying the turnaround for next flight. SpaceX is aiming for \u0022Fuel up, stack up, apply payload, fly again\u0022. Yes, in the real world the turnaround time will probably still be weeks - it takes easily 4-6 weeks to integrate a rocket at the launch site from pre-built stages and prepared payload and obviously if you are reusing previously flown hardware, any checks and repairs have to be added to that. But why add something that definitely needs to be constantly repaired/replaced? Also parachutes are dead weight when going up. Coming down using the engines only adds the weight of the legs (which you\u0027d need anyway) and needed fuel (which is incredibly small percentage of the total fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, chutes scale poorly when the size and weight of the payload increases (like, say, a large rocket stage).[/QUOT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorporations like Virgin and others are attempting to get away from the rocket idea. Its inefficient and costly, they are going for more winged craft that take off like every other plane and get into orbit that way. Space x its self proved that the idea was possible, these new balancing rockets are for interplanetary craft to mars and the moons of Jupiter. Or at least that is what the engineers are planning. In my opinion the first company to get to the moon on a budget of 100 million or less will be able to make some good money extracting He3 and other compounds that are expensive to synthesize here on Earth. There is money to be made in space its just not quite marketable yet, and tourism is not going to be paying for it all.
