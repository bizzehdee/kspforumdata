Once I hit 1700 m/s at around 20km up, I adjust my ascent trajectory with Mechjeb to point the nose about 20-25 degrees up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane pitches up VERY violently and spins out of control, well before the engines flame out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen flying level, my CoL is slightly behind my CoM, so it\u0027s nice and stable. However, when pitching up about 20-25 degrees, the CoL moves forward, which causes the sudden and violent orbital insertion spin of doom. At more normal speeds and altitudes, Mechjeb can use the canards and elevators to compensate without much trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I prevent/reduce the CoL\u0027s forward movement as the plane pitches up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings are large and delta-ish, for low supersonic drag and plenty of room between the CoM and elevators. I would really rather not decrease wing size, as that would severely limit the amount of stuff the ship can carry. (Design goal is 1 orange tank and able to take off before the runway\u0027s end, and no stalling issues when transiting from low-altitude sharp ascent to supercruise.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECanards removed \u0026amp; wings resculpted.

The spaceplane lacked reaction wheels (I thought they were installed), and suffered from a relative air intake deficit (less than 1:1) which limited maximum air-breathing altitude and forced the orbital insertion window much lower than normal. Both design flaws have been fixed, and the aircraft now meets or exceeds all of my design criteria.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-04T09:37:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2013 09:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ThatSpacePlaneGuy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T23:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry pitching up slower?

It also has a habit of oversteering sometimes, so your 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA change might temporarily go to, for example, 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, before settling back onto the requested course. As far as I know, it has either no or very little knowledge of aerodynamic stability, so will just jam the controls hard over for large changes, even if that means a guaranteed loss of control incident. A spin out of the type you mention tends to become likely when the heading strays too far away from the current prograde vector. So, if you do your change more gradually, e.g. in 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA or 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA increments, allowing time for the prograde vector to catch up with the new heading, the problem may well go away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does very much depend on the design of the plane, however.

It\u0027s infinitely more steady and precise than trying to use a keyboard to fly. Occasionally it requires some manual input to remove unwanted roll, but this particular spaceplane only requires a couple periodic Q or E taps during ascent.

And that would likely happen even in level flight. Your goal is not to pitch your plane\u0027s nose 20 degrees up, your goal is to pitch your trajectory 20 degrees up, and you need to guide your plane there.

I can\u0027t see from your pictures where the fuel tanks are, and what sizes they are, but careful movement of fuel could well get the mass forward for you. Also, if those are turbojets on the top of the tail, you could move them forward, as their exhaust doesn\u0027t damage things like rocket exhausts do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing which looks a little odd, but it could just be the angles of the photos. If those are the B9 SABRE intakes on the group of 4 nacelles, I believe the angle on them is supposed to be pointing downwards, so that they are facing more into the airflow when you have a positive angle of attack. They might be fine, it just looks like some of them might be pointing in odd directions, but hard to tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow heavy is this thing? If you\u0027ve got SABREs on there, I\u0027m slightly surprised at having turbojets as well, and levelling out at 20km. I thought the SABREs generally kicked the turbojets out for both power and fuel efficiency. A couple of planes I\u0027ve been working on use SABREs, the smaller one taking about 80\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153100t up to 100km orbit on a pair of SABRE Ms, and the larger one taking 200t up on quad SABRE Ms. Every plane and pilot has their preferred altitude for gaining speed, but 20km seems maybe a little low to me, for SABREs \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC I tend to level out at about 25km to gain speed. Perhaps gaining your speed at 25km might help with the spin out issue, due to the thinner air there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T07:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd mass to the front and your problems are solved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatSpacePlaneGuy","CreatedById":85074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T10:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I finally discovered one particularly massive issue: The plane COMPLETELY lacked reaction wheels (aside from those in the cockpit, which are woefully inadequate for a plane of this size). I thought I installed a cluster of three heavy-fuselage reaction wheels near the back of the ship, but apparently that was a different version. I shuffled the fuselage parts a bit to add in three reaction wheel pieces without altering CoM/CoL relation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue (as pointed out by Murph) was my orbital transfer altitude: It was far too low. I was getting flameout-prevention thrust loss at around 20 km - where the air is too thick to execute the nose-up maneuver without losing control. As it turns out, the centerline Sabre had NO air intakes whatsoever, and the two inboard ramjets also had no air intakes - so I had a HUGE air intake deficit. I added several radial-mount air intakes, and the plane can now begin orbital insertion at ~25 km, and burn air-breathing ramjets all the way up to ~55 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe combination of higher orbital insertion altitude with extra intakes and reaction wheels for extra rotational authority has fixed the problem. The spaceplane is now quite a pleasure to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your question, those other engines are not turbojets - they are ramjets, from the mod \u0022Taviero\u0027s Pizza and Aerospace\u0022. They perform quite well at high speed, and similar to Sabre engines, their thrust does not taper sharply to zero as you approach a vaccuum. Sequentially switching Sabres from air-breathing to rocket mode as altitude increases conserves a lot of rocket fuel during orbital insertion, and ramjets give statistically significant thrust almost all the way up to main engine cutoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spaceplane weighs 184 tons fully fueled, with no cargo. Carrying an orange tank, it weighs 218 tons. (975 delta-V remaining upon establishing circularized 300 km orbit, before consuming any of the orange tank\u0027s fuel.) Since the cargo bay is right on the CoM, the flight profile of the spaceplane is NOT altered by hauling an orange tank. The thrust-to-weight ratio just goes down a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, thanks to careful design and shuffling parts around on the airframe, the CoM when fuel-full and CoM when fuel-empty are almost identical, so the spaceplane doesn\u0027t even fly differently upon re-entry - just lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-04T10:34:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2013 10:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ThatSpacePlaneGuy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
