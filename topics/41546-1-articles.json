It was able to house 20 kerbals, and what do you do when you land a space station with that many kerbals on board? Obviously, you take a picture of them all. About 15 minutes into lining the kerbals up, I was perhaps on the 17th one. When he it the ground and fell over, the screen suddenly went black, and the altimeter went berserk. In addition, when I tried to return to the space center, it showed a black screen with a back arrow. This made me think of danny\u0027s video when he went into the jool atmosphere and broke the universe in a similar manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink to the video is right\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kkeb5-u3-lY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E if you haven\u0027t seen it.
