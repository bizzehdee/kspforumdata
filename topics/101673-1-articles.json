On Ubuntu there is a program to install new drivers (I believe it\u0027s called \u0022Jockey\u0022. Just search for \u0022drivers\u0022 on the main menu). Choose the \u0022Nvidia proprietary driver\u0022. After install and reboot, it should run.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coco146","CreatedById":65367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T11:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou were absolutely right.
