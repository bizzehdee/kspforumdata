On Ubuntu there is a program to install new drivers (I believe it\u0027s called \u0022Jockey\u0022. Just search for \u0022drivers\u0022 on the main menu). Choose the \u0022Nvidia proprietary driver\u0022. After install and reboot, it should run."},{"CreatedByName":"coco146","CreatedById":65367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T11:55:31Z","Content":"You were absolutely right.
