I\u0027m using a lenovo u410 notebook. These are the specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3rd Generation Intel Core i7-3537U (3.10GHz 1660MHz 4MB)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8GB Ram\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNVIDIA Gforce 610M (1GB)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows 8.1 64bit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(\u003Ca href=\u0022http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/u-series/u410/#tab-tech_specs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/u-series/u410/#tab-tech_specs)\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am playing with all RO, RSS, RP-0 mods installed plus KAS/KIS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am running the game 1680x1050 (same as my external monitor), with most quality settings set to low or lowest. And using open-GL (is that a good idea? I read that running open GL can also cause your FPS to drop, depending on your system?) and dynamic texture loading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, my game runs kinda sloggish. When launching rockets the game kinda \u0027slows down\u0027, what should take ~30s (I know cause, for example, my SRBs are set to burn for 30s), sometimes takes more like ~2mins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou guys have any suggestions on what to do to make my game run more smoothly? (apart from getting a better computer) I don\u0027t have a lot of knowledge when it comes to games/performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFew things: when looking at the kerbal base (where you can click VAB, research center etc, so when not in flight) the game is running at 7fps, with all settings to lowest ( I think), flying crafts in atmosphere is kinda hard, as the FPS is so low and the game responds so slowly, performance seems to increase when reaching space. Don\u0027t really know why my comp has such a hard time running RO. Stock KSP runs fine with low settings, and I think 8 GB Ram should do be enough..?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Ram usage (according to windows task manager): KSP does not seem to use more then 1,5-2g of RAM when playing. Another thing I noticed is that when I have no programs open, windows task manager still tells me that arround 50% / 4gig of ram is being used. Anyone know why this is? All the programs listed in the task manager only add up to about 1.5gig Ram, no idea where the remaining 2,5gig goes...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelp would be very much appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-11T13:07:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2016 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CitizenVeen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-24T07:28:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure your laptop is plugged in and not in power saving mode.

The rest do not slow your PC. You can also lower the resolution of your game and played in window mode if you want to keep pixels corresponding to your screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also lower the time between 2 physic ticks. It\u0027s somewhere in the setting area. First page I think. And while you are there and have a lot of flying debris, lower their count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe weak part of your computer is the GT610 ( I have the same one ). The rest is fine. Just be sure that your processor can get into turbo mode and isn\u0027t stuck at 1,66GHZ. Normally if you haven\u0027t changed it in your BIOS, you should be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConcerning RSS and the RO mod list, the one that I found to be quite resources consuming are Smoke Screen and Real Plume. To my knowledge, it is possible to play without them. Cloud packs can also slower your game, especially in low orbit ( \u0026gt;250KM)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you mean external screen, do you duplicate screens or do you just transfer from one to an other?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never noticed any performance issues when it comes to OpenGL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd lastly, there is your ship design. If your rocket is mainly made of struts, this may also slow things a bit. If your try to put 1000 pieces in orbit, don\u0027t worry about it, even newer PC can have trouble to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally when 1.1 is out, you will notice an increase in performance.
