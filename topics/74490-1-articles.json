You\u0027d have time your launch and launch into a polar orbit at the right time to match the plane of the mun\u0027s orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor our moon I\u0027m not sure, it would mean our tides would be very weird, when the moon was near the equator then the tides would be pretty much like now, but when it was directly above the pole, tides would effectively stop, at high tides near the poles and low tides at the equator until the mun became low enough again. The point on the surface with the highest tides would corkscrew around the planet, So each month you\u0027d have tides going from changing like they are now to pretty much stopping, then back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to consider is sometimes the polar orbit would be perpendicular with the direction of the sun, and sometimes aligned. When it was aligned you\u0027d be getting spring tides every day, and when it was perpendicular, you\u0027d get neap tides every day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the spin of the earth and moon, I\u0027m not sure what would happen there. The moon has a stabilising effect of the Earth\u0027s spin, stopping it getting too eccentric, I don\u0027t know what difference a polar orbit would have but I expect it wouldn\u0027t have the same stabilising effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallace","CreatedById":77574,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T16:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso it would be possible to land a craft where it would be stuck in the dark for several days and unable to run without RTGs (or about 9001 batteries).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s already possible, but you\u0027d now be able to land somewhere where you were in the dark for about a quarter of the kerbal year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: actually it\u0027s not more than 1 day in the dark at the moment, I misunderestimated the speed of a Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-08T16:08:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2014 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wallace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T16:05:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECome to think of it, I\u0027m kinda want that in KSP. \u0022Challenge\u0022 planet, like Inaccessible from Planet Factory, is welcome.
