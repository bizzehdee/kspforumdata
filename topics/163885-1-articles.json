If so, what\u0027s his skill level? That will make a huge difference in drill and converter efficiency. As for the drill saying \u0022operational\u0022, I think that may be that your ore tanks are full. Just guessing, though. Try jettisoning the ore in your tanks and check to see what the drill says afterward. For quick advice, four or five star engineers are my usual choice for drilling. Tough in the early game, I know, but even three stars will make a huge difference. Also, for future operations, two of the large drills are all you need. They produce a tremendous amount of ore. Especially with a good engineer. And personally, I try to always use the medium size thermal controls. Usually, one for each large drill. Overheating can be a big problem when drilling. Especially with a lower skill engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-30T15:13:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2017 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NewtSoup","CreatedById":178829,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-30T15:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks once again \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0I figured it was probably over engineered but that\u0027s fine. \u00A0The ore tanks are not full but getting close. \u00A0There is an engineer on board but she\u0027s only 1 star at the moment. \u00A0I\u0027ve not sent her to solar orbit yet. \u00A0She has done EVA on Mun and in orbit around the Mun. \u00A0So she should get a nice boost. \u00A0I\u0027ll take your recommendations to Minmus Base ( Rura Penthe ) as it\u0027s still in planning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-30T15:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223135414\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163885\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221501428803\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022178829\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NewtSoup\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, NewtSoup said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks once again \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0I figured it was probably over engineered but that\u0027s fine. \u00A0The ore tanks are not full but getting close. \u00A0There is an engineer on board but she\u0027s only 1 star at the moment. \u00A0I\u0027ve not sent her to solar orbit yet. \u00A0She has done EVA on Mun and in orbit around the Mun. \u00A0So she should get a nice boost. \u00A0I\u0027ll take your recommendations to Minmus Base ( Rura Penthe ) as it\u0027s still in planning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHa.
