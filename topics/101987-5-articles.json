In 1969 there was no good household comparison, so they talked about \u0022layers of aluminum foil\u0022, which gave people the wrong impression. But we have a great visualization today. If you look at a picture of the LEM, the pressure hull looks like a can lying on one side, with the cockpit windows in one end. That hull was about triple the thickness of an aluminum can\u0027s skin, and holding only about one-third the pressure of a shaken soda can (4.8 psi vs. 15 psi). So they landed on the moon in a soda can. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E An astronaut could have punctured it if careless with a screwdriver or other tool, but not easily by-hand.
