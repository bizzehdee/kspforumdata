Recently I have been having a problem with the Powered Hinge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works fine until I dock with something. In this case The FusTek Airlock, then it wants to rotate backwards. What can I do about this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is an image of the rover The Artimus Assembler Mk VIII, driving the 2.1 km to the base. Followed by an image of the rover with the AirLock docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the bottom is the Mark IV rover moving the Observation node to the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/1101419084259222643/38B00D0A92D8BE742FABB83133FD7C19F5B7DE40/\u0022 alt=\u002238B00D0A92D8BE742FABB83133FD7C19F5B7DE40\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/1101419084259414977/5A6B224CBDBA79C9E5E9B76A40BFDAE8F1FB65C0/1024x640.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x640.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/1100292456312765975/BE48BB453967107580C4BD20A0999DB1E34C7387/1024x640.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x640.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
