It consists of \u003Cstrong\u003E50% [50T]\u003C/strong\u003E Ore, \u003Cstrong\u003E40% [40T]\u003C/strong\u003E MetalOre, and \u003Cstrong\u003E10% [10T]\u003C/strong\u003E Xenon Gas. For simplicity, let\u0027s assume that all 100% of the asteroid mass is mineable resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I send a mining ship that has storage space for 55T Ore and only 35T MetalOre, and start my drills, I\u0027m assuming the following will happen:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ore tank fills to 50/55 Tons because that\u0027s all the asteroid has. The MetalOre tank fills to 35T, but I\u0027ve read somewhere that if the resource tanks are full, the drills won\u0027t stop drilling, leading to wasted resources. This means I\u0027ll most likely have to shut off the drills before this point, but let\u0027s just assume my reflexes are insane, and 35.00T Metal Ore is all that\u0027s drilled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf my thoughts are correct, then after storing away all resources that I\u0027ve collected so far, I should be able to send up a mining vessel that has storage space for all other resources that are on the asteroid (In this case, 10T Xenon Gas, and 5T MetalOre), and collect them all, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully this example makes sense, because I\u0027m trying to figure out if my thought process is correct before committing a load of time and resources to designing a MEGA mission in my Science Mode save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Overview, for those who are curious:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a Jool-5, but with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E and Extraplanetary Launchpads to build the lander.
