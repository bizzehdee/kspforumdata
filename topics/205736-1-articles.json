In a 2019 interview between Shadowzone and Nate Simpson, when asked about the possibility of alien species being in the game, he said he had no comment but \u201Cthere are some pretty interesting things out there\u201D. My theory is that they will actually add krakens as an alien species from a different star system!

However, as far as adding a literal kraken species to the game, it seems a bit of a stretch if you ask me. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s impossible, but most likely improbable given what we know about the current direction of the game.
