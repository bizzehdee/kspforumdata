They took a while to gain enough power to push the ship up and that is where Mechjeb was most needed in the mission ( otherwise it is hard to avoid the ship to start dancing in the launch pad until it crashes unless you have a good control over it ( I don\u0027t ) ). Anyway. I started turning the ship at 10 km ( standart mechjeb fight program ) and I activated the aerospikes there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XqRry.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XqRry.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI let the fuel in the lateral tanks to end to detach them \u002B the jet engines.

The flight plan was good enough for leaving lest than 300ish m/s for that manouver.

Will burn here until the orbit gets to 22-30 km inside kerbin atmosphere ( that gives the magic IRL 6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA reentry angle good enough for a Mun return trajectory )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NOKtI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NOKtI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip trajectory after final burn. In here unfortunately had to run not on full throttle, since even a little thrust diference can mean the diference between failing the atmosphere, doing a decent aerobrake or crashing hard in the floor because the parachutes malfunctioned due to the high reentry speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NOVmw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NOVmw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this originally wasn\u0027t even supposed to leave the atmosphere, I have not putted a decoupler between the capsule and the rest of the ship ( it has 3 small parachutes, but that was legacy of the previous design I was testing before trying this and that I forgot to take out... they aren\u0027t even attached to the capsule, but to the lateral tanks ). Anyway, we have enough of fuel to do do a powered descent if we do some parachute assisted aerobraking \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Bbm9.png\u0022 alt=\u00229Bbm9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest I was not expecting that the parachutes would hold, but they did. Unfortunately, as the ship is quite top heavy at this point, the torque overwhelmed the Mechjeb SAS. This could be really bad news if the parachute opening would tear the connection between the fuel tank and the capsule, since there are no chutes in the capsule itself \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PuDD7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PuDD7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some heavy balancing of the ship using the capsule SAS and the force of the opening parachutes I managed to rotate the ship to the right direction. And, in spite of knowing that his ship could hold a impact to the ground above 10m/s ( previous tests ... for science and Kerbalkind sake ), there was no harm in doing a proper soft landing. Too bad we touched down in water ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bj29t.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bj29t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip floating , using Mechjeb to avoid tumbling to the side, while waiting for the Kerbal Navy to rescue them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rype0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rype0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal stats of the flight.
