Up until now I\u0027ve mostly been adding features to support KSPI and the CTT, and those parties are aware of what TM can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe short version is that each tree shows \u0027part\u0027 of the total tree at a time. If any tech is on more than one tree, then researching it in one place will research it in all places. Some exceptions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) An \u0027external\u0027 node must be researched on another tree. Its serves as a start node for sub-trees that don\u0027t want to include all the techs. So, for example, you can branch off of a late game tech as your starting point for your sub-tree and not have to include all the earlier nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The \u0027hideIfNoBranchParts\u0027 option will hide a node if none of its children\u0027s nodes have parts. To work properly, this actually checks all trees for parts, not just the tree that one node is defined on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Part assignment.. This one is kinda nasty. If a part is assigned to more than one tech, via multiple different trees, the first tree to assign it wins. The other tree(s) will be ignored when it comes to assigning that part. This is one reason I recommend MM should be used for part assignment and TM should not be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cvod","CreatedById":110540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T18:06:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s not any chance you\u0027d be interested in making a replacement for TreeEdit too, is there?
