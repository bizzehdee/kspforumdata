(IIRC, the tech guys were able to avoid a reprimand for misuse of government equipment, partly because they de-jury rigged the components back to regular use after the mission was over, and partly because the duty officers wanted to see the live coverage, too. Presumably, the landing and EVA, and the re-entry and splashdown, were also shown on that jury-rigged set for those on duty during them, too...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
