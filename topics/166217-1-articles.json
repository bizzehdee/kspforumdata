I recently sent of a module to to my space station and placed a cylindrical in-line\u00A0battery and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Supplies cylinder between a few of the mannable compartments and now I can\u0027t reach those places. I find it ridiculous that the benefit of the doubt could not be given that there is a hole in the center of a huge battery, allowing passage to the rest of the station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there isn\u0027t, I suppose i\u0027ll just de-orbit the defective part and use the cheat console to rendezvous the modified module. But I don\u0027t want to have to do this because it negates so many design configurations\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might even look into learning how to mod, if this doesn\u0027t already exist. That\u0027s how much I want to be able to pass through a damn food bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-06T21:48:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223188214\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166217\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221507325459\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158821\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ItsSeanBroleson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, ItsSeanBroleson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone aware of a mod that allows you to pass through in-line parts,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn stock game,there is no such restriction.This is coming from a mod you have installed,if i would make a blind guess it is probably from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/109972-130-connected-living-space-v1253-1-jun-2017-localization/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECLS\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo,you need to remove that mod or write \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch to override the restriction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
