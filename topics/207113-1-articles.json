It\u0027s the \u0022Equality\u0022 rocket mod. It uses a model of the Omnidroid rocket, half cut to make the lower stage in Windows\u0027 3D editing apps and converted for use in Blender and Unity, finally making my own modding dreams a reality. If you can launch spacecraft that heavy, like a 4 ton satellite, you gotta have this addon. It\u0027s in Beta, which means the rocket won\u0027t appear in KSP, despite it being loaded. The KSP modding community would be happy to make improvements to the rocket, because I included a COLLADA file in the zip to make improvements.
