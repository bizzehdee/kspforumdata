On all those renders, the planet scale is only 1 unit wide, which results in a \u0022fat\u0022 haze, i suppose bigger planets can get a better looking haze.\n\nHere is the node setup, just in case anybody wants to use it (I know, it\u0027s confusing...):\n\n![bsqdV84.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bsqdV84.jpg)\n\nNote: The clouds used in the render are KSPRC clouds!

Just turn on the material index pass in the render layers, then in the material properties for the atmosphere go to the settings and give the material a pass index. Now in the compositing you can mask out individual materials for all kinds of fun. Below I\u0027m giving just the sun a multi-layered blur effect. Makes it a ton easier to control the individual materials.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n\u003E ![BgSBicX.png](http://i.imgur.com/BgSBicX.png)\n\nNot sure how it would look but maybe worth a try.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T17:11:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by esinohio**"}]}
