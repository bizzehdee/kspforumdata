I was wondering if there would be any interest in having a mobile app that lets you view various in game stuff like resources on a ship etc as well as control it. If there\u0027s interest I\u0027ll be developing it in Unity for mobile devices so that it can be extended by other modders etc. Does this seem appealing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGin (The amazing)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T09:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t see my post as an insult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy should one use an inferior device to present parts of information and control a game?
