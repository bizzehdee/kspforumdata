I am not trying to steal ksp\u0027s audience or anything. I just need to know what you think about my game so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have screenshots of a map here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.alerios.co.uk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.alerios.co.uk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this game there are 2 dwarven teams. They have to gather resources and buy building such as walls, blacksmiths, and forges. Teams can start killing eachother from the very start of the game even with basic tools such as a dwarven hammer. It is a 10 - 36 player game with even teams. It isn\u0027t even in alpha state, I just recently released the first playable (which no-one but me can have). Please leave feedback about the graphics of the game and the idea at its core. I am still working on mechanics for it so I can not release a demo/trailer kind of thing yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gniuz","CreatedById":57846,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T09:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom looking at the screen shots its not a game I\u0027d play, I don\u0027t like the \u0022blocky\u0022 3D games that are becoming more and more popular at the moment. It looks a lot like ace of spades, guncraft, minecraft and probably many more in the same vain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of gathering resources and buying buildings is a nice touch I must admit, but at the same time what is the balance between doing this and just wanting to go and cave people heads in? as you stated you can just go kill the other team from the start and this must be more fun than resource gathering!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand your at the very early stages of developing your game and don\u0027t give up chasing your vision. I am but one gamer among a lot of gamers and there is a definite group of gamers who really enjoy this style of game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a developer (not games developer) myself I would say don\u0027t be scared to push into areas that you don\u0027t feel comfortable in as it gets you thinking in different ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish you all the best in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KOCOUR","CreatedById":37749,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T10:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would not play this.
