On the one hand it could be an amazing platform for all sorts of missions, even if only the block I ever flies 70 tonnes to orbit is pretty impressive. It enable missions that could otherwise only be performed using propellant depot architectures (which unfortunately are no where close to being mature technologically). If you\u0027re looking at variable costs SLS should cost $7million USD per tonne to LEO, which way outperforms both the Space Shuttle or the Saturn V as HLVs go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand they are talking about launch rates so low that there isn\u0027t going to be any economies of scale, and they will not be able to amortize the (substantial) development costs over many launches. Also as people have pointed out it already looks like, given the current budget environment, that NASA will get trapped into the same cycle they were stuck in with STS, which is that the launch system and its support infrastructure is so expensive that they won\u0027t be able to afford developing any interesting payloads that could actually use the rocket\u0027s considerable capability to its full potential. Part of me sees that for many American politicians the SLS is a useless jobs program, and that makes me want to ditch it just on general principle. Another part of me knows that if SLS gets cancelled NASA won\u0027t have a HLV for probably another decade or two, and though I have lots of faith in Elon Musk and SpaceX I don\u0027t see the Falcon XX coming to the rescue anytime soon. These things take a while to develop, even if there is a mandate and a solid budget, which currently there is not. There aren\u0027t really any serious efforts to develop flight qualified NTR or propellant depots systems that we would need to say, go to mars for real using only Falcon Heavy class launchers. Do we abandon the progress that\u0027s been made (and the 2030 Mars timeline) and try to stick it out by putting our faith in capitalist enterprise?
