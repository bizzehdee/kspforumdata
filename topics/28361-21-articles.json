However, I do want to raise the following points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The latest public version (R0.03.5a) has a total on-disk size of ~20 MB; contrast this with the (current) iteration of my dev build, which is just ~4 MB. I suspect that once loaded in-game, there would be a greater improvement in RAM usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There is something peculiar about the way texture overriding works in KSP 0.20\u002B\u0027s MODEL{} nodes - specifically, if you are trying to override textures by calling from another location, you must already have another set of textures in the same directory as your .MU model files. In trying to use \u0022common\u0022 texture/bump/emissive atlases for my parts, I encountered the following dilemma as a consequence of this quirk:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- If I kept each CFG / model organized into individual folders like in R0.03.5a, and then try to make a texture override call to the common atlases in another directory, the parts end up being white and untextured in-game. One workaround would be to put dummy textures in each of the folders, but the prospect of having 80\u002B \u0022empty\u0022 PNGs sitting around is not only unappealing, but would also lead to mass confusion for those attempting to extend my work.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- I could also just put all the CFGs and models in the same directory as the atlases, although it would end up being a bit less organized\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some head-scratching, I opted for the latter, but also decided to bundle all my station parts inside one big \u0022Station Parts Expansion\u0022 subfolder under FusTek - this will allow me to do other FusTek projects (like that MSEV) without lumping everything in one big mess inside the main FusTek folder:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/299/e/7/ksp_fustek_optimization_wip_27_oct_2013_4_by_sumghai-d6ry8to.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp_fustek_optimization_wip_27_oct_2013_4_by_sumghai-d6ry8to.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFig 40\u003C/strong\u003E - (WIP) FusTek Station Parts - Optimization for R0.04a (4)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I went from 80\u002B PNGs down to (currently) nine PNGs, most of which are tiny \u0022swappable\u0022 graphics for the Module Icons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Another limitation regarding model nodes is that multiple copies of the same animation won\u0027t work properly.
