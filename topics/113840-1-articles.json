They were mounted under a mk1-2 pod with batteries and little rcs tanks attached. On the other side a large reaction wheel, then a fairing base. The cubic peices and attached bits were inside the interstage fairing. They exploded due to heat, but where from, had a single mainsail under an orange and a half and two radial SRB\u0027s. Saw in a thread in the Spacecraft Exchange someone else complain about stuff attached to a large reaction wheel explode on ascent. Cannot do anymore testing right now just a heads up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I have this problem with my Orion, a cubic strut I clipped inside the fairing explodes when I launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T01:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone reported on one of my mod threads that the mod\u0027s reaction wheels were appearing to spontaneously overheat.
