I am not posting this on spacecraft exchange because it seems more like a generic airplane-design topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJack Northrop felt that the concept of a flying wing was sound because it eliminated parasitic drag from tail booms, tail empennage, engine nacelles etc. It would however create problems of its own regarding placement of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E in regard to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and control surfaces in regard of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E (\u003Cem\u003Eits much more complicated than that, but\u00A0 summing up...\u003C/em\u003E). Already knowing how the Gotha/Horten and the YB-49 looked like, after some fiddling around I came up with this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mNzLR1U.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mNzLR1U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inner control surfaces are\u00A0inactive. The middle ones are\u00A0the ailerons (\u003Cem\u003Eas with such long wings I do not need a lot to get good\u00A0roll\u00A0torque\u003C/em\u003E) and the outermost controls are the elevators. Being so close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, I needed the elevators to be as far back as possible, and the picture shows I could only get them so far back, which is not a lot:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sFhpOjM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sFhpOjM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may ask by looking at the picture above: why not sweep the wings farther to the back, so that the elevators actuate a little farther from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, thus being more effective? Well, it turns out that it would result the\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E dislocating\u00A0back \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E while the\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E dislocated\u00A0only \u003Cem\u003Ea little\u003C/em\u003E, making the plane an impossible design when near empty of fuel (\u003Cem\u003Enotice\u00A0the red center there,\u00A0courtesy of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E BUILD AID\u003C/em\u003E). When low on fuel, as it is,\u00A0the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E almost goes behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E. So the sweep of the wing can only be\u00A0that\u00A0much. As a consequence, the main performance issue I found is that pitch is somewhat\u00A0ineffective.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that matter: fuel tanks are behind the intakes, and in the center section - as far ahead as possible. Wings are not wet. If I place fuel tanks inside the wings, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E again dislocates way far to the rear and again the design is rendered impractical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few more design features you can see in the picture above: \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is around 0.87, good enough for a fast plane; \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eb)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E I chose the engines I did because I wanted to couple speed with range and time aloft. Hence\u00A0they couldn\u0027t be joyride engines but also couldn\u0027t be a punch through the wall like an X-15. In the end it was a medium/fast design choice, allowing for decent endurance - an interceptor design would have to aim at some other setup of course; \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ec)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E you can see it has some 40 minutes of endurance, which of course depends on altitude (more on that later). With stronger engines that would be much, much lower, so I am happy with my choice; \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ed)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E full weight is a bit over 10 tons, empty weight is closer to 4.4 tons, allowing for easy landings and low stall speeds; \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ee)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E being not-that-heavy-really, but at the same time with such large wing area, you just know it floats like a balloon with just a little speed, so high cruise altitudes are to be expected.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main design feature arising from the lack of a rudder is that yaw is controlled by aerobrakes on both sides (I placed on top and below the wing to avoid it influencing the pitch). They double as speed-breaks:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022L3N4HLV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/L3N4HLV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt turns out that yaw control is decent\u00A0with that system. Roll control is excellent and pitch control is, well, good enough, kinda. But it allows a perfectly controllable plane in most situations, so that\u0027s that. Lets take it for a spin!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRotate\u00A0is above 40m/s, which is not surprising given its large wing surface.

This design allows for eliminating\u00A0useless drag, \u003Cem\u003Ebut it is not exactly low-drag either\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0I don\u0027t know if KSP is perfect when simulating this, but it was to be imagined that with such a thick\u00A0wing my drag characteristics would result a poor performance at low altitudes\u00A0- in this case, just below supersonic at 1000 meters at full throttle\u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cRwX4TE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cRwX4TE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, all that lift carries you very high where the air is much thinner, and at 11.000 meters I achieved no less than mach 3! It shows what a combination of \u0027lowish\u0027-drag with high lift can achieve, specially with decent jet engines:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vCYoKJ0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vCYoKJ0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, forgot to take a pic of that, but\u00A0I actually took it as high as 18.000 meters. But by then it was nearly uncontrollable, specially the elevators, which were nearly useless. Endurance also fell a lot above 10.000 meters, due to the much thinner air affecting engine performance.\u00A0So I wouldn\u0027t say the safe envelope is that high.\u00A0 Flying around 10.000 is where I got the most of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust some more vanity pics of the return flight and I\u0027ll wrap things up:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Tie602M.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Tie602M.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bByjiD3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bByjiD3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy conclusions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 - It was hard to deviate from what Northrop and Horten already concluded on their own. All changes I did eventually lead to a worse of even impossible design. And it is no surprise my own thing came out looking so much like their own;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - Speed is great in higher altitudes, and terrible in lower altitudes. In my understanding this is because drag remains a bit high due to the large wings, so it is meant to be optimal as\u00A0a high-flyer. A plane meant to do what a Panavia Tornado does, for instance, could never be designed like this. A high-altitude bomber, however, could.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - Lift is in ample supply, which opens a lot of opportunities for several different design purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 - What I\u00A0really didn\u0027t like are the poor characteristics regarding pitch control. I will consider a future \u0027B\u0027 version with canards on the tip of the nose to correct that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 - The thing is a test plane only, so it carries only the bare minimums. But all the characteristics indicate that it could mature into an effective, fast long-range bomber or a medium/high passenger plane very easily. I could easily double or triple its payload or fuel capacity, so the concept has a lot of potential.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NgkGnMe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NgkGnMe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-13T23:55:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2019 11:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Daniel Prates\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-13T19:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally nice writeup! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Spacecraft Exchange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
