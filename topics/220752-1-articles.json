Especially in view of the interstellar colony part. I tried to build a small fuel station \u002B habitats and if possible a hangar but I saw that I was very quickly limited when I went to more than two docking ports. As in the screenshot we can see that one of the ports doesn\u0027t\u00A0 seem to want to dock. A solution or a possible reflection on your part? thank you for this incredible game that just needs to evolve best reguards.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022?imw=5000\u0026amp;imh=5000\u0026amp;ima=fit\u0026amp;impolicy=Lett\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022502\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2200632144659508143/B0B2E07B2C9AB7DF9B82B3B35BFD40F2033B28C1/?imw=5000\u0026amp;imh=5000\u0026amp;ima=fit\u0026amp;impolicy=Letterbox\u0026amp;imcolor=%23000000\u0026amp;letterbox=false\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022?imw=5000\u0026amp;imh=5000\u0026amp;ima=fit\u0026amp;impolicy=Lett\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022502\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2200632144659528536/8407D85B14C1BD923562021430C6E297E565B11D/?imw=5000\u0026amp;imh=5000\u0026amp;ima=fit\u0026amp;impolicy=Letterbox\u0026amp;imcolor=%23000000\u0026amp;letterbox=false\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dansiegel30","CreatedById":225462,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-11T15:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems you are simply trying to have the ship \u0022dock\u0022 with itself.\u00A0 I believe this may be a Unity limitation or simply a KSP design restriction, this limitation was with KSP1 as well.\u00A0 Another example would be that a booster can have only 1 radial coupler connected to it, where as in the real world, they can have multiple (obviously releasing them at the same time).\u00A0 There is an exception to this rule, using struts.\u00A0 It does limit imagination for craft design, I\u0027ve just gotten used to it being this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattihase","CreatedById":73161,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-12T18:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI swear I remember hearing some talk in the past about KSP2 using a graph style representation for ships rather than a tree representation, that would allow for stuff like multi-docking but it seems like that isn\u0027t the case so same limitations as KSP1 at the moment am fraid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattihase","CreatedById":73161,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-12T18:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly though I have had a poke around in the file format for crafts before and the file system at least seems like it could handle representing loops, but I doubt the game engine would be happy about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-12T19:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would only be one real docking point.

Example of use was with wide vessel, in the centre is 1 large fuel tank with say x8 symmetrical fuel tanks pointing down attached to it\u0027s side. I wanted to save the launching vessel (for financial reasons) so I didn\u0027t make x9 separate launchers as all of them but the one I was controlling would be lost in orbit as it descended down from it\u0027s sub orbital position. I instead had 1 large fuel tank with other fuel tanks connected symmetrically to it\u0027s side, just like the payload it was delivering had. As you know, you can\u0027t do multi decoupling. so Instead I only had the centre large tank attached to the payloads large tank by a decoupler. All the other fuel tanks had docks on them but the docks had not been attached to each other in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and instead they were attached to the fuel tanks which were positioned so that the docks were next to each other, like they would be when docked. When I launched the vessel, they all docked and showed in the information window as docked. I also \u0022enabled staging\u0022 on the docking port in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and put it in the same stage as the main decoupler in the centre and when I activated that stage, they all undocked with the decoupler (on most occasions), sometimes I would have to manually undock them. I have also used docks before as locking mechanisms for attached rovers and this worked in a similar way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeq","CreatedById":172375,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-07T14:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wan\u0027t this behauviour from \u003Cstrong\u003EKSP I\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0be translated to \u003Cstrong\u003EKSP II.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt did bring new bugs especially when docking itself with claw and docking ports but if they can do it stable then it would be cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am starting to see pattern at \u003Cstrong\u003EKSP II\u003C/strong\u003E, there will not be problems introducted which cannot be solved, if docking with itself is one of problems which cannot be solved reasonable clean code, it will not be in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-07T14:13:18Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2024 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 7\u0022\u003EJanuary 7\u003C/time\u003E by Jeq\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
