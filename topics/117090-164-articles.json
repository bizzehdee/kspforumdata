Made possible with SSTU parts and based on the Deep Space Habitat concept, which should gain a lot when the new SSTU station parts are finished.  \n\nAssembled in two launches with the help of welding docking ports and the capabilities of the Orion capsule. Main concept here was to minimise launch mass, Duna ascent and descent mass, as well as cost and required technologies at this stage in the tech tree. We\u0027re on a budget, people.  \n\nThe plan in total also involves an unmanned surface hab, landed with the assistance of airbags. This is packed with surface experiments and ISRU gear.  \n\nThe transit vehicle will perform deep space/solar experiments in it\u0027s 300 day transit, then aerocapture to Duna orbit using a ballute. The pressurised rover/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E will land with the assistance of parachutes, and will trundle over to the habitat (widening the margin for landing error), where the crew will finish outfitting the surface base, perform experiments and fine something to do with themselves for 600 days.  \n\nThe rover has an inflatable fuel tank, so the ISRU-fuelled ascent delta-v is significantly greater than the descent delta-v, but is just about sufficient to get into orbit.  \n\nThe unmanned Orion capsule will then rendezvous with the rover, and pootle over to the transit vehicle, where they will dock and transfer experiments to process on the return trip.  \n\nVehicle returns to Kerbin, aerocaptures at Kerbin using the re-packed ballute, and the crew return in the Orion capsule. The transit vehicle remains in orbit, and can be manned as a space station (to continue processing the Duna science), or refueled for travel elsewhere. This same architecture should work fine for manned missions to Eve orbit, Gilly and Ike, but may struggle with Dres.  \n  \n![9xvPxJG.png](http://i.imgur.com/9xvPxJG.png)\n\nSome efficiency is lost here - processing experiments would be more efficient on the surface of Duna, but that would require landing a lab, which increases the size of the payload. The concept here is for a reusable exploration-class ship that can work as a baseline for more advanced missions later - this kind of architecture is not required for Duna, but a scaled up version is probably pretty much mandatory for missions to the outer planets."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-14T14:04:10Z","Content":"How many crew for the actual mission, [@Domfluff](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64903-domfluff/)?

I swear I have looked for both.\n\nI am having a problem constructing landers and suspect I am doing something incorrectly.  So, from the bottom up here\u0027s what I m doing. (I\u0027m using Hydrolox for both descent and ascent engines RL110A-3; RL110A-4; RL10A-5).  I am using SSRSS and am attempting a Moon landing.\n\n1. For the descent engine I\u0027m using the one with the extending bell.\n2. I\u0027m using a lander tank main and nose combination, both have cavities down the middle for engine recessing.\n3. I mount the tank on top of the engine and set the vertical height of the engine so that it is recessed to the point where you can just see the bell peeking out of the bottom.\n4. I place the decoupler on top of the lander tank attaching it to the next node down into the tank cavity.\n5. I mount the CM (2- or 3-man)on top of the engine and set the vertical height so that the CM sits just above the top of the lander tank assembly.\n\nIn use, the descent engine fires up and does a nice job.  So that works fine.  For launch I set the engine power to max, hit the decoupler and engine-start simultaneously.  The decoupler decouples and the engine fires up, but the CM just sits there engine roaring.  I know it\u0027s decoupled because I can\u0027t activate anything on the lander tank assembly.  And when I have tried using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to give it a boost, the CM just slides along the top of the lander assembly and when it gets to the edge, topples off.  I\u0027ve right-clicked the engine and determined that there is thrust and specific impulse, and that its status is \u0022Nominal.\u0022\n\nIt\u0027s odd to me that you can use the vertical height adjustment with the lander tanks but not the lander CM.\n\nNow, if I go back to the Editor, and change the Vertical height back to \u00220\u0022 the engine functions normally.  But it looks pretty strange with the CM perched atop the engine all of it sitting on top of the lander tank assembly.\n\nSo, I need some basic instruction on engine configurations that will work or not work when construction a lander.
