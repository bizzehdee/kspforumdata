In real life these are essential to the functionality as they ensure that the exhaust gases don\u0027t re-enter the engine, canceling out the thrust provided.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModeling-wise it would be easy to implement - just stick a tube on top of the engine that also glows as the engine fires.
