I built and launched a Surveyor 3 probe that soft landed on the Mun, then 2 game years later, landed my Kerpollo 12 spacecraft within 200 meters of it. Just wish I took a picture before, as the old style of the LT-1 Landing Strut better matched the real Surveor 3, and allowed it to be much shorter. Had to redesign it a bit for them to work, and it makes it about 4 kerbals tall. Then again, they are pretty short to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here is the real thing first:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://v4s1.yimg.com/sj/2864/12862835124_5321b914d1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212862835124_5321b914d1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is my mission: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3281175165214043842/9A28AF43CD1BD17FFA24B5F8909D188F7DA4A629/1024x640.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x640.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s kinda small and hard to see, but my lander is off to the right in the screenshot.

I started a KSP historical series on Youtube, building replicas of historical spacecraft and aircraft, and the Kerpollo series is on a near-accurate Saturn V booster. The Surveyor was also launched and landed the same way NASA did it, which was hard too, that final decent took many tries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I have done replicas of Sputnik, Explorer 1, Ranger 7, Mariner 2, Mercury, Soyuz, Gemini/Agena, Apollo, ASTP, and Skylab. Now I am turning toward aircraft, working on a X-15 replica, drop launched from a wing mount on a B-52 replica, just ironing out the bugs, primarily the landing. It works great, even though it makes the mother ship asymmetrical. But that is for another day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here is a shot of the lander. I am really proud of it, it\u0027s 2 stages just like Apollo, and can reach a 101x122km orbit after launch from the Mun surface, just like Apollo. I feel kinda bad about it, it is 100% stock, but I had to part clip on the ascent stage to get the fuel tank flush. Ah well, and it can deliver a rover to the surface too, though it\u0027s top mounted for now, until we get cargo pods/bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/3281175165276418199/8453388667392BF8F92F44E92DA7F4D62D74F86D/\u0022 alt=\u00228453388667392BF8F92F44E92DA7F4D62D74F86D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas a bonus, here is another screenshot of another component of the spacecraft, the CSM.

This is a slightly older version of it, my fleet is constantly evolving and improving as I make changes. Action group 1 is still there, but irrelevant, as you can lock gimbals in the VAB, as I did. I also changed the SAS module on the 3rd stage to a remote guidance unit, so I can control it once I extract the LM. also, this has the old antenna array, you can see how much smaller it was with the older antennas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft is so big (500 parts even including the 40 launch clamps), it makes for terrible framerate, but that works in my favor with the launch audio.
