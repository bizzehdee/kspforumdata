I have the kerbal targetted and am within only about 500m but I can\u0027t see him. When I switch to him with bracket I can control him but can\u0027t see my rescue ship anywhere. ??

The kerbals have some built into their space suits. While you might be too far to illuminate something with them, it might help you to spot the lights in the distance. Either that or wait till you are on the day side. I think the tags auto hide after you get close enough.
