It could be used to allow balloon probes to float around the thick atmosphere of Eve, have pods on parachutes drift off slightly on the wind while descending and move floating probes on Laythe (when in the ocean, movement would probably be influenced more by current than by wind but since I imagine the same system could do both wind and current).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow difficult would that be to implement? It wouldn\u0027t need to be that complex as far I can tell. Objects where the horizontal speed is less than the vertical speed would be susceptible to some sort of phantom force that would push it around in a random direction. Then after a while the direction would change (within certain limits). Different altitudes for planets would result in different forces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T10:38:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that the real problem is modeling the effects on the ship, not the wind itself. The simple way is to add an horizontal force to the CoM of the ship and we are good, but this wouldn\u0027t be really realistic (especially in FAR).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T11:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebest option might be for delployed chutes to have phantom forces applied in a random direction. on a craft at high speed a breeze would be negligible i think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
