Why is it that everyone expects something \u0022literally every week\u0022? It\u0027s not like they\u0027ll be able to show us progress in the game\u0027s coding without potentially revealing core game details that they probably want to save-off for until much much much closer to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means that pretty much all they can show us that\u0027s \u0022watchable content\u0022 is progress in the art department.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow don\u0027t get me wrong, I know a thing or two about programming in general (I\u0027ve dabbled in a few languages, always related to a video game tho), and \u0022dry scientific content\u0022 is something that I\u0027ll partake in occasionally (especially if it\u0027s about a video game I care about, which KSP 2 is). However, that\u0027s almost certainly the kind of stuff that they don\u0027t want to reveal until either day of launch or maybe even a little after it. I mean, what do you do if everyone knows how to beat your game before you release it? (I realize that KSP 2, being mostly a sandboxed game, will have a very hard to pin down definition of when you\u0027ve \u0022beaten the game\u0022, and that that will likely be different for every player, but the point stands, why release a game if the content of the game is already able to be consumed without the effort of actually playing the game?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point I\u0027m trying to make is, they can\u0027t give us all the info right now or there won\u0027t be any for when the game\u0027s about to launch, which is when they\u0027re going to want people to be the most hyped about the game. So since we\u0027re 4-5 months or more from release date, we\u0027re going to be on a drip feed of new information about the game for probably a few more months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat that boils down to is that when a new video comes out about KSP from the developers, I personally don\u0027t expect the next new video from the developers about KSP 2 until roughly a month has passed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo far, that seems to be about the pace of things.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not saying to not stay hyped! Staying hyped is fine! What I am saying is that you shouldn\u0027t be let down by the lack of a new video every week, because there\u0027s only so much info they can share about the game at any one time and it takes a while for a full video\u0027s worth of info to be ready for release. So it\u0027s almost certainly not going to happen literally every week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrust me on this, because I have personal experience. Candy\u0027s only special because you only get to have it sometimes. If you buy yourself a 5 pound (~2.5 kilogram) bag of candy and just have it sitting next to you at all times, then candy loses a lot of its enjoyment factor.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSimilar thing goes with these KSP 2 update videos, if they happened every week, they wouldn\u0027t be as special, and probably they wouldn\u0027t be as enjoyable either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Admiral Fluffy","CreatedById":210816,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-12T23:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224054421\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187338\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221636759076\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust an honest question here.

Really I do. However, it\u0027s actually an example of excellent flexible program management, because instead of throwing up their hands and letting the program get canceled, they stuck with it and made the changes they needed to to keep making progress on it until it was (finally) ready to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, comparing it to a game is like comparing apples and oranges for many reasons, not least of which that KSP 2 is being developed by a private enterprise that loves what they do, and that JWST was a wholly government-funded project and so expecting it to stick to its deadline is like expecting pigs to fly. On the other hand, considering the amount of budget over-run on JWST, some would say that pigs are in fact flying when JWST finally does launch (as many now consider it to be a pork project).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I\u0027m just glad that both JWST and KSP 2 are finally at a point in development where the point of culmination of all that effort is finally in sight.

I\u0027m sure that it won\u0027t live up to some people\u0027s expectations, as there are always a few that expect the game to do things that just aren\u0027t practical to program given the time constraints, but I\u0027m relatively certain it will live up to my own expectations, as I don\u0027t consider myself to be one of those people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally, so long as KSP 2 doesn\u0027t require me to fly every logistics flight to its destination when I\u0027m doing colonization things, I\u0027ll probably have a lot of fun playing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if the game doesn\u0027t live up to my expectations?
