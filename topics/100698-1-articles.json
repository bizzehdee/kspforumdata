I may have missed one where the opener speaks about the same idea as I intend to do. If that happend, please leave a link to that thread. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo what makes me open this new Topic?\n\nI thing KSP starts to forfeit its humorous aspects. Its all about rocket-science right now. I have to admit that I use a more realistic flight model (Ferram Aerospace Research) which made it way more challanging to bring someting to space and back to the KSP in one piece, or even construct a flyable plane. But if it works, its way more rewarding I think...\n\nAnyway, the last time I had to laugh really hard... uh, its hard to remember. Hmmmm.... a short time ago, there was a (long-time-hidden) object placing-accident while laying out a mun-lander, which ended up only having one landing strut when I finally came to my designation. That was a true kerbal moment... especially after I managed to land this piece of junk anyway, with its upside down and extended the lonely landing strut. (but needed another launch to get my pilot back from Mun). \n\nBefore this, I had to rescue a Vessel that lost its parachute and was out of fuel, but carried around pretty needed science data. Fortunally I had a mod running that provided me with stuff like robotic arms and another one that offered stuff like winches and grapping hooks... well, you might know, how this did end. It was pretty entertaining. And hairy, after the two objects startet so sprin around a common barycenter, just by a black rope... guess how I did provide the needed loss of delta-V.\n\nUh, and I had to drop a big fuel-tank during recently space-shuttle-testing. It left a lasting impression... uh, well, no, to be honest, it left a crater where once the Adminstration-Building was located at. \n\nAh, and there was the time I was testing a \u0022science-utility-vehicle\u0022, which was just a science-lab with wheels attached and a robotic arm at its back. And winches. And... stuff. Well, that thing was able to pull itself at the top of the rocket assembly building. And doing science up there. But it crashed the game, when I tried to pluck a tree with its robotic arm ^^\n\nOkay, why am I telling you this? Because that what I think the kerbal way of rocket-science can look alike. \n\nRight now, the contracts are pretty... uh... to be honest, I feel offended by most of the contracts. Not because they are to easy, but all of them include parts I can\u0027t use right now or want me to build surface-bases at planets I don\u0027t can reach with the stuff I have at this very moment.\n\nAnd placing satellites in orbits for ten seconds (which I can dump afterwards or maybe bring in another orbit), send science-data from a specific place (thats why I have probes in orbits around all moons of kerbin), or a specific science-experiment (ha, my rockets can\u0027t even lift the parts necessary for this ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) ), or rescue someone in orbit (how did he end up there?) or do surface surveys (which are likely to crash the game because they eat up RAM like nothing) and EVA in areas, where nothing is present... Well, most of the other \u0022make better contracts\u0022 people did mention that too. \n\nI know, its just a Beta and these contracts do look like placeholders, but I\u0027m afraid that in 1.0 its still the same. \n\nBut I wonder if its possible to make contract more look like this:\n\n- Drop a Concrete-Donkey (or something else) at a specific location\n\n- Land a probe at Mun that does have not more than 1 landing strut\n\n- Place a random silly object (maybe a cactus, or a kerbal) at a suborbital trajectory of the sun\n\n- Plant a flag at top of the Administration-Building\n\n- Deliver Pizza to the guys at that island-runway without leaving the ground (or the water) wihin 30 ingame-minutes\n\nEverything that let you think \u0022well, that was plain stupid, didn\u0027t make any sense at all, but... moar!\u0022 \n\nOr am I the only one who thinks that kerbal science should keep a more entertaining pace?"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T14:00:00Z","Content":"\\*~lolsokerbal~\\*\n\nBetter contracts are needed, yes, but ones like these aren\u0027t.. to be honest, they\u0027re not a good idea."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T14:30:42Z","Content":"Wow, more contracts I\u0027d have to decline 100% of the time.\n\nWhat we need are sensible contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T14:32:27Z","Content":"they are serious in getting to space, yet have a childlike interest in exploration, discovery, and the doing of SCIENCE.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9fvjKVuULQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJDLGY7La1k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlbHmsHOe-U?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nDelivery of pizzas or concrete donkeys is not in their scope of intrest I feel.

I don\u0027t agree with it, but I get it. I\u0027m thinking though, that a lot of the humour you mentioned came from a crazy situation that happened accidentally whilst you were trying to do something else. In which case do we need deliberately crazy contracts?\n\n Landing a probe at Mun that only has one landing strut, through some accident in flight, or odd design flaw, is funny.
