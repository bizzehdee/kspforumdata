These seemingly easy early career missions can actually be quite challenging, as the altitude / velocity parameters they setup can be difficult to hit (e.g., go between 210 and 510 m/s at between 30km and 34km . . . later in the game, when you\u0027ve unlocked lots more parts, not a problem, but when you are using the early game crude implements can be tricky).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. More than once, I have\u00A0hit the space bar _while_\u00A0SEEING that all conditions ARE green, and thinking, \u0022Okay that will get it done.\u0022 and had it not get done. I reckon it was a simple matter of me being close to the margin for the test condition and by the time my space bar type actually processed into the game I had stepped 0.001 ms/ or m outside the fricking margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese tests would be more fun if the margins were more fuzzy and you got more reward for being closer to the middle of the margins, but could nonetheless finish them without the grindy repetitiousness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nADDIT: and one more thing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Even if you want to play \u0022pure vanilla,\u0022 there is one mod that I think you should consider getting: Kerbal Engineer Redux. It really should be part of the vanilla game by now as the data it provides is frankly essential to mastery of flight.
