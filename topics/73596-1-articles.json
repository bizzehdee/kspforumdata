It was faster than Mach 1, but was not as fast than Mach 1.5. The kerbal engineers seemed VERY freaked out at this, because the plane was flying at low altitude. Because KSP\u0027s speed of sound is estimated to be around 350-300 M/S, The approximate speed I reached was Mach 1.3 (I\u0027m a math genius). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo rather than achieving 456 M/S, I achieved MACH 1.3!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E:sticktongue:\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E:sticktongue: \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake yourself useful and grab me a soda -Various Sources.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
