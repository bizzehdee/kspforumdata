Never really built spaceplanes much with NEAR, as I haven\u0027t had it long. I have a problem with this thing though. When I take off (which is just flying off the end of the runway and pulling up so I don\u0027t hit engines - that\u0027s fine with me) I start my 45 degree climb and around 1,000 meters up, I slide to the right a little. I try to correct, and if I do get it back on track, it just slides to the other side. Using SAS does not help. After maybe a minute, I totally lose control and fall into the ocean. Why? I have flown SSTOs to minmus in stock, but never made one in stock or NEAR and flown it (even to orbit, I think).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould it be drag from the shock cones? I have 6 per engine (which seems really high now that I mention it) and I placed them engine, intakes, engine, intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T23:30:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post a pic of CoL and CoM also showing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first guess is your CoM is moving backwards rapidly as the nose tank drains first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I may be wrong but I believe you should add an engine after its intakes and not the other way around.
