I am unable to swap to the detached probe with left and right bracket, and it does not show up in the tracking center. Additionally, the probe still appears to be a part of the mothership craft, as any rotation inputs I perform while controlling the main craft are also done in the probe. In the staging section in the below photo, I am hovering over the ion engines for the probes, and the engines on the detached probe are also highlighted, indicating the game hasn\u0027t registered it as a separate vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222HHFmSE.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2HHFmSE.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T01:42:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 01:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Euphotic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdd image for real this time\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
