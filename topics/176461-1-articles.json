If that formula was followed strictly, zero airspeed would lead to zero intake air... the \u0022base speed\u0022 is a means to work around that issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost intakes start to choke at high airspeeds: even though you get faster and faster, there\u0027s less air coming in. This is most pronounced with the \u0022subsonic\u0022 intakes, but even supersonic ones show that behaviour (somewhere beyond mach 4, so I guess it hardly matters in everyday operations). The sole exception is the shock cone intake, which won\u0027t choke no matter how fast you\u0027re going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-06T11:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess the graph bewing is taling about is this one:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3164387915\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/125015-105-intakes-lets-figure-them-out/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is created for KSP 1.05 but seems to fit anyway or at least you get an idea about the performance of different intakes.
