So we\u0027ll need more info to figure out whey your suffering so quickly under part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to improving performance, KSp responds very well to overclocking, its almost 1 to 1 when CPU bound. If you score a 20% OC, you can expect to earn almost exactly 20% more framerate for the same partcount, \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E the CPU was what held you back. You mention already planning to do so, I say go for it, at the very least you\u0027ll get more out of KSP for your trouble. Regarding OCing a modern CPU with boost functions, if you find your OC is limited by thermal output, so your seeing high temps and stop pushing harder, you can usually slam one core even harder than the 4 and still see the same or less temps. Idea being thast if it doesn\u0027t need the other cores, it powers them down to saver power and not produce heat, and that extra headroom can be spent pushing that one core even faster.
