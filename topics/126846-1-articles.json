The orbital speed is quite high. In order not to cook my spaceplane, do I have to spend a bunch of dv to slow myself down before descending below 120k altitude? Maybe I just need a very shallow descent angle? Does anyone have an idea of what dv it takes to get back to orbit from 100k altitude or so?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T05:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I can say is, good luck with that.\u00A0 It would be an impressive achievement.\u00A0 Huge heat, huge drag, huge dV.\u00A0 Just guessing, I\u0027d say about start with 5000m/s and see what happens.\u00A0 Much testing with HyperEdit before you do it for real \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rocketbuilder","CreatedById":154102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T07:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be an interesting challenge!
