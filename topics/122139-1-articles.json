Instead of creating new engines, an enterprising modder could instead construct bypass fan modules to stick to the front of stock engine nacelles, giving them the appearance of modern jetliner powerplants. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--5YJ3wPj3--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1363891104812494511.gif\u0022 alt=\u00221363891104812494511.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we all know, a turbojet engine is simply the core of a turbofan; a fanjet has an additional low pressure turbine at the back which drives a fan which produces bypass thrust; air which flows around the engine core. Therefore it should be quite straightforward to create a 1.875m low bypass fan module to convert a J-33 basic jet nacelle into a low bypass turbofan engine, and a 2.5m bypass fan to convert it into a powerful present day airliner engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBalancing:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe turbofan module should provide augmentation for engine thrust at low altitudes; it can simply generate thrust pointed backwards without need to check for occlusion of other parts (if possible) or output the thrust around the outside edge of the part where the outlet of a conventional jetliner engine\u0027s bypass is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost for the turbofan conversion should be increased drag area of the engine nacelle (we don\u0027t want this to be a free upgrade) as well as added mass. So you could opt for a fast jet that sucks gas or an efficient cruiser with low TWR but good cruise economy around Mach 0.8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also make jetliner replicas have more realistic engine performance and reduce part count (No need to make engine cores and bypass out of many, many basic jet engines). The idea, once again, to create a bypass fan module, is to allow craft builders to customize their engine nacelles and provide various bypass options for existing engine types in order to modify or enhance their performance in specific areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.mikejamesmedia.com/modo_media/modo_wip/genx/genx_53_cutaway.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022genx_53_cutaway.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-02T05:30:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2015 05:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cobbman11","CreatedById":76711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T05:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know much about creating this kind of stuff, but I can say that it would be a welcomed addition.

Performance can be spiced up by having a few types of each modular part, and the behavior of the engines as a whole now depends on how the player builds their turbine set. Keeping the Compressor, Burner, and Power Turbine segments all as one part is going to be key in keeping this simplicity. That\u0027s the part that is all one running machine all on its own, everything else are \u0027mods\u0027 to said machine that are strapped on each end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, A turbofan would be an inlet, a bypass of their choice depending on the job, a turbine core, and the fitting exhaust nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA helicopter would be an inlet, a turbine core, a turboshaft module instead of a nozzle, and a rotor blade that\u0027s not considered here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA generator is an inlet and a turbine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA J-57 engine is a shock cone inlet, a special bypass tube component that has the additional product [uSED AIR] resource, a turbine core, and a WHOLE lotta afterburning doom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just to double-clarify from the image. [uSED AIR] is simply to differentiate the intake air from the various inlets from the air supply the engines feed to the nozzle. Otherwise, the nozzle gets air directly from any inlet on the vehicle no matter what the engine conditions might be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust behavior in accordance with player throttle would not control the turbine core. Instead, code from Kerbal Foundries\u0027 Auxilliary Power Unit, which throttles the APU based on demand, can be linked to the [POWER] resource draw of the parts around it, allowing the core to behave as needed be it used as a jet, or as a helicopter engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECode to look into to make performance work out nicely would be AJE, Firespitter, and Kerbal Foundries. AJE would be to make the turbomachinery work, while KF is for the throttle control.

Torque is output from the engine out of the Crankshaft, and drivetrain is responsible for converting Torque into Horsepower which drives accessories and turns wheels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fun thing about ICE modelling is that one can use the stock thermal model to simulate horsepower and engine reliability being limited by engine temperature; if the cylinder heads blow the engine ceases to work, necessitating design of a working air or liquid cooling system using stock parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifferent intake and carburetion options could increase power at the cost of heat, so hot rod builders could use this as technical challenge - extreme cylinder heat would flow to other parts, possibly causing them to fail as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor turbines, the same kind of treatment can be added to the Combustor part of the engine to realistically simulate limited endurance with continuous max thrust settings; this could be countered by providing WaterInjection modules that add thrust and cool down the engine core until the water runs out; useful for large cargo aircraft and early generation heavy jet bombers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThese are coming in 1.1. Wheesley is getting redesigned as a turbofan (it\u0027s performance is already like a turbofan, now the model will match). Plus a new Goliath High Bypass turbofan, the Panther I *think* is supposed to be a low bypass turbofan and a small 0.625m \u0022Juno\u0022 jet engine, I\u0027m guessing it is a turbojet it kinda looks like the Junkers Jumo 004 (worlds first turbojet) and that name sounds a lot like it. That little Juno engine might prove useful for VTOL, depending on the craft size.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/NkzMp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/NkzMp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose new parts look great! The Panther would be most welcome for mid-range performance and I think would produce enough thrust to act as a useful compact VTOL powerplant; albeit a deck-melting one!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-04T11:40:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2015 11:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralTigerclaw","CreatedById":92104,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T23:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the points I want to emphasize with mine however, is customizing with intuitive simplicity kept in-tact. The performance of a turbomachine alone varies wildly with the number of compression stages and their ratios, and the recovery of power can likewise be varied. However, the math gets nasty and my thought is simply to keep that all one core component with a few variations on type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I mentioned before, my main thing is that turbine engines change in function and purpose massively by the big parts you strap to each end. IE, the fans and nozzle types. I\u0027m not as familiar with piston engines as I am with turbines, so I don\u0027t know how much you\u0027re breaking things down. Perhaps you should post a diagram of your engine model as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
