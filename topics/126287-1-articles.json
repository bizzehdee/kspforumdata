I\u0026#39;d love to introduce some parts for orbit manufacturing ASAP, but it might take a while considering my knowledge and experiences.

Kerbals already sending tourists in space, so why not selling some nice mun rocks?:D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@Olympic1 Thanks. I just found out that a company with the exact same name as this mod already exists. So I think I need to change this mod\u0026#39;s name. So I just deleted this mod from Kerbalstuff(Can\u0026#39;t find a way to change the title) and replaced download link with dropbox, temporaliry. After this mod gets its proper name, I\u0026#39;ll make sure to have it properly uploaded. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, I think this mod needs new name. As mentioned above, the name is already used by a company. It was my fault to not to do any research for the title. Also current name gives a impression that the mod has something to do with manufacturing in space, which is not implemented in anytime soon. Rather, I\u0026#39;m planning to introduce more businesses relying on contracts with some MM patches. So I think the new name should be more about business planning or development, something like Business Development Department. I know I\u0026#39;m not good at it. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI won\u0026#39;t rush until the proper one comes up and open to any suggestions, not only about the title but about any ideas about this mod.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hieywiey","CreatedById":99098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T17:42:30Z","Content":"\nIdeas for possible names: Space Souvenirs, and Out Of This World Gifts.\n"}]}
