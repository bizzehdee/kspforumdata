Every ship I build using one of the MKS parts as the root component or primary command component disappears from the game after I switch away from it a few times (it\u0027s not always the first time I switch away, which makes it even more confusing.). This happens on two different computers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a work-around, I\u0027ve found that using another command pod or probe body as the root part for construction prevents the ships from vanishing so I\u0027ve been able to finally start testing the mod more fully (my first few colony projects disappeared completely), but I haven\u0027t been able to isolate the specific cause yet. I\u0027ll let you know if I find anything useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E2) Docking Compatibility:\u003C/span\u003E This was much easier to isolate and resolve. The Kerbtrail docking ports are currently configured using the 2.5 meter ModuleDockingNode setting (\u0022nodeType = size2\u0022) rather than the 1.25 meter part setting (\u0022nodeType = size1\u0022). That is: they currently dock with Clamp-o-Tron Sr ports but not standard Clamp-o-Trons. I haven\u0027t installed the new 0.14.1 update yet, but I found that the \u0022size2\u0022 definition is still in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, with those two issues either resolved or worked-around, I\u0027ve finally been able to get a test facility started on Minmus!

Also is it intended that the composter module in the kerbitat drains all my power instantly when activated? I have 12 large solar arrays and a few smaller panels around my colony and 140k power storage and it all goes nearly instantly on the composter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGatesofLogic","CreatedById":58468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T17:09:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis there any possibility that you might make a kolonization module that produces the RocketParts Resource for a link into EPL, that would honestly be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-30T17:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheGatesofLogic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheGatesofLogic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eis there any possibility that you might make a kolonization module that produces the RocketParts Resource for a link into EPL, that would honestly be awesome.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.

In the VAB, the Kethane survey units say they can detect everything (kethane, minerals, ore, substrate, water). However, once I get them in orbit and activate them, they detect kethane just fine, but nothing else. I.e., looking at the planet, with \u0022kethane\u0022 selected, I can see the usual white / green hexes showing what areas have been scanned. But when I flip through the kethane menu to display minerals, ore, etc., the grid is completely blank, and nothing is displayed. When I mouse over a hex, it displays something like \u0022Kethane: 534.24, Minerals: (no data), Ore: (no data), Substrate: (no data), Water: (no data).\u0022 And it does not seem to just be that there are no resources in these cells - because some hexes display \u0022Kethane: (none), Minerals: (no data), Ore: (no data), Substrate: (no data), Water: (no data).\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s relevant, I am playing in career mode (I have unlocked the advanced sci tech node with all the MKS modules), and I hyperedited the scanners into orbit to make sure they detected MKS resources before an actual launch. I tested them around Kerbin, Minmus, and Duna. What am I missing?
