Have one run in agroponics mode, and the other run in recycler mode.

If you\u0027re looking to do more than four Kerbals, however, you\u0027ll probably need a total of 4 of the radially attached NoM 25000s, with two set at each function.

In the current CTT, you get the 5000 before any green houses. So while it may be heavy, it extends the nom\u0027s output. Looking at supply tank mass, maybe it is better just to take more supplies.

Expandable Habitat 2.75 as Greenhouse - It states it\u0027s an efficiency part, but to what? the Nom o Matics? Enabling this shows no difference in LS Status.\n3. RT-5000 and MPL-LG-2 - The button says \u0022Start Life Support\u0022. Should it really say \u0022Start Recycler\u0022? Is there any difference in the terms? Starting it lowers supplies per day.\n4.

Supplies were reduced correctly when I started Pioneer recycling.  Went back to the one in orbit, turned everything off and just tried to enable Pioneer recycling and nothing happened.  Seems like this one is blarged somehow. Not sure why yet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-14T19:48:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2016 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Gilph**\n  \nTesting"},{"CreatedByName":"danielboro","CreatedById":166078,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-14T17:29:24Z","Content":"im starting to move a 1.1.3 save to 1.2.1  \n\nI\u0027m getting sum missing parts warning\n\nis ther a recommended way for the move?\n\nwill copying the missing .cfg be all I need?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gilph","CreatedById":150861,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-14T18:44:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, danielboro said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E im starting to move a 1.1.3 save to 1.2.1  \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m getting sum missing parts warning\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E is ther a recommended way for the move?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E will copying the missing .cfg be all I need?\n\u003E \n\nI just finished my move.
