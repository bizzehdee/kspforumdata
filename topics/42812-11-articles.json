Further, as Jahulath says, you\u0027re certainly under no obligation to make the mod, let alone make it compatible with other mods--I really appreciate the work you\u0027ve done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since you\u0027re trying to make it compatible with MFT, that implies (to me) that you want it compatible with what MFT really does, which is _allow different tank configurations_. That the ability to specify, in CFG, the base mass of a tank and the mass added to a tank for each unit of volume it stores _modified by the fuel type to be stored_.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands, your mod does not do this. It will links dry mass and volume, which _breaks_ MFT\u0027s ability to change that ratio. Which is necessary for the self-included mod RealFuels--if you look at the CFG (RealTankTypes) you will see that LH2 tanks, for instance, have a much lower dry mass (that\u0027s what mass = 0.00005 implies, vs LF\u0027s 0.0005--that\u0027s not mass of fuel, that\u0027s tank mass there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo modified config--the RealFuels config right from the MFT archive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it\u0027s true that it\u0027s inconvenient that MFT doesn\u0027t store that multiplier. However, it looks like Starwaster has found a way to do the lookup (tank type-\u0026gt;basemass, fuel type-\u0026gt;mass), so it\u0027s certainly possible to pull from confignodes what the tank should mass. And again, as to \u0022no indication when it\u0027s using RealFuels\u0022--there\u0027s no difference in terms of MFT works. It\u0027s just that basemass and fueltype structural mass work out, when MFT does the math for LF and Oxidizer, to be the same as in the stock game. In MFT that ratio is simply NEVER hardcoded. It\u0027s read from CFG (using those two attributes) for LF and Oxidizer as well as any other fuel type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, it\u0027s not like \u0022Regular MFT\u0022 and \u0022Real Fuels\u0022 and \u0022Other people\u0027s versions\u0022 operate off any different codebase. MFT is the same plugin. The only thing that changes is the CFG values you feed it. If you feed it values that happen to equate to a 1:1600 mass:volume ratio, that\u0027s what you\u0027ll get (and that\u0027s the case for \u0022stock\u0022 MFT). If you feed it values that don\u0027t...then StretchyTanks, as it stands, reverts to a 1:1600 mass:volume ratio. Which breaks anything with different values for basemass or fueltype structural mass, since (for instance) RealFuels\u0027s LH2 depends on low density (and thus large tank size required to store it) but lower tank dry mass (so you don\u0027t get overly penalized by needing volume-larger fuel tanks for it).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-14T01:41:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2013 01:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NathanKell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T01:35:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AncientGammoner\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AncientGammoner\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMFT is poorly written tbh.

Using to fuel a nuclear or thermal engine? Want to carry oxidizer separately from LF? You want the mass to equate to volume. My repetitious suggestion in this thread basically amounts to, lets enhance stock (using the \u0027bess guess\u0027 to determine real world analogue ratios for fuel units/mass for a given volume) rather than simply nerf an otherwise brilliantly adaptable fuel storage mod.\u003Cp\u003EThe squad LF tanks were most likely nerfed intentionally because they are/were used as fuselage and not as strictly fuel tanks, had they been full it would have made most aircraft (using stock parts) too heavy.
