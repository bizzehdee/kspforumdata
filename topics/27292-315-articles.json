It has 2 RAPIER engines for atmospheric and the initial hop into LKO and then switches to a pair of xenon plasma thrusters for space maneuvers. It uses a microwave receiver for the power. The orbiting construction depot is also the power station with a 3.75m fission reactor and with all the right conditions, the space-plane can receive ~850MW of power anywhere in orbit thanks to two relay satellites also in stationary orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular plane gets up to speed just fine and into space - what I never achieved was a decent landing before. Well, the mission was a success: I got up to orbit, transferred the kerbals to the construction thingy, then used the xenon plasma engines to reduce the periapse to about 55km. I then aerobraked 3-4 orbits to get to a 48km X 130km orbit for the final de-orbit burn to a 12km periapse. The plane skipped once (by design) and then I re-entered into about 10km altitude before re-activating the RAPIERs in air-breathing mode. I was about 100km away from KSC, but got turned around for the approach from the East. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the trip back was sub-sonic as the plane handles way better and I\u0027d previously had difficulties slowing down with an earlier flight (the earlier one broke up on landing though the kerbals survived). This time, though, it was very smooth return including flaps to reduce velocity even further. The landing worked out at about 100m/s and then I activated all the spoilers and brakes to stop about dead center on the landing strip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFINALLY!
