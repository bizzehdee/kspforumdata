It\u0027s also known that animals are less active when it\u0027s colder, as your next encounter with a summertime mosquito swarm will remind you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what does that lead to? If the Earth is warming up, as the alarmists claim, then animals (including insects, which are the largest percentage of animal biomass and also the largest emitters of CO2 per unit body weight) are going to be more active, and therefore exhale more CO2. And there you have it. A process by which warming causes rising CO2 levels, rather than the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does WedgeAntilles have in common with a church that\u0027s missing its steeple?

What you have just described is a feedback loop, which is a magnifying effect, and is one of the very things that climate scientists are worried will exacerbate the problem. It literally demonstrates the exact opposite of what you were claiming earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T18:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZetaX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZetaX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022The basic principle hasn\u0027t changed\u0022 is a very bad argument; it\u0027s like saying that cars are still the same after a hundred years (or several millenia, if you call a quadriga a \u0022car\u0022). Here\u0027s the scientific reason:\u003Cp\u003EThe only two things that remained the same are \u0022burning the coal\u0022 (which is inherently what the coal plant is about) and \u0022turning heated fluid/gas into electric energy\u0022 (which also is part of the definition); almost everything else changed over time. We also added ways to directly use residual thermal energy, e.g. to heat houses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, we cannot become much better than that because thermodynamics says so, see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnots_theorem_%28thermodynamics%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot\u0027s_theorem_%28thermodynamics%29\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency\u003C/a\u003E. The latter also gives numbers: a good modern coal plant peaks at 46% efficiency fr conversion into electrical energy, while the theoretical optimum (in this case of a specific gasoline engine, be invited to get the actual ones for coal) is at 73%. Thus doubling efficiency is already proven to be impossible at that step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut lets go even further: those 73% are for the conversion into mechanical energy, i.e. turning a shaft via a turbine; the second stage of conversion into electrical energy is not even factored into it. Furthermore, the 46% above do not account for using the residual heat, i.e. the numbers are actually even better if that happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly, my previous point still stands: if it were easy (read as: if a trillion dollar are enough to get this done) then we would probably just do it. The coal plants surely have no interest in wasting coal, i.e. money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that. But we\u0027re currently creating chemical energy to turn it into thermal energy to transfer that thermal energy into something else to turn it into mechanical energy to turn it into electrical energy, and losing along every step. You\u0027re telling me there\u0027s not a better way? I don\u0027t believe you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
