However, recently it has become unplayable due to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E putting the craft into an uncontrollable spin, even without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on. Sometimes I can temporarily stop the spinning by holding the Q key, but not always and when I let go it speeds up again.\u00A0I have searched the Internet but none of the tips such as pressing Alt-x have made a difference.
