I built the craft for something much larger.\n\nAnyway, general procedure I used:\n\nGet into a nice round orbit around Kerbin, do a plane change to match orbits. Minmus is on about a 10~15 deg inclination.\n\nDo a hohmann transfer out to Minmus, aim almost directly for it.\n\nAs soon as you start getting close, accelerate parallel to the orbit until your orbit patches in.\n\nIt\\\u0027s not the most efficient way there, but for a first exploration, it worked pretty well. \n\nTo anyone wondering what it looks like, here it is:\n\n\u003E ![8tFu7.png](http://i.imgur.com/8tFu7.png)\n\u003E ![xHl5n.png](http://i.imgur.com/xHl5n.png)\n\nYeah, my lander is huge,"},{"CreatedByName":"Naiba","CreatedById":3221,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T19:50:18Z","Content":"YAY, fluked a first-attempt landing with a stock ship I slapped together =D\n\n\u003E ![minimuslanding.jpg](http://img535.imageshack.us/img535/6449/minimuslanding.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLucky","CreatedById":3060,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T20:47:38Z","Content":"For what it\\\u0027s worth, the \\\u0027seas\\\u0027 on Minmus are solid.
