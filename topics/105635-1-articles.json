No input is being supplied and SAS can not correct it. The COM and balance of the vehicle is centered and there is no RCS or any method for it to gain this motion except through reaction torque. I turned off reaction torque to see if that was causing it and it was not, it continued to gain speed. You can correct the motion manually and reset SAS but the SAS system will supply no input to correct it even though the SAS icon switches to it\u0027s 2 arrows chasing one another active state.
