Thank Thee\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe technical explanation is that is loads the backup save that MCE creates upon visiting the space center. It only does this when exiting a simulation, no matter how the simulation is exited. This means that if you use my revert buttons it will work, but it should also work using the stock revert buttons or simply going to the space center or tracking station. This mod does nothing with regards to MCE recycling, but any parts recovered manually are \u0022recycled\u0022 by KCT or if there\u0027s enough parachutes to drop the velocity of the spent stages to below (about) 10 m/s at sea level. I believe MCE recycling is similar (mine is based on theirs and the Real Chute support that they have is based on mine). I don\u0027t support recycling powered stages without parachutes like MCE does. I THINK the two recycling systems shouldn\u0027t interfere (neither specifically remove anything, and as long as you use the recover button for things on the ground then that\u0027ll be fine too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for quick saves: you can\u0027t quick save during a simulation, which is the only time KCT cares about MCE.

I\u0027ll make sure to update the OP, so thank you for catching that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weirdness with unlocking is a bug on KSP\u0027s end, as it doesn\u0027t update the screen when changes occur to the science amount or tech nodes. I intercept the tech nodes being unlocked and set them to locked. KSP displays it as unlocked even though that isn\u0027t true. When you reload the window it displays properly. You can unlock them again, but a message alerts you that the node is already being researched and you are refunded the science. Except once again KSP doesn\u0027t update the science counter at the top of the window to display the fact that it\u0027s refunded.
