The biggest issue encountered was requiring the deployment of one Duna Ascent Vehicle with no control whatsoever (forgot a probecore somehow...). The only option was to set the chute and drop it... amazingly, it worked first try but it appeared many legs were broken in the landing due to not being able to fire the retro-rockets. The second Duna ascent vehicle will go down with an engineer to ensure it lands safe and will be able to repair the second ascent vehicle if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting into Duna orbit felt a little cheaty, in regards to heating. Although most vessels were able to use a fairing as a heat shield, the crew vessel had and needed none; it only needed to approach Duna from a higher Pe and aerocapture with a high Ap. Several high Pe passes through Duna\u0027s atmosphere later, a high orbit was easily attained. I have heating at 120%.. no issues, still. ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small RCS-powered crew shuttles ensured safe transit between the various vessels and also helped FPS-wise by only having to load one \u0022big\u0022 vessel at a time. The shuttles, capable of (gracelessly..) landing on Kerbin or Duna, comprise one measure of backup/emergency protocol. There are also two inflatable crew quarters, excess life-support and two ways of returning to Kerbin should the primary system fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext post will land the team, mine the fuel for the ascent vehicles, and explore the surface in the rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/3CDef\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

As a child of the Apollo age, I think it says a lot about Apollo in general when it still inspires people over 50 years later. And, as much as I like the 70\u0027s lines of the space shuttle, it really is about as exciting as a long-haul cargo truck (although seeing one launch was impressive). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArguably, the space shuttle got more work done than Apollo but a reusable shuttle certainly wasn\u0027t needed to build the ISS.

Most of the co-dependent vehicles were ever tested together and since I don\u0027t use any engineering mods, all \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv needs are done purely by experience and \u0022ballparked\u0022. While there was plenty of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for the return trip, getting the crew into orbit and rendezvousing with the return craft was very tight for both ascent vehicles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurned out it\u0027s a good thing they only needed to get close, as I seem to have left off the auxiliary docking ports for the return crafts to use. Instead, we pulled the return craft alongside, bailed out, and performed 6 EVA\u0027s to the return craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll 6 crew were returned safe in the Big Gemini capsule on a ballistic re-entry after a course correction while just inside Kerbin SOI, tossing the main return craft into deep space. With a Pe of 34km, the crew passed through the atmosphere and into one suborbital trajectory before final landing. Could have gone a little lower, as not even 200 ablator was ablated - good to know for future missions from Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/8pwVG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/8pwVG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETier 1: Normal Apollo Program 136 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Saturn Five uses 5 engines on the first stage, 5 engines on the second stage, and one engine on the third \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E stage. \u002B20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Free-Return Trajectory until in Mun\u0027s SOI. \u002B10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Lander stored behind a fairing. \u002B10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Leave Descent Stage on Mun. \u002B5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Include ALSEP Science Package on Apollo 11-18 \u002B5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Include Lunar Rover on Apollo 11-18 \u002B10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Include Lunar Subsatellite on Apollo 11-18.\u002B5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Launch Escape System. \u002B5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Use fuel cells for power generation only \u002B10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Use a Life Support mod \u002B26\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Fly a mission to Minmus using Apollo/Saturn hardware. \u002B30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Tier 2: Apollo Applications Program 105 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - AAP \u0022base\u0022 mission MOLAB \u002B0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Duna Flyby \u002B20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Skylab \u002B20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Munar Base \u002B20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Eve Flyby \u002B20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Use fuel plant on Mun in some way for further missions \u002B25\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELand and return from Duna, using Apollo-Saturn hardware: ???\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI throw myself at the mercy of the OP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell-deserved congratulations for for your journey through this challenge! \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Why cannot I give rep at this moment?

The Eve flyby was only 526 days and departed Kerbin about 30 before the optimal transfer window. Initial burns were definitely the highest \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv burns, but due to Eve\u0027s inclination wasn\u0027t able to take as much advantage of the slingshot effect as with Duna.
