The probe cores make this unnecessary but my Kerbals like the option of the view. \n\nThe wheels are mounted on fuel tanks inside upside-down MK 2 cargobays (dust shields) Thrust is a little off center, but it has more than ample TWR and fTeruel for a landing (not sure about VTOL after wards - my landing simulation ran into trouble when the relay sat went out of range and Line-of-sight to Kerbin was lost - but everything else was going perfectly - especially considering I couldn\u0027t use the NAV ball correctly (Thrust was directed 90% off from pro-grade).\n\nThere is a third cargo-bay on it with a surprise for later, the only hint I\u0027ll give to that is that there is a reason lights around that part of MOLAB are all red."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T17:13:56Z","Content":"The PM - 1 Mission is complete, and my Apollo Program has officially begun.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123221-Challenge-My-attempt-at-The-Apollo-Applications-Program-1-0-Edition?p=2007285\u0026viewfull=1#post2007285](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123221-Challenge-My-attempt-at-The-Apollo-Applications-Program-1-0-Edition?p=2007285\u0026viewfull=1#post2007285)\n\nI think I\u0027ve very much underestimated the SpaceBucks required to run this whole program. My S-1b launch cost about 77K, and I can easily see S-5 launches running to three times that number. With 17 Missions planned out of a possible 22 proposed (Not counting the AAP Missions which I haven\u0027t even planned out yet!), the potential cost of all of this is astronomical. It will be a challenge going forward, but it\u0027s also a lot of fun.\n\nAs promised, I finally have a score that is above zero.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Stock. *\u002B20 (Use only stock parts)* \n\nI didn\u0027t actually have the fuel cells unlocked for the PM - 1 Mission, so I cannot claim a score for that yet.\n\nEDIT: Eagle-eyed viewers might spot the reason I just realized this flight doesn\u0027t count.

This mission is a combination of various ideas presented as possible Mars solutions such as: Nerva propulsion, refillable SII stages, Duna orbital shuttles for crew transfer, in situ fuel production and multiple landing teams with heavy redundancy. \n\nUsing the same Saturn family of launchers used in previous efforts, a total of 10 launches delivered these Duna-bound payloads to LKO:\n\n- (2) Saturn V MLV carrying Duna Ascent Vehicles\n- (6) Saturn V ELV to refuel the two Duna Ascent Vehicles -\n- (1) Saturn V MLV with crew habitation module\n- (1) Saturn V MLV propulsion stage for crew habitation module\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Although more testing probably would have been a good idea, getting the crew out to Duna orbit was relatively problem-free. The biggest issue encountered was requiring the deployment of one Duna Ascent Vehicle with no control whatsoever (forgot a probecore somehow...). The only option was to set the chute and drop it... amazingly, it worked first try but it appeared many legs were broken in the landing due to not being able to fire the retro-rockets. The second Duna ascent vehicle will go down with an engineer to ensure it lands safe and will be able to repair the second ascent vehicle if needed.\n\u003E \n\u003E Getting into Duna orbit felt a little cheaty, in regards to heating. Although most vessels were able to use a fairing as a heat shield, the crew vessel had and needed none; it only needed to approach Duna from a higher Pe and aerocapture with a high Ap. Several high Pe passes through Duna\u0027s atmosphere later, a high orbit was easily attained. I have heating at 120%.. no issues, still. ?\n\u003E \n\u003E The small RCS-powered crew shuttles ensured safe transit between the various vessels and also helped FPS-wise by only having to load one \u0022big\u0022 vessel at a time. The shuttles, capable of (gracelessly..) landing on Kerbin or Duna, comprise one measure of backup/emergency protocol. There are also two inflatable crew quarters, excess life-support and two ways of returning to Kerbin should the primary system fail.\n\u003E \n\u003E Next post will land the team, mine the fuel for the ascent vehicles, and explore the surface in the rovers.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.

They convert kerbal waste called \u0027mulch\u0027 into LS. However, it\u0027s not a closed system as it takes 1 kerbal two days to excrete (?) enough mulch to create 1 day of LS. I\u0027m really fond of this LS mod as it doesn\u0027t add a huge amount of complexity to the game and the LS is a reasonable mass, but it still adds consequence if you send a kerb on a long mission without sufficient LS or electricity.\n\nThe girders are from [Stock Part Revamp](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92764-1-0-2-Stock-Part-Revamp-Update-1-8-1!), another highly recommended mod. Also.. most of the habitation/station parts are from the [Stockalike Station Parts Expansion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814). Both of these mods are excellent part additions while still staying mostly-stock.\n\nI like your reasoning on the aerocapturing around Duna. And to be fair, I did need to burn the engine retro a bit to help slow down. On an earlier attempt, I did an aerocapture with a Pe around 21km and several parts turned into smoke from overheating so it *is* possible to get heat damage, but not too tricky to avoid it. I have yet to go beyond Duna/Eve in 1.02.. I guess I need to head out to Jool and Laythe to get a better feel for high-speed aerobraking. \n\nOn another note.. seriously impressed with the creativity in design and storytelling this thread has wrought from everyone here. As a child of the Apollo age, I think it says a lot about Apollo in general when it still inspires people over 50 years later. And, as much as I like the 70\u0027s lines of the space shuttle, it really is about as exciting as a long-haul cargo truck (although seeing one launch was impressive). \n\nArguably, the space shuttle got more work done than Apollo but a reusable shuttle certainly wasn\u0027t needed to build the ISS. The [link](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/dreamingadifferentapollo/) posted by B-STRK earlier in the thread was almost hard to read in the sense that the Apollo/Saturn systems were already fully developed when they were scrapped. Had the production lines and launch schedule kept even at a minimum, with iterative design upgrades along the way, we\u0027d be a lot closer to the visions of Kubrick and Clarke in *2001 A Space Odyssey (1968)*. \n\nThe \u0027Dreaming a Different Apollo\u0027 article reminded me a little of the [Avro Arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_CF-105_Arrow) story. At least the cancelled mission hardware for Apollo 18 and onward still exists as monument instead of having horrible, unspeakable things done to them like the Avro Arrow. Threads like this, and the popularity of KSP in general, are testament that space exploration remains a priority to many. And that gives me hope. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*It [the rocket] will free man from his remaining chains, the chains of gravity which still tie him to this planet.

The Eve flyby was only 526 days and departed Kerbin about 30 before the optimal transfer window. Initial burns were definitely the highest \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv burns, but due to Eve\u0027s inclination wasn\u0027t able to take as much advantage of the slingshot effect as with Duna. As I returned and re-used the MORL after getting out to Duna and back, the Kerbin orbital insertion burn back from Duna was fairly costly as well (it was discarded at the end of the Eve flyby). Both missions needed around 150 m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv burn to get back to Kerbin while in deep space.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T16:52:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Death Engineering**"},{"CreatedByName":"loch.ness","CreatedById":101329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T17:07:26Z","Content":"Technically I launched this SanSat probe with a Saturn IB... does that mean it counts as Apollo Tech? \n\n![B503EF2C525B8E3708222C54B34623821DFE8282](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/27367103398353032/B503EF2C525B8E3708222C54B34623821DFE8282/)\n\nP.S.
