That 7200RPM might help with the spectacularly slow loading screens as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CPU I have no idea about. However, my old AMD X4/640 will cope with a few hundred parts quite nicely. I\u0027ve built thousand-and-odd part rockets, but it does go very slideshow at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only sticking point are those integrated graphics. You might need to turn terrain detail down or do some config hacking on the oceans, but other than that, yes, I see no reason why this computer could not run KSP. Of course, the best thing to do would be to download the (0.18.x based) demo and give it a whirl. 0.23 will run a little smoother than that due to improvements since then, but it\u0027ll give you a good guesstimate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Peter KG6LSE","CreatedById":98109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T08:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am on a toughbook CF30 core 2 duo 1.6 GHz 4 GB ram and it works OK Win xp.
