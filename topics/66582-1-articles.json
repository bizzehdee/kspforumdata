I wanted to send out a small buyou-looking spacecraft on Duna with some science experiments. And when i got to Duna i noticed i don\u0027t have any fuel for my landing engines. So why not to use parachute, you say. Nope, only one parachute for 5 tons spacecraft isn\u0027t good on Duna. So i thought to simply land on the structural part on bottom of spacecraft it will break but spacecraft will live. NOPE. The game decided that after coming back from warp prachute will break off. So i thought - oh sh**! And then i realised i have some fuel in my interplanetary stage i didn\u0027t detach yet! If only those liquid fuel engines for landing could work... (game decided that i can\u0027t transfer fuel. So i said- LITHOBREAKING! Why not to use it? I set up a course leading (after calculations on drag and how atmo will lower peri) to be just few meters above ground. (few meters means few meters above 0) I came to atmosphere and the game decided to screw my calulations and let\u0027s put the periapis -10000 meters under the ground. So i quick engaged the enignes! They didn\u0027t have enough throttle to slow me down so much, but at least after lots of explosions my probe thermometer science bay and an antennae and, luckily, one solar panel survived. Yay! I did science an transmitted it. I earned ~1000 science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ENo pics, not so interesting, why do i post this?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
