Maybe that is still the case. In that case I think you are out of luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidmetalrob","CreatedById":167611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-28T17:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/144074-rodhern/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022144074\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/144074-rodhern/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Rodhern\u003C/a\u003E! That is the first time I\u0027ve seen anyone mention that you have to upgrade the tracking station and the game doesn\u0027t explain that at all. Now I have the option to switch to my other Kerbal.
