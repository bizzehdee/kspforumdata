And noticed these Finance strategies are pretty much useless.\n\nYou do missions where rewards are 100k\u002B funds, and 20-100 science. And even with 100% conversion rate that would give you 200-1000 more funds. That is like drop in the ocean. This should be % amount of money from the mission you do, not just fixed rate which is now ridiculously low. \n\nIs the only good strategy to get reputation boosts and reduce launch cost?"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T06:27:26Z","Content":"Uh, the one that turns money into science is ALSO at a fixed rate and is on the scale of \u0027finishing the whole tech tree in three contracts\u0027... but that takes all the fun out of unlocking nodes, so it\u0027s kinda useless in a different way."},{"CreatedByName":"Bandock","CreatedById":28934,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T06:34:11Z","Content":"Outsourced R\u0026D is definitely overpowered at the moment. You could get incredible amounts of science through that strategy (capable enough of actually unlocking the entire tree in a few launches).\n\nHowever, I can definitely say the ones dealing with funding/finances are underpowered.\n\nThese things should be fixed up in 1.0 though. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T07:12:34Z","Content":"Just in case you didn\u0027t know: There\u0027s a mod for that! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nLook up Sane Strategies."}]}
