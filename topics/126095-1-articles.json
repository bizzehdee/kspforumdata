Its very manouverable and pretty quick with a top speed of 230 m/s in low altitude :).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was genuenly suprised that the aircraft worked so well considering that the wings are not the biggest ever and it has a lot of \u0022extra bits\u0022, wing tip tanks, external fuel tanks and the engine pods on the sides.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince the aircraft has so many fuel tanks and 4 tiny \u0022juno\u0022 engines it has a very long range. I only used 280/880 units of fuel for maximum performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo here are some picks of it in action.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Ie6wFEa.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/a1mkPOm.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/XI55SUL.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat was the first proper test flight and its safe to say that the weapons work as intended :wink:.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Joi91is.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll safe and sound on the hangar.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe aircraft turns on a dime in ground so its easy to enter and leave the hangar from the same door :D.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/PbkbSuL.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter a quick stop at the island we are ready to leave and end the second test flight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/iuZjkNQ.png[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere it is for you, the F-89 Scorpion.
