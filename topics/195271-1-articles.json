He does not address Terraforming, IIRC. There is apparently an updated version of the Plan using SPACEX equipment but I haven\u0027t read it. But all the key elements of living on Mars are addressed, shelter, food, water, breathable air, light and then heavy industry, energy sources, and how to make the fuel and oxidizer for your trip home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMartyn Fogg takes a much longer look at things, including the truly EPIC like changing planetary orbits (hint: It\u0027s not impossible just VERY EPICALLY EXPENSIVE, and you\u0027ll probably end up increasing the planet\u0027s overall mass in the process - it will still SUCK to be living there for a couple of thousand years, even after the project is deemed finished). Terraforming is the stuff of a species that has shed its one-planet mentality, and has learned to take the long view on things.Perhaps a species that routinely lives two or three centuries instead of six decades.\u00A0Even the relative quick fixes like solar radiation collectors that focus the equivalent of several times Mars\u0027s natural energy quota on the poles take hundreds or even thousands of years to make a difference. You\u0027re playing a very long game when you want to change a planet\u0027s environment. That all said, in Fogg\u0027s mind, and his calculations Mars is the easiest candidate in the solar system. A couple of the Gas Giant moons look more favorably until you factor in the Gas Giant\u0027s magnetic field and what it does to charged particles in the solar wind. Hint: Jupiter has Van Allen Radiation Belts that make Earth\u0027s look ... well... quite inferior... humorous even.

I included him for reference sake to show how technology can makes things change. I have a copy of an updated version of the Mars Project (updated during the early Apollo Project, I think). In the initial version he disregarded hydrogen-oxygen or kerosene-oxygen propulsion in favor of a ridiculously nasty hypergolic mix of nitric acid and hydrazine, because the hypergolic mix was storable even though he knew it had a much lower performance. Less than two decades later the same man recants and writes that even with LOX and LH2 lousy storage they\u0027re a better choice because the engines developed in the last two decades are so powerful and will shave thousands of tons and dozens of launches off the mission plan. Other things also disappeared or changed over the two decades. Initially all radio communication for the Mars mission would have been done through Morse Code, because of the mass of existing radios. By the time Armstrong and Aldrin touched down on the Moon they took TV cameras with them and were in constant voice contact with mission control. The manifest for Mars Project also included tons of coffee and mechanical computers for the multiple navigators, so that they could remain alert and precise while double checking each others calculation for the next trajectory adjustment. By the time that the Saturn V was finalized one of its stages (2nd I think) was carrying a 50 pound concrete ballist where a guidance computer would have been. The actual guidance computer had shrunk from a 50 pound monster to a sub-1 pound object in just five years.

Best chance for metals other than iron oxide and a handful of others\u00A0on lunar surface is meteorite impacts. If we can get everything we need on the Moon in abundance, great,\u00A0but it seems doubtful from the first glance. Just looking at general mineralogical composition, there\u0027s no carbon on the Moon. Even if you find a way to refine iron from the oxides found on the surface, no way to make such basic material as steel. Copper also looks like a problem, so aluminum alloys are also a problem.\u00A0Mars has far richer geology and seems like it would give great opportunities for mining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars is also conveniently located. It\u0027s a little far, true, but there are known cycler orbits that would make it very convenient both to send equipment from LEO or lunar gateway to Mars and to send goods from Mars to Earth. Shipping down here on Earth can take months, we still get things manufactured where it\u0027s cheap, not where it\u0027s convenient. 7-8 month shipping time from Mars seems entirely reasonable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next convenient mining location is the asteroid belt. The problem there is that while it\u0027s pretty good for raw resources, it\u0027s not fantastic for actual industry. A lot of the things we make require an entire pallet of raw resources. The simplest of titanium alloys require a source of titanium, aluminum, and tin. Good luck finding all of that on the same asteroid. And failing that, moving things about the belt is actually awkward. Depending on how quickly you want things moved, sending things to Earth might be cheaper than moving things from one part of the belt to another. On Mars, while I don\u0027t expect all of the necessities to be found conveniently in one location, you can have a literal railroad moving raw resources about. That planet\u0027s practically made for being turned into a giant factory. The only significant problems are the dust that you\u0027ll have to deal with and lack of rivers and lakes for easy cooling solutions. But this feels less like a barrier, and more like reason to build infrastructure differently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-06T15:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223815802\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195271\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221594031406\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next convenient mining location is the asteroid belt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept that the asteroid belt isn\u0027t sitting deep in a gravity well,\u00A0 so once you mine an asteroid you can easily ship it where needed.\u00A0 Granted, this is going to require either expensive ore or cheap robotics (technically near-zero interest rates would help, but that\u0027s almost certainly an illusion or hidden subsidy), because the *time* till your return on investment is going to be brutal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is entirely possible that you might send multiple probes out to locate ideal asteroids, unfurl a solar sail, reverse slingshot around Jupiter to Venus, reverse slingshot at venus, and finally capture at Earth.\u00A0 Some of those asteroids would effectively break the current market for that ore, and only be valuable as either some sort of monopoly (like DeBeers) or finding new uses for said ore (like having platinum catalysts available everywhere, or replace copper conductors with gold).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- never heard of a golden asteroid, but you *know* you would get investors to go grab it.\u00A0 It wouldn\u0027t matter how irrational, you\u0027d get investors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-06T16:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeh heh.... so what you are saying is... if Mars was the Golden planet INSTEAD of the Red planet, being covered with golden dust and diamonds on the soil, with platinum ore beneath... we would have a space program that was much farther along?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause I find it really hilarious that the answer is probably YES!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHumans and their wants.
