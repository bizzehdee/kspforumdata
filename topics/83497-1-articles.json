Hmmm. My vague answer is \u0022educating the people\u0022. While it isn\u0027t an immediate affect, it certainly can benefit any direct methods that diminish the spread of ebola. Not a really scientific answer but rather a social/cultural approach. As the article says, applying such a concept in the field can ultimately be very difficult. Epidemiologists working with cultural anthropologists may be able to find a way to educate those that might be affected by this spread. This likely would be a slow process but in my opinion, essential.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T13:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll see a lot more damage done by ebola virus in the future.

One of my nightmares is that Boko Haram or someone like them will deliberately infect people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course in that part of Africa trust in the government and doctors is in short supply which adds to the problem. Lack supplies to treat and contain the spread, one of the highest groups at risk are the doctors, nurses and hospital staff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can be done to control it...drastic action. The areas effected need to be contained, vigorously. When new infection is located contain that as well, reduce as much as you can the ability of the virus to travel. With it\u0027s spread slowed it will kill itself, Ebola Zaire, has a death rate of 75% IIRC unless it can spread it will run out of new hosts. Once transmission is reduced below a certain point then send in people to treat what you can and bury/burn the dead. Keep the active quarantine up for months until you sure it is dead, dead, dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand the last mass outbreak which was only 300 or so was in the \u002790s I think medical advances have come along way since then so a firewall defense against the spread will kill people that could be saved...Dammed if you do, dammed it you don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow excuse me I need to stop thinking about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T15:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe virus, unless it mutates into something even more horrific, is rather easy to avoid if you don\u0027t touch or lick other people or their bodily fluids, if you don\u0027t engage in coitus with strangers and if you wash your hands with a soap.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntuitively, it makes sense that the virus isn\u0027t that contagious. After all, it is currently endemic in highly populated regions that lack adequate sanitation and clean water, yet it has \u0022only\u0022 spread to a few thousand people so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, I think that Aningaaq makes a good point. Educating the people is a key component of controlling the spread. It sounds like public health efforts are having some effect because I\u0027ve read reports that people are avoiding physical contact and are washing their hands everywhere they go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s a darker side too. People who have been exposed to the virus have to understand that they carry a burden of responsibility themselves too. Two recent cases where several health workers were unwittingly exposed to the disease while trying to care for a person who they thought was only sick with malaria occurred after the patients (or their families) lied about their being exposed to Ebola. Contrast that with the incredible story of the people of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyam#Plague_history\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEyam, England\u003C/a\u003E who chose to isolate themselves when plague was discovered there in 1665, rather than let the infection spread. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the absence of a vaccine, sanitation and social responsibility will probably be the greatest factors in getting this outbreak under control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Herr Doktor Strangemember\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Herr Doktor Strangemember\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOn the other hand the last mass outbreak which was only 300 or so was in the \u002790s I think medical advances have come along way since then [...]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read another article that indicated that the genome of the virus responsible for this outbreak has already been sequenced as part of the effort to understand how it has spread so far. They know that it has mutated a few times already and can trace it all the way back to patient zero. That is pretty impressive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also understand (someone please correct me if I am wrong) that the experimental drug Zmapp introduces three antibodies that interfere with the virus\u0027 ability to cause damage. IIRC, the antibodies are grown in GMO tobacco plants. Again, that is pretty impressive technology! In short, there\u0027s hope that this can eventually be brought under control with biomedical technology, but while we wait for that, the world community needs to continue to supply public education, sanitation, clean water and health care to the affected areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T16:03:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 04:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T15:56:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I know, so long as the public is aware, even if there was a case in the developed world, it wouldn\u0027t spread so easily.
