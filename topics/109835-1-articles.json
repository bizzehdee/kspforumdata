Obviously math and science and get a good SAT score. I assume they haven\u0027t changed too much of the course catalog since 2008, so I\u0027ll say not to worry about chemistry too much as you only need 101 and 201. Physics and equations are everything. Dr. Mazzoleni was head of the space division in my time and he\u0027s the nicest dude ever. Try to find a smart TA in your first aero courses who can guide you a bit. Also, just enjoy the labs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I took summer session courses every year (even straight out of high school). It\u0027s a great way to get a jump on things. If you go that route, use your summers to do something totally different, otherwise you just go blind on calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a history minor with mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd study up on NASA history. There\u0027s a lot of solutions that have already been done that you can reuse...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESend me a private message and I\u0027ll keep an eye out for you as you go through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck kid!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
