I thought I would start simple, practice driving round the KSC before I attempted anything more adventurous. What a a pain. Starting simple I used a control pod and an XL girder with a couple of solar panels and four wheels. The wheels seem to want to attach themselves to the girder in every possible way other than the obvious way of one each side with the wheel pointing to the ground. Eventually i get them on and go to launch. The wheels the sink into the runway. They rotate but the thing does not move forward. I guess it must be me but I just can\u0027t see what I a doing wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-23T09:47:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2014 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by THobson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T16:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may just have to take the brakes off.

A little bit of the suspension will be sticking upwards when you\u0027ve got it right. If for some reason they\u0027re attaching at an odd (non-90 degree) angle, you can hold shift while pressing the WASD\u002BQE keys to rotate them in 5 degree increments until they look right. Also, Pressing spacebar while holding a part will reset its orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think even on mac, the F1 key is the screenshot key. Screenshots are automatically numbered and saved to your KSP installation folder under \u0022Screenshots\u0022. Repeated pressing of the F1 key will take screenshots in rapid succession, no need to copy/paste anywhere. Posting the resulting pictures on the forum can be a trick, since the \u0022Insert Image\u0022 will require a web address. I advise checking out Imgur, which lets you upload images and albums for free. You can then copy BBCode from Imgur and paste it directly into forum posts to share.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T04:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen attaching wheels to girders, it\u0027s often helpful to turn off \u0022snap to angles\u0022 (the hexagon/circle toggle on the lower left, next to the symmetry button). Then you should only need to rotate them once before placing them, as the orientation won\u0027t be flipping around, trying to match itself to the girder surface. And yes, if the wheels are not upright, they will seem to sink into the surface and get little or no traction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THobson","CreatedById":97709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T09:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for your very helpful replies. I will have a look at how to upload screen shots. My experience is that when rotating the wheels the only time they snap on is either some ridiculous orientation or one that looks right but does not work. I think it is a great idea to develop a game while people are still playing it but my impression is that rovers have not been a high priority for the development team. I think I will give rovers a miss until the developers have had more time to make the interface more usable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T09:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if it is the problem or not, but you should definitely construct your rovers in SPH (spaceplane hangar, that small building next to the runway), not in VAB.
