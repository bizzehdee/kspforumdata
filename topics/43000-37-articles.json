That\u0027s why you can see the flickering sometimes when in space and you look down on the edge of the ocean and land. Or just go to the Kerbin city airport and look at the taxilines xD if you look them from more than 20 meters they will flicker badly cause the taxiline plane is just a few centimeters over the ground plane. But in this case I made an exception cause they are tiny, not that noticable, and cutting the polys there would be ridiculous.

Although I was using my current knowledge of water management and land reclamation in the Netherlands, I was looking more at a Manhattan (an natural peninsula on which people have expanded, mostly with landfill) and New Orleans (a large portion of which is under sea level as we all sadly remember) There is hardly a city that isn\u0027t building levees. I guess it is fashionable and has the side effect of only saving millions of lives, which is nice. I was thinking of maybe a ring road around KC that would go over the levee with a bridge, 60 meters above the sea so ships can pass. (think Golden Gate, although I am a personal fan of the cantilever, seems very Kerbal \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) Also, instead of having your land 10 meters above sea level, the plots I am thinking of should only be 1 to 2 meters high. This would also give a perfect opportunity for canals like Amsterdam and Venice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nothke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nothke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe biggest problem about the map I see here is that you didn\u0027t mind airport flight/landing paths and rivers (that I noted in a post few pages ago). Otherwise the city is just too big. We need 3 months to fill up one island and I don\u0027t plan to be on this project for a long time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to give in on that point. It is big. I liked the suggestion of one person to just \u0027Lego\u0027 it and speed up the process. Maybe a basic building on a plot. If someone wants to build something, then they get the plot. I think it would make a much more fluid transition and possibly give the mod an extra popularity boost if it was \u0027beta-ready.\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the flightpath... In hindsight I think light blue 2 and orange 3 are a bit overkill. I put them in so as to fill up dead space. It was also pointed out that the train station isnt in the most ideal of a location. Shifting that into the residential (green) section could solve that problem and (for a real world solution) help congestion by spreading out the transport hubs across the city. I like your idea about the seaport (and yes, i did spell that incorrectly which is pretty bad xD.) In RL I would win this argument. But this is KSP and the ships wont get that big. Shifting it back is possible and then you could free up some space for the river (if it ever flows again...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nothke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nothke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would rather wish that the Kerbals have social equality, so there are no really \u0022classes\u0022, sure some Kerbals are more artistic and some more scientific, some are bosses some are workers, but I don\u0027t think they need aristocratic villas areas to show off. Even if some do, it certainly wouldn\u0027t be \u0022gated\u0022. If a Kerbal has higher income, then he pays higher taxes =) I imagine them as having a very good social politics, therefore they can invest everything in science, technology and space exploration and they don\u0027t really care about personal wealth cause they only think about space and science =)\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, most of these ideas are already mention and thought of, but there are some nice ones. I\u0027ll keep this in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd residential doesn\u0027t even have my priority in interest. It is more for a SimCity feel to it. Maybe for long term or something. I am just wondering, do you live in the US, cause then you must be a communist xD but elsewhere you would be an average Joe for saying something like that xD (I\u0027m also American but I moved to Holland when I was 12). I would love to contribute, but whenever I try out Blender I go into a fetal position and start sobbing like a blubbering baboon. If I have time I could do some Google sketch, but it is very uncertain how much time I have. First free days of university I have is for Christmas and new years, then exams...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I can contribute in anyway that isnt too time consuming I would love to. I haven\u0027t tried out this mod yet because of a promise I made myself to only play Killing floor until November so as to have time to study and not game too much, but once november wakes me up again I will certainly try it out!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brobel","CreatedById":59489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T01:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell im going to messing around with sketchup and unity trying to make a building so i saw a waiting list for phase 2 and i would like to be on that\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fitzy3","CreatedById":65851,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T06:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan someone please put my company logo on a building, just \u0022Fitzpatrick Corp\u0022 In red with black backing and underlined e.g. in my sig.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"POTKC","CreatedById":57600,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T07:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could try, I\u0027m not THAT good though.
