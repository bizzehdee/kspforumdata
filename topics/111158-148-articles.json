And how do you put a quote from a different thread into a different thread?\n\u003E \n\nAs to user quotes, there are three ways:\n\nWay 1 *should* work, but I haven\u0027t tested it. Basically, you want to be in an editor with the quote you want, then grab the entire \n\n\u003E  (or maybe even the \n\u003E one level up) from the element editor, then open your signature editor, and edit the \n\u003E  inside the editor from the page source, and paste that in. It\u0027s a nuisance, and there\u0027s no guarantee it will work.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Way 2 is to click the \u0022quote\u0022 button in the sig editor, paste in the appropriate text, and use that. The only problem with that is that it doesn\u0027t have the name, date, or link of the actual quote. If you care to fix that you could try to get the unix time, user id, and post id and edit the \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E  element by reverse engineering other quote\u0027s HTML.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Way 3, and the one I recommend, is to do what I did in my signature: Take a screenshot of the quote, then edit it with an image editor to save space (which isn\u0027t possible using the other methods without creating a table, also via HTML editing), and link the image to the post.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-07T22:54:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2018 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Mad Rocket Scientist**\n\u003E \u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-08T00:21:48Z","Content":"Would it be possible to see what the first version of the forum website looked like?"},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-08T00:43:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, HansonKerman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Well if it wasn\u0027t you, who was it?
