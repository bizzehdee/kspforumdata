Also, some parts need to be \u0027tested\u0027 and this is accomplished by right-clicking the part and clicking the \u0027test part\u0027 button on the bottom of the popup.

But I am puzzled, and so I want to check a few more things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first point is that testing an engine on the launchpad is the easiest possible contract there is. So if you are having difficulty with that one, then it seems like something must be wrong. So, first question -- I assume that you still have a pure stock game with no mods at this time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, how you test an engine on the launchpad is that you take a command pod, attach an engine, take all the fuel out of the engine (usually you don\u0027t really want to take a flight!), hit Launch, wait for the ship to load, hit Space to activate the engine (and complete the contract), and then click the \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 button to get your ship and crew back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, this assumes that the contract really does say \u0022on the launchpad\u0022.

You get four contracts available before you ever even touch the first structure or part, if you look. The one I\u0027m referring to is something like \u0022Launch your first vessel from the launchpad or runway.\u0022 Also, there\u0027s one for collecting science anywhere around Kerbin, one for escaping Kerbin\u0027s atmo and another for achieving orbit, which is all great, because I don\u0027t have any problems with completing all three in a single launch... sometimes... but more often than not, I\u0027ll complete those three contracts and somehow still not have completed the\u00A0\u0022Launch your first vessel from the launchpad or runway.\u0022 I\u0027m in a stable orbit for crying out loud! How have I NOT launched? I promise a complete and total lack of BS here. No debug menu, no Hyperedit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a bug I\u0027ve yet to stumble across perusing the forums here? Perhaps it has something to do with reverting the flight? With the basic starter parts, it\u0027s really hard to nail the launch to orbit, so sometimes it takes me a few tries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose it\u0027s not really that big of an issue, but in the beginning, your limited funds IS.

Depending on which two you accept and complete, some of the others may\u00A0disappear. Getting to stable orbit, and getting above 70km are pretty obvious. The experiment one just needs you to do any science experiment. Launching from the pad or runway means exactly that.\u00A0I usually accept the first two contracts, put 14 unit of fuel into a flea, attach a command pod, a parachute, and 2 goos. Take runway data, Launch from the runway to 400m altitude, take airborne data, float back to the runway, take more runway eva data, roll the ship down off the runway onto the grass, and take all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E data -- then recover.
