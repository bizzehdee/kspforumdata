With career mode, this has prolonged the time it has taken for me to complete the tree with my limited play time. Recently, I have started using the LV-N for interplanetary. Because I assemble the rockets in space, my LV-Ns are delivered by manned crafts and docked by probe control. The idea with this is almost a form of asparagus. When I get to my destination, I transfer the fuel from one set of tanks into another, then remove the empty. Well, that was the plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I get to Gilly for this mission and sure enough, didn\u0027t quite use up half of the fuel getting there with a much lighter payload on the return without lander craft and fewer drive engines. So I start thinking to myself, I cannot just dump nuclear engines through Eve\u0027s atmosphere, that would be wrong. Suddenly I get the idea! I should make nuclear engine storage areas until I can get the tech up better to recover them properly. In this case, I parked them at my gilly landing location! When I get back to Kerbin system, I will lock them together in orbit around Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/504702189374130307/33059F306001667138FC96CC848CAE4A436DB96F/\u0022 alt=\u002233059F306001667138FC96CC848CAE4A436DB96F\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/504702189374132535/3CE69A8DD60228623D1A6DC9086E3BA54FE83810/\u0022 alt=\u00223CE69A8DD60228623D1A6DC9086E3BA54FE83810\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you dispose of your LV-Ns?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Hrm, I changed it to be 5 poll questions, but it posted instead.

I\u0027m still not sure how I will handle nukes, one-way interplanetary missions will probably just crash the nuke into the nearest body or leavy it orbiting for all eternity around Kerbol or some alien world. Nuclear drive cores of return missions, though, they will either be re-used or crashed into the Mun/Minmus.
