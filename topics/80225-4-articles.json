Seems like it\u0027ll work great for this and I\u0027m really liking how you got this setup. This mod is stellar!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever two things keep bugging me. One is the color scheme. I hate to rag on it because I know it is hard work, but I would love to see a more stock alike look. Maybe just a grey/white texture. It\u0027s just that the colors as they are really clash with almost everything I pair them with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond thing is two fold. One is it\u0027d be really nice to have attachment nodes on the sides of the hanger. That way I could mount it side ways and have a short fat hanger if wanted. Second part is that the ends just kind of fit awkwardly. For instance let\u0027s say you take the inline hanger at its default size and attach a mk1 to the top. It looks kind of odd. But if you attached a larger command podthe white texture of the node that I should probably replace it also looks a bit off. Just like it doesn\u0027t really fit. Not really sure how that could be fixed since the hanger resizes on the go. Maybe if the ends could have selectable sizes like in procedural parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow this doesn\u0027t come off as critical or anything. Just trying to give some helpful feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the feedback.

But they themselves are wider to be able to store vessels of the same size type as they are. For example, smaller hangar by default has attachment nodes of size1 which are 1.25m in diameter as all stock parts of that size. I agree that Pod Mk1 doesn\u0027t fit right, but compare this with how it fits with the stock fuel tank (FL-T400 e.g.) and you\u0027ll see the same thing. On the other hand, both Cockpits fit just fine. The thing I don\u0027t like myself is the texturing of the attach nodes. The rims of the white circles are pain to the eye when you make a hangar bigger a little.
