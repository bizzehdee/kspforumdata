Bomber intercept is a tricky one to automate; as bombs aren\u0027t currently AI controlled, perhaps Smart Parts timers open the bays and drop the payload from planes already spawned in flight (they start with zero velocity, so would start high), on a bearing controlled by one of the autopilot mods.\n\nThe bomber escort becomes feasible once BDA gets wingman capability.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-21T01:51:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2015 01:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by colmo**\n  \nUpdate info"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T00:18:03Z","Content":"I spent a while reacquainting myself with BD Armory AI and Kerbal Konstructs, which works again thanks to community patches.  \n\nBy increasing BD Armory physics range, and judicious use of radar links and dummy probe rockets with weapon managers, I was able to trigger a fight between two planes launching about 12km apart, with a mountain in between to boot.  \n\nThe last trick I need to perfect is launching both the dummy probes simultaneously.

By all means run one with turrets allowed.\n\nThe problem with turrets is they take away from good plane design. We arrived at the fixed gun rule very quickly when we realised how OP turrets, even limited, were.\n\nThe fixed .50 cal gun is more compelling because it\u0027s very lightweight, especially important on single engine planes struggling for TWR.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-08T14:35:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2016 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by colmo**"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T16:18:41Z","Content":"I wanted to formally report the ASC - King of the Hill for your list of AI tournaments:\n\n[\\[ASC\\] Air Superiority Challenge - King of the Hill - 2v2 AI Dogfight Battles](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/136016-air-superiority-challenge-king-of-the-hill-bdarmory-2v2-ai-duels-submit-your-fighters/)\n\nNo holds barred, practically anything goes. 2v2.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-18T16:20:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2016 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by inigma**"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T16:29:14Z","Content":"I had an idea, wondering if it would be feasible:\n\nAn open Player vs AI Tournament, with each \u0022level\u0022 being a more targets, more enemy fighters to fight against, but each level the player keeps the same planes (such as 3 AI planes which he can control at any time).\n\nThoughts?

My own focus was testing craft v craft with the AI as the level playing field. Changing that up into a pilot challenge would also work, not least for bragging rights! Where players are involved, I think it\u0027s most interesting as a contract, so that it folds into the career gameplay. e.g. I suggested a contract which air-spawned incoming craft to the KSC. The incremental nature would be the contracts getting harder and harder as the attacks become more deadly.\n\nI\u0027m still looking forward to finally running the JSF challenge, as I see that as the constructors\u0027 championship for plane designers!"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T11:54:47Z","Content":"Just voted in OP. I didn\u0027t see anywhere in thread that someone suggested procedural wings, although I didn\u0027t read carefully trough whole thread.\n\nEither B9PW or continuation on PW mod. Both are helpful in craft designs to reduce overall part number and to minimize part cliping.  \n\nAt the same time it allows freedom in shaping overall craft, something that is even more important with FAR phyisics.\n\nB9 Aerospace(part) mod have also some few features that comes handy in craft designs. You can easier turn some fuselage from structural to fuel tank without replacing all parts when you figured out that you need some extra fuel. But I understand that part mods should be limited to allow wider public to join tournaments.\n\nPerhaps all of tournaments need to be put on hold until BD Armoury is updated for KSP 1.1.2 or future upcoming patch.  \n\nLike some others mentioned, I\u0027m not much of fan for weapons, but like a chalange in good craft designs, might join some of tournaments if procedural wings are allowed in at least one of them.\n\nInstead of pure dogfight chalange, maybe to consider Fighter vs Bomber chalange ? Bomber needs to reach some target on the ground and destroy it while dodging fighter, while fighter need to shoot-down bomber before it reach target. Target can be some of KSP building or other craft on the ground. Bomber can start on old runway while fighters take off at KSC. It could bring some more interesting videos to watch."}]}
