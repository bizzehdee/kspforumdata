For detached shocks, the Mach number is actually below 1 on the craft side of the shockwave, so the flow could feasibly get around to the rear. For oblique shock waves, i think you have to look at tables, since flow can be sub sonic or supersonic on the craft side of the shockwave. Theoretically, pressure should be significantly reduced behind a blunt object.
