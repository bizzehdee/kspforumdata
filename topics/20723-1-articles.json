Jeb was always a bit of a slacker when it came to school, so his two very close friends, Bob Kerman and Bill Kerman(No Relation), have been there to help him out. Well, Jeb didn\u0027t have the experience to get a good job so he bought a small plot of land and built a junkyard on it, whenever he finished, he opened it up to the public and called it \u0027Jebediah\u0027s Junkyard\u0027. He and his 2 friends loved that place, and for a while, it was their livelihood After finishing college and getting his Bachelor\u0027s Degrees, he was faced with paying off his student loans, so like any normal kerbal would, he turned to his business for income; and sure enough, he found it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After a few months of thinking he decided it would be best to incorporate his passion for Aeronautics and space into his business, and started scrapping old Sub-Orbital Space Planes and old jet fighters. After much work and many months of scrapping old planes, he renamed his junkyard to \u0027Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co.\u0027 One day, while working, a young, beautiful woman stopped by in an old pickup truck to drop off some old furniture and junk. Whenever Jeb saw her, his heart and jaw dropped. He couldn\u0027t believe his eyes. After seeing her that one day, he couldn\u0027t stop thinking about her. She came by a few times to drop off random junk, but every time she did, he just couldn\u0027t gather the courage to talk to her. Well, one day at school, he was in class when all of a sudden, \u0027she\u0027 walks into his classroom. He couldn\u0027t believe what was happening; turns out she transferred in from another school. So one day, Bob and Bill decide to help their old pal out. They urge and pressure him into talking to her. They kept this up for weeks, until one day, Jeb finally gave in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Turns out, she likes all the same stuff he does, she\u0027s interested in Aeronautics also. Well, as the years go by, they become better and better friends, and soon, all 4 of them start hanging-out. Jenny, as was her name, starting to like Jeb more and more, and soon enough, they started dating. After a while Jenny tells Jeb that she is going to join the Kerbal Space Program. Jeb bids his girlfriend farewell, knowing it will be awhile before he sees her again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After a few months of loneliness, things go from bad to worse, he gets a terrible call from the KSC: Apparently Jenny went behind Minmus in a decaying orbit. She was flung out to space with no way of returning. Eventually as the ships power grew weaker, Jenny told Bill via a souped up phone antenna- that she is putting herself in a almost stable cryo-stasis system, operated by the ships computers. She wants him to join the KSP and figure out a way to save her because there is only so much time before the ships power generators run out of fuel and she perishes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So, you all might ask where this is all leading up to. Well, as you might see, Jeb is always smiling whenever he pilots a ship. The reason for this is because around every planet, every star, and over every hill and inside every valley, Jeb might find Jenny, the long-lost love of his life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis story was thought of and made by:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETheJokerMan\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Echrist110\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*Note: This story is a work of fan-fiction.*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkwolfpaw54","CreatedById":37377,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-28T22:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei give this 5 STARS now we need to show a movie about this then jeb is a star \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OceanFire","CreatedById":52626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-28T23:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI give this 10 out of 5 stars!
