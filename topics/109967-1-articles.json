I would highly recommend looking into an i5, they have turbo boost and can achieve even better single threaded performance.

Absolute minimum would be something like a 750ti, if you have the money to build a more future proof machine I would recommend something closer to a GTX 970 (ATI has some good deals on cards as well, but I prefer nvidia due to better driver support overall in my experience and much better power efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid state drive. This makes a huge difference in load times (especially when you have a heavily modded game). 256gb is the sweet spot for me with enough room for the OS and a decent amount of software, although from a pure price per GB perspective I think ~512GB drives are a little cheaper now, but not by much. I also highly recommend a secondary storage drive, something inexpensive with high capacity (speed isn\u0027t an issue). Great place to store all those mod downloads and backups of KSP installs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure to get a decent monitor, keyboard and mouse.
