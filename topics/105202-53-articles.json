I intentionally default them as \\*off\\* because I did not want to break other mods that have USI-LS support.\n\n(edit)\n\nRemember that LS configs are additive, so you just make your own, drop it in your mod, and it will automagically delta to the most pessimistic combination that it finds.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-21T21:28:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2016 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RoverDude**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T21:31:18Z","Content":"Wow. OK. So Kerbin has a 14 month year, with a \u0022holiday week\u0022 someplace in there? Strange.\n\nSince the month is arbitrarily defined in days (seconds?) how is it calibrated to Earth days? I can find it in here someplace, where roverdude listed some of his baseline assumptions regarding net consumables used per unit time... I wonder if it is roughly scale to kerbal size vs humans, and kerbal days standing in for Earth days. Ie: If a human uses a net 1.8 kg/24 hours, and kerbals are 40% of humans, would they use 0.72kg per 24 hours, or would they use 0.72kg per 6 hour day, instead?\n\nI\u0027m asking with an eye towards scaled up games (k-365, SKY, 64X, RSS, etc).\n\n(I tried searching, but the new forum will not let me constrain the search to the add-ons under development section where I think I recall Roverdude making the post).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-21T21:33:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2016 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"mcortez","CreatedById":153791,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T21:34:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Fraz86 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve been trying to work out how exactly the HabitationModule works. I don\u0027t use MKS, but I intend to turn on the habitation mechanic and write configs for other mods to support it. I saw that LSModule.cfg gives the Hitchhiker a HabitationModule with 12 KerbalMonths (KM). At first, I assumed this would simply add 12 KM, or maybe 12 KM x # of seats (48 KM), but in testing I discovered that it\u0027s actually more complicated. It looks like the formula is Habitation = Vessel\u0027s total # of seats x (1 \u002B Total of all KM added by HabitationModules). Is that correct and intended?\n\u003E \n\nAssuming I\u0027m groking roverdude\u0027s code correctly, habitation is currently calculated using 3 main factors: Crew Ratio to Crew Capacity, Habitation adds via HabitationModule and habitation multipliers via HabitationModule.\n\nCrew Ratio = Crew Capacity / Crew Present  \n\nHabitation Adds = 1 (by default in LS config) \u002B all values added in parts via HabitationModule  \n\nHabitation Multiplier = 1 (by default in LS config) \u002B values from HabitationModule (I\u0027m not sure what happens if you have 2 multipliers, do they add 1.25 (OKS Aeroponics) \u002B 3 (OKS Kerbitat) or multiply 1.25 \\* 3)\n\nTotal is then H-Adds \\* H-Multipliers \\* CrewRatio"}]}
