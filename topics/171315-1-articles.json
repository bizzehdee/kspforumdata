complicated (actual code monkey here) Most likely they just iterate over the gameData Folder and load each mod. If they create a Folder for each save and iterate over that instead...done. (However that would mean you have to create your savegame first, than close the game, copy your mods in the new folder and restart). They could do a simple text file for each savegame with the mods to load, but than you need an ingame screen to select the mods...that would mean actualy a bit of work.

Every change, or feature, will need coding to some degree and there are always problems when coding, changes change things and you have to deal with that. This is normal. Problem coding is when you have an issue with something like multiplayer time warping, the issues are not doing the coding, they are external to the code. Trying to find an acceptable way for the idea to be implemented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen someone says something would not be difficult to implement what they are meaning is, it is just another coding job. In this case, it would be to inject code into the mod loading code so you could have an option to selectively \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E load some mods. Then in the cheat menu where you can reload all assets, expand that to unload all the assets then reload them based on a checklist. Then activate particular checklists based on the loaded game so selected mods are loaded when you load a save. Not too hard but time consuming and I am sure a better solution exists. Personally, I know coding but not the language used for KSP or the mods. This means I know enough to know should be relatively easy but could not do it myself. I admit that lately the \u0060if it is so easy why do you not do it?\u0060 response to suggestions is wearing thin for me, like \u0060there\u0027s a mod for that\u0060 which was the retort to suggestions for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is like knowing a job would be easy for a plumber, like changing a radiator, but being unable to do it yourself. You could quite accurately say \u0022That should be an easy job to do (for a plumber)\u0022 and your mate saying \u0022if it so easy, I am sure you could do it yourself\u0022. The logic does not stand up to scrutiny. In a similar way, the suggestion from the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E would be an easy job (for a coder).

Also the method I suggested might take as long as loading the whole game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOften, a solution when coding that works is very easy.
