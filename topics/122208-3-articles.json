Also, the best advice I can give is to learn to fly your craft in Camera LOCKED mode rather than free or chase camera view. For me, just being in that camera mode makes everything easy - flying through hangars and landing on a small helipad with surgical precision.

Seems to work just fine. And oh, but internet points can be redeemed for real money! j/k. Also, that VTOL is compact enough that it could probably fit nicely into a rocket payload bay so it could be useful in other scenarios as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-08T14:09:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2015 02:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T14:35:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MunGazer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MunGazer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, very good point about it saying landed at the admin building.

This is the first challenge I\u0027ve posted so I\u0027m sort of feeling things out a bit. Speaking of video capture - I had been using fraps for quite some time \u002B windows movie maker. Recently though, I discovered that Windows 10 users have a free built in video capture tool that works exceptionally well. It doesn\u0027t hit my framerate as hard as fraps does, if at all, and the video quality is pretty good for how much memory it uses. And, it\u0027s already in a windows movie maker friendly format as opposed to the avi from fraps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-08T16:19:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2015 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegetal","CreatedById":147251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T16:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI downloaded Open Broadcaster just for this challenge, and I\u0027m keeping it.
