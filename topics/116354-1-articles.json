I don\u0027t have my beloved Near Future Propulsion due to it being unfit for duty in 1.0.4, and I don\u0027t want to revert back to 1.0.2 (too draggy even though I prefer the jet engine efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to play with Outer Planets Mod to give me some new targets, but don\u0027t for the above reason (no electric engines = PITA).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I\u0027m stuck waiting for several mods to get their 1.0.4 versions out (which is looking to be a while on the NFP/NFE/HC package), and, to top it off, my go-to Space Engineers server is a graveyard right now as we await the planets update (we\u0027ve decided on a wipe for planets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP\u0027s performance is getting worse for me (I have a monster of a rig but the CPU is 8-core and KSP doesnt like that), and I\u0027m running out of ideas to reinvigorate the experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve launched a whole torus station, so stupifying craft has its check in the box.
