Right now, Courage and Stupidity mean absolutely nothing. They are just arbitrary values which, while they might determine what facial expressions a kerbal has, do absolutely nothing for gameplay. I can think of a few ways this could be fixed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, I would like to see either the stupidity bar inverted (intelligence) or the courage bar inverted (cowardice) so that the stats can be more easily compared at a glance. High bars == good (or bad), and low bars == the opposite. Furthermore, I\u0027d like to see them add some more attributes. I\u0027m not sure what those would be, but more attributes would be nice to round out the kerbals\u0027 personalities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we can have something like that, I think it\u0027d be a good idea to tie those parameters in to how kerbals perform certain tasks. For example, high intelligence kerbals get more science from experiments; high courage kerbals make better pilots; and maybe high... I dunno... resourcefulness? ingenuity? something like that would make good engineers. Now, when you hire a recruit kerbal, you should be able to specify their job for them! Bill, Bob, Jeb, and Val are all pre-assigned, but recruit kerbals can be made into whatever role you want. However, the rate at which they gain experience, or perform their tasks might be dependent on their personality parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, parameters aren\u0027t just a random bar that is of no use to players. It can be used to make decisions about hiring kerbals and assigning them to their respective roles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T11:20:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Extraplanetary Launchpads mod makes a little use of some stats, but that\u0027s about as much as I can think of at the moment.

I had been thinking they could be integrated into a \u0022happiness\u0022 system, in which lone kerbals on long missions slowly deplete in happiness. Once they become unhappy, they no longer gain experience. This could be mitigated by bringing along more kerbals on long missions and by including \u0022living quarters\u0022 modules.
