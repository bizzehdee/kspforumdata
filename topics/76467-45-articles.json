For example, to go to the moon, you should launch from Cape Canaveral, and when it is aligned with the moon\u0027s plane (which is only once per day).

Obviously this isn\u0027t a fault of RO, but the way in which MJ handles itself. Unfortunate for sure. I do recommend you do not add reaction wheels for realism sake. Couple of notes. Ensure you don\u0027t have too much RCS. IRL, maneuvering with RCS is done with as few thrusters as possible, which is NOT the way RCS is handled in KSP. KSP will fire both \u002B and - sets of engines, while in real life, just one or the other does. If 4 quads are present, IRL a roll maneuver would only use 2, KSP uses 4. So I recommend trying to keep thruster power at least half of what it would be otherwise, and remember the big Apollo CSM only had 4 quad pods of only 100lb per engine. A much smaller satellite usually only has 1-5lb engines.
