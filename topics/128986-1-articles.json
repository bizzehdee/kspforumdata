The first time I did it, I set my periapsis to about 20,000 meters, and quicksaved (so if something went wrong I could reload that)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, when aerobraking time came, the atmosphere slowed me down some, but it wasn\u0027t enough, and I ran out of fuel, so I reloaded the quicksave. The reload was... odd. When I looked at my periapsis, I saw it was rapidly going up for no reason. I could burn to reduce it, but the instant I stopped burning it started increasing again. I did manage to get it down to 15,000 and keep it there with timewarp. When it was time, the atmosphere slowed me down too much, and I crashed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took several more tries, and probably luck, to get it into orbit, and the aerobrake didn\u0027t really help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I\u0027m wondering is, what is the optimal aerobraking height for Duna? And, in the optimal aerobrake, should I have to use my engines? Is there any explanation for my rapidly increasing periapsis?
