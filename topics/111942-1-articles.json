I\u0027ve glance over the forums and haven\u0027t seen this issue yet, so I apologize if it\u0027s been solved elsewhere. Below are two pictures of my ship, in case that\u0027s relevant. Those are not the only two versions, I\u0027ve also tried using Kickbacks and Thumpers, but the problem persists. I\u0027ve tried using dozens of struts, but the same thin happens. Is it the decouplers? Some weird atmo bug? Space goblins?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m a beginner so my ship may be considered crap, but if you can tell just by looking that it\u0027s not gonna reach Gilly, please please don\u0027t tell me (failing is part of the fun and the discovery, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/2462w6u.png\u0022 alt=\u00222462w6u.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/2hcmaro.png\u0022 alt=\u00222hcmaro.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be very appreciated!
