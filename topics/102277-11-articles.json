If I lose control of a craft during launch/ascent, and aerodynamic forces cause it to start spinning wildly, then when I Revert to Launch the craft still bears the angular moment it had before I reverted, and so it torques the launch clamps mightily. If the mod could dump that angular movement data when it Reverts to Launch, that would be most excellent. I wouldn\u0027t mind this happening (I can straighten out once I launch) but it often causes the craft to keep jiggling a bit, which disallows high timewarp which I often want to use to get back to my desired launch time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also liked the Artificial Gravity estimate, because I would use this mod and KAS/KIS to generate artificial gravity between my hab and the stage I used for my Mars injection burn.
