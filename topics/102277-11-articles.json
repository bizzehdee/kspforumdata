Same thing would work for MechJeb executed maneuvers, I imagine.\n\nI noticed a little bug that bears mentioning, I will also post it on the Github Issues page. If I lose control of a craft during launch/ascent, and aerodynamic forces cause it to start spinning wildly, then when I Revert to Launch the craft still bears the angular moment it had before I reverted, and so it torques the launch clamps mightily. If the mod could dump that angular movement data when it Reverts to Launch, that would be most excellent. I wouldn\u0027t mind this happening (I can straighten out once I launch) but it often causes the craft to keep jiggling a bit, which disallows high timewarp which I often want to use to get back to my desired launch time.\n\nI also liked the Artificial Gravity estimate, because I would use this mod and KAS/KIS to generate artificial gravity between my hab and the stage I used for my Mars injection burn. If you could return that information, or make it optional from the GUI that would also be most excellent.\n\nKeep being awesome ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T22:41:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, if RemoteTech makes that small change (or if you turn it on, I\u0027m not sure if you can, I don\u0027t use Remotetech) then the body will stop rotating when it expects it to.
