I was in the middle of working on NP as well, going to have to do some backtracking.\n\nI\u0027m still fuzzy on the math of it all, but the major change; Maxthrust is one again actually the maxthrust (IE, the thrust you\u0027ll get at IspVac, whereas in 1.0 is was the thrust you get at IspSeaLevel, and then then actual \u0027maximum thrust\u0027 you achieved in a vacuum was based on doing the math (maxthrust \\* currentIsp/SealevelISP -- Note, no longer valid)\n\nHeat production is also tied to this scaling, so that\u0027s why the LV-N number appears larger but its going to work out to less (I think, again I haven\u0027t done the math, its possible that the heat value got regressed during the change as well)\n\nI\u0027m gonna consult the experts and get some documentation written up on it later hopefully."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T18:42:26Z","Content":"The Launcher is still stuck.
