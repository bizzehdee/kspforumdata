Think of it as an \u0022electric charge\u0022 resource that only kerbals use. When kerbals deplete their provisions, they\u0027ll be rendered uncontrollable (they fall unconscious, go into stasis or hibernation, whatever you want to call it), like a probe that runs out of charge. If a rescue mission arrives with provisions, all present kerbals would fully-recover, and there would be no adverse effects beyond this. Colonies could have buildings which provisions for kerbals on site, and missions launched from colonies can take provisions with them, so you don\u0027t have to ship them all from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be simple to control by a difficulty toggle: you can turn it off entirely with something equivalent to the \u0022ignore electric charge\u0022 cheat, and it would provide a good foundation for mods to configure more complex life support systems, with multiple different resources required, or kerbal illness and death rather than hibernation.

But done that way it\u0027s really only a mass tax to increase the expiration date of your vessel. It feels punitive if you fail, but not really rewarding if you manage it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternately you could make it very realistic and detailed in which case it could simply become overwhelming to new players.

In the end KSP is not about showing all engineering challenging or simulating everything - it\u0027s a game with (roughly) accurate orbital mechanics with a lot of the other stuff being abstracted away for the sake of fun.\u00A0It doesn\u0027t have you design rocket nozzles, handle 10\u002B different types of fuels which detract from the main experience. The orbital mechanics should remain the centerpiece of gameplay, especially at the start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, you could hide it behind a difficulty toggle but it\u0027d still take valuable developer time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever with colonies and colonists I could see it become a valuable aspect of game play - if you want to make self sufficient colonies elsewhere then it is something that the late game could focus on.

Automated supply runs should help quite a bit as well. The main opposition most folks have is they don\u0027t want to worry about a vessel full of dead kerbals if they screw something up, and I\u0027d strongly advocate against death or even touristification as the default consequence. Its enough if they just get grumpy and have reduced science collection, resource harvesting, etc. The point is to help folks understand how flight duration and living off the land will affect the colonization of space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThing is, we wind up screwing up and killing vessel-fuls of dead Kerbals on the regular. \u00A0 Even most of the time until we get the hang of things. \u00A0We\u2019re all fine with crashes and bad re-entries and explosions killing Kerbals; they all add value pedagogically and gameplaywise. \u00A0I don\u2019t see life support as being any different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-02T23:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224194488\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210405\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667424193\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr LS is introduced into the game along with the colonization mechanics, either because the majority of LS is focused on \u0022making sure your colonies can supply a habitable environment for the kerbals that are living there\u0022, or that it\u0027s for both ships AND colonies, and it doesn\u0027t make sense for one to exist without the other if they\u0027re eventually both going to be in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick here is that resources and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E aren\u0027t being introduced until after colonies and interstellar in the 2nd new star system update, so even if you can build colonies and can use colonists to do science stuff and maybe work out the population boost pacing you aren\u0027t yet harvesting raw resources to make new rocket parts or fuels or, hopefully, LS.

Many of the things you mentioned are reversible by short-term revert, which is much more punitive on very long-duration missions, exactly the kinds of missions on which imperfect transfers can result in big errors between planned flight duration and actual flight duration. If you\u0027re at the point where you have a multiple colonies and vessels going here and there it\u0027s one thing to go back a day or so and repeat a docking maneuver to undo a coms loss, but it\u0027s something else entirely to revert weeks worth of player-time to redo a complex interplanetary mission that itself took 10-20 player hours to plan and deploy. This creates a compounding problem for LS as players get deeper into the game, where the greatest risk and the greatest punishments occur when players have the least flexibility to go back and solve problems. I mean I guess Im fine for permadeath to exist on hard mode but I\u0027d never use it, and I think it would discourage new and even moderate players. There\u0027s no real need for it if you\u0027ve created other compelling gameplay incentives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-03T00:24:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2022 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
