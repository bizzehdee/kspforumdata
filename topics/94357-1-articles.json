I found out by trying to set up a new career with normal settings, but tweaked with higher penalties for failure, like no respawn and a higher fund hit if you can\u0027t accomplish a given contract. Just because my last career at only 50% everything was grindy enough. But then I had to just quit it, because there is no way I grind my way into 1.5 MILLION funds to get the Tier II science and new parts, when I already have the rest of Tier I unlocked, no money spent on other facilities, 100% reuse throughout the save, and a mere 500k funds saved up. No. Freaking. Way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I edited myself back to 100% penalties. I think a new slider for building cost would be in order, some people want failure to have real, lasting consequences, like wiping out hard-earned reserves you have to re-build up over a long time.
