We have slightly webbed hands, Wrinkled fingers let us hold on to slippery things better, etc. I thought about Mermaids. Is it even slightly possible that humanoid creatures could exist*? Clearly not. Although, it could make an interesting plot to a Sci-Fi story, albeit with \u0022Artist\u0027s License: Biology\u0022. Fantasy is fine for little kids and fairy tales, but I wonder if any serious Speculative Science Fiction Stories have ever been written about \u0022Mermaids\u0022. What I wonder about even more is if the Rocket Scientists that browse these forums even give a crap about Speculative Marine Biology, Fantasy, or Disney films*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Joke\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T06:47:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found this theory somewhat fascinating when I heard about it, as it does make a fair amount of sense.

Sure. Do they exist? Well, if they did, they would be at a similar stage of water adaptation as, say, seals. Not enough time has passed for them to make a full adaptation on the level of dolphins for example. This would mean that they would spend a lot of time on shores and beaches and we would have probably found them by now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, as you say, they might have changed their minds, went back to dry land and became us instead. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T09:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI heard about this theory as well, but I don\u0027t give it too much merit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the reasons it gives are easily explained via other routes or just plain wrong:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans have no fur: Yes we do, it\u0027s just much scarcer to allow us to sweat. Humans are actually one of the best long distance runners in the animal kingdom, aboriginals hunt by running after prey until it drops from exhaustion.

When you run for long durations heat management is absolutely essential, which is why we\u0027re one of the best at sweating. Hair also has nothing to do with aquatic species, platypus and beavers show that fur and water mix quite well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans are bipedal to avoid drowning in shallows: Could be yea, but it seems way more likely that it evolved to give us a better vantage point on the savanna and to free our hands for tool use. Both of those explanations are scientifically supported by the fossil record since we can find the hand axes they used all over Africa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans have big brains because other aquatic mammals also have big brains: Chimps have big brains and they hate water, correlation does not imply causation. Not to mention that the timescales are way off, our ancestors became bipedal a few million years ago and we only started to really pump up our brain volume a few hundred thousand years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eetc. The hypothesis is sketchy at best and downright wrong at worst, I wouldn\u0027t trust it until they come up with some real evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for an aquatic human species. I doubt that they\u0027d look anything like a mermaid. That tail seems very unlikely to evolve since it means you have to radically alter the bone structure of the lower body. If something like that had time to evolve it would certainly have streamlined our shoulders and face. Those cause a lot of drag when swimming. Humans that adapted to an aquatic environment would probably swim like frogs and look like murlocs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T13:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always thought a real mermaid would look more like Harry Potter in that one book where he has to go underwater to win some tournament, and he gets frog-like limbs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T13:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course there are aquatic humans ... have you never seen the documentary series \u0022Man from Atlantis\u0022 with Patrick Duffy? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(but well .. in reality I don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t think it would make much sense ... humans aren\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t very well adapted for a life in the ocean (even if we disregard the lack of gills) ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust look how many adaptation the only land vertebrate to return to the water underwent ... the whales)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-22T13:32:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2013 01:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Godot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T14:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to burst your bubble, but it\u0027s not a \u003Cem\u003Etheory\u003C/em\u003E because there is no evidence for it.
