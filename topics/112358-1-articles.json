This mostly happens to the oxidizer compartment in specific fuel tank. Although I have DangIt installed, the parts have not failed, the engines are shutdown, RCS is off. I have the idea that this might be caused by RealFuels, but before I post this there I would like to have your opinions.\n\nMods installed that might possibly cause the issue: \n\n- TAC Fuel Balancer\n\n- RealFuels \u002B RealFuels Stockalike configs\n\n- NearFutureElectrical Decaying RTG\u0027s\n\n- HeatControl\n\nEdit: Probably a feature of RealFuels, with the focus that it indeed is called REALfuels and not fakefuels: Hydrogen boils off...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T12:22:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Andy81le**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T12:25:39Z","Content":"This is a real and intentional effect of Real Fuels.

My pleasure with KSP \u002B Mods such as realfuels just increased exponentially. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
