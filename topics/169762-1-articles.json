For harder difficulties, you must pay an entry cost for each part after researching them so they become available. Now for a reason I\u0027m yet to understand, the cursor is available everywhere but on H\u0026amp;D...\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince the cursor is not available, after switching\u00A0to the parts specific window - as in, after you first select a part through the part list window, a new window will pop-up with this part description - you simply can\u0027t switch the point of interest to this very window, therefore not being allowed to purchase the part. This would be quickly fixed if you could click on the purchase button, but no cursor available in R\u0026amp;D for no reason at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother problem one could quickly notice here is that on the bottom of that same window is the text \u0022Hold \u0026lt;B\u0026gt;: More Info\u0022. If you do hold B (circle on PS4), instead of getting more info, you\u0027ll go back to the previous screen, since B (circle) is the same button to return in a window, lovely.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(Minor, problem but a problem nonetheless, and may show that this happens on different windows as well): in the Tracking Station you can press LB/RB (L1/R1) to scroll between different celestial bodies, but in the controls App it tells you that when you have the cursor active, you can hold LB (L1) for precision mode. The problem is that even in cursor mode, holding LB will scroll to the previous celestial body. There seems to be an unnoticed problem going on with keys being used for multiple functions at the same time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith the Radial preset, for controlling your throttle you must hold LB (L1) and move the D-Pad Up/Down (instead of simply moving the D-Pad Up/Down and leaving LB \u002B D-Pad for Maximum/Minimum instant throttle like it is with cursor settings). Not only the controls scheme is so limited to the point that for you to simply change this you must switch to another preset, which will change a lot more things than only this, you also have the LB (L1) conflicting between two functions again: LB (L1) \u002B Axis movement is used to trim your craft, therefore you just cannot control your throttle and changing you craft attitude without trimming it and making it go all over the place.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLike with problem #2, controls conflicting once again: at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E you can click X (Square) on a part to change some of it settings (like on a parachute to change it\u0027s deployment altitude). So, although you can use the cursor to change it\u0027s settings, you can also change to that window and use the Axis to scroll through the settings. For that, you switch back to non-cursor mode and press LB (L1) \u002B Y (Triangle) (the same way you switch back and forth to the dialogue window during the tutorial). But with cursor mode on, if you press LB \u002B Y you will also toggle between Snap Mode on/off.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is another minor bug, but can get a bit annoying when you have a window open but want to toggle between Snap Modes and it keeps switching windows.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPs.: Using this LB \u002B Y combination in the R\u0026amp;D does not change the focus to the desired window, since by pressing LB (or RB) you will change tabs, scrolling between Technology and Science Archives.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-18T17:52:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2018 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arch3rAc3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leopard","CreatedById":167666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-18T17:25:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhave noticed one or two conflicts with control as noted above, where one function is what you will want (often) and the other is (OMG now I\u0027m dead because of that)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nroughly the same as how Elite Dangerous had (maybe still has) the landing gear and \u0022turbo\u0022 button on the same control\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nseems odd that the default for throttle is \u0022all or nothing\u0022 with a modifier for \u0022fine control\u0022 - the other way round would make more sense - is there an option to toggle this behaviour somewhere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-18T17:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223271455\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169762\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516296343\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167666\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Leopard\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Leopard said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nseems odd that the default for throttle is \u0022all or nothing\u0022 with a modifier for \u0022fine control\u0022 - the other way round would make more sense - is there an option to toggle this behaviour somewhere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it comes down to personal preference but even playing on PC I use min/max throttle like 99.9% of the time.
