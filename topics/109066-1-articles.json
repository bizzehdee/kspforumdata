How do I write a mod that prevents physics calculations from being applied to those 50 \u0027hidden\u0027 parts? Basically, the craft, in the eyes of the game, becomes a 100 part craft, with the entire cargo bay contents being just 1 physics-less part. When the cargobay opens, it revenrts to being calculated as 150 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne phenomenon you may see is very long payloads swaying inside long fairings.
