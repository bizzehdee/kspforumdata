Much better and immersive than the stock science (I am playing in Sandbox). Here is a few suggestions that I would love to see in the mod in the future:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003E Mass Production\u003C/strong\u003E - an ability to select one part (or two, or three) that will be mass produced, and therefore it\u0027s cost reduced. This will force the player to design smarter and reuse a single part several times for cost benefit. If player desires to change the mass production to another part, it would be possible, but at a price price due to change of manufacturing equipment, again making the player think better in the first place. Real world example: SpaceX is mass producing Merlin engine which they are using on both the first (9 of them) and second stage (single) so that they reduce the cost of manufacturing 2 different engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EActually reusable parts after recovery\u003C/strong\u003E - Instead of automatically getting the money back after the debris has been unloaded-recovered (parachuting or powered landing), IMO, the recovered parts should be \u0022stored\u0022 in a warehouse. Then, the next time when you build the ship with the parts that have been previously recovered (in the \u0022warehouse\u0022), the part should come free (or with minor price tag for refurbishing). This would make the player again design better and have in mind that launching the same rockets multiple time is more beneficial that designing new ones each time. Otherwise, if you wish to sell/scrap the recovered parts, you can, but you will get less money than when reusing it. Real world example: Well so far, only the Shuttle reused the orbiter and SRBs, if you don\u0027t count aviation in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EDistance dependent recovery\u003C/strong\u003E - (I don\u0027t know if this is already in the mod, I haven\u0027t checked yet) First, when unloaded, depending on where the debris\u0027 trajectory impact point is, see if it\u0027s falling on the water or land, and second, according to the distance from the KSC, add the recovery cost. Further it lands from KSC, higher the cost. If landing on the runway (or pad) the recovery should be basically full part price. Real world example: The Shuttle\u0027s SRBs had to be recovered by US Navy which added cost to the program, while recovery of orbiter from the runway needed refurbishing of TPS tiles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EContracts, better missions \u003C/strong\u003E- Right now, the missions are straightforward.. Select a single mission, do the job. There is not much variety than that. If you lose your money, you basically can\u0027t do anything. It would be much better to add another layer of mission types, for example contract signing, where you would get paid UP FRONT. For example.. Communication department could ask for 10 satellites to be deployed in orbit. So they give you some starting money and promise you more after you accomplish the first part (for example delivering 5), and then all the money when you deliver all of them. These are not straightforward 10 missions, but the end goal is to deploy 10 of them, you can launch as many rockets as you like. You could launch each satelite on a single rocket, or you might launch all of the 10 on the single rocket. But the moment when you have 10 satellites in orbit with certain parts (communotrons and such), is when you finish the contract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, for example there could be \u0022craft development\u0022 contracts, for example military gives you a contract to develop a reliable spaceplane. The requirements are that it, on 5 consequent missions, can launch into a certain orbit, and land on the KSC runway. If you run 2 missions successfully and fail on the third one, you still didn\u0027t fail, but you will have to improve the design and do it again until you manage to get 5 consequent missions. Then, there could be another advanced contract where not only you have to launch into certain orbit and land, but you also have to carry a certain weight.. And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EManufacturer contracts \u003C/strong\u003E- This is like a combination of mass production and \u0022contracts\u0022 where a certain manufacturer (for example Rockomax) could give you a discount on their parts, or a requirement to use them to get a total price reduction (sort of like advertising xD). This would add more interesting design again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Random events for random missions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E - Instead of chosing random missions or contract, you could get them at random time.. For example you get mail from Rockomax that they are offering a contract for reduced price of their parts..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it from me for now xD Hope you will think about these ideas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: some more,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003E Technology research \u003C/strong\u003E- The only reason I would get the technology research is the rocket powered landing. It doesn\u0027t really make sense that you just started the rocket age, and right at the beginning you already have rocket powered landing xD RPL is something that is no functional rockets are even possible today, but research is being done. Maybe RPL should come as an unlockable (with a big price) technology that you could research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EBalancing values\u003C/strong\u003E - I know that you can modify values in MC, but it\u0027s just weird that propellants cost that much, I don\u0027t know if the solid fuel is expensive, but LOX and H2 are pretty low cost comparing to the rocket. That is why the rockets are better to be reusable cause the price of manufacturing is much much much higher than the propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-31T17:56:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2014 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nothke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red3Tango","CreatedById":92122,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T03:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been using this mod for a short time, but I noticed something that may be a bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I disable the plugin (within the settings menu) and launch a ship, it shows in the build log as $0.00 cost, but in the finance window the cost of the ship shows under Total Spent Vessels.
