Mods, please feel free to fix as you see fit.\n\nHaving searched around all the current science-related spreadsheets and checklists available for KSP, I found there isn\u0027t a complete, simple and easy-to-use checklist for tracking what science you\u0027ve done or haven\u0027t done. Sure, there\u0027s the in-game Science Archives, but they\u0027re not exactly convenient to use mid-mission.\n\nSince I was trying to milk the Mun for all the available science at the time, I made up a spreadsheet checklist I could print out, to keep track of what I had and hadn\u0027t done. I\u0027ve now expanded it for all the planets and moons, as well as Kerbol.\n\nSince many experiments need to be performed twice to get 95% (or so) of the available science, those experiments that need it have space to check them off twice. Each planet/moon gets a sheet to itself (except Kerbin/KSC, which needs 4 all told) and is designed to be printed on a single page for ease of use. Each sheet also has some space for notes, which comes in especially handy for planning science-mop-up missions.\n\nI\u0027ve found the checklists invaluable when planning multi-biome missions.\n\n[update 3/3/15]\n\nBarometer and Sensor Array added for bodies with atmospheres.\n\nBlack blocks replaced with light grey background with cross-hatching.\n\nColumn and row dimensions standardised.\n\nNumerous errors and omissions fixed.\n\n[update 6/3/15]\n\nKSC Science Checklist updated\n\n1.0.4 version now released. See this thread for details.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130697-KSP-1-0-x-Complete-Printable-Stock-Science-Checklists](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130697-KSP-1-0-x-Complete-Printable-Stock-Science-Checklists)\n\n![Capture8_zpsvxmzxkik.png%7Eoriginal](http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp159/ElYoda69/Capture8_zpsvxmzxkik.png~original)\n\nThere may be the odd mistake, particularly with the KSC location-biomes and sub-locations, which I haven\u0027t fully checked/completed myself, so if anyone spots any, please let me know and I\u0027ll correct them ASAP.\n\nAlthough intended to be printed out, if you have a multi-monitor setup it should be fairly easy to use on-screen, marking them off however suits you best. I\u0027ve saved them in .ods, .xls and .xlsx formats and bundled all 3 formats together as a zip file which can be downloaded here:\n\n[https://app.box.com/s/rrb117aiuhubmb4e0fehtx12e9odp57a](https://app.box.com/s/rrb117aiuhubmb4e0fehtx12e9odp57a)\n\nHere\u0027s an example of an early version in use for Mun science. The notes relate to how I planned an eight biome mop-up expedition using just 3 lander missions.\n\n![out_zps88kywlsf.png%7Eoriginal](http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp159/ElYoda69/out_zps88kywlsf.png~original)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T13:26:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 01:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JAFO**"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T18:05:28Z","Content":"I\u0027ve kept spreadsheets before, but nothing reusable like this.
