Vanilla : honestly not many hours of play with vanilla, but for me, on my rig, vanilla seemed to be exceptionally stable, and exceptionally \u0022efficient.\u0022 Load times fast for such a heavily asseted application, visual transitions and animations smooth and clean (better be with 3.5GHz graphics card!), scene transitions and input responsiveness, superlative . . . not mobile phone transmission level latencies but plenty fast for a computer game, all in the 1 to half-second ballpark (C\u002B\u002B is pretty much the only option if you want that kinda performance, or at least that is what I gather so far . . . not sure, maybe Python can come close?). I cannot recall a single crash I have had with 1.1.13 vanilla (but then again, only 5% of my several hundred hour play time has been with vanilla).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Lightly modded (lets say \u0026lt; 25 new directories or files added to the GameData folder): again, not a lot of play time with this configuration. Maybe 10% of total. Main difference: load times doubled, transition times 1.5 to 2 times slower, input responsiveness perhaps slightly slower at baseline, but with obvious signs of memory leakage and software aging leading to progressively worsened performance in some contexts (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E most notably). Interestingly, the flight planner and the flight windows (caveat: excluding ~\u0026gt;300part composite space stations comprising four separately launched pieces) show the greatest \u0022resistance\u0022 to this performance degradation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Heavily modded (I\u0027m presently about about \u002265 mods\u0022 added): this is what I\u0027ve played with the most, and it is here that I\u0027ve seen \u0027quite a few\u0027 crashes. Interestingly, with my particular mod configuration, crashes are more common early after game launch, and seemingly prior to some of the \u0022sub-scenes\u0022 of the Space Center having been loaded by \u0022normal\u0022 means (instead of by means specific to a mod, I won\u0027t go into specifics as it is specualtive and I don\u0027t want to convey bad PR based on speculation). In sum, if I avoid doing certain things right after I load the game, I can play for hours with no crashes. After sort of \u0027warming up\u0027 the app by NOT opening the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, the game seems able to handle those sub-scenes being opened up and \u00A0. . . no crash. But go straight for those right after load = almost invariably crash (at least with my current mod configuration). So excluding those \u0022predictable\u0022 crashes . . . perhaps once every 25 or 30 hours? Those low frequency crashes have the hallmarks of \u0022excrements just happens\u0022 CTDs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoad times with this current set of 65 are much protracted compared to stock, on the order of 6 to 7 times longer (a minute versus 10 seconds for stock for game initialization, and 4 or 5 seconds for some scene changes versus 1 second for vanilla). Symptoms suggestive of memory leaks and software aging are also an issue, but actually not so bad that I feel the need to prune my modlist again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-19T00:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably a three digit number.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaelumEtAstra","CreatedById":109360,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-19T00:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know, I don\u0027t really count them.
