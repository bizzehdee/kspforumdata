Let me try and help you understand the mechanics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe process through which experiments are added to the R\u0026amp;D archives is intimately tied to recovering or transmitting individual experiments. Those recoveries or transmissions come tagged with the situation and experiment info (\u0022goo observation while landed in the Mun\u0027s midland craters\u0022), so the game knows what to file them under.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the mobile processing lab, things work differently. It\u0027s not merely about Squad not implementing a link to the R\u0026amp;D archives; it\u0027s that this is literally not possible. When you process an experiment to add it to the lab, that experiment\u0027s report becomes a raw data value that is added to the internal pool of data that the lab has. And that internal pool simply says: \u0022there is now 433 out of 750 points of data storage\u0022. Then the lab begins converting 1 data into 5 science at a speed dependant on the Kerbal scientists present. So, let\u0027s say the lab transformed 100 of those 433 data points into science, and you go and transmit 500 science points to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would the game know what experiments went into those 500 science points? Even if the lab kept track of a list of experiments entered into it, there\u0027s no way for the game to know which point of data was processed to make science. It\u0027s like, you have five glasses of water, and pour them all into a bucket. Now someone comes and tells you: retrieve for me the fourth glass of water from that bucket. What would you tell that person? You\u0027d probably question their intelligence. Even if you had labeled your glasses, and kept meticulous record of the order in which you poured them in, it is still physically impossible for you to identify the contents of any specific glass of water afterwards. All identity information was permanently lost the moment you poured it in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same is true for the lab: all identity information is permanently lost the moment you process an experiment, regardless of whether or not you keep track of what you entered when.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you went and made a R\u0026amp;D archive entry the moment you processed the experiment, it doesn\u0027t work properly, because you don\u0027t know for sure whether or not you\u0027re actually going to get any of that science back to Kerbin. You\u0027d have an archive entry with an empty bar - and the game has no way to tell at which point it should start filling it in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, in order for this to work, Squad would have to completely delete everything about the mobile processing lab, and re-develop it from the ground up in a way that is completely different from what it is today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is a lot of development effort, and a lot of effort from a huge playerbase that has to re-learn new mechanics, just for a minor annoyance. Which only affects a tiny subset of the playerbase in the first place, because right now, the MPL does not prevent you from also recovering/transmitting another copy of the same science, which is then added to the archives as normal. So the vast majority of people still get all their R\u0026amp;D archive entries just fine - they just get some extra untagged science from the lab as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-06T11:31:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2016 11:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T03:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOMG! \u00A0I love this idea so much! \u00A0I mean these Kerbals can figure out how to contain nuclear fission, train pilots and spend vast treasures trying to divine the mysteries of the cosmos. \u00A0Still they can\u0027t figure out how to hire a librarian to hang around the R and D building with a ham radio listening to chatter coming in from distant laboratories?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood science requires good records. \u00A0Right now the mobile labs have no lab notes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clancy","CreatedById":167425,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T20:11:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222790131\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148391\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475753344\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/6/2016 at 7:29 AM, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, in order for this to work, Squad would have to completely delete everything about the mobile processing lab, and re-develop it from the ground up in a way that is completely different from what it is today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game does keep track though, because you can\u0027t process the same experiment in the same lab twice, so it must be keeping a record\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esomewhere\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of what experiments have been processed in what lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that there would then be multiple checklists: One for R\u0026amp;D and one for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeach\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EMobile Lab currently in the game.

I got ninja\u0027ed), it just pools everything together. It knows what went in, but it can\u0027t tag what comes out due to the pooling. If players were comfortable with randomized output, then maybe the Lab could award R\u0026amp;D archive data as it transmits the equivalent of science for the data amount of an experiment. Problem there is that each experiment contributes a different data count to the lab, so at what point would the Lab know when to trigger an R\u0026amp;D entry?
