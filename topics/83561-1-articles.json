I honestly have no idea how to do it in Blender, but this might give you some pointers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://vimeo.com/21942950\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://vimeo.com/21942950\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than animating the mesh rotations themselves, you\u0027ll just need to animate the links that will then move the \u0027skin\u0027. You\u0027ll have to get used to the terminology, this kind of thing is often used with animated bones that move the mesh of characters. Be aware that you will get some stretching effects, and honestly don\u0027t obsess over the poly count if you need to add a few more to get it to look right. Unity is pretty slick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not easy, I\u0027m afraid, but an incredibly useful tool once you\u0027ve got used to it.
