I wanted to post them for anybody to use, as well as the images (cut outs with no backgrounds for easy layering) so that others may use to make there own. It is a really simple process to make flags and can be done with using just Paint.net or like myself use a combination of Paint.net, Art Rage , and Adobe elements 10. I am new to posting on forums ( just never really did anything but read them). So please give me some feedback if you know of a better way of posting and submitting files than what i will be using.

You also have this option: upload the flag and each art asset used to imgur.com and post the gallery here. Easy way to display everything and keep things simple. I\u0027d suggest storing each of the assets as transparent background .PNGs.

Also all the templates in the download are already transparent backgrounds and .png. The only few that are not are the full sized flattened flags before they were re-sized to 256x160 for use in the game, so that people can change those to there liking as well.
