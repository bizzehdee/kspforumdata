However, I\u0027m having difficulty texturing. I\u0027ll work more on that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, my question today is, is that when I design an SRB, whenever I get to a point where I can test it, it ignites, and just sits there, seems like there might be a problem with my thrustVectorTransform definition?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so you have some references, I create the thrust Vector in Unity by creating an empty game object, setting the definitions as putting the X axis at -90 degrees, and drag that gameobject into the same folder as my model, then export. Right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help/pointers anyone would give me would be greatly appreciated!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T18:13:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CluelessModeler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CluelessModeler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust so you have some references, I create the thrust Vector in Unity by creating an empty game object, setting the definitions as putting the X axis at -90 degrees, and drag that gameobject into the same folder as my model, then export. Right?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need it in the model hierarchy somewhere under the object with the part tools attached. Having it in your asset folders won\u0027t do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe -z axis needs to point in the direction you want the thrust. That is, the blue arrow shows the path of the exhaust. For a symmetrical exhaust plume (which I believe they are all currently) the rotation around the z axis shouldn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s case sensible so make sure the name of the game object and the name you\u0027ve specified after thrustVectorTransformName = are identical\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: And finally, do make sure it has sufficient thrust to lift it\u0027s own weight off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CluelessModeler","CreatedById":58172,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T03:58:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!
