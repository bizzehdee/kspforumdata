This seems counterintuitive to me. Perhaps you\u0027d be better off trying to learn assembly code or FORTRAN, then. If that seems outrageous, maybe you need to change how you\u0027re looking at code. Code is a set of instructions. The syntax might be arbitrary, but it\u0027s important to keep straight. It\u0027s called a \u0022language\u0022 for a reason.\u00A0Apart from that, think about the commands you\u0027re using. A computer moves data, sums data, and performs I/O interactions with the peripherals. Conditionals split your list of instructions into separate parts based upon the data. There are no other kinds of commands, just as there are only a couple kinds of quarks. Variables are just a name for a collection of data. Multiplication is just adding a bunch of times. For loops are just a fancy conditional.

That requires skill. But I can guarantee you didn\u0027t have that skill when you started.\u00A0You got on that bicycle...and then fell down. You got in that automobile...and then did something absolutely foolish. You know this. You can use a pencil to write, a keyboard to type. Did you not make hideous, meaningless scribbles as a child, proclaiming loudly that they meant something to \u003Ci\u003Eyou\u003C/i\u003E? But now look at yourself. Presumably, you ride a bicycle with at least passable skill. You may or may not drive an automobile. You can write in a fashion that others can understand. You can use a computer. Look at all these things you could not do at birth. How did you get these skills? By \u003Ci\u003Ework\u003C/i\u003E. You rode that bicycle again and again until you didn\u0027t need your parent\u0027s hand. You scribbled and you wrote until the scribbles turned into letters, and the letters into words, and so on. You \u003Ci\u003Elearned\u003C/i\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut why did you learn? Because you wanted to. Do you want to be a programmer? Do the ideas left unrendered burn within you? Does the fact that you lack the skill to create an object in reality cause your soul pain? If so, you will learn anything to make the pain go away, if nothing else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve talked about you, but let me establish myself. I am a senior in high school. I\u0027ve tried many things in my time, made rubbish, and then \u003Ci\u003Efailed\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0when I put them away. But I didn\u0027t put them away forever.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTake my art, for point of argument. Several years ago, back in elementary school, I drew. A lot. And it was, to be frank, crap. I stopped for several years, until three years ago I tried it out again. And something clicked. Something that made me start drawing again until I became decent at it. That something was smoke. Thick, billowing smoke gave me joy in my art again. I haven\u0027t stopped drawing since.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother example: writing. If you saw my writing anytime between the very first paper I wrote and when I started Kerbal Future, you would have thought I was a liar and a scoundrel to claim authorship of the latter. I was the \u003Ci\u003Eworst\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0student when it came to writing. I was unable to start on writing tests in elementary school. I had to be pulled out of an assembly to finish one such test in junior high. If you had told me anywhere in that time that I would be any kind of writer, that I would write for \u003Ci\u003Efun\u003C/i\u003E, I would have denounced you as a heretic. But only a couple months ago, I got third in a competition with a writing entry.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne more\u00A0rather pertinent item: Programming. I read at least five programming textbooks during junior high, on such languages as Java or C\u002B\u002B. I tried several times to build games and other grandiose projects (such as one gem, titled \u0022Angry Turds\u0022).\u003Cbr\u003E\nNever once did I bring one of these projects to completion.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut over the summer, I investigated C#. I had a specific goal in mind: build a program which would solve each problem on Project Euler. So far, I\u0027m at 19 of 568. The fact is, the first problem was a basic goal which was more about learning the syntax of the language. It made for a good introduction (\u0022The first one\u0027s always free!\u0022), without being patronising like \u0022Hello World.\u0022 They ramped up in difficulty from there, but the fact that I succeeded with a program was energizing. I\u0027d suggest solving the first half-dozen of these before you decide whether you make a \u0022good programmer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder how long ago it was the last time you tried to do something. If it was more than a few years, give it another shot. If it was recent, look at it differently. But most importantly, set a goal, and don\u0027t stop until you reach it. If that goal is as simple as \u0022make \u0027Hello World\u0027 work properly from scratch,\u0022 that\u0027s fine! Once you reach your goal, pat yourself on the back, grab a sweet, and revel in the glory of your success. Then, if you feel like that goal was too simple, or if you enjoyed yourself, set another goal a little further away.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI subscribe to\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://m.youtube.com/user/gisikwGames\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis guy\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s notions.
