I\u0027m also under contract to land a large base onto Ike, so I\u0027m thinking of doing both missions concurrently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously I can over-engineer a giant lander and go take the samples I want. However, I would like to insert a drone and let it gather all the data instead. My issue(s) are basically with design of a rover/drone. I can\u0027t find any good resources to help me figure out how to build a rover that doesn\u0027t basically tip over/destroy itself. Further, I would really like to be able to complete contracts in the future where I might need to get some height above the target as well. Or I might want to bring the drone back home after picking up the science so I would ideally like somthing super efficient to go down get multiple readings and re-ascend to be captured and taken home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I\u0027m terrible with drones and I need help actually creating one. Are there any good resources I can check out? Also I\u0027m wondering what the most efficient drone would look like in theory, anyone have that sort of knowledge they\u0027d like to impart?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally is there a way I can build the thing such that I don\u0027t have to continually rebuild it every time I get a new mission/contract?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-28T20:56:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2015 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by darthWes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T11:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour questions are a bit broad so it is difficult to start answering them - \u0022most efficient\u0022 depends on the circumstances, but usually it is very efficient to only carry with you what you really need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a separate lander for your rover leaving the transfer stage behind in orbit for starters; and undocking the rover from your lander will make it easier to build it \u0022less tippy\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedocking something on the ground may prove difficult (without mods); e.g. if the lander packed the rover under its belly, I would go for landing struts/plane gear to either raise the rover or lower the lander towards the docking port again, but this will require lots of testing and fiddling in the design process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many threads dealing with rover constructions - do not use the forum search, rather ask google \u0022forum kerbal *****\u0022 to get better results - basically you want to build it with wheels wide apart and with a low center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure, but I think the \u0022gather science from x\u0022 contracts do not require building a new probe every time, only the satellite, base and orbital station contracts if I remember correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the \u0022explore x\u0022 and \u0022gather (unspecified) science from x\u0022 contracts only require you to do an experiment and send back the results, they do not even have to give you any science value anymore, so you can repeat this forever with your first probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
