For a couple reasons. First it adds nothing to the purpose of getting help. Secondly it sounds, well rather negative. I\u0027ve used USI mods for almost as long as I\u0027ve played ksp. And there are rarely ever missing components, in the sense that something just wasn\u0027t put in by some oversight or some sort of bad work. Which is what this sounds like. I have no conflicts with any mods I run so far with this or any other USI mod. So they do not conflict a lot. USI life support does not always seem to break something, because it has broken nothing for me. In fact he goes to great lengths to make sure his mods do not conflict with other mods as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethese statements look nothing more than a knock on someone\u0027s hard work, and a put down towards there work and competency. It may not have been meant that way, but it\u0027s how it comes across.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand then all you said is it conflicts with the Taurus mod. But offered nothing to explain what the conflict is or anything helpful to what is causing you issues in your first post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you simply stated something along the lines of hey I\u0027m having an issue with this mod and such and such mod. This happens when I have this mod and some other mod installed. When I remove this mod the problem goes away. Then maybe add is the known? Does anyone know of a fix or workaround for this? Maybe even ask if the mods will be made compatible. And add any relevant information to help with your issue. It would probably have come across much better. The above quoted part is really Not needed and doesn\u0027t nothing to help with the problem, and more than often tends to seem inflammatory to many.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for for two posts in a row but seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SymbolicFrank\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SymbolicFrank\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, replying to you is a waste of time.

Because they expect nobody understands anything about programming or modding, and do everything wrong that can be done wrong. And they might have a point, in many cases. Or perhaps simply because it\u0027s easier to treat everyone as a moron: at least you don\u0027t discriminate that way \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s perhaps easiest to say that the modders are God, know exactly what they are doing, and anyone who objects to anything is a heretic and should be punished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, without feedback there will be no improvements, either.
