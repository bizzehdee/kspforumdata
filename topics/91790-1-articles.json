I tried adding that LLC_All = C to the launch options and launching it through steam but now it stops loading immediately, if I remove all or most of the mods it loads up just fine, normally I\u0027d think memory error but I\u0027m running 64 bit with 16 gigs of RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my KSP Log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wkq7lE1vUM02GV6ojlkRkx-xzo8JdHznE4R5lM1_r-E/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1wkq7lE1vUM02GV6ojlkRkx-xzo8JdHznE4R5lM1_r-E/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
