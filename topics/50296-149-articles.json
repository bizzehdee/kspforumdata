I sifted through my output_log.txt for any mention of the \u0022FASAApollo_CM_HeatShield\u0022 part. By default, FASA is setting maxTemp=3600 for the part. And according to output_log.txt, the part is being modified only by RO, RP0 and Better Buoyancy. After looking at the modifications each of those mods is making, I found that RO is adding the ModuleHeatSheild to the part, and then later changing the maxTemp=800 which happens here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ModuleManager] Applying node RealismOverhaul/RealismOverhaul_Global_Config/@PART\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleEngines*],!MODULE[ModuleHeatShield]]:BEFORE[RealismOverhaul] to FASA/Apollo/ApolloCSM/FASA_Apollo_CM_HeatShield/FASAApollo_CM_HeatShield\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReading that line form output_log.txt, this modification should only be made if the part in question is not an Engine and is not a HeatShield. It\u0027s obviously supposed to be a heatshield, though, so that means the \u0022ModuleHeatShield\u0022 isn\u0027t being applied to the part until after RO changes it\u0027s maxTemp. Technically, based on the order the lines appear in output_log.txt, it seems like RO should be adding the ModuleHeatShield first (line 46014 of output_log.txt) and then checking to see if ModuleHeatShield exists later (line 78077 of output_log.txt) but that doesn\u0027t seem to be happening. Either way, though, there is no DRE modification being made to this heatshield at all. Shouldn\u0027t there be a config change being made by DRE for this part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: So I added a config into DRE for the FASAApollo_CM_HeatShield that matches the config for the \u00223.75_Heatshield\u0022 part that comes with DRE. This time when i tried re-entry, the heat shield peaks at about 950C. My crew ended up dying from excessive G-forces so I\u0027m guessing I\u0027m coming in too steep, so I\u0027m reloading my save and adjusting my periapsis for a shallower entry, but at least the shield isn\u0027t exploding. I might suggest adding a DRE config for the FASA Mercury, FASA Gemini (black and white versions) \u0026amp; FASA Big Gemini (black and white versions) capsules, plus the FASA Apollo CM Heatshield.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T17:40:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chrisl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T17:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReading that line form output_log.txt, this modification should only be made if the part in question is not an Engine and is not a HeatShield.
