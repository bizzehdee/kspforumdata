The scientist EVA\u0027d out to the rover, which I sent with the base. After driving for a bit, the rover accidentally flipped and the ground clipped the kerbalnaut enough to make him go ragdoll, but still stuck in the external chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I corrected the rover upright, I switched to the kerbalnaut to rest his posture from ragdoll to standing (still kinda partially in the seat). When this happened, the screen shook a little (like a 2 parts in a rapid collision) and he was free\u0027d from the seat/rover and stood up next to the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI switched to the kerbalnaut to get him back into the seat, but noticed that he was unresponsive to any controls and when I moused over him (as shown in picture) He was deemed a piece of debris from the rover. So I tried to bump him over with the rover, but he now weighs a ton and cannot be budged.\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty detrimental to my career mode, because the mission was expensive and so was hiring the scientist for the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFixes/Workarounds\u003C/strong\u003E: none\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dvs9HtP.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Dvs9HtP.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T08:46:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 08:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RedKosmos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFormat\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T10:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127580-1-0-X-Cross-Platform-Issues-Thread\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlease see here.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedKosmos","CreatedById":72690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!
