Flowmaps, godrays and a custom particle system makes it look even crispier. Well, people are allowed to have their own opinions, so I\u0027m not trying to persuade them for this. Indeed, I think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-redux clouds are better, especially on Jool and Eve (the planet) in most cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I believe that in some cases, KSP2 does better. Take Kerbin for example. As shown with many videos and images, KSP2\u0027s clouds have some huge VARIATION IN CLOUD HEIGHTS, which is something not so commonly seen in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-redux. I know the existence of anvil clouds, but they are a bit rare. Apart from that, volumetric cloud layers in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-redux seems a bit too flat with almost no\u00A0protruding visible. They also look a bit off when viewed from space. As a conclusion, it\u0027s a bit hard to have this \u0022cloud mountain\u0022 effect in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E-redux, something that I believe KSP2 is doing pretty great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 is also (to me) somewhat better on Eve. The clouds are just EXTREMELY whispy. This means that, with the correct configuration and cover map, they could be realistic cirrus clouds-something that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-redux has yet to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, I don\u0027t like flat-bottomed clouds, and I believe that there could be a way to combine the good of both, such as using standard unity volumetric clouds as the bottom of the cloud and use KSP2\u0027s volumetric clouds on top of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, just my very own opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-30T11:07:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2023 11:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 30\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Alpha_star\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI don\u0026#039;t know why I didn\u0026#039;t finish writing.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha_star","CreatedById":230385,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-31T06:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as a plus, here\u0027s a general comparison between modded KSP1 and KSP2.

Parts: If we\u0027re just comparing the stock/vanilla games here, I believe that most people would think that KSP2 parts look much better than in its prequal. However, as we are comparing stock KSP2 and modded KSP1, it would be natural to have some kind of part revamp mod into the earlier game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I\u0027ve seen, there are a total of three part revamp mods in KSP1, namely Ven\u0027s Revamp, Stock Replacement Assets (this one is a bit unpopular and incomplete) and Restock(\u002B).

A look at the Restock album on Imgur will give you an Idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 parts, however, is a different story. They have a different art style from Restock, even if mostly being made by one person. What I have noticed is that KSP2 parts have very detailed textures, even having the nails visible on most parts and complexed endcap models. Of course, like most other graphical stuff in KSP2, they look a little too shiny, but nothing inacceptable for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also worth noting the plumes. KSP2 plumes have much more complexed textures compared to most default waterfall, which is not necessary good or bad for either of the games.
