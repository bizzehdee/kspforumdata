This will, however, not fix anything for the current save (and it\u0027ll only launch the x86 executable anyway). What\u0027s happened is that KSP has mis-read all the decimal points in the save file, treating the high-precision floating-point numbers as though they were immensely large (which results in a massive loss of precision, causing the weird physics issues you mentioned) -- basically, all decimal points are ignored and subsequently removed from the save file when the game is saved or autosaved. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a quicksave you can revert to (that was before this issue appeared), it might work. If not, you\u0027ll need to go through your backup and infer the missing decimal points as best you can, save the file, then reopen KSP.
