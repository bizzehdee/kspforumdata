Kerbals duplicated and bugged out my game!","CreatedByName":"LuckyGentleman","CreatedById":205566,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T13:22:32Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"LuckyGentleman","CreatedById":205566,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T13:22:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nHello Guys, I have a Problem and need your advice/ help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nI played the Career Mode for the second time and as I knew how to build efficient rockets and how to play the missions fast, I wanted to take as many tourists on the same Mission as possible. So I took off with around 15 Kerbal Tourists (and a pilot) on a relative small spacecraft with external commmdoseats. I took them to Mun, orbited and then went on to Minimus, landed and headed back to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeanwhile I started another small mission to rescue a kerbal from low kerbin orbit... but then i realised that the tourists where back in the space center... I could choose them again and take them on other missions!?!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI didnt think much about it and told myself thats surels just a display bug and continued the mission to take the tourists home.\u003Cbr\u003E\nafter a difficult and slow reentry (I had to refuel the spacecraft tho, otherwise they would have burned in the atmosphere\u00A0:P) I landed safely and ended the mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe normal After-Mission screen appeared with the 3 info tabs (600 Science in a single Mission, I was really proud!) but then the game bugged. I couldnt enter the assembly hall anymore and most other buildings too. I also couldn\u0027t save the game at this point, the screen just froze and I couldn\u0027t even close it other than Alt \u002B F4...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI restarted the game and the autosave took me to the landing on kerbin, so i told myself if I just start another rocket and take all the duplicated kerbals on that rocket there must be space for the originals then... but the same bug came up... Now I have no Idea how to continue and what to do...\u003Cbr\u003E\nI dont want to kill the Kerbals as the mission is worth at least 1.7 mio. and as said, 600 Science Points.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny Idea how to solve that? Did someone had similar issues? Does it have to do with my PC maybe..?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks a lot for any help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-20T17:08:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2020 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by LuckyGentleman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etags\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T19:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223806353\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194903\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221592659353\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205566\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LuckyGentleman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, LuckyGentleman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont want to kill the Kerbals as the mission is worth at least 1.7 mio. and as said, 600 Science Points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose you can cheat to autocomplete the contract, that might solve the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you don\u0027t know, go to the Alt-F12 menu, select Contracts, select the Active tab go to the contract, and select complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also, Logs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-21T15:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Force complete the contracts in the cheats menu (either alt-F12 or escape \u0026gt; view version info in the pause menu).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) If the tourists are still there, copy and THEN open the save file (persistent.sfs) and search for KERBAL until you find the tourists, then delete all their information.
