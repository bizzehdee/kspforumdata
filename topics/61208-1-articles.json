For example, the first one - I\u0027m not sure how I can use this data to help me. Ultimately, any engine can lift any mass, if there\u0027s enough of them. I presume what you\u0027re getting at is at what mass the S/C\u0027s TWR (Thrust-Weight Ratio) becomes less than 1 (i.e., won\u0027t take off on a given body vertically), presumably on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* On plots #2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, it would be good to add text to the pots themselves (as you do in #5 and #9) as the sheer number of colours makes it hard to tell which is which.

I think you will find the following to be helpful. First, all of the graphs above are plotted from data on the spreadsheet linked at my signature line. Second, here is where I explain my engine testing: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65937-How-I-tested-the-stock-engines-of-Squad-s-Kerbal-Space-Program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65937-How-I-tested-the-stock-engines-of-Squad-s-Kerbal-Space-Program\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose that some ambiguity will occur without the context of the referenced chart. Your presumption on at what point the TWR fails to lift mass is correct; again the context (and some explanation) is had on the engine spreadsheet. All launches occur on the KSC pad. The idea of the first graph (and the base testing) is that one can get a practical idea of how engines compare (hence the 3 and 2 radial combinations alongside the single stacking engines). I believe that you know that the altitude scale of all graphs is in meters. The subsequent graphs (well, most of them) deal with the same mass per engine as is found on the first graph. The second graph deals with the altitude when most of the mass is fuel. The third graph deviates in that the altitude results are of each engine using only one small fuel tank. It demonstrates the efficiency of an engine (or set of radials) in a real simulation way. The fourth is back to using the mass shown on the first graph; this time about half of that mass is non-fuel. The fifth graph attempts to convey the range between about 100% and 50% fuel by mass, in terms of altitude reached. The additional four (graphs 5-9) are repeats, with the most powerful engine results excluded so that the remaining engine results are easier to compare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGraphs 5 and 9 attempt to show the altitude \u003Cem\u003Erange\u003C/em\u003E for each engine, albeit with engines side by side; thus the 3D plot. As for the 3D look and colors; I\u0027d love to blame Calc for that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d consider the tests more useful to beginners, but veterans might find them useful too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the feedback!
