Corporate Reddit doesn\u0027t talk to/help moderators for a long period of time.\n2. One administrator becomes a default bridge, in part due to her heavy involvement in the Ask Me Anything subreddit. (which brings a lot of reddit\u0027s traffic)\n3. Corporate demands that said admin change Ask Me Anything to not include input from the redditors and instead become a misleading publicity method.\n4. Admin protests the changes, saying that it seems unethical and against the spirit of AMA\n5. Admin is fired.\n6. Celebrities, AMA interviewies and AMA moderators are all left with ZERO ways to contact the administration now that said admin was removed.\n7. AMA shuts down to try and scramble under the bad situation\n8. Other subreddits take notice and investigate.\n9. Insider speaks out about how it was an unethical money-grab that resulted in the loss of a competent and communicative admin.\n10. Subreddit moderators offer votes for if they should join AMA in shutdown.\n11. Votes are overwhelmingly in favor\n12. Subreddits shut down.\n\nNet result: loss of advertising and gilding money going to corporate Reddit and a temporary loss for reddit users.\n\n[EDIT: Removing a section I may be wrong about..]\n\n(I\u0027ve been researching this all morning. It\u0027s very interesting to me from a psychological and sociological standpoint.
