Unlike normal wheels, which have high surface friction in all directions, omni-wheels high friction in one direction, and low friction in a perpendicular one. They achieve this by having free-spinning rollers on the outside of a driven hub. This allows for several omni wheels to be placed together and work together to move the robot in any direction, much like how RCS on a KSP vessel operates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechanum wheels are a different beast though, as their high friction direction is 45 degrees off from the wheel rotation. As they spin they\u0027ll want to move outwards/inwards by the same amount they move forward/backward, but because of the rollers this can be overcome using a second wheel with a -45 degree offset. When four (or more) matched sets of wheels are placed together, its possible to have these motion vectors add together in different ways to allow for movement in any direction, whilst still having a more traditional \u0022car\u0022 shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/7690/mecanumprogram.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mecanumprogram.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that explains it sufficiently.

When driving forward 100% of the driving force is going to forward motion (since effectively the rollers do nothing in this case).
