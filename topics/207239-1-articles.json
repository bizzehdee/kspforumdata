I went back to the training mission to learn how to dock and finally it clicked after 3 tries. I don\u2019t know if this page is official but I really think that an Advanced Docking Mission (in training maybe) in the same way as the docking scene in the movie Interstellar where your mothership is a constant spin and you have to match its spin, dock and then stabilize the ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPls share if u would play that mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
