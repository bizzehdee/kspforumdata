I do not bare any ill will to Squad or the developers of KSP, but boy do I feel like they created a PR nightmare here that I honestly feel could have been totally avoided! We can argue the merits of resources and multiplayer until we\u0027re blue in the face, and that\u0027s fine. We can have debates about which one deserves to be in the game more (for the record I think it\u0027s resources, but that\u0027s not why I am writing this post), and that\u0027s fine too. I think most reasonable people can understand why squad would want to challenge themselves to trying to implement multiplayer, and I think most reasonable people would also understand why squad wants to make sure their resource management mechanic is accessible to everyone. That\u0027s all well and good.\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do NOT think is well and good is this idea that because a mod exists that implements a feature, that it should not be included as part of the stock game. Why shouldn\u0027t it? The devs have far more resources available than the modding community, and on top of everything they\u0027re getting paid for it. The modding community does what it does because it sees a demand that is being created by the fact that the game is still in development, but as the game develops it is perfectly reasonable to expect that demand to disappear. I can\u0027t speak for others on the forum but I myself see mods like Kethane, KAS, and FAR to be *placeholders* for the stock features they are filling in for, not *substitutions*. I hope that distinction is very clear to the developers, bless them all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly feel like no game should rely on a third party outside of the developers and the intended audience in order to reach the state of gameplay it was supposed to be at to begin with. If you will forgive me for indulging in a slippery slope / strawman argument for a moment, a very respected video game analyst named Jim Sterling (you can catch his segment the Jimquisition at \u003Ca href=\u0022www.escapistmagazine.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.escapistmagazine.com\u003C/a\u003E) once detailed a phenomenon where triple-A game developers would do an awful job porting console games over to PC with the expectation that third party modders would fix the port\u0027s flaws. That is *not* okay! In my own experience, I could tell you the endless frustration I had playing orbiter because I struggled to sort out all the mods I needed for basic features such as sound, high-resolution textures, EVA, and more extraterrestrial bases, but orbiter gets a pass on that because it\u0027s a free program only done as a hobby to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut KSP does not need to, and in fact should not have to rely on third party modders for basic gameplay features! Now, we can argue what constitutes a basic gameplay feature, and I would say that a prime target for this debate would be Mechjeb. I love Mechjeb, and I think it\u0027s a very useful mod, but the base game already provides a myriad of tools that allow players to control and guide their own spacecrafts manually so Mechjeb isn\u0027t really necessary to complete the gameplay experience. Resources on the other hand do not even have a basic current implementation in the stock game, and so adding them is perfectly reasonable to expect. So you say \u0022well Kethane already does that so why not install Kethane?\u0022 Well, I\u0027ve already explained why games relying on third party support for things they should have done to begin with is not an okay thing, but besides that Kethane adds an entirely new gameplay mechanic rather than just augment or modify an existing one. I hope you can see why this is a completely different thing than Mechjeb simply providing more information and tools to guide your spacecraft from point A to point B which you can already do in the base game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately the decision to add resources and/or multiplayer is squad\u0027s decision, and if they choose not to add one or the other you can bet there will be a host of mods to fill the demand. That said, I hope my post has made clear why third party modders should never have to do squad\u0027s work for them, and rather should create enhancements to existing features that give advanced players more tools to play with. And that\u0027s all I really have to say about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t saying that mods should REPLACE features, merely act as a temporary solution to the \u0022problem\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T19:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI strongly, strongly, strongly disagree with the statement \u0022resource gathering is too grindy for KSP.\u0022 So is science point gathering, but that mechanic is actually fairly entertaining!

All this is literally coming after KerbalKon which they gave us like 48 hours of constant streaming with so much interaction with devs. No game that i know of has this type of development interaction in the world. That is why I have been sticking with it. Its like a full on experience. Whats more if the community members don\u0027t like something in the game (or lack their of) then Squad has given us other outs by the ability to heavily mod the game. Each update they usually throw many things in for the modders. It is seriously possible to add this resource system that everyone is complaining about. I think all of the fellas making such a fuss need to relax. Lets get a grip and look at the situation (Situation being listed at the top of this paragraph).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpinion. Coincidentally, a lot of people seem to think different and don\u0027t think the dev notes are full, or detailed, or the announcements are useful at all.

They started making the system and didn\u0027t like it. Clearly they arent going to release what was...because it was not what they liked. To me it seems like the complainers are seeing the above like squad is just flat out dropping resources which was not what was said. And if they dont think that then they are upset over the fact that they liked what the screenshot contained and are upset that it wont be included like it was but stock. And if you saw the screenshot they released in 0.19, i dont see what is stopping a modder from putting it in.

Yeah, remember back in 0.19 when we didn\u0027t have career mode, there was no science, SAS was a hard, stuttering lock and Bac9 hadn\u0027t redone the KSC? Unless the game is going pay-to-win some time in the future, the game has done nothing but get better with each patch. It isn\u0027t native to this game, people tend to put rose colored glasses on for the past for reasons I guess were summed up in Watchmen, \u0022Every day, the future looks a little bit darker. But the past, even the grimy parts of it, keep on getting brighter.\u0022 It\u0027s a dumb sentiment unless a plague is currently wiping us out, the future is unanimously better than the past.

It\u0027s clear Squad is going to focus on career mode first and foremost, multiplayer is end of development stuff. They said they\u0027ll probably implement some back end as they go along but first and foremost is completing the game. Here\u0027s my tea leaves: We know two things, the owners said they wanted to have KerbalKon next year, which supports we\u0027ll see another year of development at least and that the versioning scheme has been ticked up .01 per patch. If this is any indication to go off of, it looks to me like they expect to do quite a bit more development and aren\u0027t entirely flying by the seat of their pants. There is one bit of information being glossed over, probably because the \u0027victors\u0027 don\u0027t really think of it in terms of a potential problem.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe uncertainty in development comes from what I already named enough times: 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA turn on the roadmap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe debacle about post-release DLC or expansions and how the people who bought in early got approval to get everything free forever! I don\u0027t know about you, but it looks like the community has been able to strong-arm Squad before, and it\u0027s likely why they are as hesitant now as they are to watch what they say. The game is new, it\u0027s expanding and the developers want to share what\u0027s going on. I mean, they are human, they are just as excited about what they do as we are. Developer tweets from indie studios has reached a fevered pitch. Now, I\u0027m not going to debate whether or not one side was right or wrong on this one, but you have to examine the implications of it. Squad said something, tried to change their mind and ultimately were forced into a position to comply. I believe them when they say this was not a pleasant experience for them, and I\u0027m sure that was their first real \u0027wake-up\u0027 call: shut the hell up or get burned at the stake.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, they really need to control what they say. They are talking to people that love the game as much as they do, so saying things out of the blue without really studying them (such as mentioning DLC on twitch chat out of nowhere) was something really dumb. Transparency is good, impulsiveness is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, in closing, I\u0027d like to address the resources chart. This may be news to some but Squad has LOTS of those charts lying around. They have written a TON of stuff down, discussed and planned many features they ultimately pushed off or are still finding ways to address. If they shared every design with us, our heads would explode. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ve played around with the idea of crafting or hats at some point. If you feel betrayed, please think of it this way : you are not the only person in the room. The player base expanded. Much as gaming has exploded over the last decade and casual gaming has become the norm, traditional (now referred to as \u0027core\u0027) gamers are in the minority. As KSP\u0027s number of users grow, the idea of what it should be or where it should go has also expanded. Just because you were here first doesn\u0027t mean that you know best, or that you own the game. Your share has been dwindling with each new purchase or forum sign-up. Whereas you are only selfish enough to see how you want the game to be, Squad has to distill community interest and see how it mixes with their own interest.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not the chart, really. Do read the threads before presenting invalid arguments. They got resources up to a playtesting/nearly release point and decided it was not funny.

I am in no way saying you cannot do anything you want to do, but after awhile you will either like the product or not. Personally at the price I paid for mine I would rather be unhappy with a game that is not finish yet, than say companies like EA, Blizzard, and other who charge $60\u002B and release games that need fixing after the fact. Also there are other ways then carrying on over the same issues like a child who has not gotten their way, look objectively from SQUAD\u0027s stand point as well. Do you honestly feel that there are not more important areas of the game that need more attention? Would you want a half finished resources system to go with the half finished science system in career mode? Would you like those things over improvements to performance and the randomly blowing up ships? Could you imagine you just collected all the science you could and on your way to drop it off your ship randomly disappears cause not only the loss of the science, but all the rep you had as well? In turn this makes further missions in your career useless since you exhausted all other avenues to get more science, and you cannot go to those that would give more due to the massive rep hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso most alphas are not like this, most you have to test a certain area, task, or whatever is being done that day.....that\u0027s it. once the test day is done the game is not available anymore (even single player ones are very limited). Not to mention I put a lot more money into another game that isn\u0027t even in internal testing yet, so maybe that is why I have a bit more patience for this than most. The money spent is not because I want to play the game, well maybe some, but more that I believe in the product and want to see it happen.
