Also KCT adds a whole slew of possible upgrade options for the Space Centre, which makes the base upgrade side of the game\u00A0a bit deeper. In short, it\u0027s a relatively straightforward way of building out the space \u003Cstrong\u003Eprogram\u003C/strong\u003E (rather than individual mission) planning part of the game, which is what I thought Career mode would be all about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes - I know I could just install the mod.

Keep the current Kerbol system as a default option but for the love of Jeb\u0027s sweaty socks, give us some variety too. Give us something to actually explore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an ideal world, I\u0027d rip up Career mode and rebuild it from scratch. KCT is actually quite a solid foundation (for the reasons outlined above), so I\u0027d start there. For those that haven\u0027t used it, KCT lets you earn science by building rockets. I would make that the main progression loop that drives technology progression. Build spacecraft, earn Engineering experience points and use them to unlock better parts for building better spacecraft. Put in a diminishing returns mechanism so you can\u0027t cheese your way through the tech tree by churning out endless \u0027Mk1 pod \u002B Flea\u0027 suborbital hoppers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext - make life support stock. Doesn\u0027t have to be a complicated system but give us some logistics to figure out and manage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext - proper kerbonaut training and career logs. Give us a reason to care about them, give us a reason to actually manage them, allocate them to appropriate missions etc. Get rid of the current \u0027get to level 3 and now I can repair wheels / magically get more science from a thermometer / figure out how to orient my craft antinormal rather than prograde\u0027 nonsense. Instead a spacecraft needs a certain level of crew training before you can launch it. Crew accumulate training over time, the more experienced a particular kerbonaut is, the faster he/she accumulates training points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext - tie reputation to exploration and science. Boldly going where no kerbal (or probe) has gone before - and beaming back the pictures to prove it - keep the public interested and\u00A0earns reputation for your program. Repeat missions also earn rep but on a diminishing returns basis. Likewise, gathering science points earns you the approbation of the Kerbin research community and builds your reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally - let us choose how we want to earn our funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReputation grants you a \u0027base salary\u0027 to spend on your program. If you have a sufficiently high reputation, that might be all you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunning tourist flights will earn you money - build your ship, set your price and see the punters roll in. Or not. Passengers will generally pay more to go to more exotic locations in more spacious spacecraft. Conversely, once the novelty has worn off, passengers won\u0027t pay much for the \u0027privilege\u0027 of being cooped up in a Mk1 pod for a month, regardless of how good the view is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding infrastructure like space stations and\u00A0Munbases\u00A0will also earn you money - building nicer infrastructure will earn you more money. Building infrastructure in far-flung parts of the Kerbol system will earn you even\u00A0more money. I would probably leave the task of building and maintaining the infrastructure to the player but have passenger transport handled automagically - or at least make that an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding and maintaining commercial comsat networks will earn you money.

Eventually, you manage to put craft in orbit, land on the Mun, land on Minmus, launch various satellites, and build grand space stations. But for a new player, the step out to the faraway planets is daunting. \u0022What if I don\u0027t manage it?\u0022 \u0022What if I strand my Kerbals where I can\u0027t recover them?\u0022 \u0022I\u0027ve fast-forwarded a few weeks to get to Minmus and back, but now for this mission I have to fast-forward more than three times as long as my accumulated play time until now - this feels wrong!\u0022. Leaving the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of Kerbin feels at least an order of magnitude more complex than anything you can do inside of it. It takes a lot of play time to design a craft, perform the necessary maneuvers (10\u002B minute burns with the nuclear engine, for instance), fast-forward, make orbit and land safely. And all the way, you\u0027re uncertain if you have enough fuel to make it back home. If you fail at any stage, you\u0027ve easily lost an hour or more of play-time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll stop you right here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly,\u00A0the problem of fast-forwarding: time needs to matter. It doesn\u0027t right now. If you warp through the tech research because it needs time then the ships arrive at other planets in no time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, the \u0022oh, but do I have enough fuel?\u0022\u00A0is simply the case of the lack of information in stock. Colonization won\u0027t fix that. You shouldn\u0027t be able to go all \u0022oh, oops! I guess I\u0027m stuck here with this one-man capsule! Time to colonize!\u00A0\u00AF\\_(\u30C4)_/\u00AF\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColonization would not improve the career. It would extend it. I\u0027m not against it, but to fix the career we don\u0027t need more nodes\u00A0or more parts, or even life support (though I support the notion of having it in stock). We need a fix first, more stuff later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-18T18:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany mechanics that fit within the paradigm I am sure we are stuck with are suggested to make time meaningful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe typical response of naysayers is \u0022then the player will just time warp through the 2 months it takes for X to happen.\u0022 My response? Good! That\u0027s the point. To feel like a \u0022career\u0022 of, well, anyone, time needs to pass. Going from \u0022what is a rocket?\u0022 to \u0022The next tourist flight for 30 passengers leaves for Jool in 2 hours!\u0022 in a few hundred 6 hour days kills any suspension of disbelief anyone might have, anyway. Yet somehow warping to the next fiscal quarter because you are out of funds is anathema.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer has other, fundamental problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The lack of failures is a glaring one. Failures, and mechanisms to correct them (using the new \u0022upgrade\u0022 mechanic, perhaps?) force design choices on the player when done properly. Rating parts by \u0022safety\u0022 would be a kerbal sort of stat. Upgrades make parts safer, and also might improve other stats. Some parts might be fundamentally safer from the start. Safety would not be \u0022risk of explosion\u0022 as much as \u0022risk of failing to function fully, or at all.\u0022 Monoprop or hypergolic would be a nice addition for upper stages---when you absolutely, positively want your munar lander to be able to take off. Yeah, squad hates \u0022random.\u0022 Get over it for career mode, because that makes things interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Scale. The mini scale is sort of crippling because it removes interesting design branches. There is no need to think about Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous vs Munar\u00A0Orbit Rendezvous, or Direct Ascent, etc in KSP. You can send a kerbal in a mk1 pod, alone, easily a few days after you realize which end to point up. Challenges make the game interesting. We know that what was it, rounding errors, resulted in the mini scale? Really, the size should be such that landing on the Mun---the primary body outside of kerbin that most players visit, apparently---is interesting/challenging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Difficulty over time. KSP career gets easier as the game progresses. The only possible way to ever lose is set on maximum grind mode (\u0022Hard\u0022), and only then fairly early in the game. Basically, if you can get to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, all you need to do to go literally everywhere else is upgrade facilities so you can build bigger stuff with the same parts. Life Support, kerbal wellbeing included, makes distant missions harder as you need to build considerably larger craft. Add in failure as an option, and perhaps you need spares.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. No, well, \u003Cem\u003Epoint\u003C/em\u003E. KSP includes an implicit Space Race, for example. It would be more compelling if it was made explicit. Real pressures to beat a foil. If you don\u0027t like that, perhaps a colonization mode (perhaps a world will destroy Kerbin in XX years or something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could sketch out ideas, but I\u0027ve written dozens of pages of this stuff over the last few years to no avail, all we see are \u0022double down\u0022 updates, adding more thoughtless, random side quests instead of fundamental changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-18T18:46:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2016 06:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-18T18:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailures is not a fun mechanic. - So you carefully planned a mission to duna which took 20\u002B hours to plan/develop.
