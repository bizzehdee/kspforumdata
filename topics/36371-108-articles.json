I was doing some tests just now, and got some...nonsensical results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, take a Rockomax X200-32 fuel tank (the half-an-orange-tank one), and put a fairing base at the bottom, and a fairing around it. If the fairing base has a diameter of 1.25m, the fairings have a mass of 0.204 and a cost of 1,222. If the fairing base has a diameter of 2.5m, the fairings have a mass of 0.43, and a cost of 2,351. However, if you look at the fairings, the ones from the 1.25m base need to immediately go out to 2.5m to get around the tank, so they should actually be MORE massive than the fairings with the larger base. (Of course, the fairing base mass is completely reasonable, but the fairing mass dwarfs the base mass much of the time anyway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dislike this because it means that I can get a cheaper craft by making one that doesn\u0027t make sense with real-world logic, and matching real-world logic is a large part of the reason to have procedural fairings in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orangewarning","CreatedById":113062,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T06:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find that when I right click to change base radius and height and things,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt becomes really laggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe it has to do with tweakable everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut just letting you guys know anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mecki","CreatedById":116929,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T16:35:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI don\u0027t know if this is issue belongs to FAR, Procedural Fairings or DeadlyReentry so please tell me if I should ask it in another thread.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EWhen I load a previously saved ship and start it, my procedural fairings have two info fields for \u0022Temperature\u0022 and \u0022Ambient\u0022 on right-click.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI also have the feeling that those fairings heat up faster.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T17:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mecki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mecki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI don\u0027t know if this is issue belongs to FAR, Procedural Fairings or DeadlyReentry so please tell me if I should ask it in another thread.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EWhen I load a previously saved ship and start it, my procedural fairings have two info fields for \u0022Temperature\u0022 and \u0022Ambient\u0022 on right-click.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI also have the feeling that those fairings heat up faster.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think those fields are added by Deadly Reentry.
