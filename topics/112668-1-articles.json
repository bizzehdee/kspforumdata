On your second question - Set up two manoeuvre nodes before you do any burns. First an ejection that takes you to the right Ap (46.4Mm) then a mid-course plane correction at the AN/DN. The game will then show the resultant orbit as if you had done both burns perfectly. You will probably need to slide these nodes around before you get this orbit to intercept Minmus. Also, its likely your first burn won\u0027t be perfect - you may need to recalculate the second one afterwards. As said above, this is a fairly standard way of getting to other planets, so worth learning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T07:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou use less fuel by braking at Minmus periapsis to enter its orbit after an encounter at the apoapsis of Kerbin orbit meeting Minmus, than you would burn to circularize an orbit at Minmus level, which would allow you to \u0022enter\u0022 at a speed that needs nearly no dV to enter the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only optional burn is equalizing the orbits, which is a huge time-saver and doesn\u0027t cost all that much.
