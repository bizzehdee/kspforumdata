Anyways, I discovered KSP from my friend about a year ago, with .13 or .14, I can\u0027t remember. I played it a lot but I eventually got tired of it, and then new versions released, and I forgot about it. About 2 weeks ago I checked the new version of KSP because of seeing mentions of it around the internet, so I bought it on Steam. Instantly hooked. I made a bunch of rockets and was wowed at all the new stuff put in, especially the atmospheric effects and structural parts. Then I noticed the airplanes. I ditched rocket making and started making airplanes, and as of now I mostly make airplanes instead of rockets (not that I can\u0027t make working rockets, I make rockets that are just fine, I\u0027m just a horrible pilot at them) and so I have an increasingly large number of airplanes that are either strangely designed, amazingly maneuverable, record-breakingly massive, etc., so I thought I would join to share some planes I made/am making/will make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some images of such planes: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/NOqMn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/NOqMn\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: I\u0027m new, but I\u0027m not new, and I make planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T17:36:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
