You can delay it by not using RAM hungry mods, or by cutting out parts you know you won\u0027t be using (example? I reduce my part list on loading by removing most fuel tanks and fuel adapters in favor of \u003Cstrong\u003EProcedural Parts\u003C/strong\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EWindows 64bit\u003C/strong\u003E - You can try stuff mentioned in \u003Cstrong\u003EWindows 64 bit community workaround. \u003C/strong\u003EIt is considered a hack, so no warranty it will work properly (but you can always check it out). Keep in mind, that you better not make any bug reports while using this method, as generally win64 unity player executable is considered unstable and therefore mod authors are not supporting it and/or disabling it in their mods. I do understand the motives behind it, as for getting a spam of support requests can be frustrating (as it is not the fault of the mod that something crashes, but the broken win64 unity player exe). You\u0027ll also need \u003Cstrong\u003E[WIN][1.0.X] KSP x64 Total Unfixer \u003C/strong\u003Efor mods that disable themselves when detecting that KSP runs in 64bit. Assuming you\u0027re using them. \u003Cstrong\u003EAlso (again) I would like to point that important thing about not bugging mod developers while using this method\u003C/strong\u003E. It is a crash-sandbox for you only. If it is too buggy for you - choose other option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Linux 32bit - \u003C/strong\u003EI don\u0027t see the point of using this combination, so i\u0027ll skip it (similar to win32bit option).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Linux 64bit\u003C/strong\u003E - This is the place, where fun starts. 64bit linux build of KSP is rock solid (my main career is hosted on this option). It can take tons and tons of mods and still run quite fine. Only downside of massive modding would be initial load time and loading times in scene switching. Everything except that is golden. Well... maybe the borkyness of using AMD drivers under linux (my case), but it is manageable. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0026lt;- BEST OPTION \u003C/strong\u003Eif you can spare few gigs on making a dual-boot on your laptop.
