As I\u0027ve [been saying for](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114541-Career-mode-set-up?p=1817699\u0026viewfull=1#post1817699)[some time,](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/1767-Science-is-pretty-shallow-Could-it-be-shaken-up-a-bit) career mode is still flawed.\n\nThe problem is conceptual- they made career a series of impediments regulating what the player can do until they\u0027ve progressed by fulfilling some else\u0027s space plans.\n\n They didn\u0027t make it about planning and managing the kerbals, exploration and utilisation of space. That happens, but it seems secondary.\n\nWhen it was just sandbox, imagination ruled. People went to the planets, because it was awesome to explore, built complex vessels because it was fun to embrace the challenge, built stations and bases because it was fun to be a pioneer in space. \n\nAll they needed to do was stick the right meters on things, and provide a way of measuring what the space program was achieving, )So we\u0027d earn/lose money depending on how cost effective we were,) and add a few more activities to make the experience complete. \n\nInstead, we\u0027ve got a set of task lists to tick off- unlock the parts, build the buildings, visit all biomes.\n\n Then fly around doing someone else\u0027s missions until you\u0027re bored of it. \n\nIt\u0027s not that what career mode has is bad per say- fulfilling some contracts can be a fun, working with limited parts an engaging challenge. But it just doesn\u0027t come together to create a fulfilling whole. And even though we may see great improvements in future expansions,  that is a problem when this is this the \u0027complete\u0027 game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T16:05:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Twreed87","CreatedById":50017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T15:15:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I maintain a slim slice of hope flavoured cake that we will get a .91 to chew on before the final release that KSP will be judged on.\n\u003E !\n\nWe\u0027re not.

In career mode atm I feel like a janitor for the Kerbals doing their busywork and building their stuff. I don\u0027t feel like I control a space program. Most of that is due to the arbitrary limits imposed by building and tech upgrades that make no sense from a gameplay perspective. The tech tree is being dealt with (from the sounds of it the buildings thing is not) but purely by testers, not by the community at large which has so far made some pretty good calls on what SQUAD should and should not do (i.e., the tech tree needs redoing, kerbals shouldn\u0027t be able to magic up extra dV, we need new landing gear) that SQUAD cannot make themselves inside their developer bubble.\n\nHopefully the testing team can detect problems beyond bugs, but if they cannot then my fears are likely to come to reality based on what information is currently available.
