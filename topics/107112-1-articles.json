I mean YES... the stock system you can edit stuff inside without having to move it, but really... all you do for procedural fairings is place one fairing on, that is it, everything else comes on and off as you pull one on and off... its so much more intuitive to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a couple of things the stock fairings have going for them:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou don\u0027t need a mod.

I also suspect that the stock fairings will set off some evolution on PF making them better in any aspect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think stock needs to outperform existing mods in every aspect. I do think that, long term, stock needs to offer everything that is regarded \u0022essential\u0022 to enjoy the game. That doesn\u0027t stop at parts but includes also things like clouds, chatter, automation (we\u0027ve already seen that happening with the pilots). Stock should provide a playable basis (and the stock fairings do). If you want more/better/different in some way, get a mod. (Case in point: real chutes vs stock parachutes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"billbobjebkirk","CreatedById":104713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:56:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInterstage fairings are a lot easier with stock, as opposed to having to work with two bases. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou only need one base with PF.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:01:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I actually don\u0027t particularly like either and favored the pre-set fairing sizes that came with KW Rocketry.
