Yeah... This...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe short answer is that you could use Persistent Thrust to accomplish this. It doesn\u0027t look quite as intuitive to use as the stock maneuver node system, but it might accomplish what you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9850882321\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/120404-wip13-persistentthrust-v109/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe longer answer is that you probably don\u0027t need this as much as you think you do. Bear with me, maybe you\u0027re doing something cool I haven\u0027t considered, but I tried spiral trajectories and found they were rarely useful or necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually spent a lot of time writing a mod that hacked the stock Orbit and ManeuverNode classes to make the patched conic solver accept patches that were solved through a differential equation solver rather than the usual Keplerian model. This let me create maneuver nodes that did exactly what you\u0027re envisioning and would even have let me use non-physical timewarp with the engine running because the \u0027orbit\u0027 was precomputed through the differential equation since it knew the thrust and mass burn rate.\u00A0I never released it for a few reasons, one of which being that the way I hooked into some private methods is in a gray zone for forum rules (I don\u0027t think it ever broke the EULA, but when I asked if I was crossing a line I never got a clear go-ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other reason I never pushed further towards releasing it was that it wasn\u0027t nearly as useful as I imagined. For interplanetary transfers, brachistochrone trajectories never materialized because I got super short flight times with ejection burns on the order of a few hours. While that\u0027s obviously not ideal, things like BetterTimeWarp would make those doable. For local orbital changes, bi-elliptic or multi-\u0027impulse\u0027 maneuvers accomplished things just fine. Even when I was trying to create scenarios where a spiral burn would be used, I ended up making spiral segments of a few degrees of arc before coasting to the next maneuver. I guess with KSP\u0027s small scale, burn times are only rarely of an order where the impulse assumption gives unacceptable errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-22T17:20:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2018 05:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Booots\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-22T20:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersistent Thrust doesn\u0027t appear to *calculate* these trajectories.\u00A0 It just makes flying them less annoying.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 I may be wrong there - I haven\u0027t looked to closely.\u00A0 (And Solar Sail Navigator might actually have some helpers for this, though it\u0027s still listed as in alpha.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, it\u0027s not a very useful thing to try with the Stock engines.\u00A0 There\u0027s only one ion engine, and it\u0027s not really worth using for anything more than a small probe.\u00A0 And you always can boost to a higher orbit and do your burn from there, or split the maneuver into several parts and do those instead.\u00A0 You rarely *need* this trajectory class, and it\u0027s hard to set up and use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, with some of the modded engines (NFE \u002B NFP come to mind), you can build decent-sized ships using ion engines, and it would at least be interesting to me to be able to attempt this style of burn and compare.\u00A0 A large part of the purpose of playing KSP to me is learning the answers to the question \u0027what would it actually take to colonize a solar system?\u0027, as well as just learning what works and doesn\u0027t work in doing that.\u00A0 I find these an interesting option, and I\u0027d like to be able to play with them to see when and if they\u0027re useful.\u00A0 And even a few hour burn would be worth comparing on this - the orbital period of my standard \u0027orbital separation\u0027 orbit of 80km is ~30 minutes, so a two-hour burn is four orbits.\u00A0\u00A0 Again, I can split that up, or move to a higher orbit before calculating the burn, but I would find it interesting to try this instead sometimes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-24T12:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should do it :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1340929282\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/33568-winmac-ksp-trajectory-optimization-tool-v158-mfms-updates-and-rss-compatibility/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:188px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-24T15:20:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I\u0027ll take a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
