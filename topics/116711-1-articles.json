I know 3D modelling and texturing in blender, and have a very basic notion of Unity, I wanna start with a very small parts mod, I0m following this tutorial\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFRICd-0zYo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E. I have my model textured in blender and I exported it as a Collada file. I then set up PartTools in unity, and import a folder with the .dae model file and the texture file. Now, in the tutorial right after the model is imported onto the scene a lot of components appear by default like a mesh renderer and a mesh filter with a default diffuse material. Whenever I import my model to the scene it doesn\u0027t have any components. I can add them myself and then add the texture, but then whenever I write the final .mu file with PartTools only the .mu file is created, without a texture. What am I doing wrong here?\u003Cp\u003EAny help much appreciated, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T09:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome screen grabs would be really helpful.

I figured out what was going on, it was something rather silly actually... I forgot to delete the camera and the lamp in blender so I guess the PartTools exporter didn\u0027t really know what was going on. I even managed to open it in KSP now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E However I will probably need help further down the road, since this is my first try at modding!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T21:17:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat stuff.
