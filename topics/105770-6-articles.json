However, I should really not act too smug, as I haven\u0027t actually gotten all the way to Jool yet. The last Kerbin encounter requires me to get right down to the top of Kerbin\u0027s atmo, so we\u0027ll see if I can actually manage it without burning any more fuel. It\u0027s one thing to have the maneuver node editor telling you that you\u0027ll reach Jool, and another to actually arrive there. I\u0027ll certainly need to make another correction both right before and right after the second Kerbin encounter to dial in my Jool approach. As to making the Eve ejection adjustment while still in Kerbin orbit, I agree that would have made it cost significantly less, but the maneuver node editor is so wibbly-wobbly that far out that it can be really hard to tell where you are. Nonetheless I could no doubt do it better the next time, but given the many hours I\u0027ve already sunk into this go, I\u0027ve no stomach for starting over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFiguring out my Jool approach will be interesting. My initial plan is to try to set up a Tylo encounter that will slingshot me retrograde sufficiently to either get captured by Jool or alternately to send me into Laythe on an escape trajectory that is still slow enough that I wont burn up aerobraking there. I\u0027m tempted to go through everybody\u0027s reports to see how they did it, but I want to try to figure it out myself first. I\u0027m hoping I can maybe tag Pol or Bop on the way out too, but we\u0027ll see. My 0.90 Jool5 mission, which I unfortunately never posted before 1.0 came out, taught me quite a bit about slingshotting around the Jool system, so hopefully I can come up with something beyond just landing on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T16:15:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T14:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nefrums\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nefrums\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt get easier after you done it a couple of times.

What I found last night analyzing the projected Jool encounters of my fleet of 4 ships is that the timing of the second Kerbin encounter is critical. Since you have to be at a 2:1 Kerbin resonant apoapsis no matter what, your speed coming into Kerbin\u0027s SOI on the second encounter is pretty much fixed. That means that you have a very limited parameter space to maneuver in in terms of where you place your Kerbin PE and what your ejection angle is. Since you have to come from the inside, the closer you get to Kerbin the higher your AP will be, but also the earlier on Jool\u0027s orbital path. That means if your second Kerbin encounter is too early, you\u0027ll come in too far behind Jool with no way of correcting your course without burning anti-radially a whole lot. Presumably coming into Kerbin too late would put you out ahead of Jool, but that\u0027s actually quite a bit easier to fix since you\u0027ll be going so much slower than Jool when you reach its orbit. Anyway, all of my ships can get to a Jool encounter via Kerbin, but the earliest one to arrive there has such a rubbish encounter (\u0026gt;350dV to get down to Tylo\u0027s orbit) that I don\u0027t think it\u0027s even worth it to continue with that one. As it is KEKKJ was only saving me maybe 700dV over a direct Hohman transfer. Anyway, I believe that there is sufficient wiggle room on the first Kerbin encounter to allow you to place the second one where you need it, even if your Eve encounter is a few days off, for a fairly small price in dV. If you just put the second one in exactly the same spot on Kerbin\u0027s orbit as the first though, then exactly when you arrive at Eve really is crucial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Just a quick update. After posting all that I figured out that the best way to correct my second Kerbin encounter is inbound, as close to PE as possible but before the approach direction starts to change. From there, boosting prograde or retrograde will change the ejection angle so that you can move your Jool encounter ~150 days for ~150 m/s. So far my best ship is headed for a survivable capture at Laythe with a total of 1289 m/s expended from a 70X75km LKO, my worst ship 1457. So if I can land it near deadstick, I should end up on the ground at Laythe for 1300-1500 m/s, with 3.3-3.6km/s dV left -- in all cases significantly cheaper than I could have via a direct transfer. As it turns out, setting up captures at Jool was pretty easy. For three of the ships I was able to set up Tylo encounters that slingshot me retrograde into Jool orbit for just a few m/s over my ~90 m/s plane change correction for Jool. With another ~3m/s, I can adjust each of these so it should culminate in a survivable Laythe aerocapture. For the fourth, I couldn\u0027t get the needed Tylo encounter, but I was able to set up a swing around Laythe into a Jool orbit that re-encounters Laythe at much lower speed 4 days (2 Laythe orbits) later. Anyway, this is starting to look pretty doable now...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-23T00:09:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2015 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mesklin","CreatedById":73898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T01:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurbojet is cool device - \u003Cstrong\u003E1 (one)\u003C/strong\u003E turbojet \u002B 2 LV-N = 4563 m/c dV on Kerbin 100x100 km orbit with mass 22.6t.

Aside from that, the only parts exposed to teh air are intake in front, MK1 LF tank, 2 MK1-2 adaptors, cargo bay, cockpit, rapier, nuke. That and a few minor things like landing gear, ect, but i doubt those are that big of a deal (i always can stick the front gear inside the cargo bay to disable its drag is thatd help?).

Its ~26.4t heavy on takeoff and had 4000 dV before i realized i accidentally had 2 RTGs for some stupid reason (i mustve used symmetry despite only wanting one), so it was actually heavier then the final version i have now. The whole angle wings helped ALOT, for some reason angled hull (even angled a little bit) is terrible, and yet higher AoA on the wings seems to have helped. Also the tip about control surfaces on the nose was helpful too, made liftoff way easier, and seems to have no real negative impact on drag or maneuverability. I had to switch to lighter missiles, as 2 tons was a little overkill to drag up there, although the absolute maximum of payload i have tested it is 5 tons, ofc it wont go much more then LKO as u gotta drain the equivalent of fuel, but it will actually get 5 tons of ordinance into orbit provided the weapons are no larger then 625mm caliber. It is rated right now at ~1-1.5t ordinance without draining a drop of fuel. Without missiles, i feel this might very well be comparable to some of the other 4K dV craft ive seen here as that extra 1.5t of dead weight (provided you arent actually going to use them to shoot stuff) is just not helping one bit at all. that, and it has full docking abilities, so its very much multi-role. It most likely can land on duna too (as one of my older versions did).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing im still unhappy about is that i cant seem to get a working SSTO to laythe that doesnt use outright exploits (such as giving yourself near infinite electric charge capacity in a pod) and is below ~25 tons mass. Id really really like a lightweight ~10-15t fighter (the thing i have now feels like a F35 with a cesna engine on it, cant glide, unstableish, and just slow even with the engine on full power, cant climb at all unless ur above 500m/s where it actually becomes useable, and, in space it feels worse then flying a capital ship, but hell, IT ACTUALLY WORKS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, is there any way to get lower mass then ~20t and still get to laythe and back direct route without grav assists (you can get just about anything in KSP to jool using grav assists well). My last question in this thread, is it even possible to make a 100% legit craft below 15t with no staging at all or refueling that can get ~4-4.5K dV after achieving LKO and allow a direct route to laythe, land, and get back, or is this just some sort of dream that will never come true without mods and or cheats? What id do for a craft that could do that, and atop of that carry at least 1 ~.75 ton missile, thatd be the best fighter ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here are some pics of my new AKSTechnologies HK-201 V3 prototype. This one is most likely going to be put into full scale production. After removing an intake off the back of teh nuke (apparently having that node open is less total drag), removing that useless 2nd RTG, and cutting a few struts that werent really needed inside the cargo bay in the 1st place, i managed to get into LKO with 4350 dV (a little more as i always estimate a little low on what the dV is. It get 6500 dV fully fueled with no oxy loaded aboard, which is enough to get to near anywhere.
