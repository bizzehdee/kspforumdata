One of the key problems is the cotainment of gases, gases are best liquified, the problem is with ion drives that might operate for months in space, liquification is a problem. Vasimr is a solution but its weight and energy needs are enourmous, if you can get a fractional weight with much less ISP then its worth it, IMHO. But the authors did not oresent on the durability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELight scattering is the inverse forth power of the wavelength. UV scatters worse than visible light. You can get a suburn under a cloud, thats due to scattering of lUV around the cloud. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot uv - plants like the deep blue and red-orange. plants appear green because they absorb everything but green light, (a generalization because the spectrum tapers at its edges anyway).

That\u0027s a real thing I tell you. IMHO we don\u0027t really need any visual telescope in space - lucky imaging can make images from Keck sharper than Hubble\u0027s, large delicate mirrors are easier to built and install and correct on ground, and interferometry helps avoiding bad weather. But Earth\u0027s atmosphere (and biosphere - anthrosphere ? What do we call human activites, sociosphere ?) is not good for any other wavelength, except some low-utility radio gap. Having any other kind of telescope outside Earth\u0027s atmosphere is a major advantage, from radio to UV and even X-ray or \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3-ray. Radio suffers from ionospheric absorption and comm device interference. Microwave and IR suffer from water vapour absorption. UV suffers from ozone absorption. X-ray and \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3 ray, you know these thing really hate it\u0027s own existence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : And FYI, JWST is going to be fully in IR.
