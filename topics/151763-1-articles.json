Module manager goes through the installed mod, umpteen thousand patches are applied.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThose who, like me, are totally kid-in-candy-store when visiting Spacedock and have dozens of mods installed. Or hundreds. That whole startup procedure isn\u0027t quite quick.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich makes sense if I installed a new mod, or there are updates, etc., etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if that is not the case. If I didn\u0027t install anything new, if there are no updates or I just don\u0027t want to update. It\u0027ll basically do the exact same stuff it did last time I started the game, right?\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, my idea/request/delusion/feverish-dream: A mod or addon that takes an image/makes a copy of whatever was patched together. So that, next time I start the game, I can chose to just use that stuff. And the mod will make the game use the image/copy of the thing that was run last time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMight not be a thing for a mod, more like a new game-launcher, maybe.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nObviously, I have no real clue what happens in detail, nor understanding of that. So I won\u0027t be surprised if it\u0027s not remotely possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIdeas, imho, shouldn\u0027t usually go to waste, so I\u0027m just throwing this out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceMouse","CreatedById":126931,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-09T10:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst loads are generally slower because the game has to store files.

When the game first starts, it moves all the game\u0027s files (or the ones it needs) from your hard drive to your RAM. This allows the game to use all the files faster than if they were all still in the hard drive. For example, fileX takes 2 seconds to load from the hard drive to the RAM, but only 0.2 seconds to move from the RAM to the CPU and back (when the game uses the file). I know this isn\u0027t exactly how it works but it\u0027s the simples way I can explain it.
