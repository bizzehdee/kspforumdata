Unfortunately, all the old tricks I knew about building heavy-lift and long-distance SSTOs no longer work. Multiple intakes per engine, turbojet/nuke combos, etc are all off the table. Reading around, the vast majority of SSTOs people are showing off lifting payloads to orbit or visiting minmus, etc. feature RAPIER engines.

I am using FAR these days, but I played in the new stock aero while ferram was still building Euler and I can definitely say that there\u0027s not as wide of a gulf between stock aero and FAR these days as there used to be. A Turbojet engine in FAR still produces 166.77 kN of thrust on the Runway, so at 25 tonnes you\u0027ve got a TWR of 0.71 and with thirty tonnes you\u0027re at 0.57. The wiki puts the figure for a single Turbojet at a nice, even 180 kN, and that would be for the stock game, so the TWRs there would be even higher. Half your mass in rocket fuel gives you somewhere in the neighborhood of 1800 m/s of delta-V (with the Twitch engine\u0027s 290 Isp), which is what I\u0027ve seen folks recommending lately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Told you guys wrong in that first post - it\u0027s not eight Twitches; it\u0027s sixteen.

Once you need to burn absurd amounts of fuel, you\u0027re no longer saving as much.

If that\u0027s the case, that\u0027s fine, I can still do satellite launches, etc. I had been hoping to launch orange tanks into orbit or use them as mun/minmus crew shuttles but it sounds as if that\u0027s not possible these days. I can live with that although it\u0027s a bit of a come-down from the heady days of 0.90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now I\u0027m converting my existing launch rockets to be partially recoverable which is helping to reduce launch costs. I\u0027ll probably look into SSTO rockets too for lifting heavy payloads onto LKO. I\u0027m building an orbital fueling station so eventually my LKO-restricted SSTOs can refuel and head on to my mun and minmus research stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T03:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis may be beating a dead horse, but whatever - check \u0022Applied Sciences Division\u0022 in my signature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HansonKerman","CreatedById":185809,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-13T20:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry a \u0022Dart\u0022 Areospike Engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Not Sure","CreatedById":165210,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-13T20:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt really can be done quite easily with some knowledge.
