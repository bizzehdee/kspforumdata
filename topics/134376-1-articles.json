Im having a bit of trouble. I want to create a specific shape\u00A0out of fuel tanks. But it\u00A0must be a certain size for the vessel to look proportioned. So i found that Rocomax jumbo 64 fuel tank is 6m in height and im working with Rocomax x-200 which is half that so 3m in height. for what I want each tank need to be angled from the last tank by 37 degrees and thats whats causing the issues. So i looked around and found a mod called Part Angle Display which I thought would solve all my problems but it seems not so much.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI click the first fuel tank so its the root part and dont change any alignments on it. Then I add the second fuel tank on top. Now in the mod ive tried changing increment increase/decrease in various ways but it doesnt actually change the angle at all it says it does but when I click on the part with rotate tool and manually change to roughly what I need the its totally different. This only seems to be an issue with fuels tanks and the attachment nodes as when I add wings to the sides of the tank (radially that is) I am able to change but the increment stated in the mod and attach radially at that angle. So it seems to work radially but not on the nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I cant attach radially as the shape I want is circular-ish plus like i say i want the fuel tanks on top of each other. Does anyone know how to over come this in the mod or if there are any other mods that can help me do what I want. Otherwise Im going to have to change each tank individually and only roughly get the right angle rather than exactly and I really need the exact angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T10:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are trying to make something like a ring station, I place girders in 6 way symmetry first around a central core. \u00A0Then place your tanks on the end of the girder. Smoother look if you stack 2. Then use the stock rotation tool on one, all will rotate together (Try\u00A0and you will see what I mean). \u00A0Repeat on the second tank for a smoother curve. Struts for strength at the ends to reduce wobble. Tweak between the 2 tanks (unclick the snap to fit circle) until it looks right. Save as a sub assembly if you want it sideways or multiple rings.
