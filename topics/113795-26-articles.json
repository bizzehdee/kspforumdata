I can no longer replicate the bug with the new version of FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding vectoring: more control over axes would certainly be welcome, as would some way to apply dynamic deflection to them, but part of the problem seems to be an extension of the tendency of stability controls/BD AI to get itself into nasty oscillating situations with overcorrection. I\u0027m not sure what, if anything, can be done about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t completely write off vectoring, though. Aside from the ability to pull off cool stunts (I spent quite some time last night pulling 360 degree flips in both yaw and pitch axes for giggles -- quite a lot of fun while low over the KSC in IVA mode), it really helps in situations where control authority might otherwise be weak. The poor Skua has taken quite a beating with the recent patches; the relative centre of lift has moved back a lot (or the centre of pressure has moved... Forwards? Is that how it works?) -- in any case, pitch authority is now dismal. Fixing it seems to require a complete redesign of the planform, and my efforts in that direction quickly ran into new problems, so I would essentially be designing a new plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHowever\u003C/em\u003E: with thrust vectoring, the Skua is able to regain some of its former glory. I ran a few test fights, Skua versus its replacement (\u0027Cormorant\u0027), and while the Cormorant completely destroys the Skua if neither have vectoring, a Skua with TV has enough energy retention (and otherwise undesirable stability) that it can still spring nasty surprises on more agile planes (though it does wobble like a top in the process).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I tried to replicate the problem \u003Cstrong\u003ETheHengeProphet\u003C/strong\u003E had, but no luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T05:31:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Doke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T06:49:28Z","Content":"\nI have been having trouble replicating it myself.
