I love it and have lost literally hundreds of hours of my life playing, building, and flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was putting a satellite in orbit today and the music I was listening to ended. I noticed that the quiet humming, rumbling sound was there and it made me think...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How about making unmanned spaceships truly silent? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Adding some fan/electonic/general ambiance, to crewed ships, similar to what\u0027s there now, but perhaps a bit more varied. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Finally, I\u0027m sure that spacesuits make interesting sounds, it would be really cool to add those real sounds to EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for the fantastic game. I love it.

Unmanned probes totally silent in a vacuum? Ok, I\u0027ll go with that, so long as I can get a indicator of some kind while in the map view to let me know when a stage runs out of fuel. Maybe a fuel light on the navball or something. I\u0027m used to an audio alert of some kind to let me know when a stage runs out of fuel and it\u0027s time to press the space bar, which doesn\u0027t work all the time anyway. A fuel light would be nice. That way I\u0027m not carrying around spent fuel tanks anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
