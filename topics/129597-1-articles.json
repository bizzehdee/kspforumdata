If you angle it right, you can take 90% of that delta-v off your entry velocity while maintaining the same Perigee. An entry at 10 km/s is a lot easier than 11 km/s - heat scales with the cube of velocity AFAIK.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T06:04:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConvective heat does.
