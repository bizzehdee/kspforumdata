evening.\u00A0 I am encountering an intermittent \u0022event\u0022 that so far has not killed my game, but it is a bit frustrating and damnably weird.\u00A0 My 2 questions are has anyone encountered what I will explain below, and can anyone explain it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy load times, from double-click on icon to select save game usually runs 8-12 minutes.\u00A0 I have 1850 patches for 40 mods, and I play\u00A0on a potato.\u00A0 However, the game always works (albeit with slow frame rates).\u00A0 However, lately I have noticed that when I SAVE a game while a ship is Either building or being rolled out of Kerbal Construction Time, my next save game load can take a LONG time.\u00A0 Once it took 45 minutes, and I only waited that long because I needed to do the dishes and I saw it happen to finish loading as I was walking back.\u00A0 Another time it took 4 hours (I got doing something else and so didn\u0027t care how long it took), but my Latest load topped them all-\u00A0 15 hours.\u00A0 Yet, this only happens half the time, the rest of the time it takes about 1 minute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMind you, this is how long it takes after I select which Save Game to load.\u00A0 So, has anyone experienced this before, and what on earth could my computer be doing for 15 hours that- when it finally finishes- the game plays\u00A0\u0022fine\u0022?\u00A0 Thanks for any input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[Likely most troublesome mod-
