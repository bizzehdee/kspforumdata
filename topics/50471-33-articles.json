Here is a summary:\u003C/strong\u003E This mod is cool because it makes good design and optimization a requirement. It makes all the advanced technology actually useful and needed, and not just a cool novelty. Realistic sizes and distances = massive required dV budget. Massive dV budget means that the weight, ISP, and thrust trade-off is no longer trivial - it is required, and of primary concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it does come with warps with much greater time compression, so that pretty much cancels out the increased travel time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe beauty of this mod, IMHO, is not the placement, but the size and distances involved. Half the fun for myself was in creating something capable. And let\u0027s be real, this doesn\u0027t require much in stock. In stock KSP, you could reach orbit with minimal effort. Just add a 1.25m fuel tank and a small motor and bam, orbital velocities. I remember in stock, I used to add extra unneeded dead weight to my rockets just so that I would need to make them bigger and more complicated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor myself, what it boils down to is this: I never had to worry about weight in stock KSP, considering how little dV was required to do pretty much everything. However, rocket science and space travel \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E all about weight, or at least it should be. This mod fixes that, and makes weight the primary concern due to the fact that a very large dV budget is required to do anything. And the larger the dV involved, the more weight becomes a serious consideration and limitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stock, I had no need for high ISP motors. Ions, nuclear - they were cool, but unneeded. This made their inclusion, as well as sacrificing thrust for ISP, pretty irrelevant. No trade off, and inconsequential design optimization= unbalanced for myself. Unbalanced quickly turned into boredom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that not everyone will share my opinion, considering that it\u0027s an opinion. I would recommend trying it out again with this in mind. It really makes everything you do so much more satisfying. Plus, those big multistage rockets are a blast to create and fly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just started a new career mode, and I love the fact that I cannot actually reach anything beyond the moon without better equipment. In stock, you could land and return from Duna with only the first few tech nodes unlocked. And a trip to Jool or Vall? Better have some seriously high ISP motors, and some seriously powerful booster motors. With the realistic sizes and distances, I actually see a future need for Kethane mining and Extraplanatary launch pads as a matter of requirement. Some of the ships I plan on building for manned interplanetary missions will require the lower gravity and lack of atmosphere just to make it into orbit. So for the first time, I actually have a need to build that Munar base and mining operation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Check out the sunrise and sunset from low kerbin orbit with this mod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S. Another example of how game-changing this mod is: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to make a low science fly-by of the sun. To my wonderful horror, I saw that I needed a dV budget of around 22,000m/s just to lower my solar Pe to below 1,000km from Earth\u0027s orbit, which is required for science. Even with the ion tech node unlocked, I did not have the higher-end energy-production nodes unlocked to actually run it. And I didn\u0027t have powerful enough lower-stage motors to put something using conventional motors with a dV budget of 22,000m/s into orbit. So instead, I built a craft capable of reaching Saturn (dres), and used a gravity assist plus the fact that a higher Ap burn will be more effective in lowering Pe. This got me the low-pass solar science I needed, and was immensely satisfying \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV optimization puzzles like this are unneeded and absent in stock, and really is only done for giggles.

In fact, stock Kerbal parts underperform relative to real-world rockets, partly in an effort by Squad to balance the game and make it challenging enough (esp. after they had made it a lot simpler by reducing the sizes of planes and giving them unrealistic densities). If you\u0027re playing stock KSP, you\u0027re probably justified in saying that MFS makes it \u0022too simple\u0022. But enter RSS. Just for a Munar orbit-and-return mission you\u0027re going to need about 14.2km/s of delta-v.
