After rebooting the PC, all engines are \u0022active\u0022 in construction scenes (VAB, SPH,) and when I load a craft for launch, it starts flipping around, as if there was trust generated by it\u0027s engines, even if they haven\u0027t been started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the screenshots, you can see that the engines are not turned on by staging, their icons dont even appear. I tried reinstalling the game, vanilla works fine, but as soon as I add my mods again, issue comes back. So, yes, its related to my mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess some plugin got corrupted, I have no idea which one. Do you guys have any idea which plugin/mod can control or alter engine behavior?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgbox.com/c0Hv3KQg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c0Hv3KQg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T02:35:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, that\u0027s unusual.
