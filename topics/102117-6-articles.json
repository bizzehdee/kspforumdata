On several occasions I\u0027ve had to \u003Cem\u003Eleave the game\u003C/em\u003E to google how some of the GUI worked. That\u0027s not the sign of a good GUI. For example, I didn\u0027t understand how some of the contract requirements worked, and couldn\u0027t figure out why I wasn\u0027t completing missions. Some terminology is foreign and never explained, like suborbital vs height requirements in the contracts. Again, I had to google it to find an explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Science. What the heck is it? Where do I get it? Science painfully trickled in until - after googling (again) - I discovered you could do other things to gain science, like right clicking the command pod and selecting \u0027Crew Report\u0027. Who knew? Not me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Tooltips. If I hover over a button with my mouse, like SAS, I\u0027d *love* if a tooltip could appear that would show you a little explanation of what it does, and maybe its hotkey. SAS? What the heck is SAS? Oh, it\u0027s stability assist, and I can turn it on and off with \u0027T\u0027. It\u0027d be really helpful if that was in the game, instead of having to search google for these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Automatic hints could go a long way to help teach players. For example, the first time the player attaches a jet engine, why not have a little popup to tell them that Jet engines will require the addition of \u0027air intake\u0027 parts to function?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has a really big learning curve, and that\u0027s ok - but players need to be given tools and help to scale that mountain.
