I think I kind of figured it out now - I can launch rockets into orbit finally - but I\u0027m still no expert on it so this is only advice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing is thrust - high TWR will simply rip your rocket to pieces as it barrels through the thick lower atmosphere. The mod author has recommended multiple times in this thread to keep that below 1.6. Personally I aim for ~ 1.2 at launch. This number then increases as the fuel burns and you get lighter, but at that point the atmosphere is less thick and the ship can handle the stress (or at least I\u0027m assuming that\u0027s what\u0027s happening). In fact by the time I am on my second stage (somewhere at 30-40km) I throttle to max with my liquid engines which are at that point something like 4\u002B TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second, and probably the biggest thing, is center of mass and center of lift! This is likely what\u0027s causing your rockets to flip over backwards and break their backs. What I have figured out is that, as a rule of thumb, you want your rockets to be top-heavy. You want your COM (center of mass), to always be above your COL (center of lift). In fact, you want your COL to be all the way back as far as you possibly can. But remember that as you drop stages and run out of fuel, the center of mass will tend to shift downards towards the heavy engines. When this passes the center of lift, this is what causes your rocket to flip backwards on itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while you are designing your rockets, check for your center of mass and center of lift on each stage, both wet AND dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly is the piloting method. Where in stock KSP you barrel straight up and then pitch over, that just will not work with FAR. For me this method works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurn off SAS (I find that it only introduces oscilations that get bigger and bigger until it rips the ship apart).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress Caps Lock key to enable fine control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost at the start of launch, pitch 5 degrees over (carefully! A single tap on the D key will be enough to start your rocket to pitch over). You will notice the rocket will try to pitch over further and you will have to fight it. Try to keep it at about 5 degrees for your initial launch. It\u0027s ok if it pitches further to about 10 or 15 degrees, but if you don\u0027t keep it under control it\u0027ll go out of control and pitch below the horizon. By the time your first stage is almost done, you will notice the rocket rapidly becomes harder to keep control of and pitch will dip to around 45 degrees. This is good, don\u0027t worry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you stage and engage your second stage, this is very important, \u003Cem\u003E stop fighting the pitch\u003C/em\u003E. If you try now to pull the pitch back you will only flip your rocket. Let it go. At this point personally I only correct pitch very very slightly so that the position marker on the nav-ball is on the left side of the prograde circle marker and stays there. The rocket will keep slowly pitching but that\u0027s ok. I\u0027ve even just completely let go of the pitch controls at this point a few times and let the thing fly itself directly into the prograde and gotten into orbit just fine as well. I only try to keep pitch up a bit higher because I use remote tech and don\u0027t want my probes to fly too far down range and out of communication before their orbital insertion manuever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it! Once you get one or two rockets into orbit it\u0027ll become just as routine and easy as stock, only more fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: random tip - I\u0027ve tried adding winglets at the bottom of my rocket to have more control, but have found them to have the opposite effect and destabilize my rocket.
