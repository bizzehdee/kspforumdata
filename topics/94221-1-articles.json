You will have to say goodbye to some of the mods you use or use a mod called \u0027Active Texture Management\u0027 alongside your current mods. If you run KSP 64-bit, its an unstable version due to the game engine KSP is built on, and its going to crash a lot, especially with mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmenia","CreatedById":83343,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T21:33:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having the same issue, but usually only after I\u0027ve been playing a few hours.
