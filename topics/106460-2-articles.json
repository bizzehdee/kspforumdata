They will suck your batteries dry though if you\u0027re not careful with the pump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that they used a closed NH3 (ammonia) coolant system to absorb and dissipate heat, gradually becoming less effective over time as it absorbs heat. To counter this, it must be pumped through the unit to cool off and restore it\u0027s effectiveness. That\u0027s the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s really happening is that I\u0027ve butchered the Heatshield ablation system and created a new resource for it. The initial idea had coolant tanks from which you had to pump coolant into the units, but it didn\u0027t make sense to have vanishing coolant (even though that\u0027s technically still happening), so I went with electric powered pumps operating on the above mentioned premise. In reality, once the units reach their ablation threshold, they are in fact consuming the NH3 resource which the \u0022pump\u0022 generates. The ablation module itself basically raises the thermal mass of the units the more resource it has available, and creates a huge internal flux that dumps the heat from the radiator. It does not directly affect the engine in this manner, only the unit itself, but it will ultimately hit a balance (still at pretty high temperatures) where the engine will lose more heat to the unit than it generates and stop heating (and possibly cool off a tiny bit), if you can maintain the proper level of NH3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere, all the dirty secrets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WoollyMittens","CreatedById":138628,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T04:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers @Randazzo, that\u0027s really helpful.
