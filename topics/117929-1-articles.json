Awesome craft, nice work with the wings and especially the tail. It\u0027s hard to get it to be rotated forward accurately.\n\nOnly thought is that it might be a tad to large. And if you rotate the side panels just a couple more degrees they will dissapear more into the intake, making it smoother.\n\nOtherwise perfect. Nice work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T13:47:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by clown\\_baby**"}]}
