Especially that 2nd stage burn halfway up the atmosphere.\n\nIf you have done the same, this graphs may be useful.\n\nI have grouped the engines into 3 groups. the 1.25m, 2.5m and 3.75m.\n\nI have choosen the most common engines.\n\n![125W.png](http://tunefix.net/img/125W.png)![125N.png](http://tunefix.net/img/125N.png)\n\n![250W.png](http://tunefix.net/img/250W.png)![250N.png](http://tunefix.net/img/250N.png)\n\n![375W.png](http://tunefix.net/img/375W.png)![375N.png](http://tunefix.net/img/375N.png)\n\n**UPDATE:** Switched atmospheric model to NASA model (80%), for more accuracy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T12:11:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 12:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northlight**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T21:12:50Z","Content":"This matches my guesstimates (I thought the 909 started beating the other low-tier engines at roughly 10km). My Mun rocket uses 4 Reliants as boosters up to about 20km, and at about 10km I kick on a central 909 (at the same time I lose 2 of the Reliants) that eventually gets me all the way to Mun.\n\nAre you going to do the same with the smaller engines?
