No one is suggesting that the \u0022Kubble Telescope\u0022 be FORCED onto every one... but if some could be inspired while they \u0022played\u0022 then that would be awesome, and it wouldn\u0027t be that hard to do. Remember also, that if a person launched the Kubble telescope and took pictures... double inspiration... in a way, these are photos they took... just like people show off their landers and rovers, so too they could be proud of the photos they \u0022took\u0022 within the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could have two options for the telescope....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could have photos automatically imported from NASA along with, if possible the data of what the photo is about etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could have it take home photos ... launch a kerbal to go to the Kubble... the EVA and start snapping photos... yeah, not much point, but might be a bit of fun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMORE.... as was suggested, we could take photos of the planets and moons of Kerbal, along with data, so they can be printed out.
