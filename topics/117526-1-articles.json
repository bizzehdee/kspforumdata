I\u0027m hoping to get some ideas for space station designs. I\u0027m realatively new to the game, but I\u0027ve figured out a lot so far. (Okay, I used lots of tutorials and the wiki to give me a boost.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the ongoing missions I\u0027m currently running in my career mode game is an orbital space station, which I\u0027m using as a \u0022gas station\u0022 as well as a staging area: I have a few ships that I simply want to live in orbit, and docked at the space station seems a natural place to keep them, and re-fuel them. Naturally I need to deliver fuel to my station with tankers from the surface too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem looks like this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/sgiwx1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sgiwx1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutlined things so others can make sense of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreen= My station at present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlues= Ships presently docked at my station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYellow= Incoming tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed dots= Docking ports in use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my standard docking proceedures, once I kill relative velocity and matched my orbit to my station, as I\u0027m approaching slowly from a few hundred meters, I switch to control my station, turn on lights and such for convenience, select \u0022control from here\u0022 on the docking port I want to use, and turn the entire station so that the crosshair is in line with the target indicator. My intended port is now facing my incoming tanker\u0027s. Makes life a lot easier if I can control the station\u0027s orientation so my tanker doesn\u0027t have to work harder, and it can deliver more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem: my station has become an absolutely uncontrollable BEAR to turn with ships semi-permanently docked to it. I HAVE to use RCS because my reaction wheels (ASAS, the one with 15 torque.) aren\u0027t cutting it. I had to shut off the docked ships\u0027 reaction wheels because they were fighting each other so badly the station would never stop wobbling and threatening to tear my ships off their docks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And of course, my station is incredibly inefficient with mono now because I hadn\u0027t bothered to line up the RCS directions at.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy major concern is the docking port as a structural weak point and the wobbling/bouncing kinda killing any attempts at re-orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I\u0027m wordy. All this to ask: does anyone have any inventive station designs that somehow balanced docked ships with center mass/means of control, so that they aren\u0027t jerked around a lot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome ideas I already had but not sure are feasible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Multi port docking. (Or Clamp-o-tron Sr. - I haven\u0027t unlocked that yet.) Pros: greater docked stability. Cons: this would add deadweight to my ships - why carry extra ports just for the time it\u0027s going to be mothballed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Inline docking. Everything that\u0027s there to stay has a docking port at either end and they dock in a gigantic pole so at least one axis (roll) remains easy, my ports for tankers can be mounted radially so that\u0027s all the rotation I\u0027d really need, let the tanker take care of the rest. Pros: simple. Cons: if I want a ship out of the middle of a pole I have to reconnect the ends, and a pole of ships is unwieldy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t leave things docked. Pros: solves the maneuverability and structural issues completely. Cons: Lot harder to manage and remember who got a fill-up and who still needs it when I launch my next tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have designs that offer more stable solutions?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T15:02:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kyrt Malthorn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T13:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe basic approach is: It\u0027s called Station, not Motion for a reason.

I only know that they sometimes do it, when undocking a craft, so that it is facing retrograde or prograde. The undocking mechanism includes an elastic spring which pushes the craft away. When the craft is facing prograde it will end up in a slightly higher orbit, when facing retrograde in a slightly lower orbit. They wait until they\u0027re far enough away from the ISS until they use the thrusters of the craft again. This way they ensure that the ISS doesn\u0027t get \u0022dirty\u0022 by rocket exhaust.
