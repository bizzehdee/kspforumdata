We can currently set a lot of options in the career mode. When you start giving the features more depth, you might need to work on the balance instead letting players tweak things in career mode. (Think of the new player that has no idea what the importance of science returns is.) This tweaking of balance will quickly result in another update or two (depending on the internal testing before releasing.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s almost ready, but I don\u0027t think that the next release will be the one. probably atleast 1 or 2 more released would be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat reviewers think of the game?... I don\u0027t care, I\u0027ve already bought it, I\u0027m have my own opinion, don\u0027t need someone else\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat poor reviews would mean to squad (revenue) I don\u0027t know, bluntly... that\u0027s their problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat 1.0 could mean for me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery update I start a new career mode, finish it and start a more difficult career. I (nearly) finish that one and loose interest in the game until next update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0 suggests the next updates could be just maintenance... so it might not pull me back into the game. Having played out career on 1.0 means I\u0027m done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be back when we get close to 2.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short I\u0027m happy with the state KSP is in right now, I don\u0027t care about a alpha, beta, released label. I would not call it a finished product yet, but if Squad wants to but promises to keep up the good work that\u0027s fine with me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T12:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022running\u0022 data-cite=\u0022running\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen compared to other games that were 1.0 where I payed full price for....
