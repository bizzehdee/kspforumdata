I didn\u0027t have any asymmetries in the design, but when I checked their thrust during flight, while it was the same between them, the left one was producing less electricity, so I\u0027m assuming its thrust was more unstable.\n\nI added more intakes and it pushes the problem further into the future, but it always ends up happening. I\u0027ve added the extra engine cooler intake at the rear, before the ramjets and have tried with 3-4 radial intakes per engine but the issue still occurs at both low and high altitudes.\n\nIs this a bug or am I misusing the bicoupler? I haven\u0027t had the same problem with multiple ramjets on other craft.\n\nHere\u0027s an example of a craft that had this issue:\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438080906](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438080906)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T18:56:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MechaLynx**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:53:35Z","Content":"I know that in 0.90 there was always an issue with asymmetrical air flow to jet engines. Even if you have two engines and two intakes, the intake air was not necessarily divided evenly between them. The manual workaround was to place the intakes meant for one engine, place that engine, then place the intakes meant for the next engine, then place the engine, so on and so forth. \n\nThere is a mod out there that balances it for you, but I cannot recall what it was.

I made a craft with this approach and it didnt suffer any yaw instabilities, then went back and replaced half the parts with symmetry from the others and once air started to get a bit sparse it started yawing to the left again. Strangely, the effect was nowhere near as pronounced with this craft than with others I\u0027ve made, but at least it seems to be under control for now. I\u0027m marking this as Answered for the time being. Thanks ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
