I didn\u0027t have any asymmetries in the design, but when I checked their thrust during flight, while it was the same between them, the left one was producing less electricity, so I\u0027m assuming its thrust was more unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added more intakes and it pushes the problem further into the future, but it always ends up happening. I\u0027ve added the extra engine cooler intake at the rear, before the ramjets and have tried with 3-4 radial intakes per engine but the issue still occurs at both low and high altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a bug or am I misusing the bicoupler?

I made a craft with this approach and it didnt suffer any yaw instabilities, then went back and replaced half the parts with symmetry from the others and once air started to get a bit sparse it started yawing to the left again. Strangely, the effect was nowhere near as pronounced with this craft than with others I\u0027ve made, but at least it seems to be under control for now. I\u0027m marking this as Answered for the time being.
