We landed the moon missions of all things within 5 miles of target.

There are currently no shuttle or SLS boosters being launched, and nothing forbids them from being launched elsewhere. If you want it to be part of the answer, it should be part of the question.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You are seriously under estimating how difficult it would be to hit a target with an srb using a parachute.\n\nI am not saying it will not be hard, I am saying that it is not impossible to get a reasonable amount of control. Especially feathering before touchdown should be very possible, though mattress style controlled parachutes should be viable too. Our understanding of the aerodynamics involved and computational power have both increased since the days of STS.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T04:16:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 04:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha**"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T04:57:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Besides, SRB\u0027s are cheap because they are simple. The minute you start adding requirements you might as well stop using an SRB and move to something more versatile like a liquid booster.\n\nIndeed. The value of the SRB is derived in large part from the fact that, basically, you can get it ready, and leave it with minimal maintainance (for a massive explosive) for long durations. Trying carefully to land it would be a challenge, and would certainly add many parts that need to be maintained (in the STS scenario, adding complexity to an already exceedingly complex vehicle). But I agree with Camcha. Difficult? Yes, it would be a huge challenge, but certainly possible. \n\n@Requia, we landed on the Moon very well, indeed. But that is very different. There is no wind, so courses can be plotted very accuratley, and there is a throttle and an engine. The SRB will be falling unpowered, perhaps a few motors holding fins and chutes, or jets to direct itself. The bulk of the energy from falling will be absorbed not by directly controlled rockets, but by not always that predictable wind. Launch days are good weather days, but that does not mean things will be at all comprable."},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T08:08:08Z","Content":"The problem with reusing SRBs is that you are only reusing steel casings, in the end. The really complicated part of a solid motor is the engine casting (think firecracker, but with a *very* precise shape and composition in the propellant to control thrust and burn rate). Casting those things takes time, expertise, and expensive tooling, that\u0027s why reusing a SRB costs pretty much the same as building another one, high strength steel is pretty cheap to buy and machine into the casing.\n\nRune.
