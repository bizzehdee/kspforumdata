The value of the SRB is derived in large part from the fact that, basically, you can get it ready, and leave it with minimal maintainance (for a massive explosive) for long durations. Trying carefully to land it would be a challenge, and would certainly add many parts that need to be maintained (in the STS scenario, adding complexity to an already exceedingly complex vehicle). But I agree with Camcha. Difficult? Yes, it would be a huge challenge, but certainly possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Requia, we landed on the Moon very well, indeed. But that is very different. There is no wind, so courses can be plotted very accuratley, and there is a throttle and an engine. The SRB will be falling unpowered, perhaps a few motors holding fins and chutes, or jets to direct itself. The bulk of the energy from falling will be absorbed not by directly controlled rockets, but by not always that predictable wind. Launch days are good weather days, but that does not mean things will be at all comprable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T08:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with reusing SRBs is that you are only reusing steel casings, in the end.
