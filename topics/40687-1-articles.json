I\u0027ve figured that the NERVA is the best exoatmospheric engine in terms of fuel efficiency, but I\u0027m having trouble getting my stuff into orbit without it either falling apart or burning so much fuel on the ascent that by the time I\u0027m up, all of the fuel I was planning to use for transfers ends up getting used for establishing orbit. I use asparagus staging, but I\u0027m having a lot of difficulty getting clustering working without my lifters either flying apart in midair from floppiness and/or flipping all over the place because they\u0027re unbalanced in spite of what the CM and CT show in the VAB. I\u0027ve tried using MechJeb, but it doesn\u0027t seem to handle asparagus staging - the discards seem to impact the rest of the rocket about 80% of the time, and the whole thing wobbles like a fnoodle in a hurricane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any good tutorials out there for the current build that take the reaction wheels into account and might give some good pointers on design?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RadiatorArray","CreatedById":51694,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T22:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart off simple - stack staging, boosters, etc. Asparagus is a more advanced technique, so I suggest against it if you\u0027re just starting out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quad coupled LV-30 main stage and a LV-45 secondary, followed by a final orbital tug LV-909 or NERVA should get you into a successful orbit, assuming you\u0027re using the secondary to grav turn as opposed to using the first (heavier payloads may require more than just this. A successful design I\u0027ve been using for the past week is 8x3 large boosters with the large radial decouplers \u002B a Mainsail first stage (remember to activate the boosters, decouple when dry, and use this stage for the push into space!!), then an orbital tug secondary, plus a final bonus manouver stage and capsule decoupling stage if you feel like heading back home).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, remember!
