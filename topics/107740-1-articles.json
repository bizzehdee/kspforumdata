It seems if you do something incredibly stupid, like say placing Jool 400km from Kerbin, it... well, it destroys Kerbin. You end up with that exact screen, and the map will show your craft in orbit around Jool, and staging doesn\u0027t work.

Loading a quicksave from a couple minutes prior does nothing, neither does trying to switch camera back to the craft with the pilot. Game restart and resume lets me see the Kerbin base just fine, but if I try to take command of the minmus expedition, the glitch resumes.\n\nDecided to make new support post.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T13:30:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 01:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pgiustino**\n  \nDecided to make new support post"},{"CreatedByName":"nfpinto","CreatedById":143049,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T16:07:33Z","Content":"same problem here [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123283-Galactic-Black-Screen](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123283-Galactic-Black-Screen)\n\nany help would be apreciated"},{"CreatedByName":"Komander Faul","CreatedById":161462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T07:00:06Z","Content":"![watch?v=iZ-6sPGtNBs\u0026feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ-6sPGtNBs\u0026feature=youtu.be)\n\ni have the same problem on 1.0.5....idk if its the mods that im using, or the updater that i use (CKAN) i use warships (especially BBs) and weapons a lot, so i hope that is not a problem...\n\ni use these following parts:\n\n1. submarine systems\n\n2. ww2warships\n\n3. largeboatpack\n\n4. nas\n\n5. ksp boat parts\n\n6. pew (pormethium experimental weapons)\n\n7.
