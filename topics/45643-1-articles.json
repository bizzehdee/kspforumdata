I\u0027ll add one point - it\u0027s a LOT easier to set up a rendezvous and docking by launching the two vehicles into the same plane, or at least very close to the same plane, to begin with. As noted above, plane change maneuvers take a lot of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v and hence a lot of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside, I\u0027ll note that avoiding large plane changes is the main reason why most real-world missions have limited launch windows; they cannot afford the hit to mission performance needed to make very large plane changes.

Check your nodes during your ascent as often as you can; steer slightly northward or southward of 090 to adjust the nodes as necessary. I also find that waiting until the target is 450,000 m downrange of KSC before launching really shortens the time it takes to rendezvous; I can usually affect a rendezvous within an orbit or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay - so one more time:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Launch with the target 450,000 m downrange of KSC. Put your apoapsis as close to the altitude of the target as you can. Fly north or south of 090 \u003Cem\u003Eslightly\u003C/em\u003E to minimize the degree of the ascending/descending node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Watch the encounter chevrons when you\u0027re setting up your maneuver node for orbital insertion. If you can get a close encounter, great, but make sure your apses are both out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Zero out the nodes. This means a burn to the north at the descending node or to the south at the ascending node. Go slow if you\u0027re on LOX - a single notch on the throttle is often a bit too much. If you can\u0027t zero it out in one go, go as low as you can, stop and try again at the next node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Set up a maneuver node at the next apsis. Dink with the prograde vector and watch the encounter chevrons. If the distance decreases, keep pulling on it until it increases again. If it increases, stop pulling on it and start yanking on the retrograde vector. Get the distance as low as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Set up another maneuver node at the next apsis and repeat #4. Expect lesser results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5A) If playing around with a maneuver node at the next apsis doesn\u0027t generate appreciable results, try a maneuver node somewhere between the apses.

Note that this is NOT the most fuel efficient way to do it, just the easiest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. For this training purpose, put a vessel into a 100x100 km orbit (i.e. a circular orbit at about 100km), this will be our \u0022passive\u0022 vessel (the one we dock to). Try to make it fly roughly towards 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, i.e. around the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Launch the second vessel (the \u0022active\u0022 one) when the other one flies above the peninsula west of the continent the KSP is on, also towards 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, i.e. towards the east. Make sure this vessel has RCS and quite a bit of surplus fuel. Get it to an orbit of about 110x80km (i.e. apogee 110,000, perigee 80,000).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Click on the \u0022passive\u0022 vessel and set it as target. A few new markers will appear. Two green markers labeled \u0022AN\u0022 and \u0022DN\u0022, and two orange and two red markers. \u0022AN\u0022 and \u0022DN\u0022 is where the crafts intersect in the horizontal plane (i.e. when they switch sides from left to right), the other markers are where the crafts intersect at the vertical plane (i.e. where they switch their \u0022above\u0022 and \u0022below\u0022 positions), with the two markers representing how far the crafts are apart when this change happens. The dotted line is where the target will be when the active one is at the other marker. Don\u0027t worry if you don\u0027t get that right away, we\u0027ll get to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Wait for your craft to get close to the next \u0022AN\u0022 or \u0022DN\u0022 marker, and while you do, align the ship. If you\u0027re getting close to DN, aim towards 0 degrees (always at the horizont, i.e. where the navball\u0027s blue and orange parts meet, essentially aim your craft towards the north pole and keep it horizontal towards the planet, not pointing \u0022up\u0022 or \u0022down\u0022). If you\u0027re approaching AN instead, aim towards 180 degrees. When you\u0027re close to getting there, gently accelerate. If you mouse over the marker, you\u0027ll get a number that represents your orbits\u0027 separation. The closer this gets to 0, the less thrust you should apply. When you\u0027re at 0.3 or below, you\u0027re good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Wait for the craft to fly past the next \u0022solid\u0022 red or orange marker. I.e. the one where there isn\u0027t a dotted line towards the planet. You\u0027ll notice that when your craft passes that marker, the target ship will be at the \u0022dotted\u0022 marker. When your craft passes the non-dotted marker, you will notice that the dotted marker moves to a new location. This is where your target will be the next time your active ship passes the marker you just passed. Now it\u0027s time to adjust the orbit to match up. If the dotted marker (i.e. your target ship) is AHEAD of you, point your active ship RETROGRADE (i.e. against your flight path), if it is BEHIND you, point it PROGRADE. Yes, that means you slow down to catch up and you throttle up to fall back. Orbital mechanics at work, they make sense once you wrap your mind around it. To make it easier, click on the number above your artificial horizon until the word \u0022orbit\u0022 appears, then point to the normal green marker on the artificial horizon to point your ship prograde, or the crossed out green marker to point it retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Look at the map, mouse over the marker you just passed (the solid red or orange one) and carefully throttle up. You will notice that the number next to \u0022separation\u0022 gets smaller. If it does not, turn your ship around and thrust in that direction instead. You want to get that number down to about 0.4km (400m) or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Time warp until you\u0027ve gone almost once again around the planet (i.e. until you\u0027re approaching that marker again), mouse over the marker and stop time acceleration once separation reads less than 2000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Click on the number on the artificial horizon again until it reads \u0022target\u0022 and point your craft towards the crossed out green marker. Look around, the target should be close (watch out, you might well hit it at some speed...). Thrusting towards the crossed out green marker on the artificial horizon while it reads \u0022target\u0022 will reduce your speed relative to your target. Once it reads 0.0 (or close to it, it\u0027s kinda hard to get right TO 0.0), you\u0027re \u0022standing still\u0022 relative to the target craft (although both you and your target zip around the planet at about 2.5km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf everything worked out, you should be about 300m or so from your target. Now throttle up carefully towards the target, wait until you get close enough to see that docking port, point to the crossed out green marker again and zero the relative speed, then it\u0027s time to switch to the docking view and do the final approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-12T05:14:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2013 05:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ivan Ivanovich\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
