Currently a customer randomly walks in\u00A0with their desired plan and bunch of money, you\u0027ll accept it or don\u0027t. You\u0027ll have no control over their will, you can\u0027t control when they come or how many of them come. This makes anything with more than 5 seats not worth it, as they\u0027ll fly empty most of the time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m proposing is to have feature implemented so we could, as service providers, offer a package deal with a price we could set by ourselves. Higher\u00A0to make more profits or lower to get more demand. This would make larger passenger spacecraft and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s desirable, as well as it could\u00A0incentivize building and launching space liners, stations, hotels\u00A0and other related infrastructure to support space tourism. This would make Mk.3 passenger module properly useful. This would move KSP from where we\u0027re now in reality with dawn of space tourism to age of actual space tourism where space travel and tourism are\u00A0common things.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSlightly related cool pic of Rockwell\u0027s concept\u00A0to make this post little more interesting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022the_space_tourist.15.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/images/the_space_tourist.15.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T09:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to offer a simpler solution to get us to design large space planes and SSTOs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe just need a new type of mission, in which we get a much larger group of tourists that all want to go to a single destination. The idea behind it is that one of the agencies now acts like a tourist agency, and did all the work to get that group of tourists for us. My version lacks certain economic strategic features that your idea did have (i.e. setting the price to get a certain amount of tourists), but it is far more likely to be implemented because it\u0027s much less coding for the developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI probably share your frustration with tourist missions in which 5 tourists all want to fly to completely different destinations.
