I decided to forget about him and switch back to the vessel and maybe he would come loose, but the vessel switching command didn\u0027t work, so I was stuck with Jebediah kerman. I had to leave and go back to the space station, and go into Tracking Station and chose my vessel from the list to fly it. I have to do this every time I want to switch from a kerbal to a vessel. It\u0027s rather annoying and really complicates my missions. I\u0027ve never had this problem on the PC version so I assume it is console specific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
