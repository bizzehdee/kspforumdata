Think about what kinds of jobs you\u0027ll be able to get \u0026 look up how much they pay.\n\nI wasn\u0027t hoping that people would do the research for me. In the OP, I asked that if students/alumni and teachers especially had any info to give me about their school, I\u0027d like to hear it. I\u0027ve been doing my own research (I just visited Penn State and Pitt), but there are things that the admissions department won\u0027t tell you, like that Pitt cut a lot of funding in the Humanities Department last year (I learned that in the Pitt student paper).\n\nI certainly agree that this is a huge decision, perhaps the biggest in my life so far.\n\nSo, to recap, I want to narrow my the list down and hear from forum-goers who have experience with any of the colleges on my list."}]}
