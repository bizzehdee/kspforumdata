It was too easy. admittedly reaching the Mun was troubling though. I\u0027d have to say rather than make it easier, simply give us more things to do. if we are forced to spend more time on the early game, that\u0027s fine, as long as the options are diverse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Will86c","CreatedById":52346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T01:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think having more things to do would be the best option here. You pretty much exhaust all the science points in your first couple orbits around the mun and kerbal.

Kerbin, for instance, has a lot of biomes. Each EVA report is relevant to a specific biome, so if you get into orbit around kerbin you can take an EVA report over the desert, another one over the water, etc, and store *all of them* in the command pod.
