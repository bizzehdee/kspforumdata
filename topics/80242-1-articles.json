I didn\u0027t feel like reading an entire 59 page PDF about it, but I\u0027m starting to wonder which path would take more delta-V, the one through the atmosphere or the one that needs to get all the way into space. Of course, the Kerbal aerodynamic model makes it quite a bit different too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think the reason KSP players would be familiar is because suborbital hops on planets without atmosphere tend to have a lower apoapsis because there\u0027s nothing to slow you down, so making a high arc trajectory is just a waste of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"saabstory88","CreatedById":110598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T00:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw this, and realized there is an objective answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETim must be the author of the letter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe letter must arrive in his mothers hands in New Jersey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe letter must be handwritten by a person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method will allow for a total delivery time which can be less than 5 minutes, and use only items which the average person has available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETim picks up the phone, and calls his mother.
