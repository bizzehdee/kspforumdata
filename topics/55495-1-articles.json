Example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOften times when players want to attach a rover to their landing rocket, they\u0027ll attach one radially and use a fuel tank on the opposite side to balance it out. A ballast part could be used instead. Or it could be useful in adjusting the centre of mass on aircraft. Or for keeping the center of mass low on rovers (prevent tipping). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the aerodynamic model is revamped, ballast could be used for steering of lifting bodies.

It\u0027d be nice on any of the many missions I fly where a small weight difference doesn\u0027t matter much. Also, I can\u0027t find a dense enough material to weigh my planes down in front. The mass always seems to center at the back while the lift centers toward the front even though they\u0027re built with almost all of th elifting surface in the back. I don\u0027t understand why they do that, but it\u0027s really annoying and I\u0027d love to have something denser than RCS tanks to put in the front to weigh it down without taking up a lot of valuable attachment space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"404james","CreatedById":20023,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T19:03:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis could be even better with the coming tweakable parts, so you could specifically tune your ballast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BoJaN","CreatedById":28739,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T04:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA ballast with automatic weight shifting would be great.
