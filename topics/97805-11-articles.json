With stock lego tanks, you either have a few hundred m/s of delta v over what you need, or a few under, rarely the exact amount number. Procedural parts let you get the exact amount of delta v you need in order to complete your mission. This means you have to carefully plan your launch windows, burn at the exact heading and time, and be sure to not screw anything up. Once I overshot a burn to the Moon in RSS with Procedural tanks meaning that I had just enough delta v to get there and circularize, and I had to start dumping hydrazine that I wouldn\u0027t need in order to increase my delta v, meaning that I had even more limited maneuvering capability.

But the lego blocks are what it\u0027s gone with, and I think a major change in how you build rockets is too much for 1.0. Even perhaps something better for a KSP 2, that might then include more sophisticated considerations than having parts be perfect rigid bodies.

Are you aware that every carrier rocket on the planet has been specially built for a specific purpose? Engineers at NASA, ESA, or POCKOCMOC have never pulled pre-built tanks off the shelves, stacked them on top of one-another, slapped an engine on the bottom, and launched to space. Each rocket had a payload in mind (or a mass, width, and length), was built to specific specifications, a fairing (or three) was designed that fit the upper stage, and an engine was probably designed for that rocket unless one already fit the bill (actually a fairly rare occurrence IRL, judging from the sheer number of rocket engines that exist). Each stage would have a single large tank for each propellant needed for the stage engine encased in a structural shell.\u003Cp\u003EKSP employs a useful abstraction in stacking parts but there is nothing wrong with using a single tank part to create your rocket stage. In fact, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Emore realistic\u003C/em\u003E and much, \u003Cem\u003Emuch better\u003C/em\u003E for performance. Certainly in career there should be certain limits to width and length of tanks in order to provide a progression, and Procedural Tanks does this, but why constrain the sandbox players? Not to mention that part counts in a game with memory leaks and bad GUI design on an overloaded parts selection windows is actually a really big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, if you\u0027re still not convinced, check out \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ltas-vis.ulg.ac.be/cmsms/uploads/File/DataSheetSolidATK.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EATK\u0027s SRM Catalog\u003C/a\u003E.
