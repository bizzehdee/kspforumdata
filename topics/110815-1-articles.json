Awesome game !\n\nI purchased the game recently and got to play a lot with it, visited some planets and moons, and became a pro at rendezvous (Back when using the early access alpha, i didn\u0027t understand rendezvous that much).\n\nAlso, i don\u0027t like mods, so my experience is limited to the stock game.\n\nThe new vector i\u0027m proposing has to do with rendezvous, but has ulterior utilisations wich i may go into later.\n\nWhen doing a rendez-vous, on the final approach, corrections must be continually made by using RCS translation, to keep your prograde vector on top of the target vector.\n\nHowever, sometimes you forget to put RCS on your ship and you\u0027re dead in the water, mostly unable to dock (or rather, having great difficulty to do it.)\n\nWhenever docking with no RCS, i imagine a point that is in a position such that the target vector is in the middle between the prograde and the new (imaginary) vector, when navball is set to \u0022target\u0022.When firing at that imaginary vector, the prograde vector is moved on top of the target vector and velocity to target increases, but i\u0027m headed directly for the target ship without drifting to the side.Then, i turn around retrograde and match velocities on the last stretch, switch to the target evssel to rotate it facing a docking port towards my RCS-less ship and Voila - i\u0027m docked.\n\nProblem is, there\u0027s a lot of guess work and my imaginary vector isn\u0027t actually shown on the navball.\n\nMy suggestion is the implementation of this vector, and make it trackable by probe cores / \u0022Fly-by-wire\u0022 hubs.\n\nNow on to Alternative uses : STOCK PARTS HOMING MISSILES !! \u003C- I rest my case ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:04:57Z","Content":"just... just use RCS ? I think that not being able to dock without RCS (or having a very hard time doing it) is actually a good and interesting feature\n\nWelcome to the forums by the way !"},{"CreatedByName":"mitko","CreatedById":137288,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T00:10:15Z","Content":"If I were to suggest a new navball symbol it would be one that is opposite of the active navigation mark so that we can see where it is when we are landing on it."},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T03:54:50Z","Content":"I can think of only 2 things we need on the navball:\n\n- Docking port orientation on the navball, pretty much just navball docking port allignment indicator mod.\n- A \u0022Hairline\u0022 overlayed on the navball; of which connects Target/Prograde and Anti-target/Retrograde; it should swap colors when halfway around, denoting retrograde.
