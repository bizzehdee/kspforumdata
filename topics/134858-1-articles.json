Whenever I go interplanetary, for example on my last Duna mission, I can never get the encounter down below about 25000km. I pack Delta-V to compensate for this, but it\u0027s annoying how elliptical my initial orbits end up being. Any tips on how to cut down distance on interplanetary encounters?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodari","CreatedById":157578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T15:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have your initial encounter, try doing very small maneuvers in each direction(prograde, retrograde, normal/anti-normal, radial/anti-radial) and keep adjusting until you get closer.\u00A0 If you still can\u0027t get close enoguh, try again a bit later on your approach to the planet when you\u0027re coming from a different angle and see if that helps.\u00A0 Also, you can set the target planet as focus and zoom in on that planet in the map view to see exactly what your encounter path will be, then use that to help you adjust it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T15:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, did you left Kerbin LKO at the correct window (as described here : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E) ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSet Duna as \u0022target\u0022 to ease encounter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you need to be gentle on your transfer orbit to Mars orbit (don\u0027t cross orbits).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should alway encounter your target on the other side of the Sun (or other central body).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your Duna orbit is not good enough, no problem, do a small course correction burn (preferably at AN/DN if you can).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would recommend using some user-friendly node tweaking tool mod (such as \u0022Precise Node\u0022, or MechJeb \u0022Node Editor\u0022 feature)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T17:18:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to the above comments:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- there is no point making any adjustment in the normal/antinormal directions as you leave Kerbin. The destination is on the far side of your orbit, so normal and antinormal will merely twist your point of arrival. At most, if you aren\u0027t doing a perfect transfer (i.e. you are not meeting the planet directly opposite, but looping around the other side of its orbit) you will be able to make a difference but at the cost of huge amounts of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- heading outwards from the sun (such as to Duna) adjustments get cheaper after the half-way mark. The reverse is true if you\u0027re going inwards. So drop your adjustment maneuvre node somewhere in the halfway to three-quarters-way mark, preferably on AN/DN or as close as you can get to it (without getting too close to your destination though), focus on duna, turn the map around so you can click on the maneuvre node again and play around with the sliders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- prograde/retrograde and radial in/out are quite closely coupled. You\u0027ll find that a small adjustment to one of the pairs gives much the same result as a larger change to the other pair. What is different between the two sorts of adjustment, though, is the change it has on your time of arrival. You can use this to catch (or miss) Ike at exactly the right point in its orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T18:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmove your burn node forwards and backwards slightly as ejection angle is very important\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-25T18:00:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2016 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Nich\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
