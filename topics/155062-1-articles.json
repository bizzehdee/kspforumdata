What I\u0027ve been trying to do is create a soundtrack of sorts for each planet\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E (possibly excluding moons) just for me and whoever wants fitting music to listen to. The primary challenge I face is to compose unique, extended themes without having them be tiresome or repetitive. The lesser challenge is that my only musical software is Musescore, which means no mix tracks or smooth gradients of pitches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance I want Jool to have a grand brassy chorus in the key of C and Eve to have an orchestral section in the key of Bb. Even if the unique theme idea isn\u0027t entirely fitting, then at least the existing space theme could be slightly modified to add a fresh twist. I\u0027m an amateur composer and I\u0027m still learning how to be more patient with myself while making music.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI attached something I made in around an hour or two of being creative. A musical doodle if you will. Does anyone have any ideas? Any composers I can connect with?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7se1Lc0vwwmMmpYZjhJbXpBTkk/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7se1Lc0vwwmMmpYZjhJbXpBTkk/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-15T22:51:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2017 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Atubara\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
