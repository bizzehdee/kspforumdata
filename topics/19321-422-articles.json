In addition, backwards-swept wings also increase the dihedral effect; the strongest effect is from wings mounted on top of the plane, with a positive dihedral angle and lots of reward sweep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Dihedral angle alone will not cause pitch issues. It can, however cause pitch issues in conjunction with a lack of yaw stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, assuming your vehicle is actually stable in pitch to begin with (if it\u0027s not, move the wings backward or the CoM forward), there is a way that inertial coupling can cause yaw / roll behavior to make pitching a problem. This is a function of how lift changes as a function of Mach number at near 0 AoA and how lift reacts to changes in sweep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first problem is that as Mach number increases, wings near 0 AoA become less effective at producing lift. This has the effect of dropping yaw stability, sometimes enough to make the vehicle unstable in yaw. The second problem is that at higher sweep angles (note: relative to the airflow), wings create less lift if they\u0027re kept at the same AoA; this is why a 737 needs less AoA to take off than the Concorde did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, taking a wild stab in the dark, this problem showed up in the upper atmosphere, with you at a high AoA and high Mach number. That would lead to the yaw stability of the vehicle dropping a lot. So it starts to sideslip to the right a bit... and suddenly, the left wing is at a lower sweep angle (more straight-on to the airflow) than the right wing is; the left wing makes more lift than the right wing. It starts to roll to the right under this force, and rather violently because it was at a high AoA to start with, so a relatively large change in lift between the wings. So now, sideslip (remember, this is all relative to the vehicle) decreases, and then starts to increase in the opposite direction as it overshoots. Meanwhile, AoA starts to decrease, but the trim level compensates to start bringing the plane back to that AoA, but that overshoots too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, if you\u0027re lucky the phenomena you\u0027re experiencing (wing rock) is damped enough to not destroy the vehicle and you have the sense to bring it back under control by finding an orientation that brings the sideslip angle to 0. And then you fly at a lower AoA, or add more vertical tail. Or more lever arm for vertical tail to act over by moving the tail back or the CoM forward. This issue really only occurs between Mach 2 - 7, above that the effects of sweep on wing lift are much less important so there\u0027s no forcing, but at KSP speeds, this can be a real problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T11:40:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis heating bug is sure annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday my space stations power module lost a couple of batteries, lights and solar panels due to a spontaneously exploding strut connector\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhile I was doing Stuff at some other module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeinstalling FAR until this is fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf octagonal struty on my rocket explode during ascent, I can handle it by changing the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if existing crafts that are already in space get damaged randomly, it\u0027s not bearable for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward for the next release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T12:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, there are a few points to make here.\u003Cp\u003E1) Dihedral wings do make the plane more stable in roll, but mounting them lower on the vehicle makes them unstable.

I have since stopped clipping certain parts into each other and it quit happening. The biggest problem child was BDArmory pylons, I like to place them in bundles of 3 so I can mount things in threes like real pylons under some aircraft. Well FAR/KSP does not like that so they randomly overheat and explode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I dont think the problem is FAR problem as much as a stock KSP problem currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still routinely getting phantom overheats on small parts in cargo bays, no clipping involved.
