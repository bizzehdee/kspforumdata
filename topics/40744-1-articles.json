That last one I find is what makes this very hard lol. Im doing this Apollo style with a CM orbiter and I need this LM to be able to return to the CM where it will then be ditched.. sadly. ( Once that gets built ) So im just building and testing ideas for a good ascent craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont do orbital construction. So to get this behemoth into orbit once its done I will need a very large rocket. My goal is to make each stage as small and compact as possible to ease this process. Heres what ive been playing with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/576744651201824921/5A609E4DE92BE0CA3EAF8E038C1393AE97CBD09F/\u0022 alt=\u00225A609E4DE92BE0CA3EAF8E038C1393AE97CBD09F\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm using various mods. KW, Nova ( the radial SRB\u0027s and tiny decouplers ) Home ( small radial ascent engines ) B9 for their flat mono tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parachutes decouple off the top after landing. On take off the legs detach and the twelve SRB\u0027s fire getting the craft up to about 3,500m before they decouple and the radial engines fire. At this point the craft possesses 2,500 Dv and gets up to about 30,000m. Im testing on this on Kerbin so I figure if it can be done on Kerbin it can be done on Laythe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat im looking for is input on the ascent stage. Is there a way I can do this more efficiently and retain a compact design? And one that\u0027s less crashy maybe.. for some reason my game likes to crash on the surface of Kerbin and I suspect the SRB\u0027s to be the culprit. So they may have to go. That may mean back to the drawling board which brings me here. I need to get to a circular 65km orbit and have enough fuel to put around for a rendezvous. Heres another pic of the descent stage. Subject to change, but it works for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/576744651201823207/D3E22EF1EC8520650E82A90F758F6470D617AA45/\u0022 alt=\u0022D3E22EF1EC8520650E82A90F758F6470D617AA45\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-03T00:48:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2013 12:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlmarti","CreatedById":70037,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T00:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know enough about the parts you are using, to understand their pros/cons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you checked it out on Engineer Redux, then it should work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T01:23:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, if you\u0027re going for smallest possible, 3 command chairs on an I-beam is pretty hard to beat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T01:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell how would you do it?

There is no way you need all those radial engines (though it is a very pretty ship set up this way). Radials, are less efficient than their stack-mounted counterparts. You could cluster an LV-T45 (or better yet, a 909) and some aerospikes to get an almost-SSTO on Kerbin and a true SSTO on Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E after copying your clever aesthetics, I got 2917 m/s (and a very high TWR--if you sacrifice aesthetics you could get more, but powering through your ascent reduces gravity losses) with 6 T-400s, and 1 x200 with 6 aerospikes and 1 909 for orbital manuvers.
