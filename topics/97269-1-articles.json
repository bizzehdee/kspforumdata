I could then finally track charge in things which don\u0027t expose any methods to query changes. My question is, has anyone tried doing this or similar? Would putting overrides for the 6 RequestResource variants into a class and tacking them onto parts which use charge (via AddModule) work? Or would the overrides only function via the module they were added as?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the idea is to tack an API of sorts onto things using charge so I can track what is being used or generated and by what. Saving effort writing pull requests for mods and nagging Squad to add methods to things like reaction wheels or the lab.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T16:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERequestResource is a method native to the Part class.
