A compilation of the lowest drag parts [only necessary], enough fuel, and perfect balancing as well as flying, can make the RAPIER achieve a maximum speed of 2197.5 m/s. This assumes more than perfect piloting, as well as finding a way to make it take off and get up there. It would also be super hard because the whole thing would be incredibly sensitive to applied lift forces, and a single millionth of a degree off will cause the whole thing to flop around like a crazy floppy thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: This is also assuming optimal ascent path that equates to a distance slightly less than the required distance, but the times would balance out.
