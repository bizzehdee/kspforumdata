Every craft flown, every craft landed (all but one of them on the VAB helipad). Most of them even landed with the same number of parts as they begun with and with only a couple of uses of the f9 key all pilots survived. That I, with the aeronautical ability of a goldfish (and memory to boot), could happily fly all these is testament to the strength of design on offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts below. Before I start let me re-iterate that these were some simply excellent ships. As a result the only distinguishers are minor and petty failings or personal foibles - and as a further result these thoughts may come across as overly negative.

Flight time felt low but that likely to be an illusion afforded by poor frame rate and hence controlability on my modest PC as by the numbers it should have a good three minutes in the air. Good survivability though, the closest I got was a glancing blow to the VAB which deposited our plucky test pilot back on Kerba-Firma missing a great many panels but alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPDCWolf - RocketPower VTOL2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStays true to the original and as a result perhaps feels most \u0022stock\u0022. Genuine improvement on original in a number of areas, but retains some of originals flaws - no ladder! Feels, like the original, a bit overly symmetrical. Initial TWR just a teensy bit under 1, requiring a couple of teaspoons of fuel to be burnt before liftoff. Perhaps could have done with a little bit more SAS as not sure RCS alone quite cut it and a vertical navball option would have been nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERavenchant - Pack Mule\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery solid entry.

That writeup sounds overly negative but is not meant to be, I see this as a very strong contender. Only minor quibbles would be Jeb\u0027s entry and egress of the craft can be a bit fiddly and the drop tanks can struggle to drop if the craft is climbing at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESaplingPick - Leapfrog\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s true. I do love turtles. Achieves a unique look without turning into a multi-hundred part monster. Centre of thrust slightly off from centre of mass although that\u0027s easily compensated for by multitude of (perhaps slightly spammy) SAS modules making this a supremely easy craft to fly. I really do love turtles. Perhaps an extra thirty seconds or so of flight time wouldn\u0027t go amiss, and maybe change the cockpit for one with a better IVA view, but I really do love turtles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpartwo - Tern\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad to rearrange staging order to launch without firing off missile compliment(!) and get the LV909 (clipped inside a jet engine) to fire prior to landing gantry.

Description field, parachute/abort system, some means for pilot to get in/out, and a vertical navball option would have been appreciated.

One minute, 23 second max throttle flight time on the slightly skimpy side although as with stock and all other entrants in practice this is likely to near double as throttle is feathered.

When is a lander a VTOL? Technically the two definitions are identical but in my gut this feels like any other lander rather than a VTOL craft. As a lander it\u0027s fine, it\u0027s perfectly capable of landing on the Mun, taking off, and returning safely to Kerbin. As a VTOL it\u0027s capable, easy to fly, simple \u0026amp; sturdy. Would note lack of ladder and inability of 48-7S engine choice to generate electricity makes solar panels insufficient for night time operation, esp coupled with limited battery life on offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESploden - RocketChair\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuffers from same is it a VTOL / is it a lander worry I detail above in Psycix\u0027s entry. Swapping a capsule for a command seat makes the flight look more fun but it adds complexity to the launch and I\u0027m not sure it adds anything more positive.

Centre of mass moves around a bit as fuel burnt but kept well in check by SAS modules. Also a passable rover.

I feel like that\u0027s a generally positive review. The center of mass does move around a bit, and I did my best to ensure it moved around as little as possible. The COM starts behind the COT, then moves in front of it as the rocket fuel drains. If jet fuel is used up as well, the COM will move back behind the COT the way it started at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually considered attaching a small docking port to a fuel tank for the vertical navball option, but I had already made my video and stated the craft had 64 parts, so I didn\u0027t think it was too important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESepatrons on abort system? Maybe, but after testing the abort system extensively, I couldn\u0027t get the capsule to explode or the parachute to break off due to problems with the main body. The thing is that you\u0027re usually leaning forward when moving forward, so the capsule gets tugged underneath the main body by the parachute and the rest goes flying onwards. Only if you\u0027re going at 75\u002B m/s and pointing at your prograde marker, and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E press abort will you stand a chance of the parachute breaking off/capsule exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oRDcdhM.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022oRDcdhM.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding legs to allow rougher landings would be a good thing, but the nice thing is rover wheels \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E actually take a lot of force, even if they break (23 m/s touchdowns were tested).
