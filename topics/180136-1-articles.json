Last time I dropped rovers there, I used parachutes. They were pretty light and had ruggedised wheels; I tested on Kerbin that they\u0027d happily deal with a 25 m/s landing.

I used the rovers to scout for a base site and they did work well with that -- I dropped them in a promising ore-rich, low-lying area and then drove around a bit to find a suitably flat spot, but traversing any amount of distance quickly becomes a PITA. It can be fun the first time you land on a new body though -- I really enjoyed my drive from the highlands to the sea the first time I dropped a rover on Eve for example.

any air to drag against.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, landing on an airless body presents some other challenges.\u00A0 Since you can\u0027t use chutes, you are entirely dependent on your engines to slow to a safe landing speed.\u00A0 You will need to plan your delta-v requirements appropriately.\u00A0 While there are plenty of alternative designs, the most common design for a rover-lander is a sky crane style approach where the rover sits on the bottom of the lander.\u00A0 An engine on the bottom of the rover itself is probably not a good idea, so you are probably going to have to mount two or more engines radially positioned to expel their propellant past the rover\u0027s body.\u00A0 If the rover is short, you might as well add some landing struts to the side of those radial engines.\u00A0 Think of the lander as being like a spider with a rover that clings to it\u0027s bottom, then drops off and rolls past it\u0027s legs once it touches
