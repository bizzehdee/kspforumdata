When I\u0027m close to the Kerbal with my rescue vehicle, I change to the kerbal\u0027s broken vessel. When I do an EVA, the kerbal clings to the vessel hatch for a moment, then is suddenly launched from the vessel at high speed. Even though the Kerbal is at the same orbital speed as the vessel to which she clings. Yesterday, this problem did not occur. Today, it does.\n\nIdeas as to why this might occur?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T14:50:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 02:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13**"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:13:54Z","Content":"Im having a similar problem with valentina, whenever i eva her, she gets flung off into the distance"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:06:25Z","Content":"So, I decided to bypass the KSP broken functionality by editing the persistent.sfs file to make the kerbal\u0027s vessel landed, the kerbal available, and the contract completed (via ALT-F12).
