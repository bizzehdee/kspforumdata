I don\u0027t want to give too much away quite yet, but what I can say is that it\u0027ll be in the vein of retro simulators, with some music and writing by myself, and as much realism as I can stuff into it. What I will reveal right now is that it\u0027s a Soyuz 7K-LOK/LK Module Simulator, and that it\u0027ll be available for free. That said, the reason I\u0027m posting this now (and not later,) is that I need more resources. I\u0027ve been hunting all over the net for any sets of translated operating procedures I can find, but as of yet haven\u0027t found too much that I can actually use. I\u0027d be very appreciative for anything that would help this project be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now I\u0027ll just leave this here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://soundcloud.com/grant-mchaffie/wonder-in-space\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://soundcloud.com/grant-mchaffie/wonder-in-space\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://soundcloud.com/grant-mchaffie/wonder-in-space-non-chiptune\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://soundcloud.com/grant-mchaffie/wonder-in-space-non-chiptune\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T06:33:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do like the music!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T10:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOH GOD OH GOD OH GOD! 7K-LOK and LK!

This game really WILL be more than just looks. In fact, you\u0027ll find that the visuals will be quite lacking compared to (hopefully,) the depth of the sim, because this simulation will be text-based. When I said old-school simulation, I meant it. That said, there *will* be imagery, but it will not be the focus of the program. I\u0027m trying to stay as close I can to reality, and I\u0027m trying to avoid getting bogged down in looks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the links and the massive dose of excitement \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E It really pushes me to work harder when I see somebody as interested in this as myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also really appreciate the feedback on the music.

Due to it being on the N1, I know I won\u0027t find much. However, anything at all should make a huge difference for me. The Proton or R7 launch procedures, if I could find them, could probably be easily modified.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T16:45:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESweet, what programming language?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metalmouth7","CreatedById":72211,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T17:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause I lack any real programming skills, I\u0027m currently working with Inform7.
