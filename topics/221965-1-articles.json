I recommend in both places that this button be greyed out but have smaller red text under the label that says hold right alt. Then when the user is holding right alt, the button will be enabled to click and when they release it, the button will be disabled again. This may be more preferable than an additional UI prompt to click on and much faster if you are going down a list of filtered Debris items in the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
