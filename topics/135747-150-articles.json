If they need such an enormous constellato make launching on Soyuz viable, they won\u0027t be launching on Falcon 9, ever, unless F9 end up being cheaper than Soyuz (doubtful, since both are mass-produed, and Soyuz-V will futher reduce costs.

I honestly don\u0027t know how you don\u0027t see that as a game changer for these small, 5~20 million dollar launchers, that can loft a small fraction of the payload. They are all crowding for a market that is going to be minimal, with everyone trying to bunch their projects on the more cost-effective medium launchers and only having the odd super-important unpairable satellite of finicky requirements as a market. To build a big constellation with these smallsat launchers is a bit silly to think about, frankly, the sheer amount of flights would mean such a deployment time that the whole project could crumble financially. 20 launches can be carried off in a couple years or four, but a hundred?

And even if it only worked a bit... a 50% cheaper Falcon 9R would be \u003Cem\u003Echeaper than a Soyuz, for twice the payload\u003C/em\u003E. I honestly don\u0027t know how you don\u0027t see that as a game changer for these small, 5~20 million dollar launchers, that can loft a small fraction of the payload. They are all crowding for a market that is going to be minimal, with everyone trying to bunch their projects on the more cost-effective medium launchers and only having the odd super-important unpairable satellite of finicky requirements as a market. To build a big constellation with these smallsat launchers is a bit silly to think about, frankly, the sheer amount of flights would mean such a deployment time that the whole project could crumble financially. 20 launches can be carried off in a couple years or four, but a hundred? That can take a decade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.

OneWeb might be unviable to launch on Vega (damn you Delta II, why did you have to retire), but smaller constellations of smallsats and replacement launches will be. Cubesat Constellations will also likely grow in number rapidly, as these are also very easy to masss-produce, and are already modular- giving things like SPARK a good market. We\u0027ve already seen Cubesats explode over the last few years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd large constellations can\u0027t be mass-produced (reason why smallsats are so great). These will alwasy be relatively small, and will likely be oriented towards GEO, where orbital slots are\u00A0limited and you can\u0027t make largge amounts of smalsats\u00A0(or possibly MEO, but that\u0027s up to debate.) This area is unlikely to grow too much- it\u0027s even possible that LEO comsats outcompete the longer-latency GEO sats, reducing the number of launches for F9.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why I wish Elon decided to keep Falcon I and make Falcon V, like he originally planned. With the necessary increases in capacity made for F9, he could have a edge on his comsat constellation creation, with a smaller, LEO-oriented launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmittedly, I think it\u0027s the cost for Soyuz-U, instead of Soyuz-II. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that much different though, since Soyuz-II is bascially a modernised Soyuz-U.

I\u0027ve been looking at today\u0027s internet satellite providers in the US, and it\u0027s damn near competitive with the tariffs here where I live (northern Spain), where I can\u0027t get a decent connection anyway because the network is so crappy in my suburban area (old copper lines everywhere, and they won\u0027t upgrade to fiber for a low population density area, so 3G services are actually better, only incredibly overpriced and limited).

I don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like elsewhere, but here in France, ISPs and cellular operators merged a long time ago and our telecom prices are among the lowests (~20\u20AC/month for unlimited 3G/4G and ~30\u20AC for unlimited internet on ADSL or fiber, and you can get joint deals that combine both for \u00A0even cheaper). This is because there is an extremely competitive market.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason prices are higher elsewhere is probably because those telecom companies have higher margins. if you introduce another competitor, you would see prices go down and service go up to align themselves.

I\u0027m assuming that they\u0027re simply going to let the booster tip over faster during the first stage burn, achieving a flatter, more efficient trajectory with a higher final speed before staging. This lets them give the satellite an extra push that lets it save a few of the many months of ion-driven slowboating before it reaches its geostationary destination.
