Their main problem stemmed from the high surface tension of liquid lithium, orders of magnitude higher than that of ordinary propellants, which made it difficult to design an injector that would produce droplets of lithium small enough to burn completely before going out the nozzle. Once this problem was overcome, their results were spectacular. Using lithium and fluorine alone (no hydrogen) their maximum specific impulse was 458 seconds.

Even though it is chemically only a weak acid, it is far more dangerous than the conventional strong mineral acids, such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, or hydrochloric acid. Owing to its lesser chemical dissociation in water (thereby remaining a neutral molecule), hydrogen fluoride penetrates tissue more quickly than typical acids. Poisoning can occur readily through the skin or eyes or when inhaled or swallowed. From 1984 to 1994, at least nine U.S. workers died from accidents with HF.[275] Once in the blood, hydrogen fluoride reacts with calcium and magnesium, resulting in electrolyte imbalance (and potentially hypocalcemia). The consequent effect on the heart (cardiac arrhythmia) may be fatal.[275] Formation of insoluble calcium fluoride also causes strong pain.[277] Burns with areas larger than 160 cm2 (about the size of a person\u0027s hand) can cause serious systemic toxicity.[278]\u003Cp\u003ESymptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident, with an 8-hour delay for 50% HF and up to 24 hours for lower concentrations.
