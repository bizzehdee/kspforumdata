You can have destructive interference, but it actually requires similar wavelengths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is such thing as laser cooling, however, it has some very significant limitations. Temperature is not so much about energy as it is about entropy, a measure of disorder. If you know precisely the movement of all the particles, a beam of energy can stop such motion and freeze the object. Unfortunately, such information is unattainable. What is possible to do is utilize blue and red shift to make it so that only particles moving at the source absorb radiation from the beam. The recoil from absorbing and then radiating a photon in a random direction will, on average, slow down the particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, this only works in a fairly sparse gas and only at select frequencies specific to the gas.

Lets take a spherical object floating in a room without an atmosphere (neglecting conduction and convection). The object is at thermal equilibrium with its surroundings at let say 293K and the conduction of the material is \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; than its size (allows for the use of the Lumped Capacitance Method if you wanted to do this with real numbers and allows for a final object temperature to be determined in this very high level gedanken). Now would introduce a blackbody near the object where the entrance of the blackbody takes us a certain solid angle of the object\u0027s view. If the solid angle was 2pi, aka half of the object sees a room at 293K and the other half sees the blackbody, then the object would eventually reach a new equilibrium temperature of 146.5K.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
