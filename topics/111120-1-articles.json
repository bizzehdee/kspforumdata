Let\u0027s say 1.000.000.000m.\n\nCan anyone design a satellite capable of reaching that orbit from LKO? (I can manage myself to bring it up there)\n\nNo restrictions, i was thinking about ion engines combined with thermonuclear ones. Also useful gravitiy assists are welcome!\n\nThanks in advance!"}]}
