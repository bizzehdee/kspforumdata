Speed vectors outside of navball scope should be rendered as arrows around the edge of navball. Larger VSI/digital display VSI is important as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of this journey, the ultimate goal is to introduce stock HUD/HMD/MFD and drag them around in cockpit freely. In KSP1 mod authors do it well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
