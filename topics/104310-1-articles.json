Whilst not intended as a reproduction of any of the aforementioned aircraft, I hope that there is at least a family resemblance. Not built for any specific purpose, it has pleasant flying characteristics and I\u0027d like to think it\u0027s a good looking aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t fly itself off the runway, but only requires modest elevator input to unstick and become airborne. Glide characteristics are good and with the upswept tail booms, you\u0027d have to be seriously abusing the elevator control near the ground to suffer a tail strike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/voo1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022voo1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/voo2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022voo2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/a3ir9sr9v5548iq/Voodoo.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft download file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T08:09:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T14:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMmm.. very creative layout!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how it flies.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T18:58:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks sweet!
