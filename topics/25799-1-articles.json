After several \u0027simulated\u0027 landing attempts Jeb and lander made it to the surface of the Mun in one piece. He EVA\u0027d and spent some time looking back at Kerbin with a satisfied smile on his face while I clapped and cheered my piloting skills \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Sadly I\u0027m still enough of a noob that I forgot to take a screenshot in the excitement lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately things then went wrong, I lifted off, set up a maneuver node to set up my burn back to Kerbin.....3,2,1 burn yay....awww dammit out of fuel! Poor Jeb is now drifting around in a slightly eccentric orbit of the Mun. Ah well time for a rescue mission, now I have a reason to learn how to do an orbital rendezvous, woohoo.
