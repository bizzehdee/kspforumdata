So my question is why did I just lose Jebediah and my entire minmus mission because he got turned into a tourist just as the ship hit 68km into the kerbin atmosphere returning from minmus?  I could not decouple the capsule or even arm the parachutes so he died and I lost my entire mission!\n\nI read this before the mission:\n\nOrange suited Kerbals (Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Val) are immune to the ill effects of life support.

This always gives a player (especially a new one) an \u0027out\u0027 to test out a manned mission before actually committing your other kerbals, etc. to a horrible fate of snack deprivation.\n\nI did not have the DV for supplies and this cost me a couple hours to minmus, collecting data, and returning only to lose complete control of the ship when according to the above I should not have!

I just hacked my way though some save backups and ignored LS for that mission. Reinstated right after the mission.  Sure i lost some time but that was it.
