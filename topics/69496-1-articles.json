The basic method is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Envision the overall design, mothership and probes, especially how you will attach the probes. Your options here are stack or radial decouplers, or docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Build a probe. Then save everything except the probe\u0027s CPU as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Build the mothership including the parts the probes will attach to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Attach the probe subassembly to the attachment point on the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Add the CPU to the probe subassembly to complete the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Steps 4 and 5 are for attaching probes radially or by their lower ends. If the probes are attached by their upper ends, you might have to reverse these steps. Also, if the probe design has parts both above and below the probe CPU, then you have to do some of the probe construction in the VAB while building the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/jYcUew\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7379/12450467544_84c32b02cd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212450467544_84c32b02cd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(click pic to enlarge)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, the probes were intended for Laythe so needed a parachute. This put the probe CPUs in the middle, so the probe subassembly was just the stuff below the probe CPU and their RTGs and chutes were added after attaching to the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, the probes are attached at their lower ends due to the chutes and because radially attachments can get messy with retained decoupler pieces. So on the mothership, there are girders sticking out. At the end of each girder, I put a cubic octagonal strut, then put a small blue stack separator on each of them. Then the probe subassemblies went on top of these: engine, fuel, science stuff, MJ, and landing legs. Next, I added the probe CPUs to all the probes, then the RTGs and chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T08:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow are you trying to build this at the moment and what have you tried that doesn\u0027t work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know that you can rotate parts using WASDQE in the VAB? With that the easiest way to have several probes on a single launch is to put a quad-coupler upside down on top of the core, add separators to each of the (four) nodes on top of that and build/place your probes on top of the whole thing. Rocket goes under the core in the normal way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T08:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t attach something somewhere, it is often because you are trying to attach something that only attaches to the green attachment nodes, but you want to put it somewhere that has none. The solution to this is to first put an item there that can attach to walls, that has a green attachment node on it. Docking ports are a sleek way to do this, and cubic octagonal struts are a minimalist way to do it. It\u0027s even possible with a fuel tank, if you can finagle it into a good position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T12:04:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbes have to be built after you have constructed the mothership, but that construction needs to be with the mothership present and connected to it via a decoupler.
