I have learned from the math the kinds of things I need to do to make something work \u0022better\u0022 (e.g. Have more Delta-V or have better TWR).\n\nIn every one of my missions, I build in fail-return points. If I have a stage and the goal of that stage is to perform X, then I fail-return the mission if that stage is not up to snuff. For instance - say I have a Mun landing mission, and my stack has an Ascent Stage, Orbital Stage, Transfer Stage, Landing Stage, and Return Stage. I\u0027ll have milestones associated with each stage, and if any milestone fails, I abort and return.\n\nAscent - Stack reaches ballistic trajectory of 75km or abort.\n\nOrbital - Circularize orbit (75x75km) with fuel to spare or abort.\n\nTransfer - Transfer to and Munar Orbit Insertion with fuel to spare or abort.\n\nLanding - Land with fuel to spare or abort.\n\nReturn - no abort strategy given / abort stage for any previous failure.

Install it using instructions on that page. With that when you go to VAB you will see the window which contains all the necessary data about a rocket you are currently building (if the window is not displayed press the small button which says \u0022KER\u0022 in the lower right corner). The most important part is delta v divided by stages. This column tells you how much delta v that particular stage has and how much delta v all the stages before had. \n\nNext step is to find a delta v map. KSP wiki has one: [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png) \n\nIt may be hard to read it at first but actually it\u0027s quite easy. Let\u0027s say you want to land your Kerbonaut on Minmus and safely get back to Kerbin. Find the Low kerbin orbit (LKO) and Minmus. Two points are connected by a line and a few numbers, add them together. It will be 930\u002B340\u002B160\u002B180=1610 to land on Minmus and 180\u002B160=340; all in all 1950 delta v. That is a rough estimate. WIth Minmus it will be probably less because 340 for inclination change is way too much but at first I\u0027d recommend to take 10-15% more just to be safe. So if you build in your VAB a ship which has 2100-2200 delta v in vacuum (press atmospheric and move altitude slider to 70 km) according to KER it will be probably able to get your guy or gal to Minmus and back.\n\nOf course you will need to get that ship to orbit. Build the lower stages and look at their delta v estimate (but now use 0 altitude since you will be launching from the ground). Note that Kerbin LKO delta v listed in this map is incorrect. I personally safely launch rockets with 3700\u002B although many people in this forum talk about 3500.\n\nAnother important piece of data the KER gives you is TWR. You can have tens of thousands delta v but if your TWR is less than 1 you will be unable to lift your rocket off the ground at all. For launch TWR higher than 1.3 is ok and higher than 1.6 is better. At the same time too high TWR is also bad. IF twr at launch is higher than 2 you should probably remove some engines from the first stage/use less powerful engines since they are basically a dead weight.\n\nIf you want to see KER window in flight you should add a piece called Kerbal Engineering System (science tab) to your rocket.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T19:03:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 07:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zeratul\\_r**\n  \nexpanding on the matter"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:02:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello,\n\u003E So, my normal gameplay of KSP involves settling on a mission (getting to Mun, Duna, Eve, etc) and building a rocket based on previous experience that LOOKS like it might get me there (or there and back if it is manned).

I don\u0027t necessarily disagee with that. But I will point you that it isn\u0027t too hard to calculate delta V by hand (you just need to take the mass of the ship and the weight of fuel and stick them into a simple equation, if you have stages, you do them one by one with the upper stage just counting a dead weight). I set up a spreadsheet to do this. \n\nI would recommend doing at least the calculation (if not a spread sheet) a few times before going to KER. It is instructive. I also find the spreadsheet useful even with KER. (For examples, what will my dV be if a leave 300 units of fuel at the station.)\n\nI assume you know where to find the chart of the amount of delta V needed to reach certain places? If not, or you need a link to the equation, just ask."},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:24:57Z","Content":"Like most everyone else has mentioned, I would recommend KER to calculate the dV of your vessel. I would also recommend thinking of your vessel in two parts: The launch stage and mission playload. Figure out how much vacuum dV you need to get to orbit (vacuum dV is reported by default in the KER readout and is a convenient metric for figuring this out), and design your launch stage to supply that much dV. Then, separately, design your mission payload to have sufficient dV for your mission (more on that in a second). \n\nFor example, lets say you tend to need 4,000 m/s of vacuum dV to get into orbit, and your mission will take about 2,000 km/s from LKO. You should design your total vessel to have about 6,000 m/s in total.\n\nTo calculate your dV by hand, you need to familiarize yourself with [Tsiolkovsky\u0027s rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation).\n\nNow, to calculate the dV you need for your mission, there are two option: dV maps and the ol\u0027 fashioned manual method.\n\nUsing the dV maps that have been created by other players is pretty easy. The best one I\u0027ve seen is Kowgan\u0027s revision of WAC\u0027s map (posted [here](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet)). Just add up the values on the way to your destination.\n\nThe manual method is substantially more complex. Do really do it well, having a year or so of high school/secondary level physics really helps. Basically, you need to calculate the desired velocity for your desired orbit at the location where you intend to burn, and subtract from that velocity at which you will be traveling at the location you intend to burn given your current orbit. Repeat this process for each maneuver you intend to make to reach your mission target. \n\n Since velocity is speed *and direction*, this REALLY is vector math, so being familiar with vectors is helpful as well. A good summary of the equations you\u0027ll use is available [here](http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm). It\u0027s a great site that I\u0027ve been using since I found it. I think it\u0027s maintained by someone on these forums. You\u0027ll start with the [vis-viva equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation), and work your way up.\n\nHope the helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T22:43:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TestPilotTheta**"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:39:56Z","Content":"I like using VOID.

The whole point of staging a rocket is to shed mass you don\u0027t need. In your first configuration your rocket is severely overpowered which results in too much TWR initially and having to drag around the burnt out central stack and its Mainsail until your boosters are also empty. In your second configuration your boosters will carry the second stack as payload which results in much more delta v on paper because it assumes that it can use the Mainsail later into the flight.

Left side of the / is delta v of the stage, which is unchanged for upper stages, but total of that stage with lover stages included is higher.\n\nBasically, you have discovered the most crucial thing that KER can show you = less is more. Just enough engines and fuel can get you further with lower mass and parts count than bloated design, which at first had is counter-intuitive.

The whole point of staging a rocket is to shed mass you don\u0027t need. In your first configuration your rocket is severely overpowered which results in too much TWR initially and having to drag around the burnt out central stack and its Mainsail until your boosters are also empty. In your second configuration your boosters will carry the second stack as payload which results in much more delta v on paper because it assumes that it can use the Mainsail later into the flight. But also in way too less TWR to actually move you off the pad.\n\nOkay. Makes sense. So, I hadn\u0027t set up the asparagus staging yet at this point. If I did that, does KER take into account how the fuel lines are set up for asparagus staging? So, I would shed two outer tanks, then two more, etc. leaving the large central tank and mainsail full to the end but burning the whole time? That should help my DV? I\u0027ll test this when I get home."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T14:57:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I did that, does KER take into account how the fuel lines are set up for asparagus staging?

But you\u0027d still have too much TWR at launch and that tiny upper stage is basically worthless."},{"CreatedByName":"sledgeweb","CreatedById":80879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:08:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah.

I thought when I looked at KER with just the upper stage, and 70KM setting - it had enough DV to get back from Minmus on it\u0027s own. This thing is supposed to just sit on Minmus as a station, but I figured I\u0027d provide an escape vehicle for one person to come home. Lol. Plus it fulfills the contract requirement of having enough space for 5 Kerbals. Still, at this point, I was just monkeying around trying to figure out how KER works and not really building for feasibility."}]}
