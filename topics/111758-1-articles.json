Install it using instructions on that page. With that when you go to VAB you will see the window which contains all the necessary data about a rocket you are currently building (if the window is not displayed press the small button which says \u0022KER\u0022 in the lower right corner). The most important part is delta v divided by stages. This column tells you how much delta v that particular stage has and how much delta v all the stages before had. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext step is to find a delta v map. KSP wiki has one: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be hard to read it at first but actually it\u0027s quite easy. Let\u0027s say you want to land your Kerbonaut on Minmus and safely get back to Kerbin. Find the Low kerbin orbit (LKO) and Minmus. Two points are connected by a line and a few numbers, add them together. It will be 930\u002B340\u002B160\u002B180=1610 to land on Minmus and 180\u002B160=340; all in all 1950 delta v. That is a rough estimate. WIth Minmus it will be probably less because 340 for inclination change is way too much but at first I\u0027d recommend to take 10-15% more just to be safe. So if you build in your VAB a ship which has 2100-2200 delta v in vacuum (press atmospheric and move altitude slider to 70 km) according to KER it will be probably able to get your guy or gal to Minmus and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you will need to get that ship to orbit. Build the lower stages and look at their delta v estimate (but now use 0 altitude since you will be launching from the ground). Note that Kerbin LKO delta v listed in this map is incorrect. I personally safely launch rockets with 3700\u002B although many people in this forum talk about 3500.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important piece of data the KER gives you is TWR. You can have tens of thousands delta v but if your TWR is less than 1 you will be unable to lift your rocket off the ground at all. For launch TWR higher than 1.3 is ok and higher than 1.6 is better. At the same time too high TWR is also bad. IF twr at launch is higher than 2 you should probably remove some engines from the first stage/use less powerful engines since they are basically a dead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see KER window in flight you should add a piece called Kerbal Engineering System (science tab) to your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T19:03:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 07:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zeratul_r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eexpanding on the matter\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sledgeweb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sledgeweb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHello,\u003Cp\u003ESo, my normal gameplay of KSP involves settling on a mission (getting to Mun, Duna, Eve, etc) and building a rocket based on previous experience that LOOKS like it might get me there (or there and back if it is manned).

I would also recommend thinking of your vessel in two parts: The launch stage and mission playload. Figure out how much vacuum dV you need to get to orbit (vacuum dV is reported by default in the KER readout and is a convenient metric for figuring this out), and design your launch stage to supply that much dV. Then, separately, design your mission payload to have sufficient dV for your mission (more on that in a second). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, lets say you tend to need 4,000 m/s of vacuum dV to get into orbit, and your mission will take about 2,000 km/s from LKO. You should design your total vessel to have about 6,000 m/s in total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo calculate your dV by hand, you need to familiarize yourself with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETsiolkovsky\u0027s rocket equation\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to calculate the dV you need for your mission, there are two option: dV maps and the ol\u0027 fashioned manual method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the dV maps that have been created by other players is pretty easy.

Just add up the values on the way to your destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe manual method is substantially more complex. Do really do it well, having a year or so of high school/secondary level physics really helps. Basically, you need to calculate the desired velocity for your desired orbit at the location where you intend to burn, and subtract from that velocity at which you will be traveling at the location you intend to burn given your current orbit.

I thought when I looked at KER with just the upper stage, and 70KM setting - it had enough DV to get back from Minmus on it\u0027s own. This thing is supposed to just sit on Minmus as a station, but I figured I\u0027d provide an escape vehicle for one person to come home. Lol. Plus it fulfills the contract requirement of having enough space for 5 Kerbals. Still, at this point, I was just monkeying around trying to figure out how KER works and not really building for feasibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
