Cooling fins will buckle here and there, but that\u0027s it.\n\nI suppose an extremely powerful hydrogen nuclear bomb could penetrate it if it was next to it, but then you wouldn\u0027t need to worry about the flask, would you?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T13:03:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 01:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lajoswinkler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T19:06:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not that hard to lay more track and they are in the middle of a desert, so space shouldn\u0027t have been an issue.\n\nMaybe it was a momentum issue?

To me this is an over engineered answer to a simple problem.\n\nYou might even make an argument that the results of the test are not truly as actuate as they could have been, because they didn\u0027t use a more real world train set up as the British did.\n\nIn any case it makes for great YouTube videos."}]}
