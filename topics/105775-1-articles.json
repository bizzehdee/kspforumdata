I\u0027m struggling with this one - I\u0027m guessing I should just try shallower re-entry angles and multiple aerobraking orbits, but, in case there\u0027s another option...\n\nMy wings keep burning off my space planes on re-entry. Am I missing something? Any tips on avoiding having planes melt?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T21:06:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JimTheDog**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:02:39Z","Content":"Try aiming higher than average (35 km), and making S-curves by turning in the atmosphere before the \u0022reentry\u0022 really starts heating up.
