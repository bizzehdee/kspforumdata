Full thrust still nothing moves. Checked several times if the brakes are off everywhere. \n\nA Bug or have i forgot something?\n\n![FVLCtkE.png](http://i.imgur.com/FVLCtkE.png)\n\nI can\u0027t use the stock Gear because I need some clearance at the back to push the nose up."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T21:41:16Z","Content":"It may be that your engines are blocked.

And you can actually see how force is applied to the craft when throttling up because the wings and frame are slightly vibrating"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T22:36:49Z","Content":"This is very strange... ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nSave it under a different name, stick the stock gear on I-Beams, and see if THAT rolls. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf it doesn\u0027t, it\u0027s not the gear, if it does, it\u0027s the gear. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
