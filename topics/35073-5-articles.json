Issue: My profiles menu doesn\u0027t pop up when I click on it? Is this issue been previously reported?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Possible Bug: With the latest Firespitter pre-release candidate. I\u0027m running the KAX PT-100\u0027s on a craft. If I set a specific thrust in throttle control, before cycling the engines on at least once, the prop animations will not play. Engines will thrust normally. Cycling the engines first before setting TC clears this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I saw a few pages back in re: to toolbar integration. \u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Suggestion: The ability to pre-tweak engine throttles and limits in VAB/SPH would be nice.
