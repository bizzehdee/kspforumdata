But I\u0027d like to say that now that I\u0027m getting the hang of how MJ works, it\u0027s a godsend. It relieves me of so many of the frustrations I was having before and some/many of which I\u0027ve logged over at Gameplay. MJ can do some whacky things now and then but I\u0027m learning to adjust and figure out how to avoid those -- usually by using another MJ feature. It\u0027s a marvellous boon to newbies, and I still consider myself a noob. I have no maths (and besides I\u0027m 80 but love to play games) so don\u0027t want to be spending the time learning formulas and that sort of thing.
