I\u0027ve put 12 of the LT-2 landing struts on and worked on a process of quicksave/quickload to land myself on a bit of a mountain. I\u0027ve run into two problems in this trial run. The first is that my final stage didn\u0027t have the power storage to allow me to light up the engine once I got to my apopsis \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Having fixed that, on to the second issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven landing at 4m/s, the landing struts dig into the ground and take a serious amount of work to get going. I have eight aerospikes and four RT-10 SRB\u0027s running at full like for like five seconds before it flips out of the ground and starts actually moving. It feels like it defeats the purpose of these things if they aren\u0027t capable of taking a landing at this speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo save me two days of flying out there to test it - would wheels resolve this (even if they broke on landing) for this scenario? I can\u0027t help but notice that the RoveMax M1 is lighter and has a higher impact tolerance than the legs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T10:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can pull the gear up and then down.
