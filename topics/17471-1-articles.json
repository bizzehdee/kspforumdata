Not interfacing with the ship, exactly, but maybe a class that would report keystrokes much like a keyboard would, and a class that would manage the GUI much like a monitor would. Unfortunately, I don\u0027t know how to really do GUI stuff or catch keystrokes that aren\u0027t intended for the VM, so I\u0027m stuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the link to my GitHub where I uploaded my code so far: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/ummwut/KSP-16bit-onboard\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://github.com/ummwut/KSP-16bit-onboard\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, need an outside perspective on this.
