It locks the camera when returning to the space center, facing out towards the runway. I also cannot warp at all, the sky flies by but no time passes. It can be fixed by going to a launch. If I jump to any ship in orbit (such as by using the alarm clock) I immediately get a kraken and the ship gets vaporized and a random ship gets launched out of the Kerbin system. It seems the only solution is if the camera locks and I can\u0027t get to the launchpad (reconditioning) is to exit the game and close it down completely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw this bug reported earlier in the thread.

Not gonna lie, their reactions to things are hilarious. Having written the code, it\u0027s hard to imagine what it\u0027s like for people who don\u0027t know what certain features do. Watching first time users gives me a lot of insight into the Ease of Use. My favorite is waiting for them to try unlocking a tech node. The one person\u0027s reaction was so unexpected, since normally I figured people get upset, but he was like \u0022You have to wait for tech to be unlocked?!
