Recently I received a contract to do an Eve fly-by, so I started planning my first interplanetary mission - so far I only visited the Kerbin moons. I didn\u0027t want to complicate it and decided to do two maneuvers - one to excape Kerbin and then a correction at the descending node around the Sun to match the inclination.\u00A0 Escaping retrograde at about 1020 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and then a correction of about 360 m/s would give me an intercept it seemed (and an equatorial orbit more or less).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when I wanted to fine-tune the intercept, the controls and predicted trajectories began to glitch out. First the maneuver node controls started acting up - no matter what button I pressed in the bottom left window, the distance was getting worse (clicking to add both normal and anti-normal resulted in a change in trajectory towards the same direction). Then, when I created a maneuver node at Eve and tried to drag it, the whole Eve fly-by conic started drifting away from the planet, as if the game was recalculating the maneuver over and over and getting a different result every time (it was not \u0022jumping\u0022 back and forth, but steadily drifting/shifting when I held the node). Last, after another few minutes I noticed the burn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E bar next to the navball started to change values, the maneuver is set to 1020, but the displayed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is constantly rising, past the 1500s now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever seen this happen when dealing with the moon transfers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought it might be because the manuver is far ahead (about a year), but time-warping to 1 day before and setting up the maneuvers again resulted in the same thing.

Let\u0027s hope they fix it in KSP2 at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) If I understand it correctly, KSP uses the spaceship in control as the origin of its reference frame to avoid errors at distant locations - most of the time everything is as close to your focus as possible. However, I suspect that since it repositions the universe around it with respect to the center of the craft, it may also reorient the universe, change the direction of the principal axes within it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) If the spacecraft is rotating, the universe around it is actually rotating while the spaceship is staying at rest with regards to the KSP\u0027s used reference frame. However, reading the code the game generates, the space the game works with is cartesian (at least for part placement, I assume they also use it for the game-space, but I might be wrong), meaning that any object not precisely along the principal axes (and moving in the respective direction only) need to be re-angled, which can cause quite a bit of error if large distances are considered, I imagine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) A rotating spacecraft will always change the direction of the principal axes of the universe around it (any slightest wiggle, mind you! Good luck with large ships..), and any rounding errors will result in objects being slightly off their original positions. Since these calculations are chained (the position in the next instant is calculated from the results of the previous one), the errors are propagating further and further, resulting in a drift (e.g. you are constantly rounding down or up, cycling around the predicted position).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Now, the fix... I imagine that if you center the universe on the craft but keep a fixed coordinate system orientation not bound to the craft, you may circumvent this bug/\u0022feature\u0022, but maybe I\u0027m missing something. I.e., make the universe translate around (e.g.) the root part of the craft, but make the craft rotate within this reference frame. This way, the universe should care only about the distances (and the angles from the craft will change only with the movement of the planets, not the craft), not the orientation of the spacecraft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Or.. maybe the game is already running like this and there are small deviations in the calculation of the center of the craft (or the origin of the coordiante system) resulting in small shifts/oscillations in the repositioning of the universe around, nevertheless, any non-translational movement of the craft changes results in errors in the universe drawn around. The problem is, the errors stay there, so the adjusted \u0022wrong\u0022 calculations that you got in the first place will only get corrected once you get closer and the game recalculates the path with a higher precision.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr, rewriting the code to use spherical coordinate system could help, as any rotation will result in the change of angles only, not all the XYZ distances of the objects. Just spitballing here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA demonstration with a tiny craft that I posted on the KSP bug-tracker:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/attachments/59003/2023-01-28%2020-55-29_trimmed.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/attachments/59003/2023-01-28 20-55-29_trimmed.mp4\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA small craft (just a small tank, small engine, and a control unit) cheated into a random non-trivial orbit and set up with a maneuver to\u00A0 reach a solar orbit (I tested this meanuver before recording and cut out the 30 seconds of maneuver adjusting). When the craft is stationary, the uncertainties in the predicted path are small (as seen by the oscillations of the predicted marker position by hundreds of metres halfway across the solar system), when the ship starts to rotate, the uncertainties get significantly larger, and, what is worse, the changes stay after the rotation is stopped. With a large craft that is still wiggling from the launch (and the wiggling doesn\u0027t stop completely, ever, even though it might not be visible), these errors can get multiplied if the frequencies of the oscillations/wiggles are similar to the frequency with which the game recalculates the next sample - we could call it aliasing of the calculations. In molecular dynamics, we say that the simulation blows up when the sampling interval (time step) is too small for the changes that are calculated within the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if you have the same problem as I do, when you\u0027re setting up a maneuver, use 5x time-warp (not the physics one), this keeps your craft steady and prevents any observed drifts. Although, since the errors in the calculations propagate, while you may be able to set up a maneuver to your liking, in the end you might end up missing, since the game only recalculates the trajectory once you get closer...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-30T23:31:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2023 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by JohnG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
