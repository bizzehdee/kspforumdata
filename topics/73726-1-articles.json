I do the same on the ship I am going to dock with it. Once I have my ship within 1000m of the station I turn on its lights and face the center of the station. I will usually aim for about 3-5m/s closure which will give me around 200-300 seconds to adjust things. Then I switch to the station , go into chase view and rotate the station to face the incoming ship using its lights and the stations lights to get the cardinal line up. Then I switch back to the ship (in chase mode) and use the station lights to orient its rotation to match the station.
