However, if you have the same amount of RCS thrusters on a small ship as a large ship, the larger ship will have slower changes because it\u0027s heavier. This means you can have more control over things like apoapsis and periapsis. (Which is why I tend to make the first piece of my station really big/have very few rcs thrusters.
