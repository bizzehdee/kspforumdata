However, I have only put one Kerman boot on the surface and it wasnt pretty. The others landers succumbed to a strange anomaly (died a fiery death) as I get close to the surface. I am able to slow my craft on decent to 0 K/M s as long as I am a few hundred meters from the surface. But the closer I get, and the slower I get, the nose will tip over uncontrollably and I am unable to descend level. The behavior kicks in at less than 20 k/m s and gets worse the closer to the surface I get. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen some issues with some landers on youTube that might get this behavior with an unbalanced lander (top heavy). I assure you I have brought very simple landers in that look very much like every other lander I see on the web stick their landings with no mention of this issue I am having. BTW, SAS (updated: not SAS, but Mechjeb, and that is the problem) and light RCS cant over come it either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy newest lander has additional RCS added.

What happens is that as you approach 0 and beginning to move away from the surface the retrograde point on the navball will move. Mechjeb will then chase the point and your lander will go....everywhere. Using Mechjeb to keep you retrograde is fine, typically I turn it off and switch to SAS around 50-100m, especially if my horizontal speed is fairly low.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steve Fink","CreatedById":44481,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T18:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep Tauge, after posting that reply I ran it through my little head and figured out that the orbital path would be changing dramatically as I slowed down and got closer to the surface with horizontal velocity etc. It all makes PERFECT sense.
