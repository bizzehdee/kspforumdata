So when I sent the rocket up to fix the orbit I found all this out, and then fixing rocket couldn\u0027t even push it into the orbit I wanted....The whole Project was scrapped due to my immense ineptitude.

Mission to Duna. Got into Kerbin orbit and had some of my Asparagus stage still attached. Decided it would be a good time to refuel for the trip to Duna. Sent up an almost identical ship sans some dead weight, the second ship was unmanned. Refueled without too much trouble. As I decoupled there was a minor collision. Didn\u0027t notice any damage to the main ship. Went to Duna. Left lower stage in orbit while lander landed got science and returned to Duna orbit running on fumes. I was trying to rendezvous with the lower stage so I could refuel my lander. Managed to sync orbits and bounce off the docking ring a few times. After it didn\u0027t connect I took a closer look. Apparently during my minor collision with the Kerbin refuel I knocked off the docking ring. Doh. So THAT is what exploded. I guess when I get home tonight I\u0027ll be sending a rescue ship to recover my Kerbal and my science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nick7892","CreatedById":100672,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T20:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI undocked my Soyuz from the space station when the Soyuz suddenly exploded into bits and pieces. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T02:21:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECommenced my Gilly orbit insertion burn, with a projected peri of just over 4km, and became too busy looking at the remaining burn time to look out the window.
