I was wondering, though - if I have a spaceplane that can get to orbit and land again on the KSC runway, is that same plane likely going to work on Laythe, where there is no runway? I can land a plane on the runway at Kerbin, but I\u0027ve never successfully landed a plane on the ground. Will Laythe\u0027s lower gravity help me out there, or should I try to master non-runway landings on Kerbin? I suppose it goes without saying, but I\u0027m also going to want to take off from Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy overall plan is to ferry the spaceplane to Laythe orbit, refuel it, and land/do science/take off all using one fully-fueled spaceplane. I use Mechjeb, but would prefer not to use other mods. I hope very soon I\u0027ll have my first working spaceplane finished, and I can post pictures and the .craft file. Right at this second, I have a roughly 16-ton plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-18T01:41:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2014 01:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ZeroG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T19:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s tricky if you don\u0027t find a nice flat surface.

Inspired by Redshift OTF\u0027s post, I actually went ahead and put some parachutes on top of the plane, figuring I\u0027d do a vertical landing by activating the parachutes right before landing, then a standard take-off. I was landing at KSC and decided to try it out - it more-or-less worked; obviously the sudden jerk upward threw my plane out of control for a little while, and it\u0027s way off-balance, but it actually landed that way (on the back engines). I was also able to take off from a non-runway as well.

Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[update]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, it worked! (with only a little breakage). I hyper-edited the plane into Laythe orbit, then used MechJeb\u0027s Landing Guidance feature; I entered some coordinates I found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47979-Any-flat-spots-on-Laythe-the-length-of-a-runway-other-SSTO-questions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47979-Any-flat-spots-on-Laythe-the-length-of-a-runway-other-SSTO-questions\u003C/a\u003E, and let let the autopilot put me into a descent path. I shut the autopilot off after the descent was plotted (I\u0027m pretty sure it would have cratered me if I had just let it do its thing), and it put me in the general vicinity. It turned out to be a nighttime landing, and I don\u0027t recommend that; it made it way more difficult. I quicksaved before attempting to land, and botched quite a few landings before I finally started getting a few right. Really, I think the trickiest part is finding a flat area; even the coast can be pretty hilly. The nighttime aspect was definitely a part of that problem. I had several takeoffs botched as well; for some reason I went into a flat spin on several attempts, seemingly as a result of being on slopes. I finally did take off on one attempt, and I ended up breaking off a control surface. I had four in total, so now I only had three. Smart A.S.S. couldn\u0027t really cope with an uneven number of control surfaces, but SAS helped out a bit. I managed to get back into orbit, and actually found that Laythe takes quite a lot less fuel; even having expended some oxidizer to descend, I had more than enough to get back to a 60\u002BK orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone\u0027s interested, here\u0027s the .craft file of the plane I used; action group 1 toggles turbojets, 2, toggles the 909s, and 0 deploys chutes: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2wOLhKlE-_9cklfZVRSY3FRSTg/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2wOLhKlE-_9cklfZVRSY3FRSTg/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E.

You just need to find a flat surface to land on and not come in too fast. Always turn your engines as low as possible before landing and bleed off as much speed as you can by keeping the plane\u0027s nose up enough to fly level. I find landing on dirt easier than maneuvering to the runway. Actually I found that it was easier to design a plane capable of landing than it was to make one capable of taking off. It took me some 20\u002B plane models just to get in the air, and the first one that did also successfully landed (though it broke into pieces--but the pilot survived). Nowadays about 1 in 3 of my new plane designs fail to takeoff but only about 1 in 10 fail to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only landed one plane on Laythe but it flew and landed very similar to Kerbin.
