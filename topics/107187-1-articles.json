[steam v on auto update]) Windows 7 64-bit (AMD chip \u0026amp; GTX gpu\u0027s, standard stuff~) Stock KSP, no mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple crash: In flight, 10-30 kilometers above Kerbin, during 4x physics warp, scene change from flight to map, back to flight, sudden crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis first time this happened I was flying a simple jet to Kerbin\u0027s north pole for science collection. I didn\u0027t think it would be persistent so I don\u0027t remember the exact conditions. Simply flying 4x acceleration to get there quick, over an hour of flight I\u0027d say, and then a crash. I was quite frustrated so I made a new vessel (simple rocket with science modules), enabled cheats (infinite fuel, no destruction to parts, hack gravity) and again, in flight to north pole, physics warp, scene change, game crashed. Knowing KSP, knowing Unity, and knowing my PC, it tallied it up to bad luck. But this morning it happened \u003Cem\u003Eagain. \u003C/em\u003ENo mods, beefy PC, no random software that would interfere, I\u0027m at a loss. I haven\u0027t been able to find this bug on the forums, and it\u0027s getting rather annoying, I imagine it might have something to do with new aerodynamics (I haven\u0027t played since v0.23 or so) and maybe I\u0027m pushing the game too hard with physics acceleration and rapidly changing back and forth from map to check my trajectory. Perhaps dual monitors and KSP in full screen causes graphics crashes? Maybe this is just something that was caused by patch and will be fixed soon as it could already be known and in the works for a fix. Crash does not seem to produce an error log, though that might be something Steam alters. I\u0027ve put off playing KSP for the full release since last summer probably because I was hoping to avoid this kind of frustration inducing bugs; with any luck, it\u0027s something I\u0027m doing wrong and not the game itself. Anyone had similar experiences?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*Edit: Tried again, this time, no physics acceleration. Managed to land near pole, collect science data, went to map to reorient and head back to KSC, left map back to flight scene, game crashed. Scene changes have always been an issue for me, I really hope this is fixed soon. It\u0027s frustrating not being able to utilize simple game elements like the map.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGonna check the forums to see about map issues, and delete this post and comment in the appropriate thread if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*Edit #2:\u003C/strong\u003E Still haven\u0027t seen anything quite like this in Support.

Debugged no max temperatures, infinite fuel, unbreakable joints, no crash damage, entered a suborbital trajectory. On reentry, this time, no physics acceleration, coming in hot, throttled engine to slow decent, game crashed, not even an error window popped up, the game just vanished from desktop. Maybe this is the 64 bit version, but I figured on Steam it would be the stable 32 bit, as there\u0027s no way I know of to specify which version you want to download.
