Tested the nuke out on Kerbin. Found out that with 2 400 LF tanks 1 lander can and one thermometer. The thermometer heated up pretty fast. Next tried same thing but with small retractable thermal control system. Found out it heated up a little bit slower and did not get as hot and started to cool down sooner as well as faster after the engine was shut down. The only two places where they might really be needed are Eve (Gilly Included) and Moho. As both of those places are closer to the heat source. Also. The static one. I think is useless too. Does make a good window cover. \n\nThing is. While in space. The radiators do pull heat away from the engine(s) faster then without. Which in turn heats up the area they are attached to faster. Have not tried the medium and large radiators. Best guess worl be they would be even slower and cool down even faster. Have not gotten the drills.

Oh wait, now we can reenter the entire spacecraft and ~:%reusable space program%:~. #elonmusk #KSPpr0\n\nGiven that it was completely UNrealistic to have LV-Ns heat up in the first place, the jibberjabber demanding radiators for them was totally misguided.\n\nSo yeah, the only use I\u0027ve found for radiators is in reducing reentry heat, and the fact that this actually works just illustrates a fundamental flaw in the whole heat system. As I understand things, one of the things in the heat system is that a reentering ship heats up the air it hits, which then flows back heating the rest of the ship more than it would have been otherwise.\n\nWhy is this a problem with radiators? Because heat is only supposed to move from hotter areas to colder areas. So, if heat from the air is getting into the ship, this means the air is hotter than the ship. Therefore, the ship should not be able to dump heat back into the air through the radiators. They would instead pump even more heat into the ship and make the situation worse.\n\nTHIS IS BROKEN."},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T04:23:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Given that it was completely UNrealistic to have LV-Ns heat up in the first place, the jibberjabber demanding radiators for them was totally misguided.\n\nOnly if you believe that realism is a game design goal onto itself, which at least some of us don\u0027t believe to be the case."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T04:36:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Only if you believe that realism is a game design goal onto itself, which at least some of us don\u0027t believe to be the case.\n\nOh, I\u0027m totally in the camp of NOT desiring \u0022realism\u0022 in KSP, in the sense of defining \u0022realism\u0022 to mean \u0022just like Earth\u0022. Trying to impose Earth-like conditions in KSP is doomed to fail (if not in the 1 spot you did it, then everywhere else in the game where you apply the same rules you bent to make the 1 place work) unless and until RSS becomes stock (gods forbid).\n\nBut that misses the point, which is that the only possible reason for making LV-Ns get hot was to make it much harder to use them.

Especially if you\u0027re willing to wink at true realism from a safe distance in a game whose toy-sized system was built specifically to make gameplay easier.\n\nI tend to disagree on that point, as I think if it provides an interesting design constraint, that takes precedence over player \u0022freedom\u0022.\n\nI also do not agree that restricting player freedom is inherently a bad game design decision. Rules inevitably restrict player freedom, and to my mind, are largely what differentiate a game from a toy. Hence, I view restricting player freedom as being a necessary component of good game design rather than the opposite.\n\nAnd lastly, I don\u0027t think miniature Kerbin is necessarily intended to make the game easier as much as it may be intended to make it faster paced by reducing time to orbit. I do agree however that it creates unique design challenges in the process, that aren\u0027t always for the better.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T04:49:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"Korizan","CreatedById":142032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T13:49:43Z","Content":"Hmmm the differences between a radiator and a heat sink.\n\nA heat sink like on your CPU basically reduces the heat by making the surface area very large.\n\nA radiator on the other hand uses a fluid to conduct that heat to another area where it can be more effectively cooled once again via a very large surface area.\n\nThe exact same mechanic except the results are very different.\n\nSo if the radiators in KSP are acting as heat sinks then they would cool down the part they are connected too.\n\nIf the radiators are actually radiators then you would have to designate which part you are cooling and that part would be cooled.\n\nAnd then there is the rest of the ship which would get heated up / cooled down depending on materials, surface area, and distance from the heat source.\n\nSo the question is, are the radiators in KSP a radiator or a heat sink.\n\nAnd the LV-N heating doesn\u0027t reduce freedom but rather adds balance otherwise you could argue it is overpowered.\n\nOR you could say cause and effect, everything has a trade off."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T14:02:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But that misses the point, which is that the only possible reason for making LV-Ns get hot was to make it much harder to use them.
