With some contracts - so far, I\u0027ve mainly had this problem with equipment tests for the R\u0026amp;D vendor - I will complete the test and satisfy all parameters, get the green text that says the contract was completed, end the mission, recover the craft, go back to mission control - and there\u0027s the same contract in my \u0027active\u0027 list, waiting to be completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has happened repeatedly with parachutes and solid fuel boosters tests for the R\u0026amp;D vendor.\u00A0 If you need a gameplay video I can probably make one, since it seems to happen consistently.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t diligently tracked what\u0027s happening to my funds and reputation balances (or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E local time) through all this, so I can\u0027t tell you if the entire game is simply reverting to an earlier state or not. But I can\u0027t imagine why it would happen with equipment test contracts and not with, say, orbital rescues which don\u0027t seem to have the same issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Shutting the PS4 down completely and restarting it apparently fixed the problem with one of the contracts - when I flew the same \u0022haul the parachute up to 5-8k meters\u0022 mission again, it registered as completed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-23T22:27:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2018 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Flash Wilbury\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore info - after restarting console\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"unami","CreatedById":158013,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-18T21:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2018m having the same bug here.
