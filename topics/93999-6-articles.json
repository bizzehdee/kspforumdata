Sorry for shouting but this is a FANTASTIC mod! I have patiently waited an eternity for a legit Saturn addon to this game, this comes the closest to it. Beautiful work with the RAM-friendliness as well. Makes a journey to Jool look wimpy! I only wish you guys had the moons as well but this is still pretty cool. You mentioned you were working on them - I would like to put in a personal request for Titan (Saturn\u0027s moon) to be #1 on the list! That moon would be really cool in KSP, I heard if humans went there they could flap their arms like a bird and fly because of the dense atmosphere, would make an interesting target to land on. \u003Cp\u003ESaturn has several moons (Mimas which looks like the death star, Enceladus), you guys could infinitely update this mod with new moons to land on around Saturn (or \u0022Sarnus\u0022 as you guys call it!). Instead of Jool 5 challenge on the forums I sense a \u003Cstrong\u003ESarnus 7 challenge\u003C/strong\u003E coming...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m so pumped for this, I had a quick peak today and put one of my trusty interstellar ships in orbit for a voyage to Saturn. Thanks for making this. I\u0027m also a game developer myself (I don\u0027t do KSP mods though as I like to play this for fun). You guys should open a donation channel (if SQUAD doesn\u0027t frown on things like that is otherwise ignore this), I would gladly donate for your time in doing these mods, I would like to see the moons get finished although you guys said you are working on it already. I am going to be checking this mod constantly now for updates!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jasonden\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jasonden\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAgreed; Kerbal Titan would be totally awesome. To have similar landforms to our Titan (see my pic at left), put seas/lakes at the poles and sand dunes around the equator. Low gravity, thick atmosphere. And -- I know this might be hard, but given the atmospheric methane you could make a jet engine work there, but it would run entirely on OXIDIZER, and not need any fuel.

Eve/Laythe already cover all the major features of Titan. Thick atmosphere, strange oceans/lakes of who knows what, moon with liquid oceans, etc. We wanted to make something more unique than just a Eve/Laythe combo. That being said, certain aspects of Titan that Eve or Laythe have not yet covered will find their way into some of the three gas giants\u0027 moons. But you\u0027ll find out about that as this mod develops.

Maybe instead of moving Eeloo, adding a new planet where you are moving Eeloo to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m trying to only install mods via CKAN.
