It applies to the game instead of the vessel, so if I lock my interplanetary probe and switch away to a new launch, I have to unlock staging. Then, when I switch back to my interplanetary probe, I\u0027ll accidentally hit the stage button and blow the thing in half with most of its fuel unattached to the probe core. Then comes the wailing\u00A0and the lamenting and the tearing of clothing. Anyway, my point: stage lock is a great feature that should be a property of vessels instead of a property of the whole game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gnoyze","CreatedById":148078,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T07:21:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBump.
