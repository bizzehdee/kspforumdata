I need to be able to dock it with the larger contructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it is a Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank plus a couple of radially mounted Thud engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause is quite large, I have chosen to use Vernors as my RCS. The odd thing is that, while they work well enough to translate forwards and backwards, when I use the I/J/K/L keys, the Vernors only puff. They won\u0027t provide a steady lateral thrust, and I have to keep tapping the keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that part of the design?

I had this Problems also with 1.0.2 as well, but seems to grow with newest MJ Releases as with 1.0.3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso if you used the \u0022use rcs for Rotation\u0022 in smartRCS, dont believe the Settings that are shown as active. sometimes this button used to toggle the function for rcs throttling and had no effect on the Rotation, sometimes it worked well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebest try: disable a rcs port, try different Settings in smart rcs, use ur rcs while engine is throttled to 0, and check if the rcs got re-enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei know, that seems to be a bit offtopic, but proves that MJ is not doing what it is intended to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile i really consider of deactivating MJ.... spended 6hours on this error last night.. not joking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etry to dock a 10.000 kg ship with tweakscaled RCS ports that fire on each short press with 400% thrust... it\u0027s just no fun anymore.... and you cant disable as you dont know what Option u turned on by clicking the (i.e.) \u0022RCS for throttle\u0022 button...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehope you got my point\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T11:37:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, MJ\u0027s RCS ballancing and smart rcs was broken for me since 1.0.2.
