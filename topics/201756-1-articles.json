Constantly wondering, what\u0027s next? Kerbal children all across the world share this dream, playing as the explorers of old, but now, look up to Mun, Minmus and beyond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0There are many different Space agencies, But the most famous is called the KSP, mainly located on a peninsula on the equator called \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, making spaceflight much easier than RosKosmos\u0027 launches at the Woomerang facilities.

(That\u0027s why it\u0027s so unstable with N-body physics.) Under the ice, it may still have on ocean, maybe even with\u00A0 life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-16T18:33:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2021 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Wizard Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
