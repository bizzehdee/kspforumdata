I flew out with the part in the inventory, and I have an engineer. The contract asks me to attach the OX-4W 3x2 to an aging satellite orbiting the Mun.\u00A0 However, Bill cannot carry the part because it is too big to fit in his pack.\u00A0 The only way he can carry it is by removing the jet pack, which means he cannot do a controlled spacewalk.\u00A0 Is this an issue with him not having enough experience points?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is the case, is there a list of what the specific experience levels and capabilities are?\u00A0 The Wiki is rather vague:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, I am not sure what to do here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlpacaMall","CreatedById":209127,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-26T22:21:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo matter what, Bill won\u2019t be able to carry the panel in his inventory.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you\u2019re supposed to do: Kerbals can access ship cargo while on EVA.
