Could the same process of formation the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus be the same? In my opinion, it makes sence, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCns greater gravitational influence and size could of flung Minmus into a more, inclined and eccentric orbit around Kerbin, making Kerbin\u0027s moon system\u0027s formation just like ours except the other moon being flung out farther.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all, it\u0027s just a theory, but what do you all think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T18:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, too bad our Moon was such a hungry hungry hippo.
