Aesthetic preferences are pretty much the only reason to favor the LV-909 over the 48-7S, as the former fits better in an 1.25 m stack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The RT-10 is just too small and short-lived for anything but silly contraptions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the engines are quite useful for one purpose or another.

Sometimes I use them in landers as well. As small radial engines, it\u0027s easy to place them almost anywhere, and they\u0027re also quite powerful.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The 48-7S is small, powerful, and quite efficient. It\u0027s the engine of choice for small landers, if ease of use is more important than maximal efficiency. Its main drawback is that it\u0027s a small inline engine: using more than one of them usually requires ugly hacks that unnecessarily increase the part count.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The LV-T30 and the LV-T45 are general-purpose engines. I mostly use them in small launchers, with an LV-T45 in the lower stage and LV-T30s in the boosters. Their shape is a bit unwieldy for using them in space.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The Aerospike is the right engine for one-kerbal Eve landers. It could be useful as a vacuum engine, but because there is no attachment node in the bottom, you usually need at least two of them, and you rarely need that much thrust in vacuum.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The LV-N is the ultimate vacuum engine for large payloads and/or high delta-v requirements. Its much more efficient than any other engine using LF/O, and the TWR is high enough for landing on most bodies. The shape of the engine is very unwieldy, however, so you\u0027ll almost always need at least two of them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The Poodle is a good upper stage engine for a large range of common payloads. It\u0027s also useful as a transfer stage engine to Mun and Minmus, as well as for giving the initial boost for interplanetary transfers from low orbits. I don\u0027t use it in landers, because nuclear engines are almost always a better choice, if you need that much thrust.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The Skipper is another general-purpose engine. I use it in the lower stages of small rockets, in the upper stages of larger rockets, and sometimes also for giving the initial boost for interplanetary transfers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The Mainsail has become a niche engine. I sometimes use it as a booster engine in medium rockets, where the higher thrust of the LFB is not as important as the higher Isp of the Mainsail. It might be a good engine for large Eve landers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The LFB is obviously a booster engine for uses, where raw power is more important than efficiency. As the 3.75 m engines are all too weak, I often use LFBs to allow these big rockets lift off with a useful amount of fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The KR-2L is yet another general-purpose engine that can be used when the Skipper becomes too weak.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The KS-25x4 is the most powerful stock engine there is. It\u0027s useful for the lower stages and the boosters of large rockets.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The two larger SRBs are obviously useful as boosters. In smaller rockets, I often adjust their thrust down to avoid the TWR dropping too low when the boosters burn out. In larger rockets, a bunch of SRBs can be useful for increasing the initial TWR a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The PB-ION is hard to use properly. It\u0027s very efficient, and even the TWR is high enough for landing on the Mun. With larger xenon containers, the ion engine would replace nuclear engines in transfer stages, but now its mostly useful for small ships.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there are the airbreathing engines.

I use that engine all the time, because stock has a big gap between 200 and 600 KN of thrust.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock solution to that is either using dual LV-T30s for 430 kN of thrust with 2.5 tonnes of engine mass, or using a tweaked Skipper for 0-650 kN of thrust with 3 tonnes of engine mass. Surely their specific impulses are a bit lower than with the dedicated vacuum engines, but that\u0027s just a 5% difference in delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, you can always use engines that are too powerful for the task, as long as they are not too heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T21:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022steve_v\u0022 data-cite=\u0022steve_v\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0027A reasonable engine for rough economic times\u0022 pretty much sums up my use for the poodle - disposable 2.5m upper stages.\u003Cp\u003ENot sure I agree on the 909 though, it\u0027s pretty handy - especialy early in a career game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour\u0027e right, the LV 909 is cool! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T00:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem is that players are calling for re-balances and stating the engine is \u0022really useless\u0022 because it doesn\u0027t fit \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E play-style. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, there\u0027s three things coming together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E the 38-7S is way overpowered -- in almost every use case where the 909 or Poodle should rule, the 38-7S is better.

The other two are arguably a question of playstyle, but I\u0027m of the opinion that the game is funneling the players\u0027 decisions towards designs where the Poodle would be out of place. Just for the fun of it, browse the last handful of Jool-5 submissions (link in my signature) and the designs people are coming up with. I guess you\u0027ll be hard put to find anything that could have been built as well or better with a Poodle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
