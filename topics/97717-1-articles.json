Test tracks, rally tracks, icy, or even a city with a couple of streets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I would love to be able to change the texture, smoothness and height of certain parts of Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to select a square of ground, then be able to lift it or dig into the ground, or simply turn it black and smooth for a road to be build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf possible, I\u0027d even love more to be able to separate what I lift from the ground, and tweak the mass of the resulting object. It would make the perfect sandbox combination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I also would love to see my Kerbals able to throw things (whack a Kerbal-like balls, but with tweakable textures) in 1st person view, for example by creating a mode where the camera is controled with the mouse, if possible with a reticle at pointing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome other stuff would be fun to have as mods :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Creating more objects, simple objects that Kerbals can simply grab, put on the floor, and use. Chairs, tables, any 3D model that the player wants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Gardening system on Kerbin, seasons, weather (growing trees, flowers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Building making during EVA (would be possible with suggestion n\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B02)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Having animals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Being able to give the Kerbal flying abilities (tweable jetpack with enormous potential power)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Slowing down time (max. 100 times, would be useful for cars, as well as for some fighting mods that could appear with such an engine )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Having a mode where the mouse can grab anything with left_click and move camera with right_click, in order to move objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith these suggestions and mostly with such a community, I believe that this game could become one of the best sandbox / simulation game ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading and, in advance, for reacting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Robs\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
