And maybe say there could be a conflict with some mods when crp is present.. Since I\u0027m using crp and not experiencing this bug. It\u0027s not right to blame another mod and push people away from it unless you can absolutely prove it\u0027s that specific mod. A lot of people use mks and crp, so if it was crp causing this I would expect this thread to have a few more people posting they are experiencing this problem.

Is that your complete list of mods you were using at the time in the pic on the op you made when you first got the bug?\n\nwhat are your repro steps? I mean is it pretty much happening on any launch? Like the first one all the time or sometimes after a couple? And are you doing anything special in the launch? Reverting from a certain spot when it happens? What kind of parts on the craft?\n\ni did quite a few with just USI LS and mks kolonization. And didn\u0027t have issues using a couple different stock craft and one satellite I made. I reverted from all over too. Launchpad without launching and in flight, suborbital, orbital, reentry.\n\nAre you using any mod that interacts with the parts list? Like a sorter or something that can hide certain parts if wanted? I noticed tweakable everything and something on the parts list that you drag custom parts too. Is that from something else or tweakable everything?\n\nill try and see if I can get the problem when I add Some of your mods listed in op in a few mins.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T18:14:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"},{"CreatedByName":"falco1010","CreatedById":133508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:20:17Z","Content":"Yes, it\u0027s the complete list.
