Like a sorter or something that can hide certain parts if wanted? I noticed tweakable everything and something on the parts list that you drag custom parts too. Is that from something else or tweakable everything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eill try and see if I can get the problem when I add Some of your mods listed in op in a few mins.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T18:14:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falco1010","CreatedById":133508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, it\u0027s the complete list. For the reproduction steps, reverting from any point, with any craft, at any given time cause the bug but sometimes the bug don\u0027t appears at the first place but after restarting the game. I do have one mods that is interacting with the part list wich is QuickScroll that allows me to scroll to a specific page using the mouse scroll. I\u0027m not sure if editor extensions modify the parts list but it could.

But so far I tested installing a few of the mods you had. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy my original install had only mks (the kolonization one). Crp, Firespitter, usi tools, and USI life support. So only USI mods plus module manager. I did all my tests in sandbox to have access to full facilities and all the stock craft files. I don\u0027t think sandbox vs career should make a difference. I did a handful of launches and reverts like idk 5 or so each time. Flew for a bit, got to space and just reverted without landing. I was not able to get through all of the mods listed yet. But tried to start with some listed in both the first two posts on this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei saw no issues with the above mods I have installed nor when I added the following mods. Editor extensions, tweakable everything, quick scroll, stock bug fix module, or Kerbal joint reinforcement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso far no instance of this bug yet. When I get a chance I\u0027ll keep trying with other mods to see if I can get it. One note is I just used stock KSP craft files on my test so I didn\u0027t use any added parts or anything. Like I did use quick scroll functions. But didn\u0027t do anything with say editor extensions or tweakable everything. Just launched and reverted with stock crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falco1010","CreatedById":133508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T07:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for helping me ! You don\u0027t really have to test each situation, just create a craft with one part and revert at the beginning, it will be easier and quicker to test. Testing like that will allow you to use parts of other mods quicker too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:42:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will see what I have for notes...and get back...I barely recall I had the problem with MKS, but in my case I am redoing the cfg files for different resource generation methods...it was something to do with maybe an effects module missing/added, or a missing texture; some wierd error in a part; use alt-f2 and run the program until you just get the bug with the least amount of parts; I dont have those extra folders in CRP and I barely recall if having that and the Regolith resource was my problem in this case; in my case I am trying to add Rego resource generation as well but have to change a few cfg files in that folder and I can get it to work (maybe I havnt messed with it again yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will readd the folders and try this and see if the big crops up; it could be a resource problem or a part problem; alt-f2 should narrow it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECmdr Zeta\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falco1010","CreatedById":133508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T12:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Nope, the bug reappeared.
