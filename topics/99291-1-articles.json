So, my idea is to add this limitation to the stock engines with variability, which would further balance parts, such as the lvt 30 and lvt 45. The 45 has a higher mass and lower thrust, with only gimbaling to show. In this example, the 30 would have a minimum of 90%, while the 45 has a value somewhere in the range of 50-70%. This makes the 45 an engine for precision, while the 30 is just raw power. That way you have better precision with some engines at maneuver nodes, as well as having more power control where it counts, like terminal velocity or landing, than others. You would still be able to turn an engine off, but once you relight, it *no pun intended* will take off to its minimum thrust value. I haven\u0027t the slightest clue how to make a mod, and the tutorials leave me clueless, so I think it would be better for someone else to carry a project like his out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T17:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShh!
