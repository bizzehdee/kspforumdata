So, what do you guys think this could be? I have a few guesses:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpgrading buildings - They\u0027ve laid the groundwork for giving buildings multiple models. We have the regular model, and the destroyed model. Next, there would be various levels of each building as it\u0027s upgraded (VAB gets bigger, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Towns and Cities - I think we\u0027ve all wanted the rest of Kerbin to actually have signs of civilization. I mean, do they all live underground or something? We could be getting actual towns and cities next, and with that, something to avoid when landing. Instead of just plopping your ship down anywhere, you now have to avoid crashing into cities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgressive damage on parts - perhaps the groundwork that was laid was the idea that parts have a damage threshhold. They can take a certain amount of light, repeated beating, before they need repairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is on number 1, but I think i\u0027d hope for number 2 the most. Any other ideas?

Giving a part different states based on how much of its toughness remains can allow for many possibilities:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine trying to pump all your fuel out of a damaged burning fuel tank before it explodes to minimize the damage done to the rest of your craft. (or dropping that stage entirely)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr getting out to try and doing repairs after a failed docking attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe they will add effects to this damaged state... damaged engines providing reduced isp and thrust in a different direction till repaired etc... damaged fuel tanks bleeding fuel... landing gear not deploying... solar cells reduced power... or just pain ole not being able to control those parts anymore...there are endless possibilities with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe they will add more depth to the actual destruction of parts... is it better for a fueltank to instantly disapear in an explosion, scattering everything that was attached to it? Or to have it explode and leave a burnt out structure behind, with the other surviving parts still attached? EDIT: I doubt this last one though, unless unity can allow for an object to change its model on the fly, it would probably require rebuilding of the craft on the fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-27T17:28:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2014 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DundraL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T18:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally am hoping for deformable terrain, but I don\u0027t think destructible buildings is a direct precursor to that, so unfortunately that probably isn\u0027t it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I want my crashed Mun lander to make a crater darn it!
