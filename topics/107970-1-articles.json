And yeah, I like Career mode. Which is a bit difficult. But I\u0027ve tried to go back to Science or Sandbox, and egh, I can\u0027t really take that.\n\nSo I\u0027m continuing with Career, and I\u0027m having trouble going to orbit. I\u0027d like to try to do it with SAS.\n\nDespite manning my rocket propelled spaceship with a Pilot, I don\u0027t get SAS enabled.\n\nWhat am I missing?"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:30:43Z","Content":"Do you get an error saying that you don\u0027t have a pilot on board? Specifically even if you have a kerbal onboard unless they have the \u0027pilot\u0027 role you will not be able to use SAS.\n\nOr are you talking about not getting the little list of orientations when you turn SAS on? In that case, those only unlock as your pilot gains experience."},{"CreatedByName":"Garius","CreatedById":142266,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:10:11Z","Content":"Having a pilot should allow you to turn SAS on, but they will only have Stability assist to start (ie it will kill rotation but won\u0027t prograde/retrograde/etc hold). As the pilot gets experience you get Prograde/Retrograde at level 1, Normal and Radial (and their Antis) at 2 and manoeuvre/target at 3.\n\nIf you have a pilot and pressing T gives the error message that no SAS is available... That sounds like a bug"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaerwek","CreatedById":143220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T12:06:08Z","Content":"What I do is try to click the SAS button which is located at the top right of the Navball. When I do that with a Pilot, I get a red text message stating \u0027No Target\u0027.\n\nAFAIK the SAS button should lit yellow, but it doesn\u0027t do that either."},{"CreatedByName":"Deflinek","CreatedById":143127,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:14:49Z","Content":"The top button on NavBall changes display of your velocity and it may say \u0022no target\u0022 if you don\u0027t have any... well target (like other vessel to dock). The default key binding for SAS is \u0027T\u0027 that I think is the only way to enable it."},{"CreatedByName":"Kaerwek","CreatedById":143220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:39:10Z","Content":"Top right, the one that says \u0027SAS\u0027, if I read it right."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T20:28:29Z","Content":"The thing you are trying to click on is only an indicator light. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Toggle SAS on and off with the T key, as Deflinek is advising.
