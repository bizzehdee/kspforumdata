Your idea, uses the main engine to provide the majority of thrust and determine the TWR of the rocket. The radial rockets in asparasgus set up, initially act with an acceleration of 0. Since they have TWR of 1 themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do believe that there is a flaw though, when dealing with delta V or TWR, they all treat each individual stage as a whole entity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as physics is concerned, its only interested in your total thrust provided by all your firing engines. so the TWR ratio of any individual part effectively does not matter. I do believe it would effect stability, I don\u0027t know how much physics is in the game, but in real life there would be differences in stress through the rocket depending on where the thrust came from, and was applied to the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of delta V, I don\u0027t think it makes any difference, if u use smaller engines to achieve a twr of 1 with radial fuel tanks, you will in fact with each stage, be dropping less mass, since the central engine would need to be larger to provide TWR for takeoff. Goal usualy is to drop a high proportion of mass in your first stages than you do in the next stages. I always personally feel people do Asparagus wrong, because they simply copy the same engine and fuel tank then multiply it round. I think this is inefficient use of staging, the advantage of asparasgus staging is not delta V, its being able to use all your engines at once to provide thrust through the launch. Because you have all engines firing, you can use less engines overall, because you have less deadweight engines in upper stages. Extra delta V comes from using more small efficient engines and less deadweight engines, it does not come from using fuel more efficiency. Your simply reducing the mass needed, because more engines are being used than in an apollo style set up, that uses one engine at a time, every engine above is a deadweight. I\u0027m not good at explaining but I hope that makes sense. only other way I can explain it this, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say u have three engines, one main rocket, two boosters on the side. Without the fuel pumps, your max thrust assuming engines have a thrust of 200 is 400 for the boosters. But with fuel pumps, you can use the third engine as part of the booster stage. Provides total thrust of 600. Allows for extra 200 thrust of extra fuel, in that stage, equals more delta V. Main stage still has a thrust of 200. Of course if u didn\u0027t use fuel pumps, still fired all three engines, u would have 600 and the extra fuel from that 600 thrust. But you would only have one stage, not two stages. Assuming that its more efficient to stage with the given fuel mass and total mass your using, this would reduce your delta V. Do you see what I mean by, its not fuel efficiency, its engine use efficiency that provides the extra delta V, in asparagus. The way in which u were thinking of getting more fuel, by using your thrust efficiency is actually on the right track of how asparagus works.

For space-only operation TWR is only relevant to burn-time, while at launch it is critical from the start. None of this is specific to asparagus staging though - it applies to all strategies except serial and radial (where only one stage can burn at a time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space: the core has to be able to provide \u0027acceptable\u0027 TWR on its own and, as you say, the role of any other stages is simply to provide additional fuel. The mass of that fuel reduces the TWR though, so add drop-tanks as long as you can, with additional engines only where the TWR drops below an acceptable level. Since engines are discreet units that\u0027s likely to give you more TWR than you want/need so add additional drop tanks again in any later stages. If that\u0027s what you mean then, yes, I entirely concurr - especially don\u0027t carry engines you don\u0027t need and jettison them as early as possible because their dead-mass is even worse than empty tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor launch: As you have written in other places the TWR considerations are different at different launch-phases. From Kerbin you want a high TWR at the start but don\u0027t need so much for the final push to apoapsis and circularisation. As such the core should only be designed to give you the TWR for that final part of the flight, since that\u0027s where it will be used alone. Earlier stage(s) should have exactly those engines required to maintain the necessary TWR for their flight-phase but if you are splitting fuel-load to ditch used tank-mass and the \u0027inner\u0027 engines already provide enough thrust then, yes, make the stage drop-tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a case of trying to maintain some required TWR but balancing the fuel-load and engine-mass in each stage. As has been long noted if you make each stage a clone of inner ones the TWR must decrease all the time. As an antidote I try to put all the engine-power I can on later stages and make earlier ones comparatively underpowered or even slack tanks.

Your idea, uses the main engine to provide the majority of thrust and determine the TWR of the rocket. The radial rockets in asparasgus set up, initially act with an acceleration of 0. Since they have TWR of 1 themselves. \u003Cp\u003EI do believe that there is a flaw though, when dealing with delta V or TWR, they all treat each individual stage as a whole entity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as physics is concerned, its only interested in your total thrust provided by all your firing engines. so the TWR ratio of any individual part effectively does not matter. I do believe it would effect stability, I don\u0027t know how much physics is in the game, but in real life there would be differences in stress through the rocket depending on where the thrust came from, and was applied to the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of delta V, I don\u0027t think it makes any difference, if u use smaller engines to achieve a twr of 1 with radial fuel tanks, you will in fact with each stage, be dropping less mass, since the central engine would need to be larger to provide TWR for takeoff. Goal usualy is to drop a high proportion of mass in your first stages than you do in the next stages. I always personally feel people do Asparagus wrong, because they simply copy the same engine and fuel tank then multiply it round. I think this is inefficient use of staging, the advantage of asparasgus staging is not delta V, its being able to use all your engines at once to provide thrust through the launch. Because you have all engines firing, you can use less engines overall, because you have less deadweight engines in upper stages. Extra delta V comes from using more small efficient engines and less deadweight engines, it does not come from using fuel more efficiency. Your simply reducing the mass needed, because more engines are being used than in an apollo style set up, that uses one engine at a time, every engine above is a deadweight. I\u0027m not good at explaining but I hope that makes sense. only other way I can explain it this, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say u have three engines, one main rocket, two boosters on the side. Without the fuel pumps, your max thrust assuming engines have a thrust of 200 is 400 for the boosters. But with fuel pumps, you can use the third engine as part of the booster stage. Provides total thrust of 600. Allows for extra 200 thrust of extra fuel, in that stage, equals more delta V. Main stage still has a thrust of 200. Of course if u didn\u0027t use fuel pumps, still fired all three engines, u would have 600 and the extra fuel from that 600 thrust. But you would only have one stage, not two stages. Assuming that its more efficient to stage with the given fuel mass and total mass your using, this would reduce your delta V. Do you see what I mean by, its not fuel efficiency, its engine use efficiency that provides the extra delta V, in asparagus. The way in which u were thinking of getting more fuel, by using your thrust efficiency is actually on the right track of how asparagus works. At least in my opinion anyway, not like I\u0027m a rocket scientist, my instincts tell me that\u0027s why it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoonfrog,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The error in this train of thought is that more thrust does not equal more DV. Whether you have a single engine or a dozen, they will all yield the same DV for a given quantity of fuel given the same Isp, since the DV is actually a function of the Isp and mass ratio. Arguably, the total DV is actually *reduced* by adding engines, since they are mass that is not fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The efficiency is mostly as you say; \u003Cem\u003Eusing\u003C/em\u003E engines instead of lifting them as cargo.
