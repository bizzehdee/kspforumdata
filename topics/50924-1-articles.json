If not, use this: ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust pop in your destination and the height of your orbit. The phase angle is the angle that you need the planets to be apart. For example, if the phase angle is positive on the diagram, you need your destination to be that many degrees IN FRONT of Kerbin. Likewise, any negative numbers mean that the target planet needs to be BEHIND Kerbin. The ejection angle is the angle at which you need to burn relative to Kerbin\u0027s prograde direction. Move the camera so that Kerbin\u0027s prograde (the direction it\u0027s going in) is at the top, and measure the ejection angle FROM the prograde line. That\u0027s where you put a manuever node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T11:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do it by setting up the transfer maneuver for the target orbig and checking how far the planet will be.

Just estimating the orbits with the link provided in the 2nd post is your best bet. ~45 degrees for Duna, ~90 for Jool. It varies drastically from planet to planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso any planet with an orbit lower than the current bodies orbit you are at (ex, Eve is lower than Kerbin.) needs to be behind you when you burn. Anything higher will need to be in front of you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
