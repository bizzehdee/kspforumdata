It causes the vessel (parent and target) to wobble around if their masses aren\u0027t large enough, it results in different roll so if you want symmetry and proper solar panel alignment, you\u0027re gonna have a bad day with constant undocking and docking. This is particularly important with larger lateral structures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly perfectly aligned vessels will approach and immediately snap together so the whole experience is like uncanny valley of the robotics - n00bs are ok with it and extreme pros are ok with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d reduce it to a more comfortable level.

I had no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E as my intention was to simply decouple, flip 180 degrees, then just nudge retrograde to dock. Unfortunately, the engine fairing attached to the separator was non-collision, so I could knock it away soon enough. The docking ports started drawing together hard and fast, managing to sandwich the separator between them. It took some finagling and acrobatics to pull apart; the forces were that strong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this case, the strong forces helped in the end since I didn\u0027t have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E (whipping the landing pod around earlier didn\u0027t help alignment matters). But yeah, the forces were absurdly strong for the vessel masses I was working with. (It was a Kerbal X-derived command module and a very basic Mk1 lander can-based lander.) Advanced Tweakable for capture distance and strength would be useful. (TweakEverything provided this, I believe.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
