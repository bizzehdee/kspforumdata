Unless, you\u0027re doing a Jool-5 missions in which you\u0027re hitting all 6 bodies in one go, you\u0027re probably sending multiple crafts to the Jool system throughout your game play. I ended up sending 10 ships to Jool (two Tylo landers, three Laythe spaceplanes, 1 Bop/Pol/Vall lander, 4 refueling/labs) over the course of gameplay, each one with all the science instruments. Since they all need to be aerocaptured, that\u0027s 10 sets of low-altitude data-- more than enough to get max science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you can do if you really want to milk Jool\u0027s low-altitude science is to use Laythe or Tylo as a gravity-assist to sling you into an orbit with an Ap just inside Jool\u0027s SOI. With an Ap that high, you\u0027re going to have more than enough velocity to safely dip below 120km and emerge again. I\u0027ve used this to Jool-dive as far down as 105km and still make it out. Since Tylo is so large, near to Jool, and has a periodic orbit that can be predicted (see the orbital resonance sheet in my signature), it makes a very attractive gravity-assist target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T16:06:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo. On Jool, you don\u0027t need to be suborbital to get a \u0022flying at\u0022 result.
