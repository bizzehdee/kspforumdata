You cannot make LiquidFuel from water because you need a lot of carbon to go with that.

The only difference will come from the tank weight. However looking that a RL tank which holds 100t LH2 (1479m3) and 630t LOX (553m3) weighs only 27 ton. A ksp tank which holds 100t LF weighs 15t.

Now this is important - the engine needs 45/55 ratio, but the isru refinery will produce something like 20/80, so it makes completely no sense to refine anywhere else but the place of water extraction, otherwise you\u0027ll be carrying 40% oxidiser you don\u0027t need.
