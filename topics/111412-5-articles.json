Was it the only mod added and it worked fine before you added my mod? If so, can you please remove that KSPAPI thing and try it again?\u003Cbr\u003E\n***I see the hire go off successfully. My hire mod only creates a kerbal (and saves it as a stock kerbal) so it doesn\u0027t touch contracts and should be viewed as a stock kerbal. I went out of my way to make it so if you removed my mod nothing bad would happen, the game would go on as normal. But I honestly, even after parsing the full log and finding those errors do not see how my mod would cause the contracts to vanish....\u003Cbr\u003E\n***So I am at a bit of a loss? Did you perhaps add CivPop at the same time as my mod? Just curious....\u003Cbr\u003E\n***PS: Do they vanish if you just go and fly another ship? not launch a new one?
