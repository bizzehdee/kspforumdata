One, please remove KSPAPI extensions from the Civilian Population mod folder. This is no longer a valid dll and several other mods ( MechJeb/Contract configurator) are getting exceptions from it because they still make obsolete calls or calls made get redirected to this invalid dll which shouldn\u0027t be in that mod anymore anyway.*  \n\n    I\u0027ll remove this mod for now I haven\u0027t used it yet.\n\n    *\\*\\*\\*Two: Deep Freeze seems to have it\u0027s own tracking of kerbals some how not sure if this is relevant.*  \n\nI\u0027ll do a test in a test carreer,I however need this to get my plans going for a colony/settlement on Eeloo\n\n\\*\\*\\*Three: I\u0027m seeing sections of contract configurator that are failing left and right in the log.  \n\nI\u0027ll have a look and maybe remove the mod\n\n*\\*\\*\\*Four: You have a few remote tech issues it looks like, unsure how that might relate*  \n\nIt could be an issue with some of my interplanetary probes\n\n*\\*\\*\\*Five: At some point in your \u0027Launch\u0027 command every dll and mod is reloaded for no obvious reason... and I have no idea why or what mod is doing this.*  \n\nNo idea myself.  \n\n*\\*\\*\\*So my big question for you is... does this only happen if my mod is added? Was it the only mod added and it worked fine before you added my mod? If so, can you please remove that KSPAPI thing and try it again?\\*\\*\\*I see the hire go off successfully. My hire mod only creates a kerbal (and saves it as a stock kerbal) so it doesn\u0027t touch contracts and should be viewed as a stock kerbal. I went out of my way to make it so if you removed my mod nothing bad would happen, the game would go on as normal. But I honestly, even after parsing the full log and finding those errors do not see how my mod would cause the contracts to vanish....\\*\\*\\*So I am at a bit of a loss? Did you perhaps add CivPop at the same time as my mod? Just curious....\\*\\*\\*PS: Do they vanish if you just go and fly another ship? not launch a new one? I have a hunch that the reload of all the mods/assembly at the \u0027launch\u0027 function are the issues, maybe... just a guess.*\n\nYour mod was **the last one I added**.  \n\nRemote-tech and deep freeze have been a staple of my carreers for a long time.  \n\nI added civ pop when it got picked up for post-1.1\n\nThe vanish happened appearantly when scene changes occur, but only when does scene changes are from an active vessel to the KSC, my xp with the issue suggest it happens when returning to KSC after launch,or returning to the KSC after loading an active vessel from tracking station\n\nScene changes within KSC do not seem to affect the issue.\n\nMost likely the issue was present before I tried your recent version, and your mod just brought it to the surface.\n\nI\u0027ll have a second look at log with your comments in mind\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-16T07:34:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2016 07:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Resender**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheReadPanda","CreatedById":142617,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T14:26:14Z","Content":"[@Resender](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/18274-resender/) Even if it is not my mod I am glad to try to help. Remote tech isn\u0027t really throwing many errors per se just HUGE amounts of log spam from what I can see, but contract configurator is throwing lots of errors. The question about deep freeze is unlikely to be relevant after re-parsing the log. Removing CivPop or at least the KSPAPI component is a good idea until they fix that.\n\nBut I honestly have no idea about that with the contracts vanishing.
