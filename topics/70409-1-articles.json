I am going to warn before hand this does have a religion based question. I am NOT in anyway trying to start a religious debate and ask that this remains clean and on topic that I could receive opinions and the mods not lock this thread up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we have that established... I have decided to write out something. Something that basically lays out my personal beliefs. But could also be used by others. For example, some of the greatest scientific debates have been done by people who are athiest. The problem is not all atheists agree on each others beliefs. Christianity though, has a common belief background... The bible. Islam the Koran. (or Muslim sorry if I\u0027m wrong) anyway. I though I might try to give it a shot. I\u0027m not sure what you would call this though. Would you call it a new religion? Would you call it a \u0022bible\u0022 for athiests? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain moderators. I\u0027m not trying to start anything or cause problems. Simply trying to expand my writing skills by working on a project you could call it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for anyones help and ideas just remember please keep it clean and play nice.
