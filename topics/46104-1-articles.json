Placing items in the cfg file and getting them to look right is a fairly trivial exercise at this point so long as I\u0027ve measured and calculated my trig values correctly. I am now in need of advice for getting attachment node configurations correct. Placing regular nodes is fine, once again a matter of measure/calculate. However getting things to stay attached to a complex part is vexing. For example, I have a bay made of many 1x1 panels and when i try to attach something to the edge such as a moveable door, the part disappears when I exit the VAB. How can i get items to truly attach and stay that way. Items attached to the standard to and bottom nodes do not disappear. I am including a link to my earlier forum post, and apologize for the long form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/49944-Welding-from-craft-files-and-nodes-on-complex-structures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/49944-Welding-from-craft-files-and-nodes-on-complex-structures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alskari","CreatedById":57638,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T16:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA part disappearing or changing on exit from the VAB sounds like you may have a naming problem in your .cfg file.

In my experience it is the direction of the last node in the list.

Yeah, I placed an extra row of panels on this one (x-direction) and noticed that things were attaching to the original configuration. So you saved me twice on this one.
