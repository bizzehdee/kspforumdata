The door and master can usually be forced even if you don\u0027t have the key, at least on older models, and unlike jets, a prop will start on demand, and I can be\u00A0wheels off in minutes. I have enough experience with both trikes and tail-draggers to know that I can take off on whatever\u0027s available, and I\u0027d have better than even odds of walking away from the landing, even if I have to land in the field on an unfamiliar aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, a lot of larger airports, even if they have some GA aircraft, would have them quite far from passenger terminals. So there\u0027s a pretty big question on that option even being available. Outside of that, idea of getting a raft from one of the regional jets, which have them stored separately, rather than build into the doors, is tempting. But odds of holding onto a raft seem low. You\u0027re more likely to be trampled by panicked crowd when people fight over it. Vest does you little good, as if you stay in the water, hypothermia\u0027s the thing that will get you. Vests are only good if there will be enough rafts to pick up people shortly after, and odds of that are low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you want to be high and far from crowds. Roof of the terminal seems like the place to be, and probably try to find access point from outside, since everybody\u0027s going to be filling up stairs, etc. Getting into the jet and hoping it survives the surge, giving you opportunity to get into a life raft afterwards, feels like the last resort.

Tsunamis tend to involve a lot of debris flow, but that assumes there\u0027s debris around to be picked up. An airport on reclaimed land next to the sea would be a vast expanse of absolutely nothing, maybe a few signs and the odd towing truck, but not enough to form a sea of scrap massive enough to threaten the integrity of a passenger aircraft. Even bushes and small trees are cut down to keep birds away, and there wouldn\u0027t be boats docked in the water next to the airport either. The tsunami flowing into an airport would be relatively clear of debris, simply by virtue of there not being a lot of debris around. Then again, the aircraft might be dragged back to the sea when the tsunami recedes, so it\u0027s not a place to stay for long either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-18T20:50:21Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2018 08:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Codraroll\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-18T21:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223453591\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178392\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221537301534\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002285324\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wizzlebippi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n47 minutes ago, wizzlebippi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile both water and air are fluids, water is significantly denser.\u00A0 Even if the aircraft is facing the tsunami, fast moving water could easily exceed the dynamic pressure the aircraft is designed for.
