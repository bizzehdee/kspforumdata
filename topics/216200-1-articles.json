Modders really unlock the potential of KSP1 and managed to offer something more beautiful than a \u0022from scratch Pro Dev 2023 KSP2\u0022 which really is a shame. So they could be capable of miracle, really, but not by the same margin if the basis of KSP2 is completely out-dated. Future releases might help with HDRP and all the hot subjects that I don\u0027t know about, but I frankly doubt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, they will probably be able to offer some good enhancement that will help the game to look like a decent 2020\u002B game, in about 2-3 years, finger crossed and thanks in advance, modders !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-05T12:42:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2023 12:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Dakitess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferio","CreatedById":221176,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-05T13:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224269175\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221680698451\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289253\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dakitess\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, Dakitess said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m very very very pessimistic regarding the graphics potential of Vanilla KSP2. We are miles away from the 2019 cinematic trailer, which is OK to not get 100% of course, but we are, like, 5-10% at most of we\u0027ve seen. I\u0027ve been hopping for 25-35% and I don\u0027t think it will get that good in a decade of Vanilla dev.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m afraid so which is a huge disappointment.
