Now, a lot of people think it is a bit useless, being that the only current payload is Orion, which is rather roughly planned for now. (I think the SLS can be good if it is used wisely and reliably and can launch spacecraft that can give us great scientific results.) At the risk of discussing the \u0022Big Bad P\u0022 (politics), what do you think the future holds for SLS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the future of SLS kind of hinges on the success of its first flight in 2018 (recently delayed from 2017), considering that is the only planned flight before it begins to carry humans. Luckily, we have the opportunity for ground testing and computer simulations, not to mention that the SLS (particularly the core) is based on already-flown technology. (Although I\u0027m kind of suspicious about throwing away SSMEs, I\u0027m guessing that the RS-25E that will be used after the current stock of SSMES rests in pieces in an ocean will be cheaper.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf NASA can succeed in getting the public interested and the SLS can demonstrate success for its first flight, then NASA might have a good shot at getting a decent beyond-LEO program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, other missions are also proposed things to be put atop this monster of a rocket - a Europa probe would have to use a gravity assist trajectory with the Atlas V, AFAIK, so the SLS is being considered.

During Apollo almost the entire NASA budget went into that single program, and that amount of money was enormous. In 1966 NASA got about 6 billion \u00271966 dollars\u0027 (!), today they get about 17 and only roughly 2.5 goes to the SLS/Orion development.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T16:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne of the problems with all these projects is that they take forever\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that is sad \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T17:38:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne of the problems with all these projects is that they take forever, which is why there is ample room to cut into their budgets and cancel them. Orion has made its first flight this month. After eons of development. And the first manned flight is not expected to take place before 2020! That\u0027s six years from first unmanned flight (\u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E into the program\u0027s development) to first manned flight. The Apollo program took \u003Cem\u003Eeight\u003C/em\u003E years from announcement to reaching its objectives.

The SLS isn\u0027t a \u0022please contract me!\u0022 launcher like the ones the ULA operate, if NASA doesn\u0027t provide missions and payload for the SLS there is very little reason for its existence besides politics.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t NASA\u0027s job to lay out its own plans.
