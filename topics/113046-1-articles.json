It basically involves making kerbal a multilayer game and having factions or countries as it where. Each player would pick a side or maybe create there own faction/county and then begin the space program. Each researching and testing ships in there own way. Things like monkeys and other test specimen can be added to build up towards a manned mission to space. Other things could be added such as propergander to stunt the others research however these could also benefit the apposing players research if they fail to meet certain targets ect. The end goal of the game would be the first person to the Mun. However that would be a small victory as the game would not end there. Players could after this point begin to work together on creating space station and other such objects in the reaches of space. \n\nI feel the game really lacks a mutiplayer feature and this sort of cold war era style focus could really get peoples attention and give them something to aim for. The problem with a lot of space based games is they make you grind for resources where as here you would be trying out crazy designs trying to be more inventive and beat the other person to space and the mun. And once the competitive side has been one it is not just game over and now time to stop playing you can then work together making them game feel completely different and hopefully giving players hours of endless fun and great times reminiscing with there friends about how Boris build the most ridiculous machine but it still made it to space."}]}
