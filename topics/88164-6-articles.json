The actual game code tweaks the parts to simulate a better or worse pilot. That works fine in RPGs where a better swordfighter has a better chance to hit a monster. But that\u0027s mostly because it\u0027s *click to hit* and not a realistic 3d tracking system to swing the sword and a physics-based impact calculation system modelling armor etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is different. The bit I highlighted above is actually fallacious in KSP because I can take the craft, and calculate out whether or not it\u0027s possible to get the 71km periapsis with Kerbin. Irrespective of pilot. That\u0027s physically the best the craft can achieve, and KSP models physics well enough that one can perform that calculation. There\u0027s NO WAY to get better than that, not even with the best pilot ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt IS, however, very easy to get WORSE than that. And in fact, most human pilots would never be able to hit that perfect 71km periapsis. Which is why spaceships in Real Life are controlled by computers most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the example above, with the proposed changes to KSP, if I had that average pilot in the capsule trying desperately to get back to Kerbin, I could just send Jeb up on another ship, EVA him over to take over command, and suddenly the ship can achieve a periapsis of say 60km. Which completely breaks all the physics which KSP tries to cling onto. It has nothing to do with Jeb being the better pilot, and that\u0027s what has people so upset over these proposed perks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draft","CreatedById":72633,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T05:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maxmaps\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Maxmaps\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd that\u0027s kinda where the crux of the argument is here.
