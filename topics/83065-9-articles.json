It\u0027s a game.. and IMO, its a really FUN game. I love orbiter.. but orbiter is orbiter. KSP is KSP. If you are looking for realism, then you should be playing orbiter. If you\u0027re looking to launch 3 green men into a green ball of Earth-sized gas just to see what happens, then you should be playing KSP. The gravitational physics of KSP may be a cheated rough estimate, skewed by a lack of floating point numbers, but they are scaled well (((FOR KSP))). I have no complaints on the work done by squad. They have been very understanding and very lenient towards the players of the game. However there is a limit.. a time when you say \u0022enough is enough\u0022, and honestly, reworking the gravitational fields and the algorythms that are already set in stone is just silly.. I understand the (Want) for better aerodynamics, but as far as the gravity simulation goes, I see it as a clean, perfectly made, perfectly scaled rendition of what physics should be for a game of this nature. IS it useful as a tool for learning? Of-course it is. you learn how orbital mechanics work, you learn what apoapsis and periapsis is, you learn how to adjust each of these and you learn how to do plane changes, planetary transfers, lunar transfers, return transfers.. I mean.. you cannot deny the teaching element of KSP.. there is alot you pick up if you\u0027ve never touched a space simulator before. You need to keep in mind, this game is geared towards EVERYONE.. even children.. Children do not do complex physics calculations like some of us do, therefore the game needs to be toned down to an understandable level for even the \u0022laymen\u0022 among us, to have a fighting chance of being a popular piece of software.. Many people would just as soon by a brainless shooter than a complex science oriented game. I love this game, and I plan on following it where-ever it ends up. because honestly.. when it\u0027s finished... all mods will be finialized and youll be able to play whatever experience you want to have and never have to worry about updating your mods again...

By naming the title that and making the first post entirely about stuff that has largely not been advocated for (at least not as a, \u0022the entire game should be this way\u0022 thing), OP has successfully framed the argument so that anyone arguing for any slight increase in realism is associated with unfun things. Very good manipulation of others, I must admit, but it would probably be best for the mods to look into changing the title and making a note at the beginning of the OP about that, because it\u0027s actually hindering the discussion quite badly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MisterDoubleSevens\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MisterDoubleSevens\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOn a random note, calling KSP\u0027s air \u0022soup\u0022 is wrong.\u003Cp\u003ESoup would be a \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C/em\u003E model of air than what we currently have, because hydrodynamics still base drag on cross-section and speed, \u003Cem\u003Ejust like aerodynamics do. \u003C/em\u003EYeah, you heard right. \u003Cstrong\u003ESoup \u0026gt; Stock Aerodynamics.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought I\u0027d say that, because \u0022the air is soup\u0022 is the single most-common complaint about KSP being unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would argue that that would be worse. With a decent aerodynamic model (one with drag / lift distributed over the vehicle and with drag / lift forces based on shape and orientation), much higher density ends up making any stability issues much more severe; if a rocket is unstable with air-like densities, you\u0027ll have no hope of controlling it with water-like densities, and if a rocket is too stable and just a lawndart at air-like densities, you have no hope of getting it to turn with water-like densities. Besides that, even without specific aerodynamic failure features that will be able to tear rockets and planes apart in flight quite easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t believe me? Both FAR and NEAR have configs that include a line called \u0022areaFactor\u0022 that scales up aerodynamic forces. Since aerodynamic forces scale linearly with both area and desnsity, doubling the areaFactor is equivalent to doubling the density of the atmosphere. Now, I doubt you would want actual hydrodynamics, since that would require an area factor of ~815 to convert air into water, and that would actually make the atmospheric drag worse than in stock by a hell of a lot (you\u0027ll be looking at terminal velocities of ~10 m/s, which makes sense if you\u0027ve ever seen something sink). Setting areaFactor to something like 10 is closer to stock-like forces, so go and try that. See how much progress you make with that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T05:28:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFerram: That\u0027s impressive, but I think he was getting at how the blatant disregard for physical reality would at least not be a concern if we could believe that the Kerbin atmosphere behaved like an actual soup rather than a weird altitude-and-velocity-based gravitational force.

I think the reason it\u0027s being argued is because, in gameplay terms, the whole balance of the game would be thrown off. The engines would be more powerful than they are now, getting to orbit would require much much less, and so the career mode would be all messed up. To fix that, they would either need to nerf every single engine and fuel tank (probably) which would take quite a bit of tweaking and testing to get right, or, they would need to scale the planet size up to match the power-to-orbit that we have now, or change almost everything in career mode to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think planet scaling is the right way to go with that, but, I honestly don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever see a new aero model because of the balance changes. I think it might be better for everyone if KSP \u0027forked\u0027 into the current stock game, and a more realistic version that drops the career mode. Dropping the career mode in a forked version would be to make realistic changes without needing to balance against career gameplay. The fork could even be used as the educational version. Ultimately though, my preference is for more realism AND balanced career mode, but there seems to be a huge push against that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
