What I\\\u0027m trying to do is launch a vehicle (that is acting as an anti-sat missile) that is traveling in a clockwise orbit to smash into the satellite (for shits and gigs). I match the orbits up almost perfect but the problem I\\\u0027m encountering is the height of the objects are off about 50 KM to 60 KM. My anti-sat payload is traveling right over the top of the satellite. Is there a way to perfectly match the orbital heights of both objects with MechJeb?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T01:43:02Z","Content":"MechJeb has all the tools you need that will help you fly the rocket.\n\nUse the prograde, retrograde, normal \u002B, normal -, radial \u002B, and radial -.
