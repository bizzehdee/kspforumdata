If you want to load it in one of those games then you need to open that games save file and it will have a Ships folder with VAB and SPH folders in it, you will then have to put it in one of those.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T22:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a wild guess but have you turned off known file extensions and that .craft file is really a .craft.zip?

I have no idea how it works for .craft files, but text files (which .craft files ultimately are) are saved differently in different OSs (different line ending chars).

The file is located in my VAB under Ships, had renamed it with a .craft designation yet it didnt show up in sandbox. It does distinctively say its a TXT file so idk wth.
