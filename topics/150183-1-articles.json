But once I take off or do some other mission at minmus it just dissapears. I do have relays in high orbit over kerbin and minmus but navball still doesn\u0027t show the nodes. For instance my latest missions one was a satalite which I did then I used it to latch onto a lost kerbin\u0027s ship part and as soon as I did that the maneuver node stopped showing up on the navball. Worked fine up to that point. My relays are the top teir ones all my buildings are top tier. This is on survival. Am I missing the point on how relays work or is it something else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-18T07:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Hmmm?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForgive me if I\u0027m confused, but I\u0027m not clear what you\u0027re trying to do.
