I don\u0027t know why I have never joined the forum until now, but, here I am ready to be a member of the community and Kerbal it up with fellow kerbalnauts!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have played KSP since it was in Alpha on and off\u00A0but it didn\u0027t really grab me fully until 0.90 Beta came out. Currently, I consider it my honest to god favorite game ever. I have always been interested in space travel but before playing KSP, I knew absolutely nothing about rocketry or orbital mechanics. Hohmann transfers, apoapsis, inclination, Delta \u2206,\u00A0prograde, SAS, Oberth effect, these things were not in my vocabulary before this game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can jargon with the best of them now and am fairly versed in the game and it\u0027s mechanics. I hope to be a good member to\u00A0the community and get to know you all. See you in SPACE!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T12:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello JTreySTL, and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been a gamer for decades and no game has captivated me like this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking forward to your participation in our fine community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gelix","CreatedById":154833,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T15:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love it too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T02:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be honest- this game completely changed my understanding of physics.
