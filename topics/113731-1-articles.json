One thing Wings doesn\u0027t do is animation. Otherwise, it\u0027s simple and fast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery single time I\u0027ve tried to watch a tutorial on Blender it\u0027s been an utter bombardment of Ctl-this. Alt-that... hit this hotkey, that hotkey... etc. To make things even more confusing, unless you change the defaults in Blender, you\u0027re using the RIGHT mouse button to select things. This has led to me starting up Blender. Punching buttons for a half an hour in utter frustration of not being able to do things intuitively... and closing it again with nothing resembling an animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;cd=1\u0026amp;cad=rja\u0026amp;uact=8\u0026amp;ved=0CCgQFjAA\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.daz3d.com%2Fget_studio\u0026amp;ei=MVyIVdS5OdizyATEvqDYCg\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNHIhq-yr5r8mpJdSZqVmFQI9YAVkw\u0026amp;sig2=NtbeOZ77c2qtm1SCZ9ylHg\u0026amp;bvm=bv.96339352,d.aWw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDaz Studio\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I got to digging and discovered Daz, which isn\u0027t on the list of KSP recommended tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllow me to recommend it. Within 30 minutes, I had my first animated part in KSP. It took some tweaking to get it right but I found Daz to be so intuitive, so user friendly and soooooo free.... Blender, you are not my friend. I likes Daz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and here\u0027s a cool part. It exports to Collada .dae AND... has a Unity preset already defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing even slightly confusing about Daz is changing the pivot point for parts. It\u0027s under Tools/Joint Editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T00:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like a great tool.

They will sell you their modeling tool, Hexagon, though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will import UV\u0027s and wrap them around the object and you can kinda tinker with them but you can\u0027t create them. I make mine in Wings then just import them if I need to see the texture, otherwise, I just use a blank model. One thing I have found is that when it exports to Unity it has a habit of reversing? inverting? the normals. That may just be an \u0027undocumented feature\u0027 of the Wings .obj export and the way Daz reads it. The way I\u0027ve found to fix this is to select your object, select \u0027Geometry Editor\u0027 tool then right click and choose Geometry Selection/Select All, right click again and select Geometry Selection/Invert selection. It still looks correct in Daz but it exports a proper normal to Unity. I could be entirely wrong but I read something about a double sided UV or some such... dunno. I just know this works and it was so easy to learn that I\u0027m bout to put my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125063-1-0-3-Maritime-Pack-Beta-0-0-12-Carriers-Afloat%21?p=2036903\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2036903\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst animated part into my mod pack\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other minor issue I\u0027ve had is model size. It gives gobs of options to import and convert to various measurements. Normally, my 1 in Wings = 1 in Unity. Daz is designed for BIG scenes so when I import my .obj at 100% it looks tiny. If I import 1=1m then it\u0027s 10000% and when I export it into Unity it\u0027s freaking huge. I filled the entire SPH with one canard learning this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering the pain of Blender and the ease of which I caught onto this, I can easily deal with those minor issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T01:56:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 01:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
