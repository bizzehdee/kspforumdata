So, like say you want to move/resize landing gear, you can click on part of it, hit the K key, and in the menu that comes up there should be an option to \u0022select all of part\u0022 i think, that way you can resize the whole thing.

The only thing I can think of is that MAYBE your text file is being saved in a different format/character encoding that the script isn\u0027t handling. I don\u0027t what text editor you are using but if there is a way to check when you save the file (or in settings) and make sure it is being saved in UTF-8 format (thats what mine uses) and then try it again with one of the folder paths I listed in my previous post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E I tried saving my kspdir.txt with a different format (UTF-2 in this case) and it said it had an error, not the same error as you though. In my case it was a \u0022\u003Cem\u003ETypeError: embedded NUL character\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Also, another thought I had is, depending on your locale settings for your keyboard, it\u0027s might be possible keyboard layout is using a character encoding that some how encodes the slashes differently. So when the script tries to read the kspdir.txt it has that error. Though I think it\u0027s still more likely it\u0027s the encoding of the file it\u0027s self. If you are still having trouble with it, I can try saving a kspdir.txt and upload it somewhere for you to try.
