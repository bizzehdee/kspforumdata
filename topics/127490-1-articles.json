The kerbal has a bad COM (center of mass) causing him to spin out of control once the jet packs are turned. And as soon as I make my first thrust ALL 8 jets fire like it has SAS. Kerbals dont have SAS but sure enuff the EVA has it and he spins toward a false direction due to the bad center of mass. Is this going to get fixed in 1.1 ? I tried an old .90 install and it was really\u003Cu\u003E fluid and responsive.\u003C/u\u003E I could get the kerbal to go forward with only the forward jets firing. But in the version 1.0.2 - 1.0.5 the mechanics were change so that all the jets fire no matter what direction your going? Please tell me this is a cruel joke Squad is sneaking in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T10:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t seem to have this problem, my EVAs are nice and controlled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the Kerbal is spinning or ragdolling for some reason I get what you describe until it is stabilized.
