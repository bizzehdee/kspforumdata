Going back to space center the list was empty as was the archived list. Doing some research I saw this was an issue a while back in KSP (.25 maybe?) and seemed to happen after switching to another vessel in another soi. That\u0027s when I realized that both times this had happened to me I had switched vessels shortly before I noticed. I listed all my mods (no contract configurator) and have not edited my save files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T11:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if it isn\u0027t really a common bug, it certainly isn\u0027t new. I haven\u0027t found what was the culprit as your mod list do not correspond to other\u0027s mod list who happened to encounter that bug too. It seems that the contract agent got somehow corrupted and do not stop properly. However, the common solution is to reach the alt\u002Bf12 menu et reload the contract list there under the contract section. Let\u0027s say this won\u0027t be cheating due to the fact that a bug appeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you aren\u0027t too far in your career, or do not mind starting over again, I would advice you to reinstall the game entirely with the last version of each mod you want and make a new game. Lastly, always wait few seconds before changing ships, just to be sure that the game has initialized all its parameter and won\u0027t corrupt any file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
