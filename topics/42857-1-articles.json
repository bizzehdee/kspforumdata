I know that on Kerbin you should aim for about 400km distance from your target and then launch. Is there some general method how to calculate such distance on other bodies/different orbits? I even tried it with mechjeb and I often end up tens of kilometers away from my target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now that I think of it ... since these are nonatmospheric bodies, it really depends on the acceleration of my rocket doesn\u0027t it? On Kerbin the speed is more or less fixed, but not so on moons etc., right?

If your instincts aren\u0027t up to this, you can aim to get it roughly right and put yourself in a slightly lower phasing orbit and make any corrections there.

It made me think that maybe I could do it even simpler and for non-atmospheric bodies just assume that I am going basically just horizontally (if the station is in very low orbit) and I am basically trying to accelerate from 175m/s to 2256m/s with a fixed acceleration (MJ tells me the max acceleration of my rocket) and then calculate how long it will take me. It could roughly work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have much experience with eyeballing it, but I was expecting some surprises when launching from different moons and different gravities.
