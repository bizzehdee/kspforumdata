Now (after making no progress) we have decided to extend the competition to the community. Just submit your picture and .craft file, and list any mods that you have used, youtube videos in lieu of pictures are also good. The general judging is up to the community (you). The final judging will be done by us, and there may be a small prize (totally not an iTunes gift card \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). We are mainly looking for aesthetics, but if you can get it to work well, that\\\u0027s a bonus to you. All mods are allowed except those that are made to build halo ships. Single piece ships will be immediately disqualified. Good Luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsenio117","CreatedById":31609,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-19T16:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehello im the friend he is referring to! and for reference pictures feel free to use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://halonation.wikia.com/wiki/Halonation_Wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://halonation.wikia.com/wiki/Halonation_Wiki\u003C/a\u003E I am a frequent user and highly recommend it. the prize is a $10 itunes gift card! see ya in the competition\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FractiousBullet","CreatedById":46378,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T00:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope this kicks off but im looking forward to somebody making a huge mod with Halo craft parts, space centre, space stations, planets all that is relevent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DjVip3rStrike","CreatedById":38610,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T03:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIll start this when i get back \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
