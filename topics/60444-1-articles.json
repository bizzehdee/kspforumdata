How about the \u0026quot;Double Bubble\u0026quot;?","CreatedByName":"pbristow","CreatedById":4217,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T22:14:30Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"pbristow","CreatedById":4217,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T22:14:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been looking through the mods for parts that generate more science, in particular (prompted by a discussion a friend of mine... Hi Mike! [WAVES] ) *telescopes*. It seems that while there are several telescope mods around, no-one is so-far doing telescopes that actually contribute science points. It seems a bit odd the tech tree has our Kerbals being able to detect negative Gravioli particles before they\u0027ve even put their first basic ship-mounted telescope into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI therefore propose a new experiment/part: The \u0022Double Bubble Space Binoculars\u0022! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescription: This ground-breaking (literally, when we dropped it during installation) attempt at 3D visualisation of distant objects in space, using a binocular optical system orbiting outside the interference of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, was rendered only *slightly* less useful by the fact that, once switched on, it proved to blind in one eye. (See earlier, re \u0022ground-breaking\u0022.) Nonetheless, it is still a very fine, if monocular, space telescope that delivers useful science points, if you point it at something it hasn\u0027t seen before and manage not to jog it\u0027s elbow while it\u0027s taking snaps. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Well worth all that toil and trouble, in fact...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN.B. The value of the science generated should be inversely proportional to the angular momentum of the vessel it\u0027s attached to, and to the distance of the object being viewed, but capped to a sensible limit so that you can\u0027t get infinite science points by luckily taking one snap while perfectly stationary! This then adds to the value of taking a telescope with you on your mission to the Joule system, as it will be able to get many more science points by observing the moons up close than if it\u0027s squinting at them from Kerbin orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like the part to look like just a huge, bulbous pair of binoculars (aka field-glasses or \u0022opera glasses\u0022) with one of the big (one-metre?) main lenses visibly cracked. It should have a fixed orientation with respect to the part it\u0027s mounted on, so that it\u0027s up to the player to aim the telescope by pointing the ship in the right direction, and stabilise it using reaction wheels to get a steady shot that yields more science points than a wobbly one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hereby humbly offer \u0022Double-Bubble\u0022 as an idea for development by Squad, or by any mod developer who wants to have a crack at it.
