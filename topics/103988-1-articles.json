I tried it and it is in no way fun anymore for me to launch rockets. However i quite like NEAR :-) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut i do strugle with planes, let alone Spaceplanes.

The one I posted is the standard version; small Mk2 cargobay and Mk2 docking port. The second is designed for crew; Mk2 crew pod and Mk2 docking port. For the third I had to sacrifice the docking port for the large Mk2 cargobay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll three have very similar flying characteristics and can reach Mun/Minmus orbit with relative ease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are only a few mod parts and only a few are tweakscaled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally I rarely share craft but for this one I am willing to make an exception. I\u0027ll see if I can rescale/replace them with stock parts and still retain the design and functionality.
