For example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3400dv to launch into Kerbin orbit \u002B 950 to reach the edge of the Kerbin system \u002B 980 to get a fly-by of the Jool system \u002B 270 for a mid course inclination change \u002B 160 to capture into high orbit of Jool \u002B 620 to get a fly-by of Vall \u002B 910 to get into orbit around Vall \u002B 860 to land on Vall \u002B another 860 to take off from Vall again \u002B another 910 to escape Vall\u0027s orbit \u002B another 620 to reach a high orbit around Jool again.
