In this age of permanent internet connections, it is quite common for software to be released with known bugs, and remediation left to post-release patches. That said, if there are too many bugs popular and critical opinion of the game definitely does suffer, and you don\u0027t want your first reviews out of EA to be \u0027Pity about all the bugs that weren\u0027t fixed in the 4-year open alpha/beta\u0027.\n\nInformation displays/Engineer Report/\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv readout - Rocket science requires calculational aids - I\u0027ve never understood why you thought relying on others providing them was better.\n\nNew wheels and landing gear - The Mk.3 plane parts seem really lonely without accessories to use them properly.\n\nNew IVAs for all parts - again, no placeholders in release, please.\n\nTech tree fix (or adjustment) - Making the tech tree more intuitive, and/or giving players more options of how to progress through it, can only improve the playing experience. Anyway, the balance pass probably requires it.\n\nIn addition, things I would like to see in version 1.0 that have not been announced:\n\nOverall better graphic effects (e.g. clouds, planet shine, distant object display, etc.) - Added as options (to cater for machines without the required graphic oomph) these would make for a richer, more immersive experience.\n\nI think that if you hit the above points well, you\u0027ll have a great release product. Anything over and above that would be a bonus (and cool and appreciated).\n\nFeatures that have been announced that I would include here are - for example:\n\nFemale Kerbals - An element that genuinely is missing from that game now, but one that wouldn\u0027t (IMHO) detract too much from the release version if it didn\u0027t make it.\n\nAtmospheric heating - probably so closely tied up with the new aero model that it can\u0027t be separated, but if it can I know which one I\u0027d rather see make it. Include here heat shields and any other changes that its inclusion would require.\n\nTime warp to point (KAC functionality) - This function does really need to be included in stock, but I guess I wouldn\u0027t be too upset if it didn\u0027t make it to 1.0.\n\nISRU could be left for a post-release upgrade. It\u0027s an (almost) entirely self-contained system that (again, IMHO) changes and adds to gameplay, rather than necessarily enhancing it. It\u0027s somewhat a parallel of the asteroids from ARM; you can ignore (or even deactivate) the feature entirely and still have a full and complete gameplay experience. As such, it could fairly easily be released as \u0027free DLC\u0027 or \u0027The ISRU update\u0027 without losing anything, or causing too many changes to the already-released game.\n\nOne upgrade after release should be devoted in it\u0027s entirety to porting the game to Unity 5 (assuming this is in any way beneficial). A port release doesn\u0027t need distraction from features and changes, and features don\u0027t need to be released to the public on an untried engine. When/If this happens at all is, of course, dependent on Unity 5 development and release timing, and on whether any benefit is actually to be had from it (I thought it was worth saying that twice)."},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T13:09:02Z","Content":"Wouldn\u0027t it be better to add Unity 5 to 1.0, as I suspect there is a potential for it to be save breaking, and having 1.1 break the saves from 1.0 could be a bad thing for people thinking they have a finished product.\n\nAs to features, it really depends on what kind of time scale you\u0027re looking at with 1.0. Do you have a couple of months, 6 months, a year before the release date ? If you can take time then do so and pack 1.0 with as much as possible, like clouds, more planets, parts, etc. If not then I do think that bug fixing, aerodynamics and balance should be the priority."},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T13:23:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E We\u0027ve decided that the next release will be 1.0 because it accomplishes the goals we\u0027ve set up with the development of KSP from the very beginning, my question to you is whether you\u0027d prefer we try and add more features, or focus more on things like the aero overhaul, **bugfixing and balance?**\n\n-Note, I am not \\*exactly\\* a game developer-\n\nBugfixing and balance.

Turbojets operate perfectly well at mach 6. The team probably already has a list of what to nerf, and whatever you do will anger some users.

ISRU can wait for 1.1 IMO, it\u0027s not as essential as aero overhaul or female Kerbals.\n4. Aero overhaul is a necessity, it would be a tragedy for a bunch of new KSP players to learn the accursed 10km/45\u00C3\u2039\u00C5\u00A1 gravity turn.\n\n**Things that irk me when I play stock now**\n\n- Performance issues, I should not have to run the game at 1/4 resolution to be able to play on OS X.\n- Graphics, the fact that the skybox does not dim irks me particularly, as well as the lack of interesting terrain outside of the Kerbin system.\n- Bugs. If the game takes 15 min to load, and you crash twice an hour, thats *half* of your game time gone.\n- Moddability, I would really, really, *really* like to see an *official*  *API. The community .xml files are outdated and not that useful to a noob programmer.*\n\n*TL;DR, focus on what you already have to do (read: aero, bugs and optimization) and let the new features wait.*"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T14:28:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Why oh why must the next release be called v1.0?\n\u003E its not done. its not nearly done. a blind man could see that pushing KSP to v1.0 was a bad idea.\n\u003E \n\u003E make .91 and .92 and .93 if you have to. \n\u003E \n\u003E with out the planned features, KSP is an incomplete game. \n\u003E \n\u003E with the nasty bugs, KSP is an incomplete game.\n\u003E \n\u003E you\u0027ve created a great thing! you have a huge dedicated fan base.

Yes, they will evaluate 1.0 as if it is a release quality game (which is essentially what you are announcing if you\u0027re making it 1.0), but that doesn\u0027t mean reviewers or players are going to assume that nothing more is being added to the game in the future. I mean, look at all the content that a game like GTA V has continually added to their game post-release in a non-paid DLC fashion. I don\u0027t think anyone believes anymore that \u00221.0\u0022 means \u0022the end\u0022 anymore.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t mean 1.0 shouldn\u0027t be a quality product. It should.
