In this age of permanent internet connections, it is quite common for software to be released with known bugs, and remediation left to post-release patches. That said, if there are too many bugs popular and critical opinion of the game definitely does suffer, and you don\u0027t want your first reviews out of EA to be \u0027Pity about all the bugs that weren\u0027t fixed in the 4-year open alpha/beta\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInformation displays/Engineer Report/\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv readout - Rocket science requires calculational aids - I\u0027ve never understood why you thought relying on others providing them was better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew wheels and landing gear - The Mk.3 plane parts seem really lonely without accessories to use them properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew IVAs for all parts - again, no placeholders in release, please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETech tree fix (or adjustment) - Making the tech tree more intuitive, and/or giving players more options of how to progress through it, can only improve the playing experience.
