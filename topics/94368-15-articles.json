And I\u0027m using stock air, not FAR. However, the predictions I\u0027m getting for Ap after aerocapture aren\u0027t even close until after my ship has passed Pe, which makes them essentially useless. It goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. As the ship approaches the planet, I adjust my Pe down into the atmosphere and Trajectories shows a prediction. This prediction appears to be based on the old pre-1.x atmosphere data. That is, for a given Pe, it shows the resulting Ap just like how things were back in the day. For example, coming into Duna, Trajectories is saying a Pe between 11-12km is what you want.

However, the predictions I\u0027m getting for Ap after aerocapture aren\u0027t even close until after my ship has passed Pe, which makes them essentially useless. It goes like this:\u003Cp\u003E1. As the ship approaches the planet, I adjust my Pe down into the atmosphere and Trajectories shows a prediction. This prediction appears to be based on the old pre-1.x atmosphere data. That is, for a given Pe, it shows the resulting Ap just like how things were back in the day. For example, coming into Duna, Trajectories is saying a Pe between 11-12km is what you want. However, in 1.0.2, that will lithobrake you---what you really want these days is 16-18km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. As the ship enters the atmosphere, the predicted path doesn\u0027t change to start with.

But it\u0027s way off prior to Pe, which rather defeats the whole purpose of the mod.
