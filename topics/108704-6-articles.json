This version should also work fine on KSP 1.1.2.\n\nAlso, EVA Resource Transfer and Celestial Body Science Editor were both marked as compatible with 1.1.3.\n\n## \n\nAlso, I have a new modlet that I would like people to test out for me. A flexible docking port:\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ptfev/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAs you can see it is designed to look like the stock clampotron and shares its texture.\n\nThe docking port has two modes; when retracted it behaves like a normal port, but when extended it allows for a limited range of translation and rotation of the docking port head. \n\nThere are controls for extending and retracting the port, and for deactivating the magnets (this works for both modes, and should work when this is not the dominant port). It is meant for facilitating base construction or other types of ground docking, but it also works in space. You might want to disable the magnets in space though, at least for lighter vessels, as they tend to get tossed around faster than the docking port can move. Also note that when two flexible ports are brought together only one will be active, when both are active they tend to chase each other around and you get odd results.\n\nFor now I\u0027m only releasing a version for testing. It has a single port, the 1.25m part that pairs with a standard clampotron. The stock 1.25m docking port is required (in case anyone has deleted or replaced it) as they share the same texture. The part is in the start node of the tech tree and it is very cheap.\n\nAll aspects of the part are subject to change in future releases, so don\u0027t use this for anything you aren\u0027t willing to lose.\n\nDownload it from GitHub and let me know how it works: [https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_Flexible_Docking/releases/tag/v0.1](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_Flexible_Docking/releases/tag/v0.1)\n\nIt is release under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), and the stock docking port model was only used for reference, everything here was made from scratch.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-23T17:41:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2016 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic**\n  \nlicense"},{"CreatedByName":"genericeventhandler","CreatedById":149557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T11:35:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, DMagic said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For now I\u0027m only releasing a version for testing.
