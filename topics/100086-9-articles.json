Emilynn handled the multiple dockings and refueling herself, of course, since everybody else from the Base was down at the southern ice cap pyramid. The refueling of the dozen tiny Xenon tanks was tedious as ever (it is sure going to be a lot more fun to do this when we have the larger Xenon tank in KSP 1.0).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XxGNs0T.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XxGNs0T.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022Hey, Thompbles, are you awake?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022Yes, Emilynn. Refueling went OK?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmlynn: \u0022Sure thing. I\u0027ve decided I\u0027m going to make the next leg of my test flight starting this afternoon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022You don\u0027t want to wait until tomorrow when you\u0027re rested?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022Nah, I feel fine...and Barsoom Base is pretty dull now. All the bars are closed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThompbles: \u0022OK. But keep me informed during your flight. You\u0027re going to be covering the biggest empty stretch of land yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn\u0027s next refueling stop would be at Fido Canyon Base (where Aldner, Adly, and Kelby were stationed). That\u0027s about 147\u00B0 of longitude west of Barsoom Base. Not only is this further than any DunaDog has yet attempted to fly, it\u0027s also further than a DunaDog CAN fly in one hop westward because of solar panel illumination considerations. The sun needs to be at least 30 degrees above the horizon for the solar cells of the DunaDog to provide sufficient energy to run the ion engines at full throttle...which limits a flight to something around 120\u00B0 of longitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Emilynn would need to attempt this journey in two hops, with a landing somewhere to wait for the sun to advance across the sky before the second hop could be made. So not only is this trip longer than ever attempted before, but it also must include two takeoffs and landings before the next refueling. Can she make it? As it happens, the first rover I ever landed on Duna (an ancient RCS-powered/landing-gear-wheels rover from the days before KSP even had proper rover wheels) is located at a convenient location for the mid-flight stopping point. So Emilynn will visit this old rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow, Emilynn sits in the Amelia and waits for the sun to drop to around 30\u00B0 above the western horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002281SRPvL.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/81SRPvL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe map below (part of Duna\u0027s biome map) shows Emilynn\u0027s flight plan. Her first concern is going to be the highlands immediately west of Barsoom Base. This is also the part of the flight where the solar cells have the poorest illumination, so it\u0027s not possible to keep the ion engines at full throttle, and therefore not possible to maintain high altitude flight on just ion power. Once clear of the highlands, the Amelia needs to cross the vast stretch of midlands and lowlands that Emilynn will name the Pacific Planitia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NiolKIx.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NiolKIx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022OK, Thompbles.

OK...cleared that ridge. Leveling off at six thousand. Rocket engine off and ions on. Hm. Still drinking too fast. Decreasing throttle to 70% on the ions. Yeh.

The Fido Pup rover is located in large crater at moderate elevation, higher than the DunaDog normally lands. (This used to be a well defined crater with steep walls back in version 0.18 of KSP when the Fido Pup landed on Duna -- but with the later reworking of Duna, it\u0027s a pretty poorly defined crater now.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RoMxhwq.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RoMxhwq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn cut the ion engines 23 km out from the target, at an altitude of 5.5 km (1.9 km AGL).

The drive was a little uphill, which is tedious in the DunaDog. The old probe used aircraft landing gear for wheels, and used RCS thrusters for propulsion and steering (the landing gear did not have a steering option at the time). Life is so much nicer with proper rover wheels. The lights on the Fido Pup are still going strong, of course, because the amount of Plutonium 238 in the RTGs is still at 83% of its original value after the 23.5 years since this probe was launched.

Because this would be a shorter hop, Emilynn could wait until a little past local noon to takeoff, so there would be no problem with the illumination angle of the solar panels. Referring to the earlier map (repeated below), we can see that the biggest problems Emilynn faced on this leg of the trip were the large area of highlands immediately to the west of the takeoff site, and the question of whether she still had enough fuel left to cover the distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NiolKIx.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NiolKIx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow: The Amelia takes off for its flight to Fido Canyon, illuminated by the Fido Pup\u0027s lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022r6nV2La.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r6nV2La.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022Climbing well on rocket power.

The icon off in the distance in the picture below is the Fido Pup\u0027s lander stage to the south of the Amelia. Note that one of the ships at the Fido Canyon Base was selected as the target so that its target indicator on the navball could be used to guide the flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YQcG89M.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YQcG89M.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce beyond the highlands, the flight over the midlands biome was uneventful.

So, instead, Emilynn banked to the right so that she could fly down into the canyon where the midlands met the canyon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002226bmxA3.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/26bmxA3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilyn lost altitude and skimmed a few hundred meters over the rim of the canyon before the terrain dropped away below her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Q8qzrox.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q8qzrox.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce safely in the canyon, Emilynn turned off the ion engines and flew using the rocket engine at quarter-throttle. Xenon is more precious that LFO on Duna...especially if the ISRU engineers finally deliver on their promise of equipment for making fuel and oxidizer (to be sent out in the next launch window).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KMg89Ww.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KMg89Ww.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022Amelia calling Fido Canyon Base.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Hey there, Hawk.

Apparently having a ship with lights on sitting on the surface can cause its square of terrain to light up (at least when a ship with lights on is overhead). The landing was smooth, touching down between the Lander Hab (730 meters away) and the Fuel Station (370 meters away).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uWV1Eka.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uWV1Eka.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter landing, Emilynn repacked the Amelia\u0027s chutes, raised the nose gear, and rovered on over to the Lander Hab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022Howdy, Buzz!

If we got good data from your scanners, they\u0027ll probably head back a ways along your flight path to gather surface data to correlate with your scans. So it\u0027s just you and me for the welcome party. Come on in to the Lander Hab.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022Sounds fine, Buzz. But how about you scurry on up to the command module so that I can have a shower first...I\u0027ve been living out of the Amelia\u0027s cockpit for a while now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223fmOirI.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3fmOirI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next day, Aldner drove the Fuel Fido over to the Fuel Station with Emilynn following in the Amelia. Then came the usual surface docking maneuvers to get all three ships linked to make the refueling easier (come on, Squad...a refueling hose...please!). There was a lot of Xenon to be transferred from small tanks to small tanks, so this was again tedious. And after the refueling...the undocking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222b1Z1cl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2b1Z1cl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldner: \u0022Hey, Hawk...I want to leave the Fuel Fido here by the Fuel Station...it\u0027s a real pain to drive. So how about letting me hitch a ride on the side of your DunaDog?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn: \u0022No problem, Buzz.

But as the Amelia drove back to the Lander, Aldner slid up the ladder and eventually came loose from the top...and tumbled back along the top of the plane until he got snagged in the parachute mast...where he was stable for the rest of the drive. I was worried he might be all rag-doll-unresponsive after that, but when the Amelia braked to a stop at the Lander, Aldner slid forward and popped up onto his feet like he meant to do it that way all along. Why bother hanging onto a ladder when you can recline leisurely on top of the wing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aeOd8Z2.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aeOd8Z2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a short stay at Fido Canon Base, Emilynn was ready for the final leg of the Amelia\u0027s test flight...the return to Duna Base. This would be another long flight, but it\u0027s one that Aldner had already made in the opposite direction (which is actually the more difficult direction, since as Emilynn flies west she will have the sun moving with her, giving better illumination on the solar cells). So, again, it was a matter of sleeping in late and getting ready to take off when the sun was down to around 30\u00B0 above the western horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022K2QHpwD.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K2QHpwD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the climb out of Fido Canyon, Emilynn was profligate in her use of LFO, running the Amelia up to 7200 meters before turning on the ion engines and then cutting the rocket engine. She was able to run the ions at over 83% throttle...but was still losing altitude. An additional rocket boost was needed to get the plane beyond the highest terrain west of Fido Canyon...but then the sun angle improved and she could up the ions to 100% to cruise along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224lIkc3K.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4lIkc3K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough there is a long stretch of highlands west of Fido Canyon, they aren\u0027t particularly HIGH highlands, so the Amelia was able to cruise above them. The only significant obstacle along the path was the mountain range that makes up the western rim of a crater. Using just the ion engines, Emilynn was able to gradually increase the Amelia\u0027s altitude to over 7000 meters, which was sufficient to fly above the western rim mountains without need of a rocket boost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DNWLqyI.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DNWLqyI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p4sjPCl.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p4sjPCl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond the crater it was smooth sailing. Ike rose above the western horizon (due to Emilynn\u0027s westward motion) and the Amelia passed out of the highlands into the airspace above Adly Planitia. Happily for me, the plane handles well enough that the cruise phases can be flown at 2x or even 3x physical time warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cXA0piy.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cXA0piy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn cut the ion engines 24.5 km from Duna Base and glided the rest of the way. She overflew the base at 600 meters, making sure to land a couple kilometers to the WEST of her starting point, just to be sure that the Amelia had made a complete circumnavigation of Duna by air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RVdTSwA.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RVdTSwA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmilynn drove the Amelia back east to Duna Base.

So I slapped together something I thought might serve as the most primitive basis (pending expected hours of testing and tweaking) for a Duna plane, based on previous experience. And the silly thing blew the challenge parameters out of the water on the 1st go. I\u0027m sure it can be improved but really, why even bother? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying Duna is WAY easier in 1.x than it was before, to the point that\u0027s it\u0027s no longer a worthy subject for a challenge thread.
