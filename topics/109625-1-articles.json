This happens in the VAB, SPH, Launch Pad and any flights that are in progress. The game just crashes to desktop, there is **NO** \u0022KSP.exe has stopped working\u0022 message. When checking event logs, there is no message saying it crashed. I\u0027ve tried a fresh install, verifying game cache, trying a new save, running in Win7 compatibility mode, running as administrator and tried running KSP with all settings set to minimum in windowed-mode. \n\nScreenshot: A screenshot is not relevant in this case, as it happens with any part, anywhere with any craft.\n\n.Craft File: Also not relevant in my case.\n\nOutput\\_log.txt: [http://pastebin.com/rGBZzMUQ](http://pastebin.com/rGBZzMUQ)\n\nSystem Specs:\n\nWindows 10 64-bit\n\nIntel Core i7 4770k @ 3.5Ghz\n\nnVidia GeForce GTX 970 Super Clocked with latest drivers\n\n16GB DDR3 RAM\n\n2 TB free HDD Space"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:01:12Z","Content":"This could be the mouse polling issue that has been seen on Linux, basically if your mouse has been set to a very high DPI it causes a problem with right click in KSP.\n\nTry turning down your mouse DPI to 800 or below, this will be different from one mouse to another so you will need to check your owners manual."},{"CreatedByName":"erickj92","CreatedById":74611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:27:00Z","Content":"I can confirm this did not fix my issue.
