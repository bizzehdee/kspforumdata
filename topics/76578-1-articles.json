Or this is because the station isn\u0027t really together, and it somehow clipped inside itself. Try loading the station from the command center and see if it survives. Then, if it does, plot a course with the ship so it heads toward the station. then, go back to the command center and load up the station. Then time warp untill the ship floats into visual range of the station and then switch back to the ship to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T00:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be easier to offer suggestions (in addition to the above) if you can provide a few well lit pictures of the station, and maybe some of the early stages of exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, bring up the F3 menu and see what is the first thing damaged.
