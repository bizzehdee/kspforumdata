So, you can get almost to 20,000m with the turbojets if you have enough of them and a light enough plane.\n\nAt the moment, I think the aerospike still functions as a rocket engine; not sure if this is intended or C7 hadn\\\u0027t quite gotten around to changing it."},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T11:51:40Z","Content":"Aerospike IS a rocket engine, even in real life.
