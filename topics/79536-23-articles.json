So Either there need to be free floating satelites, which will have to be run of RTGs (I think thats what they\u0027re called) or something else that would most likely come from Interstellar. I was over at Outer Planets forum, and someone made an MM config that turns the 400Gm Dish into an 800Gm dish that can reach any planet in the Kerbol system, and a we bit farther away. As it stands, the only way to get relay network to be able to send a probe to Stella, would to have several satellites scattered in interstellar space, floating around, each one talking to each other, and then pointing back to Kerbin, Past that would need to be 2 more rings, all talking to each other in the network, and pointing back to a nearby probe in one of the inner rings. And after that you would still need to set up network in High orbit around Cyssor. With that all in place, the conection would be spotty at best, and that is with the current MM config that someone mad over on the OPM thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if I did, but that might have come of as a demand, I was only trying to ask if you, Agustus, would be able to make an MM Config so that one of the Dishes in Remote Tech could have a 5Tm Range (that would be more than enough, but that\u0027s taking into account having a network set up around planets, and not in freefall/orbit around Kerbol. I think that the dish angle should be about 0.001, and if that works, it should give full coverage to the Stella system minus planets being in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything, I\u0027ll look up (again) how to make a part for KSP and you could write the config, that way none of the current parts need to be edited, and someone could use the OPM compatible config and the Stella compatible config. I would know very little, and the Antenna would probably not have an animation, but hey, you can reach Stella with an antenna!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought: Now that I think of it, If I do make a part, instead of it being a folding thing that opens up to have a giant dish, it would be a laser of some sort, and that would allow \u0022fast\u0022 communication, and will be a tad bit more realistic in the sense of communicating with a ship in another star system.

I dunno...) and sometimes in Orbit around the planet (or is that scaled view? that probably is) but when I get close enough that the surface is rendering and not using the map texture, the lighting goes away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-20T00:42:43Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2015 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Drakoflame\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tellion","CreatedById":116794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T00:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Drakoflame\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wonderful thing about KSP is, that you can mold the game into what you would like to see from it.
