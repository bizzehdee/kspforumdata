The game is on beta, and i think it misses a lot of info for the beginners, info about the specs, about about the interface and the spare parts for building, I just felll the game is so incomplete and that the community is so engaged in completing it that the game will soon be free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, im in love and hate with this game and I want to know how will the career game mode will be and if there will be any kind of multiplayer game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rockhem","CreatedById":57141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T20:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, i started with the game stock, then after you get used to stock game you can start adding a few mods, (i always take out every mod that i dont use).
