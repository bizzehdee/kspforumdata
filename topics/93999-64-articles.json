In the Outer Planets mod, Neidon, Sarnus, and Urlum are all templated off of Jool. Plock is templated off of Vall. Once the template is loaded, it has many values and maps overwritten with custom ones, but the fact that it is being loaded off of a stock planet remains, and it even looks like it might have been assigned by reference, which means things are being overwritten on the template planet.

Even Squad is dropping support for a 64-bit Windows version with 1.0 as it\u0027s caused nothing but trouble. Only when they can get a 64-bit version working without problems will KSP and its mods be able to really take advantage of the power of 64-bit. It\u0027s a bummer, but that\u0027s just the way it is. For the moment, we\u0027re making due in some clever ways, which is also cool (you won\u0027t believe how efficient some of the best devs can make their mods).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKopernicus is sorta based on around using templates. Only one highly experimental planet has ever been made without a planet and it\u0027s a lot of work (which almost no-one knows much about). Everything up to now in OPM kind of work.

Honestly the near lack of work (or complete lack thereof) porting an application from Linux 32 -\u0026gt; 64 bit is a testament to how well it was designed. I\u0027ve done projects where there was no work at all in porting between the two. Hell, most code will compile for different architectures just fine. You just have to follow the design guidelines.
