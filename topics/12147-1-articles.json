However that second stage is still there following along not too far behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried a similar solution by putting the satellite in the middle but I am still left with the previous stage in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not attempted strapping a satellite to the side of something yet because I feel it may become to imbalanced and having not killed Bill, Jeb and Bob yet I don\\\u0027t want to now! =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas, tips or tricks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMini\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T17:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething I try to do is configure my upper stage as a tugboat with side mounted engines, that way I can tow a line of satellites into place and jettison each one when I am ready, before finally returning to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maraz","CreatedById":22308,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T19:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can arrange a satellite on top of your crew module, then decouple it, then go back to kerbin with your command module and spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee this example (needs mods: Dynasat, NovaPunch and maybe something else)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/8478/screenshot60e.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/8478/screenshot60e.th.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot60e.th.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaraz\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alchemist","CreatedById":8825,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T20:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are multiple variants:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload under the command module:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- side-mounted engines on the top stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- use RCS of the top stage for circularization and orbit corrections\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop-mounted payload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- chute that allows attaching on top\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- side-mounted chutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- powered landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- horizontal landing (plane)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- unmanned vehicle (just crash it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide mounted pauload (multiple sats)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mockingking","CreatedById":6738,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-06T21:11:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr just do it like I do: Use unmanned command capsules and attach your sattelite solidly.

I managed to get my satellite i orbit while being able to it go back to it and without it being labeled as debris. Like you stated i kept a command pod on it, so i left the mechjeb on it since its robotic and doesn\\\u0027t have the kerbals left floating around and this worked. i couldn\\\u0027t how ever, do anything with the spent rocket engine drifting in orbit not to far behind. this is where the rest of your other suggestions come in. I\\\u0027m going to get this Damned Robotics your talking about and LAZOR. Is there a pack where i can build these military weapons your talking about? And i think it will be kinda tough to shoot down or rendezvous with the debris because they are moving at about 2000\u002Bms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes English is my first language. i some times type fast in forums and always grammatically correct. I,m sorry if it bothers you. I don\\\u0027t see why it matters.

It\\\u0027s more difficult to attach all the parts correctly than it is with the guns, missiles and SUNBEAM lasers, but it has practically infinite range and doesn\\\u0027t even need to be aimed. The biggest risk with the LAZOR is actually just accidentally targeting the wrong object, and blowing up something important. It\\\u0027s really almost like a cheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you might fiddle around with MechJeb until you DO manage to get within 2 kilometers; then just use the SUNBEAM laser to overheat the debris. Or be a Hero Of The Kerbal Union and use guns and missiles. (Don\\\u0027t know how hit anything accurately, still working on that myself). In any case, it should be possible to use MechJeb to get into an orbit *almost* like the one the debris is on, then just orbit and orbit until your Hunter-Killer ship and the debris come close, then use MechJeb to go up or down to the debris orbit and do the deed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr just do it the easy way and set debris to 0 in the settings menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
