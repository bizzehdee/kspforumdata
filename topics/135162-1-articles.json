Its density in outer solar systems objects is higher then inner solar system objects (except the gravitationally heightened sun). The sun produces hydrogen, lots of it, problem is to get close enough to harvest it the level has already fallen. There is far too much need for hydrogen to bring it from Earth or other gravity wells. Hydrogen is the most basic reducing agent, it is the smallest and compounds in which it is found have the highest volatility and lowest viscosity. Because of its high energy per sp, sp2, sp3 and ss bond/mass hydrogen is a major component of rocket fuels, particularly first and second stages. It is also a component of fuel cells. Because of its volatility hydrogen is first lost from planets that a hot and/or have no atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nHydrogen\n  H20 - water, required for life, electrolysis, chemical synthesis, air conditioning, greenhouses\n  NH3 - Ammonia, required for fertilizers, used in air conditioning and cooling systems. \n  CH4 - Methane, one of the simplist fuels, can be used to make higher organic compounds and ammonia.\n  CH3CH20H - Ethanol . . . . . synthetic intermediate in the making of synthetic oils and other fuels. \n  H2NCRHCO2H - Amino acids . . . .Required to make protein, R (CHOSN) containing side chains\n  H2SO4 - sulferic acid . . . . required for life, to hydrogen to reduce sulfate is an essential process for biological oxidation\n  HCl - hydrochloric acid . . .for the extraction of metals from high complexity ore.

Comet exploit, comets are occasionally thrown from the kuiper belt into the inner solar system where they degas, wrapping and heating the comet could capture these gases. Comets are generally are in high dV orbits relative to earth, stablizing those orbits so they can be harvested is difficult, stable zones are devoid of sustantial solar electric power, a nuclear electric power plant may be required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 3.

Outside of the earth is one of the most frequent elements found in gases of non-gas giants with atmosphere in the form of CO2 and methane, also present on comets. Carbonates are also found bound to metals in asteroids and other soils. On hot planets like mercury and venus carbonates are driven off of metal into the atmosphere. Carbon also acts a reducing agent, although under some circumstances is can be an oxidezer, it is a general thicken of fluids, fluids with high carbon complexity tend to be more viscous and less volatile, diamond as a good example of the effect of branching sp3 bonds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nCarbon\n  CO2 - required for life, greenhouses, blood chemistry, concrete and basically stone based construction.\n  CH4, Ethanol, amino acids, oils, see above - see hydrogen\n  =C= (sp3) diamond, required for high end devices and for drills (embedded diamond dust)\n  =C- (sp2-p) graphite, found in graphene and other modern graphene based structures. component of carbon-fiber, light weigh building materials. \n  \u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOption 1.

Argon is basically found whereever atmospheres are found, it tends to be a bit more common in the outer solar system, likely because of atmospheric loses from the inner solar system. Argon also prevents fast spoilage in artificial atmospheres. Essentially we need cold atmospheres were vapor velocity at ground level \u002B solar wind is not sufficient to blow argon away, this represents objects very far away from the sun.\u00A0 Boiling point is at 87.302\u00A0K\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 1.

Copper is the primary metal used in electrical systems, it does not have some of the pitfalls of aluminum wiring. Namely there is little or no voltage on brass connectors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 1. Asteroid mining\u003Cbr\u003E\nOption 2. Lunar mining\u003Cbr\u003E\nOption 3.

The problem is that core components of these systems are made of not so easy to find minerals such as cadmium and semimetals (tellutium, gold). Platinum and paladium are used in fuel cells and for hydrogen storage, and is required for electrolysis of water into H2 and O2. The more stable metals are more resistent to acid solubilization that most metals, consequently some acid based purification is often required for extraction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption 1.

Earth sourced while other sources are found.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn creating stand alone colonies what we see is that sourcing of elements is not quite as easy as on earth, if we remove earth from consideration one might have to travel the mercury/kuiper-belt transfer in order to find the best source for minerals\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat is also means is that somewhere along that ellipse needs to be a facility to process the crude material into refined starting materials that can be used to manufacture the various objects. There are alternatives, magnesium might be used instead of xenon or argon in ion drives, solar panels are made of different semi-metals (metaloids), different sources for magnet metal, multiple alloys can roughly generate the same functionality. The processing to final products for some of these items is a very extensive a popularly cooperative process, which all adds weight in space to do the same thing. Some things, like working with cyanide or other poisonous intermediates are to be avoided.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis all translates to a fairly long period of dependency on earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question was asked about the stand alone profitability of going to mars, lets strike mars and ask any exploitable body, the answer is it would take a long time for the process to become profitable because, relatively speaking the energy invested to acquire the basic ingredients for building anything (complex structure) other than a solid block of nickle covered with silicon glass are spread widely across our solar system. We need to find more efficient and roboticized ways of covering these great distances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing is that here on earth, the highest price you will ever pay for transportation is the fuel it takes for a 747 to travel from say Perth Australia to Los Angeles California. Where the cargo payload is say 10% of the weight of the fuel, most often you are paying 10% or 20% of the total cost of a good in transportation, once you start compositing structure, it would be as if every part has to be transported from Perth to LA 3 or 4 times over. Despite the high expense, its doable with an eye on conservation. If\u00A0 I recieve a tin of fresh fish eggs from Perth, I can throw the tin in the trash, not so in space, the tin is recycled, the CO2 is recycled, the N in the urine and sweat is recycled, the water is recycled, Poop would be recycled. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo say that not-for profit needs to be involved emphasizes the point that the various\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Econnect the dots\u003C/em\u003E that we need to make a stable space-alone system work is not \u0027connected\u0027 not even started. It takes government and not-for-profit donors to establish the first connections, in fact all the connections, even if hair thin, for the commercial space ventures to be profitable for things like landing on mars or moons of mars. It is to say that once science is doing, well, science on many bodies that we will find alternatives to resources that I have stated above, so that maybe we dont have to mine Kuiper belt objects for Argon and Helium. But here again we may find something even more valuable harvesting hydrogen from say mercury (like maybe an abundant source of tritium and dueterium) or kuiper belt objects that makes it highly worthwhile to have Mercurian polar colonies or generational ships to the kuiper belt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is lets not put the cart before the horse, first we have to go to asteroids, see what it takes to mine them, go to comets, see what it takes to bottle their gases and package the metalics and metaliods. Go to the low gravity well moons and see what can be used. Space X can get your robot into space, but then its the government that needs to fund the science aspect of the mission, if they manage this time, instead of leaving a lander base on the moon, they leave behind a long duration robot that continues to work, drilling, preparing, etc for future landings, then you have begun the process of making and keeping a connection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[Note: I came to write this post after creating a rather massive colony on the pole (sink hole crater) of Moho, I chose moho because it takes the most important element out of the game, energy, infact, once you get your factories running full steam, there is too much energy and not enough \u003Cem\u003Enegative energy.\u00A0 \u003C/em\u003EI have launched a rather big self modded space factory that allows for gilly back forth building of anysized object I can dream of, which means I come to Moho with basically everything, no longer thinking about kerbin (the only thing kerbin supplies is kerbals, adam and eve). But then I wanted to built a sort of reflective colony on moho from scratch on moho.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 What I came to see is that the tools provided feel well short of the task, a metal drill and a smelter create metal and rocket parts. The reality is that such a smelter would require calcium and create slag and gases, those gases would need to be separated into elements, the slag would be separated into elements, and thus many of these process need their own chemistry unit, that is not in the game, or in the add ons. Ore is composed of elements which can be separated into purified or enriched molecules, which can be broken down and reformed into what we need to build colonies. After sitting down and writing out a short list of the facilities need, I can to a short list about 50 or 60 parts that can be added as units to the colonization system modules - this was the answer to the profitability question - why private companies are not hopping over each other to go to Mars]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-29T01:04:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2016 01:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T02:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite an impressive post PB666, good work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only immediate criticism I might have is that the biggest unknown on such material discussions is that we have a lot of theories on the elemental compositions of various planets, moons, asteroids, etc and some spectroscopy or other surface readings, we have precious little information on what actually lies beneath the surface of most of these bodies. One could probably fairly argue that any of the inner planets are largely likely to be elementally similar on the whole (excluding gasses) as it wouldn\u0027t make the most sense for say, Earth to have the uranium deposits it does, but Venus and Mars to have effectively zero, especially when given the largely randomized nature of matter distribution in an early and energetic solar system during planet formation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny given asteroid is probably likely to simply be what it says on the tin, IE: given the surface area to volume ratios, what you can get from spectroscopy of an asteroid is most likely a fair representation of the contents within.

I partly come to this conclusion because first off, NASA has stated that any current plans for Mars missions are temporary stay only, no colonies. That means that so far the only group likely to have a means to Mars in the next 10 years AND a stated goal of colonization is Musk. Now, whatever your personal beliefs on the likelihood of his plan happening, you have to admit that currently we are absent any colonization statements from NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, or the Chinese Space Agency (I forget the name, sorry China!) that I am unaware of, this means that Musk is the only possible colonizer. While he has not revealed his plans yet, he has not historically seemed that interested in asteroid mining, so you could probably safely assume his Mars plans do not rely upon this. That said, if he has the means to reach Mars, he has the means to reach the asteroids, springing a surprise asteroid mining industry out there would also somewhat be in keeping with Musk\u0027s known MO. Even if all he did was offer a discount on launch services to Planetary resources in exchange for something like 1/10 of their mineral shipments heading to Mars instead of Earth, that could certainly help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick currently is still just the economics of it all. Yes setting down a gigaton of iron or even something more precious on Earth could make its owner a rich person, you have to get it there which has energy costs. Not to mention fascinating political and legal questions that are still as yet unsettled on the international stage. So right now, the only place you can make an economic profit (as opposed to an infrastructural profit [IE Using your resources to further develop your own capabilities rather than selling them]) is Earth or near Earth space, which again brings up those issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I suppose the tldr of this all is that we largely don\u0027t actually know what the elemental scene looks like in the solar system to any real degree of confidence and as such it is somewhat hard to predict what material trades or economies might develop in the early or late game, even more because we don\u0027t know what engine techs might exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T03:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222478058\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135162\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459218226\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232991\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mazon Del\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Mazon Del said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite an impressive post PB666, good work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only immediate criticism I might have is that the biggest unknown on such material discussions is that we have a lot of theories on the elemental compositions of various planets, moons, asteroids, etc and some spectroscopy or other surface readings, we have precious little information on what actually lies beneath the surface of most of these bodies.

That means that so far the only group likely to have a means to Mars in the next 10 years AND a stated goal of colonization is Musk. Now, whatever your personal beliefs on the likelihood of his plan happening, you have to admit that currently we are absent any colonization statements from NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, or the Chinese Space Agency (I forget the name, sorry China!) that I am unaware of, this means that Musk is the only possible colonizer. While he has not revealed his plans yet, he has not historically seemed that interested in asteroid mining, so you could probably safely assume his Mars plans do not rely upon this. That said, if he has the means to reach Mars, he has the means to reach the asteroids, springing a surprise asteroid mining industry out there would also somewhat be in keeping with Musk\u0027s known MO. Even if all he did was offer a discount on launch services to Planetary resources in exchange for something like 1/10 of their mineral shipments heading to Mars instead of Earth, that could certainly help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick currently is still just the economics of it all. Yes setting down a gigaton of iron or even something more precious on Earth could make its owner a rich person, you have to get it there which has energy costs. Not to mention fascinating political and legal questions that are still as yet unsettled on the international stage. So right now, the only place you can make an economic profit (as opposed to an infrastructural profit [IE Using your resources to further develop your own capabilities rather than selling them]) is Earth or near Earth space, which again brings up those issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I suppose the tldr of this all is that we largely don\u0027t actually know what the elemental scene looks like in the solar system to any real degree of confidence and as such it is somewhat hard to predict what material trades or economies might develop in the early or late game, even more because we don\u0027t know what engine techs might exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe reason I think bonafida space agencies don\u0027t have a colonization plan is that they are not sure how or that they can sustain them. Mars has a feature that the moon does not have, on the moon you can, given cumulative space docking land about any thing on the moon with a GPS system in place or even lorance like system, land just about any piece of equipment. Therefore we could dig down say 100 feet, or given time we could even reach the solid warm center of the moon and chances are you would find alot ot uranium and rare earths. That could justify a moon colony, say what you like about Nuclear energy, it beats the crap out of coal, and if we had a great supply it could pay off. But you would be building SRBs to get you back to earth with your load, which means small SRBs. As far as I know the space shuttle is the only vessel that could carry a good size load of uranium back to earth and make it profitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars is a different story, even if you had pure uranium-235 (which is particularly dangerous) or pure platinum it would not be cost effective to ship it back to earth. One of the basic problems is that most board of directors expect now that an investment made today will pay-off in five years, this is not the case, you can\u0027t expect a 5 year payoff in a mars mining operation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with mining economics off-world is that compared to other planets the earths surface is dynamic. This may also be true with other planets, but we have the whole collision thing that occurred after the earth had considerably cooled, then the biological epochs of earth and the fact that we have liquid water has created alot of deposites where killer contaminants are reduced. So you get iron deposits that are low silicon, you have gold deposits, etc. And there is alot of earth and 2000 years of prospecting to find these things, made more easily so by having breathable air and food and water availability. The second problem is that you set out on a 5 year mission to get platinum off of mimos, and year 3 in your mission someone finds a rare combination of palladium-tin and krypton does the same thing for 1/3 the price and you are SOL. Alot of the rare earth stuff is going to be functionally replaced by graphene, which is a cheap on earth as it is anywhere in the galaxy. The so called smart material, in which some very special property is caged and oriented by carbon-nitrogen is going to take alot of the pressure off the rare elements and make things stronger and lighter weight. Imagine that when you make a magnet, its almost impossible to get all the domains to align, but then you put a single atom in a cage which then orients the atom, and you can basically have cages on a string which you weeve into a cloth and connect together like a diamond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the reality of interplanetary commerce is that its primary motivation is future growth off-world, what are future off-worlders willing to pay for something. If its not future growth and if someone isn\u0027t funding off-world growth, commerce does not make sense until there is growth, chicken-egg argument. So then the question is why NASA is right now only talking about a manned flyby (and later maybe a landing and reading the Orion page that sounds \u003Cem\u003Eify . . obviously we don\u0027t have a mars colonization plan because we do not have a manned mars mission plan with details\u003C/em\u003E). Because that is what they think they can do, they may have other robotic plans for mars and its moons, but everyone is interested in what their manned missions are. I would be more interested in do they intend to land on mars moons and bring back samples. The big payback from the moon. . . . seriously we could have sent five clueless missions to the moon where they tripped over themselves. . . . . all that would have still been good with the return of a single moon rock, even 40 years after the mission science papers are still being written on the rocks. So I think primary mission is to get samples from Mars, and if that is too hard then get rocks from the moons of mars, and from there we analyze and see what can be done. I could imagine some crude ore processing unit where tiny little nanobots pick little crystals and separate them one by on onto conveyor belts that then go to a chemical processing bath and separates the elements of the crystal, which is then made into pure samples. All of this would be tested on the mars rocks on earth before being sent to mars for practice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone made the point about why be in space, why should government support a space program. Other than being the heaviest payback welfare system, a space colonization system is a form of insurance against things like global nuclear war or asteroid impacts. These are the benefits now, but with good space science the colonization could have its own internal economics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T10:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s much easier to force a resource recycling on the Earth than to mine and deliver resources from other planets (even if they really are there).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery aspect of industry requires at once enormous amounts of facilities, storages and substances ready to use.

Many elements are siderophiles which mean they will copurify with iron, if you want to get these you have to use a differentinal extraction process. The job of the smelter is basically to separate siderophiles from slag elements and gases, although the addition of graphite aids in the creation of steel (if you are interested in the rare elements this is not warranted at this step) and limestone the separation of slag. Slag can then be crushed into a fine powder and extracted with hydrochloric acid and thus leaving that acid stable silicates and solubilizing the alkali metals. These are then treated with base and the polyvalent cations generally precipitate leaving Li, Na, K\u002B chlorides in solution. Putting these back in elemental form is impractical, it requires electrolytic reduction, or excessive heating. Lithium is useful for making lithium ion batteries, sodium is useful as a system coolant (its vapor point in much higher than water). The smelter is designed to force disequilibrium between transition metals and alkalis such as the metals degass and become nonionic. To separate the siderophiles requires the acid based oxidation of the metals. This means that the metal needs to be pulverized into filings, treate with acid (like sulfuric which also acts as an oxidant, adding potassium dichromate would speed the process up) and bubbling pure oxygen into the mixture. Once oxidized you can neutralize the solution and do differential extraction. The vessel of choice for this is glass-lined, since glass is stable to a 300\u0027 c and is chemically stable up to about pH 12, but some care needs to be made to remove fluorine from solution early in the reaction.\u00A0 The washing elements need to be recycled, this will require an electrolysis to produce chlorine gas, sulfate can be precipitated with calcium . . . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have alot of process chambers that need to be created, laser 3-D printers is an end process, you have to get its reagents into forms it can handle.

You might get it from dirt back asteroids, but fused asteroids made of heated metalics are going to be very hydrogen pour. So I have to say that short period comets are the best source beyond a doubt. All it takes is the effort to pull something like 67p into a stable orbit (which basically tou tug it a little and let jupiter and saturn do the rest) is the best source for the volatiles. There is water on Mercury, but since you made the effort to go their that water would be also split for other duties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNear earth orbit asteroids are not good sources of hydrogen or water, there is some carbon dioxide but mars moons are better sources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is the basic problem with your thinking, which you should have detected before saying im doing it wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoons, Asteroids, etc have alot of aluminum, nickle and silicon on the surface, but very little water. On\u00A0 the moon or mercury this water is precious, because this will be needed for the colony, and is only found in select places, like the caps. This is not the kind of water you want for making rockets to explore the system. This is the kind of water you want for building green houses and domestic use. Most asteroids will be wasted effort to get water, but are good sources of metals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe short period comets are the best source, have the lowest delta-v but require some effort and lots of time. This is where things like high efficiency solar panels and ion drives come into play. Even fusion if it ever comes about. Another strategy is to simply capture a comet, protect it from the sun and place it in a mars/earth orbit where it can be exploited, or even better place it in earth L2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMercury is good because of simply the huge amount of power, you can set out voltaic potentials and capture plasma, giving you all the power you want. This is good for the development of Nerva, which Mercurians would not have any problems with. You don\u0027t have to worry about using water, save it for domestic use and skim protons from channels in mercury to use in rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing about mercury is you have another advantage you can use solar voltaics and rf/laser power to basically accelerate your Nerva propellant to high ISP ION drive exhaust velocities. Mercury is more than about water and/or surface protons, its about power. For example a magnesium based ion drive that could develope say exhaust velocity of 1000000 m/s or even 10000000 m/s would have a solar usage zone after lift-off from mercury of millions of miles, some d/v to push its orbit in while it accelerates, it has 60 days of solar power at 4 to 8 times that of earth (provided solar panels). We can imagine how much dV that could development for travel to the outer system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHYdrogen is a poor propellant for Vasmir (storage is inefficient compared to other gases and solids, metalic magnesium is the best storage form), the best ion drive propellants store as solids (magnesium). Vasmir we don\u0027t have a power supply for, unless you are in mercurian orbit and high heat solar stability has improved and power to weight ratios increase by 10 fold. The thing about bring comets into stable orbits and covering them from solar radiation is that these are huge concentrated reservoirs of volatiles, but you have no cost at all for launching product and landing. If you placed one of these in Martain L2, its basically there for your mars moons needs. Sure you can invest 100 fold more effort trying to get hydrogen from Mimos, but you still have to launch it, were as on L2, you don\u0027t have to spend the effort and you don\u0027t have to pay much launch cost, and you can spend a tiny about of dV to send it to L1, or package it up and send it to earths L2, were it can be used. Again all this would be done utilizing the argon (comets have argon gas also) and other minerals you capture on the comet to basically run your ION drive, when and if fusion power ever becomes feasible. For a mercurian polar-crater colony we don\u0027t have to wait for fusion. There is also the potential of hunting down dirtballs in Jupiters orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFreddy your problem is that you tend to gloss over the problems in space colonization, you think that some webpages handwaving solution is a solution. Space colonization is hard, the best sources of resources are often the hardest to reach, the ones within reach demand such an energy cost to extract it makes expansion incredibly difficult. Your colonies are going to leak and lose material. But then you want to use water (2H2 \u002B O2) as a launch fuel. To much competition for too little resource. When they say there is water on the polar moon or mercury, they don\u0027t mean lakes, they mean basically frost accumulated in between the dirt on the surface. When they talk about water on Mars, its in saturated solution with other minerals. H20 is volatile in the inner solar system, its stable on earth only because of Earths size (gravity) and bound atmosphere, and temperature. Simply using a drill is some of these locations to bring up dirt will supply enough instability that water basically vaporizes and blasts away into space. For 2H2, O2 based engines you need big sources of water, not trivial sources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to be able to find great sources of resources, so that a little waste does\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"insert_name","CreatedById":150339,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T16:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222481057\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135162\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459303844\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly while humanity grows,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhile the industry can\u0027t recycle any slag to a combination of useful simple substances (just because a slag is usually a stable substance in an \u0022energy well\u0022),\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhile you need to produce much more than you consume and can\u0027t recycle the excessive goods back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a 99% recycling, and there is more or less constant amount of people, your need in new resources falls down to a ridiculous level and can be easily covered with the terrestrial ones, with no need in asteroids.

Space colonization is hard, the best sources of resources are often the hardest to reach, the ones within reach demand such an energy cost to extract it makes expansion incredibly difficult. Your colonies are going to leak and lose material. But then you want to use water (2H2 \u002B O2) as a launch fuel. To much competition for too little resource. When they say there is water on the polar moon or mercury, they don\u0027t mean lakes, they mean basically frost accumulated in between the dirt on the surface. When they talk about water on Mars, its in saturated solution with other minerals. H20 is volatile in the inner solar system, its stable on earth only because of Earths size (gravity) and bound atmosphere, and temperature. Simply using a drill is some of these locations to bring up dirt will supply enough instability that water basically vaporizes and blasts away into space.
