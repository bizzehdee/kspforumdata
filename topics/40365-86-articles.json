Made it seem kinda roll-play-ish). When I got there I landed and went to do science, but when I got back and wanted to take off, the \u0027WasteHeat\u0027 wouldn\u0027t go away like it normally would when the reactor was offline, so it seems I am stuck for now. (btw, my engine systems were one 2.5m thermal rocket nozzle, one 2.5m nuclear reactor, and one inline radiator (didn\u0027t have the other radiators researched at the time.)) I was, however, able to restart the game to take off though, so I\u0027m fine for now, just a little problem.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inline radiators really struggle to handle any of the reactors outside of the atmosphere, they\u0027re fine if you want a surface base somewhere in an atmosphere but they\u0027re really going to struggle out in space, they just don\u0027t have the kind of surface area needed to keep that amount of heat under control in vacuum. Since the nuclear reactors don\u0027t power down below 30%, there is something of a constant cooking of the ship going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea why your WasteHeat wasn\u0027t going away though. Did you try right-clicking on the radiator to see what its readings were reading? If it happens again, check all the readings form the reactor, radiator, etc and also press Alt\u002BF2 to bring up the console and see if there is anything helpful in there. The more information I have, the easier it will be to find out why this happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
