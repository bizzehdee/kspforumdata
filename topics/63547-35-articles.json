It\u0027s not even the engines; it\u0027s the wings (procedural), parachutes (realchute), and other random parts. They reach 1400\u002B degrees, catch fire, and burn up. Am I doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: I know that irl, this is avoidable, because the X-51 was able to achieve mach 5.1 for 3 minutes, and likely had been at mach 4\u002B for at least 7-10 minutes. On top of that, it was in much denser atmosphere. I know it takes special materials and engineering, and might not be practical right this moment, but engineering is making steady headway. I like KSP not just for what we already can do, but what we COULD do, if technologies that are in the prototype phase now made it to reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, thanks so much for AJE!
