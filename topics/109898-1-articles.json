Didn\u0027t visit other planets yet, barely had 2 mil funds stocked up, and I\u0027ve concluded that sending one way crafts would be expensive and hard to get into atmosphere with my current tech level, and with big lifters being too expensive. So I decided to make a reusable return Starship that can refuel in Orbit. This is my first attempt at something like this ever (Since I only ever play career mode), so here is my progress so far, and how I planned it to look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img538/5687/cguwA3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cguwA3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I have built so far, the base in orbit, and the side docking ports for Nuclear Engines and liquid fuel tanks. A Duna lander/return craft is also ready and docked in this picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img537/129/sMDGup.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sMDGup.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how I hope it will look like when I finish it. With all these Nerv Engines, it has around 0.25 TWR, and a total of 7000 Delta/v with a 25 ton payload (Approximate weight of the Duna lander)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img633/4038/MER9iN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MER9iN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere comes the tricky part for me, this is how the engine part (One out of 12) looks like, and currently I\u0027m having trouble lifting it into Orbit. Its mass is completely uneven, and has a lot of drag. The Mk2 fairing can\u0027t close up the entire thing, and I haven\u0027t yet unlocked fairings Mk3, but even so I don\u0027t know if fairings help with uneven mass (I\u0027m guessing no).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you have any suggestions how to get these things into the orbit, any advice is welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img673/2100/G48PFO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022G48PFO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the look of my tech tree at the time of building/designing this vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for viewing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T03:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can see lots of better ways to do it but none that don\u0027t involve a complete overhaul (which would involve relaunch) of your vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy best suggestion is to build the mk2 fuel segments with docking ports on one side and stack them right up against the main body, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a4JcSFI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022a4JcSFI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you empty that section 75-80%, it has a 0.85 TWR on launch. Once you get higher up and burn some fuel, you can get a 1.0 TWR (not that it will matter by that time). I didnt but you can shove a probe core, SAS unit, and monoprop tank on top of the adapter before the nose cone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: didnt explain why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour current config is gonna wobble around because your girder bracings do nothing. Parts do not collide with other parts on the same vessel in KSP. My suggestion involves a multi-dock, which is harder to do but much much sturdier. It also provides you roughly the same overall fuel and less engine mass (8 Nervs are more than enough for that but don\u0027t expect super-quick burns).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T03:25:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 03:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T04:31:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwww, they don\u0027t collide?
