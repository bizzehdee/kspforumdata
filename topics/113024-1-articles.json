My probe orbiting minmus is now effectively dark as I have no power to shutdown the instruments that have sucked the life from the batteries. The solar panels are charging them, but as soon as any power returns the instruments just drain them again.\n\nSimple fix would be to power down everything as soon as batteries hit critical level - whatever that is - 5%-10% of max value and to get a warning as well \u0022batteries on \u003Cx-vessel\u003E critical level\u0022\u003C/x-vessel\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Bug_","CreatedById":140851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T12:19:59Z","Content":"you can also just have one battery on your vessel that is already shut off, and use that for backup power.
