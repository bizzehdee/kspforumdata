Reasons: before I first formatted the drive, the flash drive\u0027s on FAT32; after QUICK formatting it to exFAT I began having problems with missing and corrupt files; in fact it was so annoying that I reformatted it FULLY to FAT32 again and no more problems, which leaves a question: Why doesn\u0027t exFAT work on my USB drive while FAT32 works?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, at least in my point of view, exFAT has gains and drawbacks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGains: The most significant gain is the increased speed of programs. I do Java coding a lot, especially since I have Intro to Programming class as one of my classes; thus the external drives are needed to store information, since school doesn\u0027t allow storage of greater than 100 MB and at any rate the size of USB Drive:\\Intro to Programming - [REDACTED - Why should I show the teacher\u0027s name \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E?]\\ is going to exceed 100 MB anyway (since besides the classwork and homework programs I write, I also write other programs alone). With the old FAT32 partition the speed to quit Eclipse is slow as a snail (2 minutes, to be exact); with exFAT the time is shorten to just a couple seconds. Seriously, every second feels like a minute to me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrawbacks: File corruption and deletion, and especially errors. Whenever I tried to create a .zip file, when I reload the drive it says it was corrupted - in fact it shows this message \u0022Please insert the last disk of the Multi-Volume set and click OK to continue\u0022 when there\u0027s only one zipped file that contains information for that! Besides that, when I reload Eclipse I found all of the projects inaccessible, and when I do get the folders working everything inside the project folders is gone! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E (No help when you still have 1 class to do...) Thank god I have a backup copy, but it means to redo everything. All of that repeated after the second formatting (full format, also to exFAT), and all hell stopped after I full format the drive to FAT32.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the gains and drawbacks of FAT32 (again, my POV):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGains: Stability. Never had I gotten a drive in FAT32 format did troubles arise. At least not yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrawbacks: Slowness and limitations, The larges file possible is chopped to 4GB, and a partition with FAT32 file system can go up to 32GB and that\u0027s it. Any higher and you would need NTFS or exFAT or other file systems that supports higher memory partitions. Besides the limitations, loading speed is pretty slow, so slow that I had thought once to format the drive to NTFS. I still consider whether I should format the drive to NTFS or keep it to FAT32 for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry that I have to rant, but exFAT just doesn\u0027t work properly with my flash drive. Anyway, just talk about FAT and exFAT in this thread, or everything related to file systems \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T06:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never really got the pint of exFAT TBH, I use ext2 or FAT32 for small disks, where the overhead of say, NTFS is a significant chunk of the capacity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENTFS for everything \u0026gt;16GB that neads to be readable by Windoze \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy larger storage arrays are all ZFS now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor anything else: ext4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReiserfs can be a good choice for certain workloads, if you don\u0027t mind that the guy who wrote it is a bit of a creep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason I\u0027d use a non-journalled filesystem is, as above, on really small disks.
