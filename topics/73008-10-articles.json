You may want to stop at 20 degrees initially for the sake of keeping your vertical speed up, but drop down to 10 to 15 degrees when you got a good enough vertical speed cushion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Just cruise along. Keep your vertical speed under to around 100 m/s, tapping down the attitude to keep that in check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) If you\u0027re on target, you should be able to get to ~1.9-2.1 km/s by the time you reach 32km in altitude. Keep burning the jets until you hit your desired apopasis (mine is 100km). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Your jets will start cutting out around 42 to 44 km.

You can use those to make short bursts to compensate for apoapsis decay due to drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) For a 100 km orbit, a burn of ~80 m/s should circularize your orbit well enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) When landing, you should have 1/3 liquid fuel in the turbojet tanks, good enough for a couple go-arounds if you mess up the landing at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn orbit, the plane has a paltry ~310 m/s of delta-v.
