We still haven\u0027t heard of it before last week, so it is probably safe to say that none of our suggestions will be heeded for the final game. At least, not in a way where we can ask the devs to significantly change direction. That said, there are plenty of reasons to work our collective hivemind into imagining what alternative game systems would look like, to detail them, to find what the problems would be, and how useful the idea\u0027s are when implemented. The goal of this thread is to go into detail about game systems that could have been different in KSP 2. As for the plenty of reasons of why this execrise could be useful; any future development of any ksp game in any capacity could have the benefit of having the players already figured out how the game could/needs to be improved in a detailed way. It becomes easier to implement something if it has a vision,\u00A0 it becomes easier to implement something that has its kinks worked out, and it becomes easier to implement something that has community support behind it. And maybe, just maybe, good ideas can move the current devs to make changes before the release.....
