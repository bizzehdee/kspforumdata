The Mun\\\u0027s terrain will quickly flip any vehicle moving faster than a dying crawl, and if the terrain doesn\\\u0027t get you, the tile seams certainly will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft isn\\\u0027t exempt from that in the slightest, but by and large, nor is it bothered by it. It can be driven any way up, and is extremely sturdy. If you\\\u0027re anything like me, you\\\u0027ll soon destroy the RCS tanks and solar collectors, but the rest of the sled is indestructable if it doesn\\\u0027t hit the surface at more than ~20m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbin orbital stage can be a bitch to control for some reason, but it\\\u0027s manageable.
