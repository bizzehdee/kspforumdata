It works, I\u0027ve done it that way, but only for small satellites that can be run in the same launch. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vqFmcMg.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBigger ones won\u0027t work\u003C/a\u003E. Also, it will make it hard to launch if not all your satellites are the same. In synchronous orbit, only the satellite opposite KSC needs all the dishes (you can park a rover with dishes right next to the tracking station for when that satellite is obstructed), the rest just have to be relays around the planet, (with 4 sats, the 3 others can just be communotron 32s and nothing else). Launching all 3 or 4 without being identical may be a balance issue on a single rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I do it is first I set up my desired network in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ryohpops.github.io/kspRemoteTechPlanner/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis planner tool here\u003C/a\u003E. It tells you the distance between each satellite once that is done. KSP will tell you the distance between two craft and also will tell show you the intersect points on a maneuver node. It\u0027s just like finding a rendezvous, but instead of getting your target distance as close to 0 as you can, get your target distance at the distance the tool web tells you to. This doesn\u0027t require a single launch and is pretty easy for anyone who knows how to use the maneuver node editor to rendezvous already. Once you get your distance close enough, you just match your orbital periods and you are done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I haven\u0027t squashed your creativity, the spreadsheet does seem to do what it says it will and it is very nicely done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T04:40:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 04:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ens Gijs","CreatedById":11410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T14:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the link to the other planning tool - I did look for tools before I made mine, but this one didn\u0027t come up.
