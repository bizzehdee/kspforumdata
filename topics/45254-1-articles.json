I\u0027m trying to move a large object, (station) from Kerbin orbit to the Mun. It\u0027s got large engines which should be more than enough for the delta v, and a ton of fuel. The problem is, I think, that it has some appendages or docked sections that protrude non-symmetrical along the main core. Anyway, when I begin the maneuver, and reach about 1/4 throttle on the burn, the craft begins to wobble, eventually into a slow out of control twist which takes it off course, and impossible to correct. The only way I\u0027ve been able to make any progress on the trip is to literally, hold the throttle below a quarter thrust and maintain constant counter force on the RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not symmetrical, and it\u0027s not completely balanced...but would that have a real effect in space? I honestly don\u0027t know the answer, and am by no means complaining or griping about the game...at all. I love it. I\u0027m just curious if I am missing something? Or is this somewhat appropriate behavior for a very large craft like space station size? Or is it an aspect of the game that I have to just play around? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-08T15:49:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2013 03:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by daffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yibbachester","CreatedById":81731,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T23:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit torques due to the trust. even though there is no resistance, the parts will still flex badly when the main thrusted section moves. my suggestion is to undock all the parts and send each to the mun orbit via rockets sent into space to take them there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T00:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not from drag, as soon as you\u0027re out of the atmosphere (slightly over 69km on Kerbin) your craft won\u0027t experience any drag.

Fortunately, I\u0027ve gotten accurate enough with docking, that I have had plenty of RCS to work with and remaining in order to reconstruct it. After the information, and discussions, I\u0027ve decided to pull it to Duna and reassemble it there. Maybe I\u0027ll try to set up some sort of a relay network for my RemoteTech, and use it as a big hub. It was actually too long to push, so I thankfully had a large tug already built that was able to launch and hook up with it. There\u0027s four LV-N 60\u0027s on the tug. I know it\u0027s going to be a slow and long trip, but I think it should work. We\u0027ll see. Thanks a ton for the comments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
