But, the target selection menu accessible from the map view (to assign an antenna) is absolutely fine. I would imagine however to have another menu available (possibly with Mission Control, as those Github comments suggest) where all available antennae from all communication sats in orbit around a body can be controlled together. Multiple antennae may be assigned to specific groups, and then may be activated and assigned targets with a single group command. Like on a spreadsheet, with rows for available antennae (or groups) and columns for possible targets, and the user may select a specific target for each antenna (or group), all in a single place.\u003Cp\u003EHave to say, the above is not actually an original idea from me.

I have satellites around the Mun and Minmus. So, when the Mun blocks the line of sight to Kerbin, a vessel did connect to a sat around the mun and find a route to Kerbin that way. That worked perfectly fine.

My KSO sats have three or five dishes (the ones within sight of KSC have only three, two of the folding dishes towards Kerbin on the blind KSO sat and the fixed dish towards \u0022active vessel\u0022; the blind KSO has five, the same static 90Mm dish for \u0022active vessel\u0022, one to each of the KSO sats within line of sight of KSC, and one each to Minmus and Mun). I have four sats in semi-stationary orbits around the Mun so far, each with eight folding dishes and 1 static 90Mm dish, giving me more coverage of Kerbin and Minmus. I plan on placing some more around Minmus tonight (some more 8\u002B1 sats, but in MinSO). I have two extra dishes on each of my MunSSO sats for deeper coverage (likely Eve/Gilly and/or Duna/Ike for my first forays outside of Kerbin\u0027s SoI). Once I have larger dishes/omnis I\u0027ll put up new KSO, MunSSO, and MinSO sats for deeper coverage of the system, as well a some relays, perhaps some in Low Kerbol Orbit for coverage anti-Kerbin, as well as repeaters further out to blanket the system in coverage. I\u0027ll likely always have the longest range static dishes on each of my sats set to \u0022active vessel\u0022, but also rely on a full network of sats for actual coverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my current KSO and MunSSO sats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dx60E0P.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Dx60E0P.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-30T03:47:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2014 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nobodez\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boomerang","CreatedById":92198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T08:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to say that I\u0027m rather impressed with this current iteration of Remotetech.

A trio of heavy polar satellites that carry the link between Kerbin and Jool, then a dish for each moon along with an AV dish.
