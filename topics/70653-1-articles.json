I perhaps didn\u0027t expect it to be so difficult. I had sent a couple probes to Eve and hadn\u0027t researched it on the forums much, because exploration is more fun sometimes. Therefore, this approach might not seem like a mission at first, but I kind of made up the mission as I went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is light on the fiction aspect, but more like self documentary. Hey, I don\u0027t know what it is, or if it belongs here, but I decided to write it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EAfter writing this up and getting an idea how much time that took and how much mission I covered, I imagine there will be two more \u0022Parts\u0022 after this.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: This story/report is in 4 parts (posts.)

I picked a small vehicle that I knew could make a Kerbin ascent, and sent poor Jorski Kerman out to try it on Eve. I did modify it slightly to use the Mk-1 lander can, and added drogue chutes. Now I knew it wouldn\u0027t make it, but I wanted to get a feel for the atmosphere. I should have sent it unmanned, but I\u0027m pretty sure those Kerbals can photosynthesize and hibernate indefinitely. This was Eve-4. (Eve 1-3 were unmanned probes) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y4HFc7y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y4HFc7y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon arrival to Eve, I moved the return pod to the Rockomax stack, and sent the lander down for a test landing. The landing went smoothly but I used more fuel than I had hoped. However, the ascent was not as impressive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8C7sLRe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228C7sLRe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, it didn\u0027t make it very far. From the Wiki page, I knew that landing on a mountain might help. It did quite a bit, but not near enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E40Hbri.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022E40Hbri.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I had stranded Jorski on Eve. I began work to build a new vehicle, this time taking some clues from a few forum posts on the subject. Aerospike engines get a lot of praise here, as well as asparagus staging, so I came up with Eve-5\u0027s design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qeJyJSp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qeJyJSp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6And it had its own flaws... Actually I did manage to launch it correctly, but it didn\u0027t get far. I didn\u0027t get a screenshot of that attempt. That was March 31...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 2: ARM Update!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as I began to re-evaluate how much time I was spending on this mission, version .23.5 was released. And Behold: Bigger rockets! \u0022Oh this has got to be a lot easier now!\u0022 I thought. So I started incorporating some new parts in my design, subtly at first. Eve-6 was born:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2lF5f3P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222lF5f3P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you are looking closely you may notice undeployed chutes and Ronzon on board. It turns out the KSP had enough data at this point to rig up an Eve ascent simulator at KSC, saving the need for long expensive journeys to Eve to test ships. Yep. That\u0027s my story, and I\u0027m sticking with it. Still though, not enough:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fesxFWy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fesxFWy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: Most of those objects in the picture above are not actually around Eve, but on Kerbin and other places in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter fiddling with the design and finding no good way to add stages to it without fundamental changes, I decided to throw out the design and start from scratch. This time, I would go big. Really big. Enter Eve-7:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SeNuaRS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SeNuaRS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I really liked about the .23.5 update was the LES. I first put one on Eve-7 for posterity, but then realized it made a very convenient way to dispose of my science package when no longer needed. I previously used a method of dropping them from the bottom of the vehicle before landing, or other tricks, but this was a nice way to re-purpose the LES after launch. I would have it also for Eve ascent in theory but wouldn\u0027t use it for that, because being stranded there without a return vessel is not much better than a fiery death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe metal structure on the bottom of the ascent vehicle is my landing structure. It\u0027s angled 10 degrees down, but you can\u0027t see that here. I didn\u0027t put any actual landing legs on it, just used the flex of the metal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe however-many jumbo-64 tanks are an asparagus heavy lifter that I used for a previous mission. It has 17 Mainsails at its core, and something like 48 Skippers on the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 3: Manned Mission Two Begins\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving gone through Kerbin based testing, and being utterly convinced that such a large rocket could not possibly fail, the engineers decided to skip the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEve Simulator.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 (What that means is that I wanted to test the entire trip this time with the new design.) Jack and Raymore Kerman were convinced by the engineers and sheer size of this creation, and signed on for the trip (leaving one seat for the return of Jorski of course.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey launched into orbit, but were forced to use some of their Eve ascent fuel to make it. They would also need fuel for the insertion. Thus the refuelling began.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/umOeC9F.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022umOeC9F.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain I\u0027d like to note that a better way to plan this mission would have some of these things going in a different order, but this was essentially my first attempt at such a complicated mission. In the future I will try to do things like send the Kerbals last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I sent up refueling flights one problem I had was to stow the LES with science package until assembly operations were complete. I sent up a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctemporary\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 docking node to help with this, and also decided to try out the new claw. Yes, it\u0027s for catching asteroids, but wow is it useful. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it gets nerfed in a later version. It serves as a dock-anywhere device, essentially making it a refueling device, and general purpose fix any ship device. I\u0027ll have an example of that later. But transferring fuel through it is somewhat questionable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YiEZ1C6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YiEZ1C6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y6ZDrVv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y6ZDrVv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, at KSC...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineers eventually got Eve-7 programmed into the Eve Simulator, (or Eve-ulator as they now called it.) They had focused on launch before, but now they were running landing simulations. (In other words, I decided to send the not yet fully fueled ship to Eve.) My first test landing ended up on water, which was OK for this test. It revealed what could turn out to be a serious design oversight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6Qdi2kH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226Qdi2kH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo of my ladders were missing! Well, not missing really, when I quickly realized what had happened. I had ladders pointing both up and down from a decoupler on that central engine. I had not originally planned to lose that decoupler before landing, but I forgot to put a docking clamp in here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/taIoItC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022taIoItC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had actually noticed the lack of docking clamp earlier, in Kerbin orbit. I was originally planning to replace the Mainsails with nuclear engines, but upon noticing that I forgot a docking port there, I just thought \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COh well, I\u0027ll use the Mainsails.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 That meant that I had to use more fuel, but it seemed better than launching another Eve-7 at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, you might already see another oversight related to that decoupler:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2LxyS2K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222LxyS2K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added those inner 4 structural panels late in the design to make sure the Kerbals had something to step on under the ladders. They trapped the Mainsail stack like a peg in a hole (or something.) Fortunately, brute force worked to free the spent stage without any damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the Eve-ulation. Somehow, this happened. I honestly don\u0027t remember why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vmpXbHf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vmpXbHf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, whatever, I had to end the Eve-ulation (reload my quicksave in Kerbin orbit) to see if I could salvage this ladder situation. Sure, they could land and just take off, but that means no flag planting or surface samples. Unacceptable. So what could I send up there that will help the situation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, at some point I had started deciding to add things to the mission, such as a rover. I was only thinking about ascent before, but really why waste such a huge trip? I also wanted to add a small glider, but had little experience with planes at this point, so that idea was shelved. The rover idea however, presented an opportunity to get around the ladder situation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wpJRgfX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wpJRgfX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested it at KSC, but I can\u0027t rely on landing on a flat surface, and water would of course make the rover useless. I needed a fallback plan. Something like this perhaps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MGyfcX3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MGyfcX3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMmmmno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I could only attach parts to something already in orbit... Wait... Yes, that\u0027s it! Meet the ladder-grabber:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nb8rAkW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Nb8rAkW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above is actually the second and more precise mk-2 design. I had already sent the rover-ladder, and ladder-grabber mk-1 to rendezvous with Eve-7, but the latter didn\u0027t work so well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d1IVfiE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022d1IVfiE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp went the ladder-grabber mk-2. You can see in this next picture why I think the new grabber/claw maybe makes things a little too easy in some cases. I am starting to get really lazy with my docking skills:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pgeNysK.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pgeNysK.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also inadvertently well on my way to assembling a small space station on this thing. A little rearranging things later, and the ladder-grabber mk-2 slides into place:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hPZP1oP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hPZP1oP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJack tests it out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0nGorij.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220nGorij.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I thought he might be happy about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I had 2 methods to get Kerbanauts beck on to the ship. The ladder-grabber looked like it had already solved the problem, but I did\u0027t know if it would stay attached throughout landing on Eve. But at that point, Eve-7 had been retroffitted, finished it\u0027s refueling, and was redy to embark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OoYz92I.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OoYz92I.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 2 coming soon...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-09T22:21:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2014 10:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jBeta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jBeta","CreatedById":102831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T21:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 4: Eve-7 Journeys to Eve.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CxLwctF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CxLwctF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJack and Raymore were on their way!

It turns out that he had not actually attempted landing on Eve with Eve-4. That was also a simulation... or.. Ah forget it, I had restored a quicksave after he landed before. The ship he had at his disposal was intended to be his return vessel, and I was still planning on using it thus. The Mk1-2 pod could attach backwards to the engine stack. All that being said, Jorski needed to meet up with the others, and his ship was more maneuverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vpo9SH5.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022Vpo9SH5.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me point out something that always happens to me. I always seem to be a docking port short. Sometimes by mistake, sometimes on purpose. Looking at that image of Eve-4, you can see the command module has a docking port, but the lander can does not - it can only disconnect. Same with the science package and the rocket stack. That was on purpose, but it meant that the lander could not dock with anything and refuel (well, except for the claw). That\u0027s ok, I decided to move the command module on to the rocket stack in return configuration, and ditch the lander on a suborbital trajectory.

Maybe from a mountain, but that was not an option now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the main problems is the topmopst size-3 tank which was smaller in earlier iterations of this design.

Not all was lost. I had at least one thing now that I didn\u0027t before: A LOT of fuel on Eve\u0027s surface. And a rover. And a semi-useful KSS. OK, three things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI needed a fuel rover to transfer that fuel to the eventual Eve-8. I started to design that first to see if it would even work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an early test desgin, and the basic concept of what I would be doing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vl1hpb5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vl1hpb5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGotta love the part grabber! I must say this is one case where the dock-anywhere idea seems to make sense, except for the fact I can transfer fuel through just about any part I believe. Well, we can just pretend there is a hose there instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving given more thought to Eve-8, I shifted the engineers\u0027 attention there. The upper stage was eliminated at first, but later added back as a removable X200-16 tank, with radial Mark 55 engines. I was leaving room to fine tune the upper stage later. I knew I needed more stages so I used the same basic design, but switched to 6-symmetry, essentially adding 2 stages. I also discovered a new feature of .23.5 that wasn\u0027t really announced: RGB settings on the Illuminators! Yes, I overdid it. My logic was that the color pattern would help a lot with docking. In later ships I toned it down to a more conservative approach though (red green port and starboard)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F536Jhx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F536Jhx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also sending a 3 person rover this time, without the ladder.

The result was a lighter simulated vehicle. KSC scientists and engineers were making numerous changes to the Eve-ulator to fix the error. Raymore had also communicated concerns for the newly arrived fuel-rover, which was already showing signs of wheel fatigue from the 5km drive to Eve-7 without even bearing any fuel. He shared his findings with the Eve-ulator techs, and the new simulator physics were tested. Soon their concerns were verified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O262AYv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022O262AYv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat problem was not major, as one of the other rovers could ride along side as an escort to make repairs as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the flight planners were also plotting revised descent profiles for the mission. It would take up to 10 fuel-rover trips to transfer the fuel, so proximity was important. Unfortunately, the Eve-ulator did not have the CPU power to simulate reliably at closer than 2.5km. A safe separation of 5km was chosen as ideal. Eve-8 was designed to have some breathing room with 36 drogue chutes, and 20 XL parachutes: an increase of 2 and 16 respectively over Eve-7. The new simulations made for a landing at just under 10m/s, which was still within an acceptable range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QV8oyxF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QV8oyxF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch simulations however, would create their biggest concern.

I\u0027ve been playing this game for 5 months and just this week realized that the little \u0022i\u0022nformation thing on the right or the map screen tells me the total mass of my ship. That would have been good to know... Anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had realized at this point that I would have had better luck with much smaller fuel tanks and engines, but I had been working on this mission for two weeks already, so a complete redesign of my vehicle was not something I really wanted to do. (I\u0027m sure I will in the future though.) Eve-9 would add 3 similar stages, hopefully filling the gap to make ascent possible. If it didn\u0027t work, I would have to start from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VGjm34q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VGjm34q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the Eve-ulator techs had been sacked, and the new hires now ironically referred to it as the \u0022Evul8r.\u0022 Their tests of Eve-9 indicated KSC would have to launch it with the 6 new fuel tanks empty, as the Mainsail/Rockomax heavy lifter was finally at its limit. (Of course I am thinking about a Size 3 replacement core for that eventually, but I don\u0027t want to re-invent the wheel while I\u0027m using it.) Achieving Kerbin orbit used 95 percent of its fuel. The behemoth swallowed tankers in LKO with a thirst that was unquenchable. The last of the original Fuel-X depot was spent at this point, sending some of its remaining modules to dock with Fuel-X2. The launch window had arrived before refueling was complete however, so Eve-9 departed with just enough fuel to reach Eve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC was aware that there was still not enough fuel for the return flight, but they wanted to take this opportunity to expand the mission parameters yet again.

I know it\u0027ll be difficult. Especially since I\u0027m not only bringing a proper lander-can to do it and not \u0022cheating\u0022 by using a command seat - I\u0027m also intending to bring a Science Jr pod with a few extra instruments bolted on back into orbit.

It\u0027ll get to Kerbin Orbit with about 2500 atmospheric dV left over. But I\u0027m thinking it is not quite enough. Initial dV is a bit over 5000 in total (over 6 stages), I\u0027m thinking just to be safe I\u0027ll need 7000. Now, the dV readout from Mech-Jeb doesn\u0027t take into account the shedding of parts during the ascent, so it is basically a guessing game. What it do get right though is the initial TWR, which is only 1.27. Meaning I\u0027ll burn a lot of fuel just getting it up to 200m/s, which will be my speed limit until I hit some thinner atmosphere. No need to introduce more drag than necessary (burning fuel to no use) by going too fast down in the thickest soup of Eve air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ll have to bolt on something to help it with the initial climb.
