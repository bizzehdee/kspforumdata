However, I give MJ2 a head start by going to each craft and controlling from the docking port that\u0027s doing the docking, targeting the opposing docking port and using the Smart A.S.S. (Engage the Smart A.S.S.!!!! sorry, had to say it...) to manually point towards the target. Do that on each craft. It worked better on versions of MJ2 prior to KSP .21.x but lately it tends to immediately drift while switching craft whereas before MJ2 would still be active on the inactive craft keeping its port pointed at you. Not sure why it\u0027s not doing it anymore \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I can still make it work if I turn on SAS afterwards and let it stabilize a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:07:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe default one can do that too.

Pretty remarkable creation!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I understand correctly that, when I activate an auto-pilot feature, such as auto-ascent, the application will effectively execute a \u0022perfect\u0022 sequence of maneuvers in the sense that it will not waste any fuel? If that is correct, then it seems to me that just watching what MJ does with your ship when you give it a particular problem is a huge way to learn more. I was operating from the basic premise that the gravity turn should be performed sometime after 10,0000 m. I basically understand what terminal velocity means, but I was nonetheless surprised to see Mechjeb making my gravity turn at like 5400 m.

So the fact that it is taking my 7 stage rocket that I\u0027ve used a lot to put stuff into geosynch and out to Mun, and committing the gravity turn at 5.4km instead of 10 to 11 where I normally do it doesn\u0027t really mean that 5.4km is the \u0022better\u0022 place to do that turn?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get the impression that there are presently quite a few known problems with this version as it functions either with 0.21 KSP else with other mods? I have RemoteTech running, but not using the Flight Computer. I just had MJ fail me on an Ascent that I turned over to full auto right after launch (really just to see how it works). First it didn\u0027t prevent overheats and my central engine blew up. Next it didn\u0027t actually relinquish control of the throttle or attitude when I clicked \u0022Deactivate Autopilot\u0022 and then finally it sent my rocket into a spin at about 30km that caused it to break apart and fall out of the sky. Can try replicate or provide more details as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
