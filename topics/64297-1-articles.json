The bottom LV-N would add some TWR on the initial burn stage. However, I was able to get orbital with that bottom onion stage of Skippers intact but empty (the center of the onion is 95% full). Now I\u0027m thinking of trucking the whole mess to Minmus, fill the thing with my Kethane refinery, and then drop pairs of greys, then the oranges. I would have the dead weight of the Skippers, though. What do you think?
