We have heard and seen things about land colonies and orbital colonies but aquatic colonies could just bring that extra bit of gameplay to the update (seeing that resource delivery routes wont be in the game yet). It is nice timing that they fixed the buoyancy for the most part with the For Science! update. Obviously if the devs haven\u0027t been working on this then it won\u0027t be able to happen in the update but maybe later down the line it could be added. Or maybe they\u0027re keeping it a surprise just for a little bit of shock when the release comes.

Maybe there are distinctions here that would prevent it, but we\u0027ll have to wait and see I suspect. This might be the kind of things that the devs haven\u0027t thought to try that someone will find a way to make it work if only by using some clever trick to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarAdmiral","CreatedById":107350,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-22T04:23:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really expect floating colonies, at least at the first release.
