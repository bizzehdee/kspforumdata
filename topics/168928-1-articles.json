Usually when I do a butt joint on a couple of modular girder struts it fuses even if I don\u0027t bother to get the nodes facing each other. This time, I looked inside my payload area and not only are things not fused, they are also slowly rotating which results in my rocket rotating and as i get going faster the whole thing blows up. I take it to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and everything looks fine. I thought I read that there is a key to hold down that shows you if anything is broken, but I don\u0027t remember what it is. Sounds like a great feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also mounted an engine on a modular girder strut and then mounted that assembly on the bottom of an inline\u00A0battery. Half of those are also floating around inside the payload area before launch. Yes. I put too many engines on and it gets hard to see. That screw up is a little more understandable, but it had\u00A0been working fine. In fact this rocket had been working pretty good. I had it in orbit, but it didn\u0027t get there smooth enough.\u00A0I had to keep modifying it.

I built sort of a wireframe of half a dome because it had to go out and then down and I didn\u0027t want the upper engine blowing on the lower engine. (I think that would cancel the thrust but don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a visual of that) I built 8 legs with 5 engines each. Then I built a tower and put on gigantor solar. I launched at night and got into the sun, but it wasn\u0027t enough thrust and I went into the dark side of the planet. Then I launched into the sun and against the spin of the earth.

Build the long range xenon ship with tons of solar in orbit by sending up the parts in huge ships that just have to orbit earth. That way I won\u0027t have to deal with the computer crashing because the ship has so many parts on earth and I can build huge frames in space because there\u0027s no gravity or air resistance. All I have to do is plan and build everything perfectly, send it up, put it into precise circular orbits and think of everything and then go up there, learn to dock and assemble and then take off with a ship with enough solar that it runs on full power.
