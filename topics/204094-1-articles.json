The components that limit you in games are the CPU and GPU, and maybe the RAM (but only if you don\u0027t have enough). Even if a gaming laptop is made that has a graphics card made to fit into a socket, the problem becomes that because it needed to go in a laptop it uses some funky proprietary form factor that as far as you (who owns said laptop) is concerned it might as well be soldered in for all the good that socket does you, because literally nobody makes graphics cards of that form factor other than the graphics card that\u0027s already IN your laptop, so there is STILL no upgrade potential.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll stick with packing my Nintendo Switch and Tablet when I go on vacations, the tablet has a fantastic screen to watch movies and videos and Twitch streams on, and the Switch has a whole lot of good games on it (tho I do avoid playing it when I\u0027m not on vacation so that I don\u0027t run thru all the games on it). 512GB microSD cards in both ensures that I shouldn\u0027t ever run out of content even if I can\u0027t get a WiFi connection (tho I do tend to make sure I go to spots with internet connection available).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a PC, I have a Nintendo Switch and, while on the go, I\u0027m currently playing NES Games on an unlocked PSP GO.

That\u0027s because of the way it uses physics of linked objects to dictate actual game events, rather than only needing physics on \u0022unitary\u0022 things like a character for platforming, or a grenade when you throw it, or even to simulate the drop due to gravity of bullets and other projectiles. All those things are easily simulated by any modern processor, even those on higher-end smartphones and tablets can handle that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat they can\u0027t handle is exactly what KSP is doing. Lots and lots of parts all interacting with each other via physics joints. That puts a large strain on any system, even mine with an Intel Core i7-9700k CPU water cooled. My landers usually have almost 70 parts on them after I put on all the experiments and cargo containers so I can deploy surface experiments and carry a few repair packs around (the lander itself doesn\u0027t have that many parts, it\u0027s all the parts that make the lander \u0022useful\u0022 that take up the part count).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is that it doesn\u0027t matter what kind of system you run KSP on, once you start getting to around 300 parts you\u0027re going to be running at (at best) 15 FPS no matter what resolution you pick, because of the physics calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know they said that KSP 2 will be better in that regard, but it would help a lot if we could just reduce part count in general in the craft files, for instance instead of having to put four individual sensor parts on the spacecraft, you could have a SINGLE part that combines the functionality of all four sensors in one part. Yes that makes the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E slightly more cluttered, but that\u0027s a sacrifice I\u0027m willing to make if it reduces the part count on my ship. B9 Aerospace has a part that does just that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other way I can see that would easily improve this situation would be to incorporate something similar to the old \u0022part welding\u0022 mod into the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis idea does SO MUCH to MASSIVELY help with the game\u0027s physics burden that I should really be using it in my current KSP 1 save game, but the issue is that I get hung up on the fact that I would have to constantly wait thru the long load process of the game in order to construct vessels the way I like to do it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf that was a process that could be automated in a way to eliminate the constant need to restart the game, I\u0027d be on-board for it, and then they would probably not need to do any additional work on optimizing the physics.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I don\u0027t think they\u0027re doing \u0022exactly\u0022 that, and I don\u0027t know what they ARE doing with regards to optimizing the physics, but I\u0027m hoping that whatever they are doing, the part count \u0022soft limit\u0022 aka where you start losing framerate in KSP 2 is at least double what the limit is for KSP 1.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat would help a lot when you want to carry say 5 different modules to set up a base all on one transfer stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as KSP 1\u0027s physics are currently, I can\u0027t see it working well on Steam Deck, especially since you\u0027ll need a whole different control configuration to deal with the Steam Deck\u0027s controls instead of a mouse and keyboard unless of course they somehow allow you to connect those easily to the Steam Deck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
