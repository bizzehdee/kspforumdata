This would be useful for anyone that is sending up large pieces of a fuel station that would be easier to launch if they were not full of heavy fuel. I was thinking right clicking the big round tank near the launch pad or any of the other tanks would bring up a UI similar to right clicking on any to fuel tanks. Either different tanks could be used for each fuel or the large tank contains all types of fuel that is \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE/\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00BE for each one, and in and out options for each. Fuel could be pumped in endlessly or out endlessly. Maybe I am the only one who would want this, but I think it would be very useful\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T03:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do believe something called tweekables is gonna allow for you to have empty tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut awesome Idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T06:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI probably would think that if you had launch clamps on, you would be able to do that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
