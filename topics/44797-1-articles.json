At the time the lander legs and not the engine were what I set down on. For the past 3 days I have done different type of Mun landings testing out different rockets with a lander and rover all in one. Difference is that my lander is always proped up by my engine and not the landing gear. I use the poodle engine for my lander as I thought that was the smallest height for that width, but could be wrong. I have recently uninstalled all mods as I found my game crashed constantly using them. Even all the favs like Mechjeb and Kethane. Maybe there was something in the mods that made the gear longer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note speaking of mods, when I did use the kethane mod it added a whole new world to the game, alot more purpose of doing things, such as why we now look for water on different celestial bodies because it can be used as fuel. I have poked around and from what I have read Squad wont be adding resources like kethane into the game. Am I right or need to search and read better? If I am right, which i hope im not, I can see this game being a bit limiting as far as a purpose on why to keep going back to places. Hell the USA stoped going back to the moon, but is now interested again as new ways to extract hydrogen (fuel) from the soil have emerged. Im sure people will ask what are these and no i do not remember details but I watch TONS of programs from the science and discovery channels on all things space and do recall that being said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way here are some screen shots of what I am talking about about the landing gear. I only have the most recent where they are too short as I never took (and didn\u0027t know how to take them) on my first ever landings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if Scott Manley reads the forums and happens across this, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR VIDEOS. I would still be trying to get into orbit without your tutorials. Instead I can do most major functions in the game (Docking, landing, rovers, inter-planetary travel), still working on harder things but thank you. You are like a star in the sky that the rest of us black holes suck your info and genious from, lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921272559427690663/7FC6A134F1B15587CD79DBEDB8CF587D11411207/\u0022 alt=\u00227FC6A134F1B15587CD79DBEDB8CF587D11411207\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell Tried adding a few, this was the only one that would actualy post an image from steam.
