As-is, I\u0027m writing down (electronically on another screen) the parts I need and the test conditions. (Yes, I know there\u0027s a pop up window with the same stuff but I find it too small to be useful when I have multiple monitors with a much larger display that works better for these old eyes). If a graphic image of the part to be tested were to pop up, it would be much easier to remember/identify which parts are being referred to as opposed to having to switch back and forth between mission control and the assembly building to identify the part in question. \u0022Ideally\u0022 you could have those mission windows as separate windows I can position on my screen anywhere as well, but that seems like I might be asking too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
