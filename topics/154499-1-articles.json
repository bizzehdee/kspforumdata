It\u0027s labor-intensive but can actually create pretty nice results, if you\u0027re up for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimalMinmus","CreatedById":172387,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T22:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most common strategy to create intelligible kerbish is to simply use some sped-up english.
