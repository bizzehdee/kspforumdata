I have also installed IRSequencer-1.0-RC1 and there is conflict with file \u0022ir\\_ui\\_objects.ksp\u0022  \n\nComes with both, core IR and Sequencer. I have installed file from Sequencer, it is larger file and i assume that is the proper one, but I\u0027m not sure.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-30T15:47:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2016 03:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kcs123**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Dry","CreatedById":163177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T20:04:16Z","Content":"Actually I got a new \u0022no IR buttons\u0022 issue, I got\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/133082-krash-kerbal-ramification-artifical-simulation-hub-simulation-mod-for-ksp-cost-settings-have-been-change/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\ninstalled to test, but actually I am in a normal mission...\n\nThe buttons are black, the windows have normal background and barely show any useful information.\n\nI will remove KRASH in the next session - it also has issues itself with maneuver nodes disappearing.\n\nEdit:\n\nbtw, which probe cores are allowed to be used for the sequencer to work?
