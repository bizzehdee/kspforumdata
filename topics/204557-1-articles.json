want an manned starship version, this will be expensive to develop and test. Why don\u0027t make an version for landing on the moon, dropping all the hard human rated launch, re-entry and land stuff.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo he probably thought, lets NASA pay half of it, it should be inside their budget, we save money and get the\u00A0useful landing heavy stuff on the moon skill.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBezos needs NASA money way less than Musk, he did also gamble high on Amazon, it took a long time for it to make profit, yes it paid off but attitude is way more important than velocity if something goes wrong.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey are going to the moon anyway, simply buy up your partners and bid an 1/10 of spaceX just to mock them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow they have an issue with orbital capable rockets doing their stuff. Don\u0027t bother with second stage recovery until 2.0, its obviously an priority, but an secondary one.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI feel this is an leadership issue, the Amazon gaming division has also not done well and video games in 2020 is an pretty mature business.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes its high risk with an new franchise and an new team but still it should be pretty easy to get talented people if you pay well and have good managers.
