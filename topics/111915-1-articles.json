I think MechJeb is lying to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reach low Moho orbit from LKO requires more than 4 km/s of delta-V, and you\u0027re trying to reach an orbit even deeper in Kerbol\u0027s gravity well. Double-check that MechJeb is also accounting for the circularization burn you\u0027ll need to match orbits (not just altitudes) with Sanrys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T01:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot exactly equal when you want to return right after rescue. Interplanetary transfer dV is not a constant. It depends on the current location, how long you want to travel, etc. Most likely when you do an optimal transfer to somewhere else, it might not be the optimal launch window for going back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisD","CreatedById":144851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T02:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDeMatt - you are correct - the delta-v indicated is just for the transfer to the orbit.
