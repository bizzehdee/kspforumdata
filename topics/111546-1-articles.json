Maximum range on such maneuvers is 1km, if the probe is further away, it is considered \u0022No longer in command range\u0022 and must be terminated/abandoned.

Getting there with a probe is easy and can gain much science in return, but getting there with a Kerbal on board - so a much heavier vehicle - is much more difficult. At some point you would need the science you would get there to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then Kerbals can be lost forever, where a probe is easily replaced by just flying another mission. Putting an advanced probe core on the ship ensures that you get all the maneuver abilities all the time, but if your pilot dies, you need to fly around all planets and land on them to level the new one up again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T13:18:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you send a Kerbal to gather science you can get a lot of EVA reports from orbit, and you get he full value from transmitting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can get to the Mun and return you easily have the delta-v to get to Duna and Eve orbit for a lot of EVA report science.
