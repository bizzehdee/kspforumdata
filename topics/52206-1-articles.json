Piecemeal redistribution of parts would make it impossible for developers to control their work and receive proper credit. It would make troubleshooting impossible. Users would not know where to go to get the latest version of the parts. This small list only scratches the surface of the problems that would arise if parts were redistributed with craft files, and I\u0027m only looking at the practical side of things.
