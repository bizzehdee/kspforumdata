It is an amusing bug though. Generally most libraries don\u0027t really care what type of file you\u0027re loading from disk. They all end up in much the same format on the GPU. To prevent having to load all the images into memory it could have precomputed thumbnails for each model and assemble them into a texture atlas. Chop that up as necessary for lower end GPUs. Then only load full images when required in game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunno if it relevant or not, but the output log shows that ksp unloads stuff after loading it - eg:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnloading 6 Unused Serialized files (Serialized files now loaded: 0 / Dirty serialized files: 0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnloading 467 unused Assets to reduce memory usage.

Good news though, it\u0027s actually smaller than R2.5 while featuring almost double the parts, thanks to awesome feature of 0.20 allowing to share textures and meshes across multiple parts. It\u0027s unbelievably small now for amount of content within, which is good both for poor spaceport servers, for your loading times, and for your in-flight performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo close yet so far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
