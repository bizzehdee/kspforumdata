There\\\u0027s nothing shockingly original or exceptional about it. By the time I\\\u0027m in orbit, for \\\u0027not being very efficient\\\u0027 reasons, I\\\u0027m down to a couple of tanks of fuel feeding one engine, which is enough to boost me out to just under 11,400,000m as per a normal Mun mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether I go into orbit first depends on whether I have arsed anything up dramatically and used up significantly more fuel than a competent pilot would have, and also where my favourite crater is in relation to my approach. So however that pans out, my preferred descent method involves falling to about 50,000 metres and then managing the remaining fuel in my stack to slow down. It\\\u0027s usually good for getting under 50m/s by 48 or 49,000 of those remaining metres, and since my lander has quite a lot of thrusters attached to it it isn\\\u0027t that important anyway. It can slow itself pretty well just using RCS (within reason).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nearest of landers pictured actually had a third tank of RCS under a decoupler, as well, for \\\u0027hovering about\\\u0027 purposes. Meant I didn\\\u0027t have to be super-precise with my descent into the crater - I wanted to park next to the previous mission, and this way I could come down a few km away and just mosey on over at my leisure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\\\u0027s more or less it. I take my transition stage with me as far as possible for braking - after all, I made the effort to get it off the ground, it\\\u0027s just wasteful to not use all the fuel.
