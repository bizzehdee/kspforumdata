How practical do you think it would be for my office to tell a 60 year old tenured faculty member that we\u0027re switching them to RHEL?

Moving \u0027em to 7/8/10 will give \u0027em as much OS shock as RHEL (rather bland, and I\u0027ve always hated the RPM system), Debian (much better from an admin view, although not the friendliest desktop environment), Mint(now we\u0027re talking desktop environment, although not the greatest back end), Ubuntu(it\u0027s like a Mac, only not $7,200), etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally though, people who suffer from that sort of OS shock probably need to be locked down completely, or else they\u0027ve probably already imported nasty MS-compatible malware into your organization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve worked for, around, and with big business for a long time(mostly US companies, we don\u0027t seem to do big business in Canada anymore), and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen anybody have their technical needs defined as \u0027whatever the end user is comfortable with\u0027...and certainly never seen OS X permitted anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xavven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xavven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree about the privacy stuff.
