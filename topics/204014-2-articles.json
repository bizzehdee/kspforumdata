Summer is hotter and winter is colder. Planets with greater\u00A0axial tilts will get more extreme seasons. And for course it depends on if you\u0027re in the northern or southern hemisphere. This would mean you\u0027d have to plan for your craft\u0027s heating and cooling needs. This could also affect weather, whether you get\u00A0rain or snow. Snow or dust storms might cover your solar panels, and you\u0027d need to retract them to clean them or send out a kerbal to brush them off (works like fixing a part. You select the part with a kerbal\u00A0and select \u0022clean part\u0022 from the menu,\u00A0then it plays an animation of the kerbal making a hand brushing motion and\u00A0it\u0027s instantly clean.)\u00A0Snow would melt eventually and rain could clean off dust, restoring your panels. Shaking your craft could also clear the panels (really all the game needs to do is test if the part receives a certain amount of g force, if it does than it counts as being shaken off.) A z-axis shader can be used to create the snow/dust effect on both the craft and on the terrain, an old tried and proven technique.\u00A0(Skyrim uses\u00A0this to simulate snow on meshes.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CastleKSide","CreatedById":152662,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-23T08:41:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about just weather?
