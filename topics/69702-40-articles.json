You can stand on the launch pad, look up at the Mun, and admire its waxing phase instead of seeing a big ball of gray. || E#3: Nevermind, I have absolutely no idea which EVE pack did that, but I still want it! :C\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal edit: Please note the wonderful dark side you can find in KSPRC already.
