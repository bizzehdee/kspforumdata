Well, not really \u0022Suddenly\u0022. Pallas has had something horribly wrong happen to it\u0027s orbit for some reason, and now on December 12th, 2018, Pallas will hit. It\u0027s actual impact location is on the east coast of America, around Virgina to North Carolina. Pallas is huge. It\u0027s 2.11E\u002B20 kilograms, at a diameter of around 580 kilometers. It comprises almost 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt. And it\u0027s just partially deorbited. It\u0027s heading on an impact with Earth at precisely 10:32 EST on December 12th, 2018.
