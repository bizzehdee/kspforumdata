Goal here is efficiency in terms of fuel and re-usability and still maintain high capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome things to know about my crafts are the fallowing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines should always be activated first on the runway by stage ONCE. This makes sure vector trust works. Then shut down engines you dont want to use. Make sure to check action key assignments in the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines usually are staged in pairs of two (only on older crafts with lots of engines) and starts at key 1 and then 2,3,4 etc after that rocket engines and on key 0 there are parachutes IF the craft has an abort system for the pod. So to abort press Delete then 0 when appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll my crafts are designed so even people with keyboard only can fly them easily and they are also designed to use ASAS extensively. I have made sure that CG wont move to much and that drag is fare back as possible to make a stable craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI my self have no joystick sens it didn\u0027t work in linux, might do that with the native linux port now not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo no mechjeb required to fly this things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the videos contains descriptions that can contain more information like action groupings and other tips for flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most of my crafts that has landing legs uses 9 for landing gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFalcon XIV Kosmos\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft came to be as a request by fellow forum members and youtube subscribers for a medium SSTO spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts intended to be efficient but easy and forgiving to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has 528-590 parts depending on version. There is the stock A version with cargo bay and cargo bay doors all stock. So it has the most parts but is basically a Space shuttle equivalent and is multipurpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the B-C versions that are crew only transport or fuel tankers etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts explained by there file names any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft was designed with 4 Turbojets because this lowers the stress on the CPU and one Turbofan engine is good for 17 tons at least. Craft it self is about 70 tons for the heaviest version with payload and the turbojets offers about 11 tons of trust per engine at take off so thats 44 tons of trust for 70 tons of craft and a TWR around 2:3 so less then 1:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts wings has a high rate of lift also due to the fact that the fuselage is made of wings like most of my crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis allows it to climb steadily and almost parallel to the smoke trail at 45 degree angle off attack even at 34m/s at its slowest point after take off. Once past 1500m it will pick up speed as trust increases and fuel burns off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick with this craft an any of my later crafts even the Falcon XIIIC Galaxy is the fact that they are built to have a perfect intake air to engine ratio at 32-33km altitude allowing for full trust in a low drag environment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 32km the air gets thin enough to efficiently go fast with few engines and still have enough air to run at full throttle. Anything less then full trust is just a waste of engines because there dead wight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you run at 50% trust at 32km altitude you have 2x to many engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this craft proves that enough wings will allow you to climb and get up to speed with what seems to be an underpowered craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But the craft is perfectly capable of 2000m/s\u002B speeds at 32-33km altitude fare from underpowered. Its optimized if anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also the trick to go interplanetary even if this craft is LKO only, hulling dead jet engines around and other components only used to get in to LKO is just inefficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo 17 tons per turbofan engine is a good number and about 2.5 units off intake air (12.5 intakes) per engine to achieve this. And this craft was built with that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause its LKO and relatively small it uses conventional rocket engine instead of NERVA\u0027s to save wight and make it easier to balance the craft and it also saves space since one would most likley need two NV-1 engines to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the added wight might as well be added as fuel for a conventional engine because fuel is easier to balance then engines. Rear heavy engine is not good for CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft was also designed with all 4 jet engines at a 5 degree angle towards CoM so etch engine individually will push trough CoM and that in theory removes the risk of going in to a spin. Also the fact that all engines are in the center and rear of the craft helps that to and made this solution possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have my self not gone in to a spin even with many flame outs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that the center bottom engine is the one flaming out usually helps and right clicking it will allow you to see when a flame out happens and throttle down accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft also features stock cargo bay doors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E They are how ever pretty unreliable, smaller seems buggier the bigger (inertia?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need the A version with payload capacity make sure to use F5 before trying to open them. The structural pylons that bend easily randomly picks what end to bend at so the doors wont always bend at the right place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pylons should not bend but be fixed relative to the airframe. Hitting F9 will reset the pylons and randomize them again allowing for a new attempt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other versions of the craft do not have a stock cargo bay doors since there pure fuel and crew transporters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo expect for the slightly buggy cargo bay doors the craft is very stable during ascent and reentry and was built to be easy to fly even for a beginner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Tough you need to be relatively proficient with spaceplanes to achieve the high efficiency that is possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent profile is everything because design of the craft and ascent profile go hand in hand. And theres from what I can find realy only one way to ascend efficiently and that is with lots of wings and what I call the two step method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically real aircrafts step up as they burn fuel to avoid stall. But an SSTO\u0027s limit in KSP is not so much limited to wight from fuel as it is limited by speed (Delta V) on jets to save fuel and amount of intake air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing up to fast wont allow for fast enough horizontal speed to feed the jet engines with air and going to slow vertically burns to much fuel due to drag and time spent climbing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne needs to climb just at the right vertical speed to allow for the most efficient acceleration and to make sure intake air speed is high enough to avoid early engine flame out and allow for 100% throttle and the use of as few ramair intakes as possible to save parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne wants to climb steadily up to 32-33km with a average vertical speed of around 50m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlow climb initially of about 20m/s and no faster then 100m/s at its peak climb rate to avoid excessive vertical speed and also avoid bleeding of momentum due to negative lift when turning sharply when leveling off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce at 32-33km altitude on wants to maintain that altitude and go as fast as the craft can do with out wasting fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means eventually you have to go rockets or you just spend more fuel trying to get those last m/s out of the jets. Around 2000m/s is doable with a well designed craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that one wants to ascend again, this is the second step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne should hit close to a 100m/s vertical speed and at least 40km altitude before going rocket, probably more with a good designed craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Faclon XIV Kosmos can do 44km on jets during the second step of the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the ascent profile I used in the video below that I also suggest you watch, it shows all the steps in the ascent profile and I also recommend reading the youtube description for more information on the craft that I might have left out here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Ascent profiles vary from craft to craft. If the craft lacks power one might have to climb to 18km at 45 degrees instead of 16km and so on and if its overpowered on might have to start the first turn at 14km instead etc to avoid excessive vertical speeds.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E0-16km = 45degrees\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E16-22Km = 35 degrees\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E22-24Km = 30 degrees\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E24-27km = 25 degrees\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E27-30km = 20 degrees\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E30-32km = 15 degrees\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E32km = 10 degrees (level off)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E32-33km. Maintain 32-33km altitude until 2000-2050m/s is achieved by flying at 15 degrees plus minus 5 degrees (here is where your pilot skills mater the most.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOnce at 2000m/s plus pitch up to 20 degrees and maintain and start ascending for the second time. You will need to throttle down a notch or two almost immediately. The bottom engine should be the one flaming out but also remember this craft has all engines pushing individually trough CoM so spin out is unlikely so no need to get nervous. But still it wastes fuel so right click the bottom engine and when it flames out just throttle down and check that the craft is stable and keep ascending.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E37km. You should shut engine par one down by pressing action key 1 now and throttle up the remaining two and make sure one of them dont flame out or produce to little power due to oxygen starvation, if so throttle down a bit. Throttle down as needed to avoid flame outs and asymmetrical trust. Check by right clicking the engines periodically.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E41km. Pitch down to 10 degrees to maximize intake air. You should be going at about 100m/s vertical by now.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E44km.

Level off to 0 degrees and burn until your Apoapsis reaches its desired target (usually between 70-400km) and once at Apoapsis circulate by increasing your Periapsis to the same altitude.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReentry from a 400km orbit you could aim Periapsis just past the islands out side of KSP, shown in the video below at an altitude of around 27km. That will put you close enough to KSC that you could if your lucky glide to KSC and land. Adjust where you want to end up with the angle of attack during reentry.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYou dont need to open air intakes for a powered landing because you have two intakes that are always open.

It took 4 previous prototypes of different designs that all failed until I came up with this about a month later.

Its not perfect but it works. The low mounted wing allowed for easier use of the short stock landing gears and also minimizes stress on the fuselage unlike center mounted wings where the force has to go around the fuselage not trough it minimizing flex and stress. Tough the engine nacelles where mounted fare out because I didn\u0027t know if the wing would be strong enough past the engine nacelle and I feared it might break off past the nacelle. That was not the case. Wing proved strong tough the fare out mounted nacelles had the disadvantage of flexing the wings more.
