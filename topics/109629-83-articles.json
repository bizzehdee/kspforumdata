Fly the shuttle and give me some feedback if you want. If the Col is above the com the aero gets a little wonky. I took a look at the tail config. Oh lord. The tail needs some adjusting. Im gonna have some fun lol.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/dlblj8uw69l7sv9/Parts.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dlblj8uw69l7sv9/Parts.zip?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T03:07:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by XxDARKWOLF67Xx**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T03:32:03Z","Content":"Tail is structured just right to have all the features.

I also re balanced the control surfaces for the brick flight.. Im really happy with it.
