I came up with a procedure for the surface-to-Hermes flight, though it doesn\u0027t match the book exactly. I also finished my D-K-D-K test flight from a few days ago, where I used the same procedure. I contend that even in the book there must have been a coasting phase before the final engine cutoff. Consider- the MAV was doing 12 G\u0027s (120m/s^2) at one point, and had a total of about 6000m/s to burn. This would take 50 seconds at 12 G\u0027s. Even if the average was a third of this you would still have 9 minutes of coasting in the 12 minutes the book says it takes between launch and final engine shutdown. Anyway, my general procedure is:\n\n1) Determine what the longitude of the MAV will be at launch time relative to the flyby periapsis of the Hermes. In my DKDK mission it was 90 degrees, in the mission below it is about 210 degrees. \n\n2) From that determine the latitude that the MAV will be at when it is at the flyby periapsis longitude. In my DKDK mission, if you launch from 16 degrees North you will just be crossing the equator 90 degrees later. (then you would be at -16 degrees 180 degrees after launch, then back at the equator 270 degrees after launch, then back at \u002B16 degrees after one full orbit.) In the mission below the MAV would be at about -10 degrees latitude at the flyby periapsis longitude, so I shifted the flyby South a bit. (Not enough as it turned out, I was eyeballing everything!)\n\n3) Figure out how long before the flyby periapsis you have to launch by noting the orbit period at the flyby altitude, and how far you have to go from launch to intercept. In my DKDK mission, which had a lower flyby, it was only 21 minutes. In the mission below it was about 70 minutes. Launch due East into a circular orbit at that time.\n\n4) If you did everything right the MAV\u0027s circular orbit will intersect the Hermes\u0027 flyby periapsis. Put a node at that point to match the Hermes\u0027 speed and direction. It will be a very big burn. If you get there a bit before the Hermes, end going a bit slower than the Hermes. If you get to the intersect a bit after Hermes, make the burn end with you going faster than Hermes.\n\n5) After the big burn is done, (or modify it before it finishes if you are a Scott Manley-level pilot) set up and execute a small intercept burn that will leave you coasting to an intercept with the Hermes in, say, 40 minutes. You will have a final velocity-matching burn when you intercept the Hermes.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/pwaKb)\n\nThis was quite fun. Your Hermes is stable enough to not wobble during most maneuvers. It would be nice to put RCS on it, though that could be deadly with a ship that big."},{"CreatedByName":"onewatt","CreatedById":151821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T21:03:25Z","Content":"OK, finished the Kermes 2 last night, behold her magnificence in orbit around Kerbin\n\n![screenshot104.png](http://addons-origin.cursecdn.com/files/2262/878/screenshot104.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nTotal XenonGas: 115,500 (kg?)\n\n![Kermes-Resources.png](http://addons-origin.cursecdn.com/files/2262/889/Kermes-Resources.png)\n\nTotal Part Count \u0026 Mass: 661 parts @ 111.58 t\n\n![Kermes-Info.png](http://addons-origin.cursecdn.com/files/2262/890/Kermes-Info.png)\n\nSave file with Kermes and Kermes 2 in Kermes orbit:\n\n[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/kermes/files/2262888/download](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/kermes/files/2262888/download)"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T22:11:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E OK, finished the Kermes 2 last night, behold her magnificence in orbit around Kerbin\n\u003E [http://addons-origin.cursecdn.com/files/2262/878/screenshot104.png](http://addons-origin.cursecdn.com/files/2262/878/screenshot104.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E Total XenonGas: 115,500 (kg?)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://addons-origin.cursecdn.com/files/2262/889/Kermes-Resources.png](http://addons-origin.cursecdn.com/files/2262/889/Kermes-Resources.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Total Part Count \u0026 Mass: 661 parts @ 111.58 t\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://addons-origin.cursecdn.com/files/2262/890/Kermes-Info.png](http://addons-origin.cursecdn.com/files/2262/890/Kermes-Info.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Save file with Kermes and Kermes 2 in Kermes orbit:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/kermes/files/2262888/download](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/kermes/files/2262888/download)\n\nAll these Hermes are looking great, but the part counts are way to high for a working ship that needs to manoeuvre and dock.\n\nIf there is one thing we have learned from making this is that being ferocious with part count is the key, otherwise the Kraken comes and gets your stuff, and for something that we want people to play it must work reliably every time for every system.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-18T05:26:29Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2015 05:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by selfish\\_meme**"},{"CreatedByName":"onewatt","CreatedById":151821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T00:25:29Z","Content":"Oh, I\u0027m building them to match the film design, not to fly, though I was able to get Kermes 2 into a pretty high orbit around Kerbin, after about an hour of full thrust\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAnd FWIW, the K2 is about 100 parts less than the first design, so it\u0027s a significant reduction for the design, though I could loose some more baby fat for sure\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T07:04:16Z","Content":"I redesigned the Hermes to be more Kerbal sized, and to also have a spinning wheel.
