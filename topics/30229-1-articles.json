I\u0027m build my rocket (a weird designed lifter) but i have a little problem: there is a way to attach a structure in the middle of two bodies so both ends are in contact?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me make a better example: lets says I have two fuselages (or tanks) not in contact but some meters apart each other, then I want to attach a solid M-Beam 200 that connect both fuselages.
