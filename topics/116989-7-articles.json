I agree that it is much harder to debug than a problem reproducible with single mod. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I will try to do clean and incremental install tests on this weekend.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m very puzzled.  Did I not respond?  Did I not ask you to do certain things?  What do you want me to do, climb into your computer and see what\u0027s going on?\n\nHow can I possibly provide the support that you seem to think I should provide without more information?  You did provide the log, but you did not provide any list of installed mods.   You are running on Ubuntu, did you provide me with ANY information about your system?  For example, memory, cpu, graphics card, whether you have the free or non-free drivers installed.\n\nLet me ask you a question:  What sort of support do you think you get when you try to contact Microsoft (or Apple), one of the biggest companies, for help?  They give suggestions, they ask you for more information, they tell you to try something and then get back to them.  All of which is done on forums like this.  If you\u0027re lucky, you might even get a support person in chat.\n\nWe (modders) do this on our own time, at our own cost.  We do what we can, when we can. \n\nI spent more than an hour on this, both on Windows, Linux and OSX, and was unable to reproduce it.  \n\nIt\u0027s a free mod.  All those other mods you installed are also free.  How do you know that the problem isn\u0027t with one of them?  You contact me quickly, but did you contact any of the other mod authors?\n\nIf you get the impression that I\u0027m angry, you are correct.  A few days ago, someone demanded support (using the words \u0022I demand support\u0022).  Attitudes like these are what turn mod authors off, and why there are so many old, unsupported, incompatible mods.\n\nI will continue to provide what support I can.  Please do those tests, and provide me with whatever information you can.\n\nI am going to be offline all weekend, so if you can\u0027t get me the information by this afternoon, I won\u0027t be able to respond until Monday."},{"CreatedByName":"Honeybadga","CreatedById":64977,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T11:18:04Z","Content":"Please don\u0027t get turned off by individual statements.
