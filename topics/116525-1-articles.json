Highlight only these two vessels and have different icons.\n\nFocus on Kerbin when doing large orbital changes.\n\nFocus in front of the vessel for every thing else.\n\nUse the rings to make incremental burns. Observe the rings closing together.\n\nOnce in front of the target and on the outside it is just a matter of time. \n\n The target will slowly approach and further refinements to normal (happy and angry triangles) can be made. When within 25 km double click LMB on the target vessel and it will be tracked on the NAV ball. Start reducing relative motion by burning retrograde from the target.\n\nUsing burns radial on the final approach. \n\nReduce engine thrust by right clicking engine. The engine gimbal could also be reduced.\n\nUse of time warp can help to identify relative motion.\n\nIf the vessel is within range then its apoapsis/periapsis markers will appear.\n\nOnce the target is close the docking port can be selected and marked as target. Having the vessel marked as target will now be visible on the NAV ball.\n\nFor reasons the docking port cannot be selected and then switch vessels. The tag is lost when switching vessels unlike what happens with advanced tier technology. The vessel\u0027s port will need to be in view and with close to zero relative velocity. Zoom to the port and zoom out and place cursor in front and wait. Part FX highlight allows easier selection. \n\nThe final encounter is similar to advanced docking protocols. Orient the vessels in at least one direction before going further.\n\n[Video Dock Hard](https://vimeo.com/134730605)\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\u0022https://player.vimeo.com/video/134730605\u0022 width=\u00221280\u0022 height=\u0022720\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 title=\u0022Dock Hard\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThis is not the ideal method but does demonstrate the procedure.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T06:23:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 06:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T16:51:28Z","Content":"This list will be updated from my Mission Report experiment log to Duna without any facility upgrades.

The CoT should run right through the parachutes.\n\n This makes an inherently stable and easy-to-fly STOL paraglider aircraft. You don\u0027t need a pilot to fly it.\n\n Steering is controlled with yaw. Altitude is controlled with throttle. Speed is controlled with pitch. \n\n These will fly easily at walking speed and set down gently on a dime. \n\n After recovering science, recover the aircraft and relaunch.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T00:06:54Z","Content":"All info on getting by without upgrading the facility is good info.\n\nEven though I cheat and push my science experiments into the doors of the VAB/SPH this could someday change and indeed rooftops will need to become accessible.\n\nAlso every body should list any issues they have encountered.\n\n\u003E If I did assemble an overweight ship off the pad to skirt the weight limit, I don\u0027t know how I would be able to get the pointy end up.

Where did I put my fulcrum?\n\n@ Slashy Thanks for contributing. You even helped by proxy in fixing the name of this thread. In a challenge I called it tier zero tech which you added correctly with the word facility. At first I was going with your name of \u0022caveman\u0022 but chose tier zero because this tutorial is for everyone who wants to build rockets solely in barns.\n\nThat rooftop jumper is being scrutinized by Bill:huh: . The crane can lift but he says if the payload can reach the roof of the VAB so will the top of his rockets boosters where the payload components could be assembled and attached radially. He would enjoy to complete a vessel assembly using his mobile rocket support braces and the VAB rooftop and something Bill:wink: is naming Skyisthelimitcrane. \n\nBob:confused:![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif) of course is nervous of Bill:sticktongue: bringing down the whole building.
