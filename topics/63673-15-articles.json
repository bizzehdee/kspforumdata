It was my goal after all to create a tool that would be useful for the realism community as well. Lo and behold, codepoet creates an API to do just that and I thought wow... this will save me LOADS of effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecodepoet and I collaborated on what I would need to integrate his API into ship manifest, and a marriage was born. We had a couple of rough spots with the community after the hard dependency was created, but we learned and evolved, and now CLS is a fine API that has found its place in the realism community. It is a recommended mod for RSS and SETI, along with others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am grateful to codepoet both for his efforts for the community and for his friendship. I value both greatly. It is my hope that I continue \u0022in his footsteps\u0022 and make him proud of the work I do on his behalf.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECodeoet, CLS is and shall always remain YOUR mod. I\u0027m only a caretaker, dutifully tending the garden that is CLS.
