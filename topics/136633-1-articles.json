You don\u0027t want to be on very high warp (six or more arrows) when you do that. Since it\u0027ll take a day or two to reach the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, be very careful with warping while you\u0027re controlling the second wave. The reason is the accuracy of the resulting orbit as you change the SOI. You don\u0027t want to do this while in control of the ship in real time (a game engine limitation) and you don\u0027t want to do it at very high warp (because the game tests for an SOI change at larger and larger intervals).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-12T00:21:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2016 12:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
