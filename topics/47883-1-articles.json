I\u0027ve gotten two into orbit so far, but i am having difficulty with bigger planes. For initial launch, i use all sets of engines i have(atmosphere, orbital, maneuver) to get it to a good speed. When i hit down the plane lifts up, or at least the front end. The back end scrapes the ground, destroying half of the engines. How do i get the back to lift also, since this didn\u0027t happen with smaller planes? :~) Should i put the wheels further back, more wings in back, or just more power? Thanks in advance for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T01:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut the landing gear so the nose is slightly up.
