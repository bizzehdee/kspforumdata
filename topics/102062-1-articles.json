The habitated one has a radio relay which sends a command to the storage space station as soon as the supplies run out. Now, a transport ship will be filled with supplies and sent to the space station, as well as returning back to the storage space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would work like that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadio relay on habitated space station (station 1) is connected to a sensor which continuosly checks the supplies. A logic gate would compare the amount of the supplies and as soon as it is lower than it should be, it sends a command to the storage space station (station 2) which tells station 2 to dispatch a transport ship. The transport ship gets filled and travels to station 1, refueling the supplies and then it travels back to station 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you could create much more than that. You could create almost everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T09:50:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 09:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by codefox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T10:10:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can actually create a system that lets the player build hardware out of basic logic gates and then have that hardware execute code as the user watches it happen, with its speed and efficiency being dependant on how exactly the player built it... well, that would probably be not very much in the general theme of KSP...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but it has the potential to be of exceptional educational value.
