Why would you want it?\n\u003E Just adding a bunch of numbers to each other doesn\u0027t seem like a huge improvement to me.\n\nWell.. my idea was about being able to create things which work fully automatically.\n\nI\u0027d like to go with this example:\n\nYou have two space stations, one for storage and one another one is habitated. The habitated one has a radio relay which sends a command to the storage space station as soon as the supplies run out. Now, a transport ship will be filled with supplies and sent to the space station, as well as returning back to the storage space station.\n\nIt would work like that:\n\nRadio relay on habitated space station (station 1) is connected to a sensor which continuosly checks the supplies. A logic gate would compare the amount of the supplies and as soon as it is lower than it should be, it sends a command to the storage space station (station 2) which tells station 2 to dispatch a transport ship. The transport ship gets filled and travels to station 1, refueling the supplies and then it travels back to station 2.\n\nOf course you could create much more than that. You could create almost everything.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T09:50:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 09:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by codefox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T10:10:19Z","Content":"If you can actually create a system that lets the player build hardware out of basic logic gates and then have that hardware execute code as the user watches it happen, with its speed and efficiency being dependant on how exactly the player built it... well, that would probably be not very much in the general theme of KSP...\n\n...but it has the potential to be of exceptional educational value.

You could just create your own small applications which execute stuff, much like kOS but with more possibilities.\n\nOf course you can also go the hard way and set up everything with logic gates, although most of the people would probably only use them for basic stuff.\n\nHowever, I have to agree on the part regarding the amount of work needed to create such a mod. I want to start on my own and as soon as it has reached a somewhat working stage, I\u0027d try to get a few more people to work with me."},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T12:47:07Z","Content":"Thread closed on request ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
