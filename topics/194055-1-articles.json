This game is extremely frustrating. I bought it a couple days ago and there\u0027s so many bugs. Contracts don\u0027t work sometimes, kerbals go missing randomly, and too many other issues. Anyways, my pilot clauburry kerman is missing in action. I tried fast forwarding to try to make him respawning and that didnt work. I have no idea how to find this kerbal. This game is extremely annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"archiebald","CreatedById":195579,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-22T06:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s true - KSP does have bugs, but not all of what appears to be bugs actually are.\u00A0 This is\u00A0 game with a steep learning curve and requires some thinking.\u00A0 Frustrating? - yes sometimes, but also very rewarding in a nerdy way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain reason for Kerbals to go missing is because you let their ship crash or burn up while you were off attending to something else.\u00A0 The mod Kerbal Alarm Clock is essential, especially as a career game progresses with 40 or 50 simultaneous flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure about the console version but on the PC, the re-spawning of Kerbals is controlled in the settings.\u00A0 You can set it on, off and set a delay for them to re-spawn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for contracts, sometimes the way they are written is not very intuitive, and some people do say there are odd ones that randomly appear but personally I\u0027ve never had one that I couldn\u0027t yet complete.\u00A0 Post an example if you want help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-22T06:33:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2020 06:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by archiebald\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bestPlayer_xu","CreatedById":204372,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-22T07:44:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nonly on the easy version or if you change it with \u0022kerbals respawn timer\u0022 - only then kerbals will respawn\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
