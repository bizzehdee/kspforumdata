With this in mind I am sure we can measure a close approximation of the Yellowstone Caldera, as to calculate an area of appropriate size to release pressure. With this information calculate a sizable underground hole to create. In this hole create a lining of some type to keep the lava there. Also a tunnel system would lead to the ocean with the same lining. This would have the intention of giving the lava a place to release a great deal of pressure and the flow to a point to reach the tunnel to slowly cool into the ocean. Also if deemed a worthwhile prevention in the event of failure and catastrophic explosion, maybe a tremdous dome of reinforced metal could be put over the area and greatly weighted down with huge metal structures that would be anchored in the ground quite a ways with concrete.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EMaybe something in this plan will have value to help construct a resolution.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThanks for reading\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T03:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should contact Elon Musk.

However, because of how complicated this is, you would have do do a Monte Carlo style study, where you simulate it, change the input parameters, simulate again. This way you build up a picture of what the eruption would most likely look like. Unfortunately, because this is an incredibly complex physical event, this will take a supercomputer to calculate, and even with a supercomputer you looking at potentially years to complete the calculations and billions in costs. Of course, this can be done by a government if it funded a research program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe your suggestion about tunnels is interesting, but at this point in time it is unfeasable. It would represent the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken by human by maybe 100 times, including the longest, deepest tunnel ever built. Again this would cost billions, maybe even trillions due to the sheer size of this project and take decades to finish.\u00A0Not impossible, but very unlikely. However, there is currently no scientific understanding on how (or even if) an event like this can be stopped. For all we know, drilling tunnels right up to the magma chamber might trigger the eruption earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe dome will never work I\u0027m afraid.

A real time real life simuation is fantasy, as we are not even sure how the chamber under yellowstone is actually fed (see below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 3 dimensional idea of how the magma chamber under the caldera looks like actually exist from seismics. There is a controversy if the chamber is fed by a deep (core/mantle border) mantle plume or just a shallow one. I am not specially informed about Yellowstone but some hotspot-feeding plumes actually do go that deep (according to models, which may change as new details come in). You\u0027d have to release a good portion of that plume which might last 20 million years and could cover north America with a trapp basalt :-).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso you\u0027d only doctor on the symptoms, the overall driving force (plate tectonics and mantle circulation) can\u0027t be stopped. Well, when the sun comes here one far day it will :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ocean is too far away for a tunnel, that is not feasible. Digging a tunnel system at the side of the plume sounds a silly idea to me, but again, the specific conditions in that area are not known to me. Differentiation of magma in a chamber leads to changes in chemical composition and viscosity. Changing chemical properties of the lava and collapses will probably plumb the tunnels before much pressure is released. And when the pressure is released, what do you do with the hole from the resulting collapse ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPublication by the AGU, Nature Geoscience, etc. could shed some light on the conditions around and under Yellowstone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, no measures we can take now and during the course of a human life would actually solve your problem of releasing the lava from the chamber under Yellowstone. It\u0027ll probably just slowly fill up again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow pressing is the problem at all ? Is an eruption imminent or to be expected in foreseeable future ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: i missed the dome thing. Here i really think that the forces involved are underestimated. An explosion that blows out km\u00B3s of molten rock will handwavy do away with an artificial structure that doesn\u0027t collapse under its own weight. Or else the crust is just lifted until the cracks are big enough to release the stuff at the sides. A dome is not a good idea.

With this information calculate a sizable underground hole to create. In this hole create a lining of some type to keep the lava there. Also a tunnel system would lead to the ocean with the same lining. This would have the intention of giving the lava a place to release a great deal of pressure and the flow to a point to reach the tunnel to slowly cool into the ocean.
