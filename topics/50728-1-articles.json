This way you can decouple the command pod from the rest of the rocket. If you do so your parachute only has to carry the small pod and not your whole rocket, so it will slow down the command pod with your crew member enough to allow the pod to land safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Use additional decouplers to put a short rocket on a long one to make your rocket a real multistage rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T22:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how you use a decoupler:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, build your rocket like you are used to. Pod, fueltank, engine. Under the engine, put a decoupler. Under the decoupler, put another fueltank and engine. (don\u0027t forget the parachute ontop)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, launch the rocket. The lowest engine will fire, and carry the rocket up. Once the first fuel tank is empty, you fire the decoupler. This will ditch everything below the decoupler, freeing up the 2nd engine. Now fire the 2nd engine. You now have a full fueltank, while the rocket is already up in the air and has speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what multiple stages is. It\u0027s more effecient than just putting 2 fuel tanks with 1 engine, because it means that your rocket doesn\u0027t have to carry the empty fuel tank. Less weight, more distance you get\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn science: Don\u0027t forget you can right click the commandpod and do a crew report. This is worth science. You can also go on an EVA (mouse over the picture of the kerbal while controlling the rocket, and click on EVA). If you do this, the kerbal will apear on the outside of the command pod. You can right click on him and this gives allows you an EVA report. This is also worth science. If he\u0027s on the ground, he can take a surface sample. Also worth science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember though: If you EVA your kerbal while in the atmosphere, he will get blown off the ladder and plummet to his death.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-26T22:52:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2013 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sirrobert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T22:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDecoupler is used to separate one part of your ship from another.
