We see silly and reckless kerbal pilots flying in trashy rockets that were presumably built by intelligent kerbal engineers/scientists (because rocket science isn\u0027t actually easy if you haven\u0027t guessed already). Why can\u0027t we have this simplicity and intelligence Portal had?

If you look at every trailer they made they\u00A0tried to emphasise on the fact that\u00A0\u0027conquering space was never this easy\u0027, while we all know that orbital mechanics and the game in fact has a steep learning curve.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo they make fun trailers\u00A0containing easy \u0027distinguishable and exagerated parts\u0027. Parts that, without even knowing anything about orbital mechanics, give away there exact function, The KISS (keep it simple, \u003Cs\u003Estupid\u003C/s\u003E and straightforward) design of the parts actually eleviate the steep learning curve because they virtually scream engaging simplicity. They give a feeling that if the rocket looks simple and get in to space, \u0027I can build that and\u00A0get it in space!\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sleek looking rocket, making the game look \u0027more serious\u0027 could actually hurt sales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really don\u0027t relate strong in how the parts look, either way would be fine by me, but I can imagine why Squad would market the game in another way than HarvesteR had in mind.\u00A0I must however say that KSP\u00A0has gone a very very long way in development since the Alpha stage, and I am not dissapointed\u00A0that\u00A0they\u00A0chose other priorities in expanding the game over an part update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat the rocketparts did get vamped and the rocketparts didn\u0027t\u00A0could be\u00A0marketing to, lure potential gamers with easy looking parts, and when they get the hang of building rockets, they can step up and build\u00A0more professional and shiny spaceplanes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0One question I really can\u0027t answer is, why did HarvesteR think that seeing Kerbalkind as silly\u00A0would hurt the game?\u00A0The\u00A0only thing I can really imagine is that some people who are interested in building \u0027beautifull rockets\u0027 are being held back in stock.
