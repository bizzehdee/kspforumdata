I pull the UV\u0027s and original textures for the parts (using the UV overlays as a reference) and load them with Gimp, then create my altered textures..save them as PNG.. Put the new textures in the parts folder with the Vanilla textures and try and add arguments to the part CFG to get it to default to the custom PNG texture that i create. I can\u0027t get it to load them though...they just end up untextured in game. Could you pretend i am a really SLOW and give me proper format for the argument in the CFG for this. I have tried a a couple of ways, like adding after the mesh = line ..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etexture = partPathinGamedata\\newTexture // using appropriate part path and texture of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand Ive tried deleting mesh = line..and replaced with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODEL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{ \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E model = partPathinGamedata\\vanillaModel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E texture = vanillaTexture, partPathinGamedata\\newTexture\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this look right? i cant figure out what I\u0027m doing wrong ...or if this kind of implementation just doesn\u0027t work?? any Help?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
