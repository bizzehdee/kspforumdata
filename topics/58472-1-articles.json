(Even if Oxygen isn\u0027t present you could treat it like a cased in thing where oxygen is supplied directly to the plant.) Just a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two other planets I\u0027d love to see added in are in real life Eris and Ceres, these are two objects in space that are too small to be considered planets. Eris would provide bored ksp players who cannot mod (Due to the lack of intelligence on the matter or updates rendering most mods incompatible) a brand new challenge as it\u0027s orbit is very unusual and far out. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Eris_Orbit.svg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Eris_Orbit.svg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECeres is a planet that isn\u0027t too unusual but is odd, being small in size and without a stable orbit it still has a potential for liquid water oceans.
