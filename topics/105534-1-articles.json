It was developed by [U.S. Army Natick Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army_Natick_Laboratories), consisting of \u0022coconut fat, milk solids, and sugar. The ice cream was homogenized, frozen, then freeze-dried, ground and compressed into cubes under high pressure. The cubes were then coated with an edible gelatin coating to prevent crumbs\u0022.[^\\[3\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream#cite_note-nasafood-3) This was the ice cream flown on [Apollo 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_7), which can differ from modern space ice cream.[^\\[3\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream#cite_note-nasafood-3) It was found to be impractical for space flight because of the tendency to crumble and create crumbs which can be dangerous to humans and equipment in a microgravity environment.[^\\[4\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream#cite_note-4)[^\\[5\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream#cite_note-5) Despite the modern images of space walking astronauts in shuttle era space suits, freeze dried ice cream was not included on any subsequent Apollo, Skylab, shuttle, or International Space Station missions.[^\\[6\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream#cite_note-6) According to one NASA [food scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_scientist), although freeze-dried ice cream was developed on request, \u0022it wasn\u0027t that popular.\u0022[^\\[7\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream#cite_note-7)\n\nOn the other hand, ordinary ice cream was somewhat regularly available for Shuttle and ISS astronauts:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E By 1972, astronauts also ate classic ice cream on the [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab) space station and regular ice cream has also been eaten on the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station).[^\\[8\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream#cite_note-8) [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab) had a refrigerator that was used for regular ice cream,[^\\[9\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream#cite_note-9) and occasionally [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle) and [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) astronauts have taken regular ice cream into space.[^\\[10\\]^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream#cite_note-10)\n\nFood for thought indeed ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Flymetothemun","CreatedById":17689,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T06:13:10Z","Content":"Astronaut food or not, it\u0027s still tasty. One of the weirdest textures, yet one of the most unique tastes. Kinda interesting to see that real icecream is available though. \n\nAnyway, decided to look up the Amazon reviews page for the stuff and found this gem, titled \u0022BUYER BEWARE\u0022:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It says \u0027Neapolitan\u0027. but don\u0027t let those nerds down in Cape Canaveral fool you! This stuff is totally Space Flavored! It says \u0022natural and artificial ingredients\u0022, but I know that just means powdered space shuttle fuel and jellied instant mashed potatoes. This stuff ISS great! (See what I did there? No? Okay, well it was pretty lame anyway)\n\u003E UPDATE\n\u003E \n\u003E Upon further sartorial and mathematical research, I found this to be made with bits of real astronaut, not that imitation bullcrap from North Korea that\u0027s been flooding the market lately.\n\u003E \n\u003E I ate one of these the other day and suddenly and involuntarily began saying all my sentences starting with, \u0022Houston...\u0022 It was great fun.\n\u003E \n\u003E I also peed into a bag!
