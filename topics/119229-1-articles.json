The aerospike is a great rocket engine for spaceplanes, it\u0027s short, quite efficient and has a better TWR than the LV-909 Terrier. The Nerv is still the go-to engine for interplanetary work, its high Isp makes it better than just about everything else \u003Cem\u003Eprovided you use the LF-only tanks, not LFO tanks with oxidizer tweaked out.\u003C/em\u003E Though I would certainly agree that we are missing some sizes of LF tanks, and a tweakable for fuel type would be the ideal solution for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not 100% sure what you mean by \u0022The smaller fuel tanks are ridiculously overloaded in comparison to the bigger ones.\u0022 Can you clarify?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T17:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will soon post a suggestion thread about balancing airplane engines. And nukes. Currently I am working on a test-mod of it. The fuel ratio is unrealistic, and bad, but if it was changed right away, the whole spaceplane-system would have to be re-balanced. 1m parts were never over-fueled. In fact, an 1m part has exactly the quarter fuel of a 2m tank, with the same height. Dry aircraft tanks are lighter than dry rocket tanks with a reason. In past, with the old mk.3 parts, this ratio was even worse. Not only for the fuel tank should get a tweakable, but all parts. But hey, I tried to build a nuke-powered interplanetary craft, and I used the 1 m LF fuselage. The craft became awesome (in sight, not in performance)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T18:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NWM\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NWM\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Aerospike is useless - heavy, weak, has no gimbal, \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically, aerospikes have a worse TWR than ordinary engines, and while superior in the ISP departement, they are no miracle machines. In the most recent upgrade, it\u0027s weight has been brought down from 1.5t to 1t, so now it\u0027s TWR is already rather good. By the way, that curve doesn\u0027t stop at 1 atm: As pressure increases, every other engine fares far worse. On sea level Eve, the Aerospike can compete with Mammoths, pound-by-pound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I still wish there wasn\u0027t such a huge performance gap between 1.25m and 2.5m engines; but if you compare the Aerospike to LVT30/45, it\u0027s a very good engine. It even holds up reasonably well compared to Poodle or Skipper.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NWM","CreatedById":67386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T11:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aerospike should outclass the others with conventional nozzle at high pressure - thats what they are developed for.
