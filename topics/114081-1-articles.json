It seems my problem parts are service bays, batteries, and probe cores. In stock (unmodded 32-bit) I have a problem with un-manned space planes if they include a service bay. If the bay is closed a battery or probe core will heat up and explode, regardless of where it is on the vessel. I have tried putting them on the far side of high mass objects like fuel tanks that are littered with radiators and this doesn\u0027t seem to change anything. If I open the cargo bay during most of the re-entry I can make it home alright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also happened in my modded-career, I came out of a large timewarp into a new SOI, did some maneuvers and jettisoned a stage and everything was fine. I created a new manuever node and in about the 30 seconds it took me to do so a huge section of my ship had parts with red meters. I turned on the thermal overlay and the battery was blinking like a strobe until it blew up and then the newly created 2-part vessel cooled down to normal on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe effect is less dramatic with the \u0022ignore max temp\u0022 flag but here is a clip showing the link between the service bay and the battery temperature (the battery changes between a temperature of 4 and 2400 again and again while the bay is closed).
