With my initial test re entry probe i followed someone\u0027s advice and set my periapsis to 60km, it worked like a charm and the heat shield only heated up to about a 1k degrees before cooling down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I launched Bob into orbit with a 1 man pod I tried the same thing; setting the periapsis at 60km, but unfortunately he didn\u0027t make it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E. For some reason the shield heated up more than it did in my first test. So after launching a few other test probes I have learned thus far that the re-entry angle depends greatly on what your apoapsis (and possibly your mass too but not quite sure) is. Is there anyway to calculate the angle? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general \u0022set PE to 60km\u0022 rule doesn\u0027t seem to work.
