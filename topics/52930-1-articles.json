Though to do what you speak of, I\u0027m pretty sure that setting the animation to actually look this way would be much, much easier. It would be harder than creating the current parachute animations, but it would probably have an end result better looking and without more lines of code.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, mine was more simple in this sense, but the animation itself was more complex as I was doing the animation entirely in 3dsmax and don\u0027t intend to use the \u0022wiggling\u0022 or scale up that the game itself does, the only thing I\u0027d need is the orientation and speed of animation according to the speed of the craft.
