The secondary issue with this kind of landing for reusable aircraft is that the forces involved on \u0022landing\u0022 usually warp the airframe considerably, and a lot of time is spent on inspection and refurbishment on damaged and warped parts. The cost of fuel for a controlled safe return is actually reduces costs, and decreases the intervals between luanch-dates for a reusable craft significantly. So, it actually (profitability wise) what you definitely want to shoot for.
