I was running the game with the quarter res textures option because it was the only way I could play it for more than an hour before running out of memory because of all the stuff I have installed. However quarter res seams to cause issues with a number of mods, RPM displays didn\u0027t work, some mods gui buttons would just show black squares, and things just generally looked bad lol.\n\nI decided to to some further part pruning so I could run at half res for more than an hour before crashing. I had already removed a large amount of the stock fuel tanks as I never used them because I just used the KW ones, so I decided to remove a lot of the stock engines as well since again, I much preferred using the KW ones instead.\n\nAt the same time I removed most of the stock rocket engines I also updated MKS and Multipurpose Colony Modules, although I highly doubt this had anything to do with the issues I began having. After removing those engines I was able to run stably at half res for extended periods. However when I loaded up my main career there was weirdness, all of my buildings showed that they were now max level, the reputation bar up at the top when at the space center was gone, and I no longer had any active contracts.\n\nMy fist thought was damn I must have had an active contract that needed one of those engines. Looking at the persistance file all the building tech levels showed the level they should have been but no amount of reloading or anything changed what I saw in game, so I decided to cut my losses and just start a new career since I wasn\u0027t all that far. I deleted the save folder and started up a new save.\n\nAfter starting the new game I have made it to orbit and unlocked 4-5 technodes, this is usually when you start seeing contracts for testing various parts in various conditions, but I am not getting any of those. I get the same five contracts offered no matter how many times I decline them, two for performing visual surveys, two position a satellite contracts, and one rescue some kerbal, and every now and then it gives me a launch a new vessel contract(never seen that more than once before this).\n\nAt this point I am afraid that something got messed up in the install itself and I am going to have to reinstall it and all my mods, definitely undesirable since I have so many and I have done a lot of part pruning and custom tweaks to get things working together and balanced together, not not all of those I did using MM :/\n\nAny tips as far as things I can try aside from doing a total reinstall?\n\n Also I was just thinking it should be ok for me to copy mod folders over from the old install into a fresh KSP install as long as I delete any settings configs generated by them and don\u0027t copy over any mods that involve contracts (Contract Configurator, Contract Window) right? Because that would make the reinstall process a lot easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T20:52:45Z","Content":"I have begun the process of rebuilding my game but still any suggestions in regards to fixing an issue like this would still be appreciated.\n\nMy assumption is that the removal of the stock engines is what caused the problems, however I am unsure of how exactly this corrupted something in the base game. Logically thinking I can see how removal of a part that is needed in an active contract could corrupt the save file, but I don\u0027t see how this would compromise something in the base game to the point of breaking the contract generator."},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T23:15:47Z","Content":"Update: new install has the same issue, no part test contracts.\n\nSuspect a mod is causing this, no idea which or how.\n\nusing the Alt-F12 menu to add contracts I get the following message in the Alt-F2 log window\n\n[Error]: Contract of type \u0027PartTest\u0027 was not be generated\n\nThe same kind of message pops up when trying to add any other contract with two exceptions:\n\nRescue kerbal contracts, it will allow me to generate two of them and then begins giving the same message\n\nFirst Flight contracts, I can add a seemingly infinite number of the launch a new vessel type contract\n\nThe output\\_log has no more detailed information regarding the error.\n\nI am trying to see if I somehow ended up with a MM patch that changes any thing in the stock contracts config. So far haven\u0027t found anything, nothing apparent in the MM cache file and so far everytime I have tried to have MM do a file dump from in game it crashes out of memory before it finishes."}]}
