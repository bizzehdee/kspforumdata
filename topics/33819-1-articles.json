I found those campaign missions hiding in the wiki a while back and it jumpstarted my KSP experience. I have many screenshots taken while accomplishing these missions. I very much enjoyed the semi-tutorial aspect of the missions, as well as for having flavorful descriptions and simple, but fun, engineering requirements. It also gets bonus points for being both stock and mod friendly, by not requiring any mods but easily benefiting from them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA great example of a mission I enjoyed was the mapping satellite (GeoSat from the Age of Satellites). Requiring a mapping satellite to have a rover body integrated in the design was an incredibly simple requirement that created the need to engineer around a non-standard shape, and made me feel like I was adding the part for a purpose, rather than just asthetics or a place to put stuff. Making the mission objective to put it into a specific polar orbit demonstrates how to gain total planetary coverage with 1 satellite. My use the ISA Mapsat mod successfully for the first time made that mission stand out even more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember getting impatient a few times, but I\u0027m glad I stuck it out and did every mission that was available (and took cues from the unfinished campaigns on where to go next).
