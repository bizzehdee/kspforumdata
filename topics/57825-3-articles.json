The shuttle is venerated for all it did for not only america BUT what it did for HUMANITY. It was retired not because we got bored of it, but because it was tremendously expensive to hurl into orbit. MORE expensive than the Soyuz, which is why Russia STILL uses it. Not because it is better, it is NOT, its CHEAPER. The shuttle launched some of the most revered satellites into orbit like oh, I dont know, HUBBLE for example. We had to shut down the shuttle program because of the expense at sending what amounted to a giant nuclear strength explosive into orbit with upwards of 7 LIVES on the line each time, a gamble that has cost lives.

It has done a commendable job achieving this design requirement over the last 30 years. It has suffered failures, some serious and even fatal, but overall it\u0027s still got a good record and until SpaceX\u0027s Dragon is man-rated, it\u0027s undoubtedly the best crew ferry around. Maybe even then, depending on how well Dragon works out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space shuttle however had a much more complex series of design requirements, which obviously required a much more complex, and expensive, craft. The shuttle, beyond simply carrying 7-10 astronauts, had to be capable of carrying 25 metric tons of cargo into orbit. Unlike Soyuz, which you insist on comparing it to for some reason, the Space Shuttle isn\u0027t simply a crew ferry. Someone in this thread described it as a \u0022small space station\u0022, and that\u0027s an apt description, since it could linger in orbit for up to two weeks, or longer with the EDO pallet (almost 18 days on STS-80), during which time the mission specialists could perform and monitor science experiments, which was a major objective of early shuttle flights. Beyond all of that it still had to safely return up to 15 metric tons of it\u0027s cargo to a precision landing on an aircraft runway with an up to 1000 nautical mile cross range trip, all without exceeding 3g\u0027s during any phase of the mission, so as to not damage the science experiments. The fact that they were able to achieve all of those goals with a single reusable craft at all is impressive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue, the Shuttle, much like Soyuz, also suffered two catastrophic failures. However, the loss of Challenger was more a result of poor management by NASA than any particular flaw with the shuttle system, since the SRBs were never rated for the extreme cold they experienced at the launchpad on launch day. Indeed, engineers at the company that manufactured the SRB\u0027s urged NASA not to launch as a result of this uncertainty. NASA management overruled those concerns and launched anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow true, the shuttle is vastly more expensive on a per launch basis than Soyuz, but that\u0027s like complaining that a semi-truck is more expensive than a small economy sedan. It could be argued that the shuttle program \u003Cstrong\u003Ewas\u003C/strong\u003E a waste of money, and that we didn\u0027t need a craft capable of achieving everything the Shuttle could, but to claim that it\u0027s price somehow makes it \u0022inferior\u0022 to a dedicated crew ferry is ridiculous. Whatever you may think of the Shuttle program\u0027s price, you can not deny that it\u0027s a truly incredible engineering achievement with a remarkably good safety record considering it\u0027s overwhelmingly complex design requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-27T16:53:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2013 04:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Firov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T16:43:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Firov\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Firov\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENationalism at it\u0027s worst...\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm neither Russian or American.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have no beef or love for either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Im just calling it as I see it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vetrox","CreatedById":69796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T17:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the shuttle as a feat of engineering.
