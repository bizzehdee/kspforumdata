Cost is 250,000. Reaches a 200km circular orbit of Kerbin with 7783 fuel and 9512 oxidizer. In this ship it translates to 6461 delta V. Its just a gas can so that number is of less importance. I am looking for a cheaper way to get 4 full orange cans into orbit. This ship is equal to 4 orange cans but the 6 half orange cans are almost half empty. I used the smaller cans to make it simpler to attach the boosters. She does have a rotation problem but Bob managed to keep her in control. It evens out once you ditch the boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/686iqb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022686iqb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/w22hl5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w22hl5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/14xo36w.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002214xo36w.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
