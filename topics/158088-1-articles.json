I\u0027ve lofted 6 pebble bed reactors into space (each on it\u0027s own satellite), megajoules says they\u0027re making ~2MW. But none of them seem to be able to connect to eachother. I have the diode array on each sat, so they should be able to transmit, and on each sat I have 2 receivers (which I made sure were on) whose description says they should be able to receive any wavelength.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransmitter: Diode Laser Array (Beam Producer) set for long infrared\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReceivers: Circular Thermophotovoltaic Receivers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
