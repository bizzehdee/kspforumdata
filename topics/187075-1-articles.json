The things that can help you are that autostruts now traverse locked robotic parts (I.e. an autostrut will end at a robotic part if the part is not locked, but will go to the other side of said part if it is locked.) and that hinges etc. are more stable when they are pushed against their stops. Unfortunately locking a hinge while it tries to keep a certain position against an outside force is pretty hard, unless that force pushes it into its stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a Eve planes that can fold their wings to be protected by a heat-shield, but can unfold their wings once the high-speed re-entry is done. In the unfolded state the hinges are at their 180deg stops, with the lift forces pushing them into the stops. That way I can lock the hinges even when there is some load on them. Once the hinges are locked the autostruts keep the wings reasonably stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think something like the folding wings like on many carrier-based airplanes (e.g. F/A-18 Hornet) that can unfold and lock their wings while on the ground should be possible with the right use of autostruts. Sweeping wings like on the F-14 Tomcat - that are expected to move their wings while under load - will be a lot harder. Maybe unlocking, moving, and locking again is possible in level flight with the lifting force being perpendicular to the movement direction of the hinges. But I haven\u0027t tested that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the way that KSP implements the physics means that the real-life reason for swept wings just doesn\u0027t exist in KSP. So everything else being the same, your plane will fly as well at all speeds with straight wings than with swept wings. But I believe that isn\u0027t much consolation for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-10T21:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy own issue is trying to make variable incidence wings that tilt up very slightly.
