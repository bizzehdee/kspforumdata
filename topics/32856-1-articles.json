Videos looked amusing so I thought I\u0027d give it a go (I neglected to get it from Steam - I avoid it if I can). I haven\u0027t had this level of childish fun in a video game for a long, long time so I\u0027ve basically lost entire days to it so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ventures so far have been to get 2 satellites in matching circular but perpendicular orbits. I\u0027ve built a (horribly inefficient) craft to get a Kerbal to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Got there too - just can\u0027t land the bugger. Tonight I started building a space station, although I have yet to actually... y\u0027know... dock anything together.
