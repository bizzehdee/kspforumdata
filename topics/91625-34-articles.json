Contract Configurator has its own contract class (just one) that it inserts into the stock system. Actually, it inserts it multiple times based on the number of CONTRACT_TYPE nodes that have been loaded to try and keep a statistical balance between Contract Configurator and \u0022normal\u0022 contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you are writing contracts using Contract Configurator there are a few things you can do that go beyond the stock system (like assigning a weight to a CONTRACT_TYPE - which Contract Configurator will use when making a weighted selection of which contract type to offer). So it\u0027s a little bit better than just the stock system, but still has a lot of the issues (incessantly checking whether a contract is still valid, generating in order from 1 star to 3 star when filling the list, off the top of my head).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid that answer the question?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T21:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nightingale\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nightingale\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid that answer the question?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYes.
