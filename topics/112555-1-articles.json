Looking at DOE\u0027s changelog for 1.02, there\u0027s a mention of \u0027fixed ghost flares\u0027 which sounds promising. I\u0027m wary of just deleting the old DOE and installing the newer one and possibly screwing my game up, so I thought I\u0027d ask if anyone knows whether a 1.02 mod will work with a 1.00 game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T13:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt could work but there is no guarantee.
