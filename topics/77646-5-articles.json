Even out at Mars orbit its best if you can be heard directly from earth without having to use one of NASA\u0027s space probes that\u0027s already out there as a radio relay. Heck, that might be a thing that our CubeSat could do if we don\u0027t end up landing on Phobos, after the primary mission is done. Provided we put a big enough radio on it, that is. Which brings me to an idea I had for a clever way to solve that problem and also actually reduce weight of the communications systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadio antennas cost mass, and so do transmitters. Good thing the ion engine would need an RF power source as well, because a radio transmitter is just an appropriately modulated RF power source operating at the right frequency, fed into a well matched antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee a similarity there? I do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is basically to spec a communications-grade radio transmitter capable of 80W (plus some overhead for the sake of reliability) so that we can also use it to drive the ion engine. Because an RF powered ion engine in operation generates a lot of RF interference, it would be hard to use the data radio at the same time as the ion engine anyways, so we don\u0027t really lose any capability. Since we won\u0027t be driving the ion engine all the time, a RF switch would be used to connect the transmitter to either the ion engine or the communications antenna as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing one transmitter to do the job of two should save mass, but further study into that would be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the antenna is concerned, Voyager 1 can still be heard to this day, and it\u0027s high-gain \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassegrain_antenna\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECassegrain antenna\u003C/a\u003E is only connected to a radio with 20W of transmit power. We have 4 times that much power available, at least for short bursts.

Good thing the ion engine would need an RF power source as well, because a radio transmitter is just an appropriately modulated RF power source operating at the right frequency, fed into a well matched antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee a similarity there? I do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is basically to spec a communications-grade radio transmitter capable of 80W (plus some overhead for the sake of reliability) so that we can also use it to drive the ion engine. Because an RF powered ion engine in operation generates a lot of RF interference, it would be hard to use the data radio at the same time as the ion engine anyways, so we don\u0027t really lose any capability. Since we won\u0027t be driving the ion engine all the time, a RF switch would be used to connect the transmitter to either the ion engine or the communications antenna as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing one transmitter to do the job of two should save mass, but further study into that would be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the antenna is concerned, Voyager 1 can still be heard to this day, and it\u0027s high-gain \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassegrain_antenna\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECassegrain antenna\u003C/a\u003E is only connected to a radio with 20W of transmit power. We have 4 times that much power available, at least for short bursts. Dish antennas are heavy, but we don\u0027t need all that power so we can use an antenna type that is lighter, but less efficient at turning RF power in a cable into RF waves in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to use a smaller antenna because we can just shove more power out of it to compensate also saves mass, but it requires that the first part of my idea works, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does everyone think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood idea, or am I getting into \u0022good at everything, best at nothing\u0022 territory?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that is a good idea indeed.
