I\u0027m fairly used to the editing part (from video files created by my camcorder), but really know nothing about screen recording software. I\u0027m using the Steam version on Windows 8.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone recommend software for this? It really is purely as a hobby project for a couple of really short clips, so cheap / freeware preferable. I do need to record sound as well,but really need nothing fancy and prefer something which doesn\u0027t hog resources too much!
