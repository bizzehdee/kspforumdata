However, if you hit F5 to quicksave, let that finish, and then Alt-F4 a corupted persistent file could be fixed by just copying the quicksave.sfs over the persistent.sfs.\n\nThere is no other danger that I can think of.

I play in window mode. \n\nIt autosaves when you change the scene, say change vessel or go to space center and i find it autosaves randomly during flight. \n\nI quicksave from time to time but I know so long as im looking at KSC it will continue the game from there when i get back.

Basically any time the game is advancing time (at the KSC screen, in-flight, in the tracking station, etc...) the game may do one of its periodic saves (you can specify the periodic save interval). It is possible to exit in the middle of this save and corrupt it.\n\nHowever, places where time doesn\u0027t advance (i.e. in the editors, main menu, ...) it is generally safe to ALT\u002BF4 out.
