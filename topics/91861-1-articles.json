It was there one mission then gone the next. When in staging view it is still visible, and if I hover over it on the launch pad then it does the drop down showing recover and space center then while still hovered I press M to go to map view and the very bottom edge is still visible until I hover off. Is there any manual setting I can change to move it back on screen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture of the barely visible altimeter at the top:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://gckaiser.me/KSP%20files/2014-12-02_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-12-02_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T08:34:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe this problem is triggered when running windowed mode at the same resolution as your desktop size, and it persists if you switch to full screen mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try running in \u0022frameless window mode.\u0022 I can\u0027t recall what steam calls it, but it might also be \u0022borderless window mode,\u0022 and many people call it fake full screen mode. Steam has a check box option to use this mode. Alternatively, you can run KSP.exe directly by creating a shortcut and adding \u0022-popupwindow\u0022 to the command line argument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I prefer borderless window mode. Works much better than full screen and doesn\u0027t have the graphics hiccups. If that doesn\u0027t work well for you and you still want a windowed mode, try reducing the game resolution a little bit and that should help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gregory","CreatedById":130824,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T04:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the -popupwindow I was able to start in borderless window mode, which is actually quite nice; however it did not fix the problem. Also when the problem started I was using full screen the whole time; I only tried windowed mode to see if that would fix the problem, sadly it did not. I also tried various other screen resolutions and even the Disable desktop composition option which has worked on other games in the past, but sadly nothing seems to be working for me. So I\u0027m still missing the altimeter, also I noticed when I switch back and forth to map view using the M key the altimeter does transition off screen with a sliding effect just like the other UI components (pilots, and staging info), So is there maybe there\u0027s a key combo to hide/show the altimeter in map view?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
