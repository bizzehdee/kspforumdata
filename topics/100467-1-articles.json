We know all, see all and are capable of all. You are our subjects.

MUAHAHAHA!**\n\n**We will begin sending diplomatic spacecraft over to Bop, a moon of jool in order to begin our alliance with the Kraken and all it\u0027s children. We will locate the ihabitants of the Sol system and work with it, for we have.....counterparts......on its third planet.**\n\n**We will then proceed with our ultimate plan. Evil will always triumph over good, and we will triumph over the universe.**\n\n**GLORY TO THE KERLLUMINNATI!!!!111**\n\nNow that the intro\u0027s done, we\u0027d like to state that for too long has the public veiwed us as only a crummy interior light supplier for the HypeTrain!

So if you ever wonder why it looks terrible..\n\nIt was only designed for one situation, and it didn\u0027t look half-bad there. Other situations weren\u0027t in the design spec.\n\nWhich is why I absolutely advocate an alternative, if you *need* to use comic sans, don\u0027t use comic sans. [Use comic neue.](http://comicneue.com/) It was optimized FOR these situations in which comic sans isn\u0027t suitable, while maintaining the status as \u0022font-like-6-year-old-writing\u0022.\n\nAnd as always, a source to prove i\u0027m not raving stark mad.
