I wasn\u0027t even sure they\u0027d get another shot given they were crowd funded, so to suddenly hear about them breaking the Karman line is amazing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess a bit more about the rocket- It\u0027s called MOMO. Ostensibly the name is a reference to a reading of word \u0022100-\u0022, as in \u0022This rocket\u0027s going up 100-km\u0022 , but the same pronunciation also means \u0022Peaches\u0022, and given Interstellar Technologies has had rockets named \u0022Strawberry\u0022 and \u0022Snow Sparkle\u0022, I think it\u0027s pretty clear what they were really going for. Really, it\u0027s hard not to root for a rocket named Peaches. Momo is a 1 tonne sounding rocket with a 1,200kgF pintle engine running on LOX and Ethanol of all things. It\u0027s designed to provide about 5 minutes of microgravity to a 20kg payload (a comparable mission to New Shepard), while also acting as a stepping stone for their upcoming microsat launcher, the Zero. The first two launch attempts of Momo rockets were less than successful, so it was great to see a success for number 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter watching their launch, I\u0027m starting to dig back through the live stream. Just for the heck of it, I\u0027ll try to keep a translation log going here, but I need to skip town for a couple days and haven\u0027t made it very far yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst note, I am not good at Japanese.

This is Momo 2... wait, Momo 3!\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s about 10 meters tall and will be launching from Sky Hills (Ed. Their Hokkaido launch site)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe camera is zoomed in from 4 kilometers away!

It can achieve a 100 kilometer apogee.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe have an upcoming development that\u0027ll do small sats, a launch system called Zero. We\u0027re doing that as our next version. As for how sounding rockets and small sat rockets differ, sounding rockets will apogee at 100 kilometers because above 100 kilometers, we can call it space. But then unable to reach orbit, they\u0027ll fall on their own and return back to the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA small sat rocket after reaching 100 kilometers will speed up to 7km/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
