This is the current progress, and I have flown five missions up to it, four of which added new modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rUDxK1K.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rUDxK1K.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to say, SQUAD has done a great job with the tweakable lights:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pLovPEy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pLovPEy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, docked to the station is my Orion Capsule replica, which was launched with a SLS Block 1A Crew Variant.
