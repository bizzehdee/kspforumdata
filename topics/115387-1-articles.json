If someone didn\u0027t tell me it was modeled after the SaturnV I wouldn\u0027t tell what theme it was. It looks good don\u0027t get me wrong, but I think there\u0027s a lot more they coulve done to make it resemble more of the rocket. A more intricate paint job with rivets in key places would really set it off. And then the inside needs to resemble the command module to an extent. Switch guards on the center console would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to meet some of the astronauts at the auction in Wisconsin.
