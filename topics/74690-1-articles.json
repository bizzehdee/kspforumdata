It\u0027s a convenient part for holding enough crew to operate the experiment cleaner, but it weighs so goddamn much, it\u0027s way cheaper to just use two mk1 lander cans. I think the mk2 can should have a weight of maybe 1-1.2 tons at most.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T20:13:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it needs any buffing. It produces as much torque as the Mk1-2 pod and IMO the increased weight is worth the convenience of being able to put it into a 2.5m stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy gripe with it is that there\u0027s not nearly enough room above the hatch to put an RCS block. That drives me freakin\u0027 crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadMG","CreatedById":99040,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T10:30:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, but I don\u0027t need extra torque or a 2.5m stack. I only need the mk1 can but can hold two Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T12:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChange the name of the MK 2 lander can, fix the top of it so it looks half decent with something on top of it and designe a larger variant of the MK 1 using the same design scheme. That\u0027s my solution. As LethalDose said, the ability to put in a 2.5 m stack is awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
