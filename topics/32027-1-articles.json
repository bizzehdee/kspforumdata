Seeing two hundred posts, even if small to other people\u0027s loss, go down the drain isn\u0027t appreciated. I decided to start a new profile, new slate, and build a new name. I hope to lend my expertise in this wonderful game to less experienced players, and veterans alike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little about myself, which no doubt you\u0027ll be enthralled with. I\u0027m sixteen years old, and am currently residing in the wonderful capital of Canada. In addition to an obvious obsession with spacecraft, astronomy, and orbital physics, I\u0027m in love with music. I love listening to a mixture of electro, Bach fugues, and modern orchestral music. I also play in the Ottawa Youth Orchestra, even though I\u0027m a year behind all the other horns there. Even though I\u0027m probably the best horn of my age in Ottawa, that doesn\u0027t really mean much because there isn\u0027t a lot of us out there. In addition I enjoy reading; Mercedes Lackey. Orson Scott Card, and Kim Stanley Robinson are all fair game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your attention, and I hope to contribute my intelligence and wit to this magnificent community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Typhor\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poldarias","CreatedById":58016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T19:32:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey there, welcome the KSP community!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T06:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
