Stock craft (especially these days) tend to survive KSP updates whereas mod craft are\u00A0subject to changes in several unconnected code bases and that can be frustrating. I like having a set of pure stock craft that can function just fine without mods, but are designed to take modded payloads or have minor mod additions.\u00A0 I keep a set of pure stock craft which I know I can easily transfer into an KSP install/version and then I add bits to them (like additional science modules, decorative parts etc).\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI don\u0027t understand the point of view that playing with mods takes away from the challenge\u00A0or is less creative. Sure there are mods that add overpowered parts, but a lot of mods add more challenge to the game and some are so complex that there is quite a big learning curve to fully understand them. And as far as creativity goes, it\u0027s about what important to you; some people want to be creative and solve a problem like how to make a stock hinge, other people just want a hinge so they can get on with being creative in other ways (and keep the part count down).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome mods do add convenience, but after the nth time of having to right click on every tank in your munar shuttle, and panning the camera into odd places to get to those hard to see tanks, just so you can refuel it from your fuel station, I\u0027d rather just install tac fuel balancer and click transfer out on the station\u0027s main silo tank. Or after 1 by 1 transferring crew between a station shuttle and station (a process that takes 3 clicks per crew), that gets a bit dull and I\u0027d rather have crew manifest so I can do that transfer quickly and get on with the interesting things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI think the idea that \u0022mods make it easy\u0022 comes from there being mods that do things like automatic\u00A0docking and landing and people see that as missing the point, or the \u0022I had to struggle with that so you should too\u0022 mindset. Personally, I\u0027d say learning to dock was a great satisfaction and\u00A0(after 5 years of playing) I still enjoy the satisfaction of getting a perfect dock, but I can see that for some people it\u0027s a blocker and maybe they\u00A0just want to do their thing in space and perhaps at some point they\u0027ll learn to do it, but it doesn\u0027t matter so long as they\u0027re having fun.\u00A0 But even something like automated docking can be used creatively; something I\u0027ve been doing recently is having various craft near a station and setting several of them to automatically dock while I pilot one of them.\u00A0 The result is so cool! it\u0027s like having traffic at the station and seeing various other craft moving about and coming into dock while you\u0027re approaching your dock just looks fantastic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JK_Kerbineer","CreatedById":180871,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-12T13:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m\u00A0fine with both playstyles, but I get really angry when someone who hasn\u0027t even tried to get to orbit without MechJeb or HyperEdit, calls the game boring because they don\u0027t get to do anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mukita12","CreatedById":179319,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-12T13:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDude i agree with you when i was trying to Public discord server and Giving my Artillery Craft many people say It\u0027s was crap, S***, and Stupid because of mod so I leave that Discord\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-12T13:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome people are against mods because they feel that playing purely stock and having to work with what the base game gives you makes it more challenging and difficult; they think that mods make the game easier and it makes them feel superior.
