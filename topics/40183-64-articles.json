I have been playing around with the rockets from the FASA pack and guess what... the recycling of stages via \u0022Rocket-powered landing\u0022 does work. But apparently only with stages dropped at very high altitude. I first noticed it with the Atlas, but the Titan rocket is a better example.

The auto recycle in MCE works when KSP auto Destroys the part. Once that happens then the calculations for the auto recycle kick in.
