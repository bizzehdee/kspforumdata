It is saying you should make sure that it is where you want it and that it is not in an accidental location.\n\nWhen your view goes far away, happens a lot. It\u0027s known about but many other things are broken and are in more urgent need.\n\nWhen this happens, press \u0027M\u0027 twice. it will go to map mode and then return to a closer view of your vessel.\n\nSome people think that the glitch happens if you return to VAB or SPH while in map mode."}]}
