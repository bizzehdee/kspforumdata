I\u0027ve visited Mun, Minmus, and Ike so far the views have really upped my excitement for the game. I really appreciate all the hard work the team has put into doing this. I\u0027m much more driven to build exploration vehicles just to go around and admire the views, or do low-altitude orbits and just watch the landscape scroll underneath me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJool is my favorite system, but in this playthrough I\u0027ve decided to hold off on visiting until they have high res texture too. I noticed there hasn\u0027t been a lot of activity in the announcements and daily kerbal section as of late. The pandemic has really screwed things up for a lot of people. How have they affected KSP 1 development? I hope the team is OK! Stay safe guys and gals, and know your work is appreciated and adored by this fan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-03T14:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMajor update due in July. They haven\u0027t said if there are new planet textures in it but frankly I\u0027d be disappointed if there aren\u0027t. The April Fool\u0027s joke had a snazzy new texture for Jool, could be that\u0027s the new one except not orange ofc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
