I\u0027ve taken a few days off from modding to kinda clear the brain a bit. And thank you VERY much for the donation. Hopefully, if everyone likes the next pack well enough, a new hard drive will be on the horizon. To answer your previous question about what that donation gets you...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I\u0027ve taken a small break, rest assured, the next pack is still being actively developed and even though I haven\u0027t been painting pixels, the ideas just won\u0027t leave my head. Here\u0027s a preview of what\u0027s to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor some reason, sketchfab doesn\u0027t like flags. The sides of the cargo bridge have the window lighting texture overlaying where the flag should be.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne the the first things you\u0027ll notice is the new texture. I\u0027ve finally gotten it applied to the RoRo and the Helo stern. The RoRo will need a bit of touchup on the Plimsoll line. I tried to copy it from another texture and it looks pretty bad. I\u0027ll redo it so it has it\u0027s own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext you\u0027ll notice the engines changed on the Helo Stern. That\u0027s because the hard mounted engines have been removed. Those are two new surface mount engines. I figured it was about time, since basic testing seems to be complete, that you decided how much power and thrust your ships needed, not me. With those engines, the powered clipper stern will vanish and no longer be in the pack. You will have the rounded stern though to mount engines to. Both the rounded and the helo stern will lose their fuel tanks. If you want to keep the look of the pack, you\u0027ll need to use the Clipper hull LF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this change comes a major problem, a brick wall that seems to be insurmountable with stock physics. I had been reading in another thread that attempts to exceed 125m/s on water ended rather abruptly. I can safely say I have found the same problem. With the new engines you\u0027ll be able to go as fast as you want. Though I\u0027m leaving crash tolerances where they are, reaching 125m/s won\u0027t be a problem. Exceeding it will. Every time I\u0027ve hit exactly 125m/s, things have promptly ripped off the hull bringing me back under 125m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I can fully understand why this hard limit exists. For those of us still on the imperial system, 125m/s=279.617mph. The current record for water speed on our planet is 141.9 m/s (317 mph). Many of those attempting to break water speed records have lost their lives when the boats utterly disintegrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with the next pack, you will be able to reach that hard limit. Doing so will have it\u0027s consequences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother minor change is a rework of the RoRo animation. I\u0027ve reduce the angle on the ramp. It won\u0027t lower quite as far as before. Since most beach landings will be at an up angle the ramp will still sit at or below the surface, just not as far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the status is: Only one hull piece still needs to have the new texture applied, the Foc\u0027sle Bow. There\u0027s still one part for the paddlewheeler that needs to be completed, a promenade that will attach to any of the lower deck sections and give it a \u0027rounded\u0027 appearance and provide a smooth transition from the walkways to the clipper decks. Right now, it\u0027s a straight drop for the Kerbals to walk over. While they do it, it just doesn\u0027t look right. I still need to determine how the new steam system is going to finally function and that\u0027s just a matter of editing cfg files. Once those things are complete a check of all parts to make sure they do what I intend, that their textures aren\u0027t too large and applying any changes needed to fix things should finish up the next release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully, I say hopefully, in the next week all of this should be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the other things that\u0027s slowing me down is Windows 10. I upgraded from Win 7 32 bit to Win 10 32 bit. One of the consequences of that is reduced ram available for apps. I had my Win 7 set up to allow 3 gigs of ram for apps. Win 10 32 bit promptly reset that to 2 gigs and damned if I can remember how to put it back. I get maybe 5 or 6 launches with KSP before it crashes. I\u0027ve installed Win 10 64 bit on an old 75gb IDE drive but now I need to get all my apps installed and working with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after that is taken care of and the next pack releases, then I begin work on a tweakscale config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sashan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sashan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it compatible with better buyoancy?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022General Rarity\u0022 data-cite=\u0022General Rarity\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/443954483439294815/FDE4081CD69A420F7A6534AB6A149A7B2C95279E/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/443954483439294815/FDE4081CD69A420F7A6534AB6A149A7B2C95279E/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slowest drive-by in history. 400 tons of pure FREEDOM!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love this mod... it\u0027s easily moddable and easy to use.

I have this mod installed via CKAN so assumed everything would run smoothly. For some reason the \u0022bitts\u0022 arent in game, and I can\u0027t access any right click menus on parts for condensing water etc in order to make the bitts and blisters work. Any idea\u0027s what could be causing this? From what I can see, I don\u0027t have any mods installed that could conflict with it, but I\u0027m not 100%,\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, will this become tweakscale compatible as I\u0027d love to be able to scale the part sizes to build bigger ships!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t looked at the CKAN pack. I can tell you this though, it was pulled directly from KerbalStuff. CKAN periodically checks KerbalStuff and adds it\u0027s listings to their pack. So if it works on KerbalStuff, it should also work via CKAN. If right click menus aren\u0027t showing up then (I hate to do this because every IT guy will say this) it\u0027s not the fault of Maritime Pack. The right clicks are hard coded into KSP. The only right click menus that aren\u0027t fully hard coded are the engines which include items from Firespitter. If the Bitts aren\u0027t included then that\u0027s not a Maritime release or your copy of KSP is not finding them. Make sure they\u0027re in the GameData directory. If they are, check the log file and see if you can find why they\u0027re not loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chris Hansen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Chris Hansen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it possible to make submarines in this mod?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few pages back I discussed the issues with subs.
