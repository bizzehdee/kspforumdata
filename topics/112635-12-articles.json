I\u0027ve taken a few days off from modding to kinda clear the brain a bit. And thank you VERY much for the donation. Hopefully, if everyone likes the next pack well enough, a new hard drive will be on the horizon. To answer your previous question about what that donation gets you...\n\nThough I\u0027ve taken a small break, rest assured, the next pack is still being actively developed and even though I haven\u0027t been painting pixels, the ideas just won\u0027t leave my head. Here\u0027s a preview of what\u0027s to come.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n*For some reason, sketchfab doesn\u0027t like flags. The sides of the cargo bridge have the window lighting texture overlaying where the flag should be.*\n\nOne the the first things you\u0027ll notice is the new texture. I\u0027ve finally gotten it applied to the RoRo and the Helo stern. The RoRo will need a bit of touchup on the Plimsoll line. I tried to copy it from another texture and it looks pretty bad. I\u0027ll redo it so it has it\u0027s own.\n\nNext you\u0027ll notice the engines changed on the Helo Stern. That\u0027s because the hard mounted engines have been removed. Those are two new surface mount engines. I figured it was about time, since basic testing seems to be complete, that you decided how much power and thrust your ships needed, not me. With those engines, the powered clipper stern will vanish and no longer be in the pack. You will have the rounded stern though to mount engines to. Both the rounded and the helo stern will lose their fuel tanks. If you want to keep the look of the pack, you\u0027ll need to use the Clipper hull LF.\n\nWith this change comes a major problem, a brick wall that seems to be insurmountable with stock physics. I had been reading in another thread that attempts to exceed 125m/s on water ended rather abruptly. I can safely say I have found the same problem. With the new engines you\u0027ll be able to go as fast as you want. Though I\u0027m leaving crash tolerances where they are, reaching 125m/s won\u0027t be a problem. Exceeding it will. Every time I\u0027ve hit exactly 125m/s, things have promptly ripped off the hull bringing me back under 125m/s. \n\nAnd I can fully understand why this hard limit exists. For those of us still on the imperial system, 125m/s=279.617mph. The current record for water speed on our planet is 141.9 m/s (317 mph). Many of those attempting to break water speed records have lost their lives when the boats utterly disintegrated.\n\nSo, with the next pack, you will be able to reach that hard limit. Doing so will have it\u0027s consequences.\n\nAnother minor change is a rework of the RoRo animation. I\u0027ve reduce the angle on the ramp. It won\u0027t lower quite as far as before. Since most beach landings will be at an up angle the ramp will still sit at or below the surface, just not as far.\n\nSo, the status is: Only one hull piece still needs to have the new texture applied, the Foc\u0027sle Bow. There\u0027s still one part for the paddlewheeler that needs to be completed, a promenade that will attach to any of the lower deck sections and give it a \u0027rounded\u0027 appearance and provide a smooth transition from the walkways to the clipper decks. Right now, it\u0027s a straight drop for the Kerbals to walk over. While they do it, it just doesn\u0027t look right. I still need to determine how the new steam system is going to finally function and that\u0027s just a matter of editing cfg files. Once those things are complete a check of all parts to make sure they do what I intend, that their textures aren\u0027t too large and applying any changes needed to fix things should finish up the next release. \n\nHopefully, I say hopefully, in the next week all of this should be done.\n\nOne of the other things that\u0027s slowing me down is Windows 10. I upgraded from Win 7 32 bit to Win 10 32 bit. One of the consequences of that is reduced ram available for apps. I had my Win 7 set up to allow 3 gigs of ram for apps. Win 10 32 bit promptly reset that to 2 gigs and damned if I can remember how to put it back. I get maybe 5 or 6 launches with KSP before it crashes. I\u0027ve installed Win 10 64 bit on an old 75gb IDE drive but now I need to get all my apps installed and working with it.\n\nSo, after that is taken care of and the next pack releases, then I begin work on a tweakscale config file.\n\nThat\u0027s the status.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is it compatible with better buyoancy?\n\nAFAIK yes.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/443954483439294815/FDE4081CD69A420F7A6534AB6A149A7B2C95279E/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/443954483439294815/FDE4081CD69A420F7A6534AB6A149A7B2C95279E/)\n\u003E The slowest drive-by in history. 400 tons of pure FREEDOM!\n\u003E \n\u003E I love this mod... it\u0027s easily moddable and easy to use. The hull parts here are 2x the normal size and work well for cruisers/battleships/carriers and possibly cargo ships too.\n\u003E \n\u003E The only problem I have is that the BDArmory guns are too heavy for the ships and usually capsize them... but I solved that by placing many bitts on the bottom hull of the ships. Add a few blisters after that and the ships are A-OK.\n\u003E \n\u003E Looking forward to future updates! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThe things you guys come up with just amaze me. Glad to see my parts are being used creatively.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m loving the idea behind this pack, however I\u0027m having a couple of small issues. I have this mod installed via CKAN so assumed everything would run smoothly. For some reason the \u0022bitts\u0022 arent in game, and I can\u0027t access any right click menus on parts for condensing water etc in order to make the bitts and blisters work. Any idea\u0027s what could be causing this? From what I can see, I don\u0027t have any mods installed that could conflict with it, but I\u0027m not 100%,\n\u003E On another note, will this become tweakscale compatible as I\u0027d love to be able to scale the part sizes to build bigger ships!\n\nI haven\u0027t looked at the CKAN pack. I can tell you this though, it was pulled directly from KerbalStuff. CKAN periodically checks KerbalStuff and adds it\u0027s listings to their pack. So if it works on KerbalStuff, it should also work via CKAN. If right click menus aren\u0027t showing up then (I hate to do this because every IT guy will say this) it\u0027s not the fault of Maritime Pack. The right clicks are hard coded into KSP. The only right click menus that aren\u0027t fully hard coded are the engines which include items from Firespitter. If the Bitts aren\u0027t included then that\u0027s not a Maritime release or your copy of KSP is not finding them. Make sure they\u0027re in the GameData directory. If they are, check the log file and see if you can find why they\u0027re not loading.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is it possible to make submarines in this mod?\n\nA few pages back I discussed the issues with subs. While it\u0027s not off the table, it\u0027s teetering on the edge.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T15:48:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 03:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T01:59:58Z","Content":"Just got to realizing that many of you may be questioning my sanity, mixing paddlewheel boats with aircraft...

Unfortunately while BB fixes some stuff it is mainly orientated towards making water NOT the most destructive force in the Kerbal Universe. And while it would be possible to make a keel shaped wing, if you rolled your ship on it\u0027s side, your ship would fly because of the amount of \u0022Lift\u0022 required to make it hold a heading. Also you are carrying a lot of weight for a fairly small amount of boat as both those containers weigh about 13 tons, not to mention any other resources you are carrying and equipment.

But as these parts are scaled up, they begin to look less and less realistic.\n- Adding tweakscale support means the pack becomes dependent on yet another mod, something I\u0027m desperately trying to avoid.\n- The more dependent the pack is on outside mods, the more memory it consumes and, not everyone will want to install these other mods.\n- If I choose to make larger hulls, this creates a need for a lot of new parts, which adds to the pack size.\n- The more parts I add, the more memory the textures consume.\n- Hull parts are now becoming some of the larger textures due to the fact many people want better textures.\n- Better textures = more memory consumption.\n\nSo, no matter which method I choose, it\u0027s going to be either more memory consumption or less realistic.\n\n**From the R\u0026D department**\n\nWith that though in mind, here\u0027s a pic from the R\u0026D department.\n\n![CatamaranTest.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/CatamaranTest.jpg)\n\nThis is a test of a catamaran adapter (the ugly blue thing). Like the CVE parts, it snaps onto the top of the clipper hull. It then allows a second hull to be attached in parallel. \n\nThe benefit of this method:\n\nRelatively low part count. A new class of double wide ships and a CVL can both be created with only 6-7 new parts, most of them very low polygon count.\n\nThe downside:\n\nThere will be multiple connection nodes along the Y and Z axis. Since KSP only allows for connections to one of these nodes, creating ships that bend in the middle or wrong places will be a problem.\n\nI hope this gives you guys an idea of some of the challenges I\u0027m trying to sort out with the \u0027bigger ships\u0027 plan.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Fengist, I have a minor request. No coding, no textures, no models, only on the forum.\n\u003E Can you please edit the OP to include a link to the Tweakscale configs that someone posted a while back?\n\nI can do that. I started a FAQ on the OP with a link to Jatwaa\u0027s tweakscale config file.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/42/113942-004-D405309F.jpg](http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/42/113942-004-D405309F.jpg)\n\u003E Can we get cargo holds like this please?\n\nIn the beginning, I considered this option... a different hull for different fuels/cargo and even test designed a few. Here\u0027s the problem. This pack is destined to get big. If I keep adding parts and textures you may end up with a pack so large, you can\u0027t add planes and spacecraft. With that, I decided the best option to was to allow the surface attachment of other tanks and give them a fuel crossfeed. Essentially, you can take any fuel tank from most any mod or stock and surface attach them to the hull and then transfer fuel around.\n\nWhile I do like the thought of dedicated cargo hulls, I\u0027m trying to keep this pack so you don\u0027t have to delete your other mods in order to use it. For now, I have no immediate plans to add in dedicated cargo hulls.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hey Fengist, whats happening man? Been a bit quiet here of late, so it would be nice to hear from you ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThe reports of my death were highly exaggerated. Sorry, RL has intervened once again. IRL, I drive a school bus (yea, it\u0027s hard for me to believe too) and with the impending start of school, preparations have begun and thus, my time is temporarily limited. But it should free up a good bit more in the next week or so. Yes, another delay but rest assured, development continues. The only part that remains unfinished for the texture update is the Foc\u0027sle and it\u0027s mostly done, just need to tweak the texture a bit. After that, a bit of testing and packaging and I hope like hell I can get this release out. I really want you guys to play with this paddlewheeler. IMHO it\u0027s pretty neat, but I\u0027m biased.\n\nAnother big slowdown was switching over to 64bit Windows 10. Since my Win 7 was 32 bit, I\u0027m having to reinstall every single program I use and that\u0027s quite laborious.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/LnP9043.png](http://i.imgur.com/LnP9043.png)\n\u003E I made a US-style submarine from WWII after I saw the USS Cobia at the Wisconsin Maritime Museum.
