The problem I have is that it takes a lot of energy to transmit that data and this depletes that batteries, switching off the computer which I need to control the glider attitude. If there was some way I could either limit transmission to short bursts or pause and unpause it then the solar panels could charge the battery between transmission bursts. I can\u0027t be the first person to have encountered this scenario so I\u0027m hoping there\u0027s already a way to deal with it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:05:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing like that in the stock game I\u0027m afraid. Once you start transmitting, it will continue at a predetermined rate until it\u0027s done or the electric charge runs out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only solution I know is add more batteries/solar panels.

I discovered by accident that by right-clicking on the antenna, you can stop the data transmission. If you resume the transmission after charging the batteries, it picks up where it left off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
