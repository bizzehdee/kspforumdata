For some reason, this is my big idea.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was under the impression that what I should do is build a large ship with many Nerv engines (32 to be exact, 4 each on 8 nacelles) and a detachable refueling unit and then throw some sort of detachable data gathering craft onto it. I started by designing this and throwing it onto a larger fuel mining ship I already had. One problem that immediately occurred was that in addition to the fact that those parts alone put me at 2mil before I even had assurances that I put the craft together right to make orbit. When I went to try it out, the less propelled refueling station fell right apart from the main stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I got to wondering, how stable are docking ports on a station in space? Will my craft hold together if I send these up in 3 stages and then connect them to maneuver throughout the system? Is this a realistic goal, or are there better ways to do this?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is a picture of the general design for the station base, without the other craft docked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/F48GWBy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/F48GWBy\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-22T04:13:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2016 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceCommunism\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T04:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s gonna wobble like crazy.\u00A0 The docking ports are not the problem, it\u0027s suspending those large engine tanks out on large long girders and THEN adding in the docking ports too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ag3nt108","CreatedById":159944,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T04:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDocking ports are not too bad at pulling but suck hard at pushing.

Though it\u0027ll depend on what the three modules look like, that you are connecting. Try to keep everything axial and somewhat flat (rather than the long, slender things you see in sci-fi shows). When things get long, you\u0027ll definitely get wobble on the connecting joints, even if you strut. If you have struts connecting the width of the vessel (such as the fuel tanks) down to a part that the docking port is attached to, that will help a lot. I would recommend putting some torque wheels or RCS ports on those engine nacelles too, or it\u0027s going to bend like crazy when you try to turn it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you may want to consider launching that thing empty\u00A0and fueling it up in orbit.
