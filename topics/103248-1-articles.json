So, yes, all mods depending on MM will be compatible with Config Refinig Tool without additional effort. And it\u0027s good alternative to all that scary Lua things as well.\n\n- better Lua sandbox so no one could use lua script to do something outside of KSP game data folder. Actually, sandbox will be restricted to changes in config files only and even more, writing to config files is outside of sandbox scope so no way to write tricky binary to cfg file instead of actual config.\n\nExample use-cases:\n\n- to really remove all that unused parts from config files instead of just making them unreachable\n\n- to perform some math on values, for example to recalculate Firespitter FSfuelSwitch tank costs avoiding \u0022negative part cost\u0022 problems or to make any wide-range balancing\n\n- to ban and then remove from configs any part or module or resource or anything you don\u0027t like, for example I used this to remove all KAS grab modules from parts when KIS is installed and to remove some unbalanced/buggy parts from other mods without hand-editing of KSP configs\n\nPros:\n\n- it\u0027s not runtime plugin but standalone application so you run it once and then use generated config files until you want to change your mods\n\n- it could slightly speed up loading and reduce memory usage\n\n- it will be completely opensource once released\n\nCons:\n\n- it\u0027s freaking standalone application so you HAVE to run it every time you change list of your mods or update one of mods\n\n- it could have compatibility issues with some mods\n\n- it\u0027s written using Java\n\nNo ETA for release yet, but surely not before KSP 1.0."}]}
