I think it\u0027s a pretty basic set, I see that many other mods require allot of the ones I\u0027ve installed and sometimes more, so it shouldn\u0027t be more than KSP can handle. My game keeps crashing. I can\u0027t run the game for more than 5 min. I have allot more memory than KSP can use (16 Gb) as it\u0027s only running in 32 bit mode it can only access 2Gb. If I have problems than theoretically anyone who runs this many mods would not be able to play. Considering there are other mods that require this many or more, it leads me to believe that people can run this many without major problems. Crashing every time within 5 min, would not give anyone a chance to test their own mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the mods I\u0027ve installed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMechJeb 2.1.1.01\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EISA Mapsat 4r2\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EB9 R4-0\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENovaPunch 2.03a\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKAS 0.4.5\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBioMass\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThrottleControlledAvionics\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had MechJeb and BioMass running fine.
