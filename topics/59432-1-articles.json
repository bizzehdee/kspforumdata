I did finally manage to get one out toward Mun with a solar panel, rechargeble battery and antenna and Goo container so that\u0027s progress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - when I succesfully run the Goo experiment and transmit the data back to Kerbin - WHEN do I get credit for the Sceince? After all - the Stayputnik can;t carry a parachute OR carry science in it\u0027s shell if I\u0027m corect about that so radio transmission is the only way to profit from it\u0027s work.
