So, what I\u0027ve found the lowest dV to be for me is wait until Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane and Moho\u0027s orbital plane intersect to do the transfer burn. I can get plane alignment (within 25-50dV) on my ejection burn and put my periapsis to run tangent to Moho\u0027s orbit. When I reach my periapsis around the sun, I bring the apoapsis down a bit inside of Eve\u0027s orbit and and wait to get a close approach, I burn at the apoapsis to get an encounter, and then do a bi-elliptical circularization around Moho.
