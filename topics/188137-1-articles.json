I know that Kerbin time is 6 hour days. I\u0027m fine with that. What I cannot figure out is why it seems that my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change times and maneuver node times seem to switch from Kerbin time to actual real Earth times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0A more detailed explanation is necessary. I don\u0027t use the time acceleration function built into the game. I prefer to play more like real life and launch my ships and wait for the interesting things to happen, like moon intercepts, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E burns etc., doing other stuff in the mean time like flying around gathering science in my Flylab. So in doing this I\u0027ve noticed that I\u0027ll make a launch to Minimus. It places the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change time as 5 days and some hours. If nothing else is going to happen, I will let my game run overnight while I sleep for 6 or 7 hours. When I look at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E time, it is reduced by a day or so as if it is using Kerbin time of 6 hours per day. At some point this timer switches to real time since as it gets to withing a few hours, I\u0027ll set my cellphone timer to make an orbit insertion burn or small trajectory change. When in orbit of a body, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E times are always in real time, as is the orbital period.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Essentially, without speeding up time, I can make it to Minimus in about 30 hours real time, with the 5 days counting down as if the timers are really running on Kerbin time, but at some point less than a day on the timer, it switches to real time and 5 hours is 5 hours. Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon and what are the conditions under which the game switches from counting down the days in Kerbin time (6 hours per day off the clock) to counting time down in real time. A return trip from Minimus is right around 8 days on the timer, but I can make it back in 2 days real time if I let the game run all the while. At some point the maneuver node timer will switch to real time. This problem does not occur with trips to Mun since it is only 5 hours each way and the timers always stay in real time. Also, since I haven\u0027t played all that long yet, I\u0027ve not left the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E so I\u0027m not sure how the timers will work on interplanetary trips.
