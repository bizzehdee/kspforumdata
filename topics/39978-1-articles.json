The important stat on it is the ISP; the higher that value is for a rocket, the more total thrust it can produce with the same amount of fuel. Those giant mainsails can produce a lot of thrust, but to go the same distance as a nuclear engine they\u0027d require a lot more fuel, it\u0027s just that the NERVA takes longer. But one of the shortest planetary transfers, to Duna takes 30 or so days so you have plenty of time and the efficiency is well worth it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strongest_2hu","CreatedById":67784,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T03:38:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to be careful as it\u0027s pretty heavy, there\u0027s some limit to how light your craft can get before it becomes more efficient to use a lighter engine (there\u0027s a chart floating around somewhere).
