I\u0027m looking for a mod (probably a plugin \u002B MM config) that modifies SAS control so that the standard SAS mode actually tries to, say, hold the heading you locked in when you enabled it. None of the wishy-washy \u0022let\u0027s give up and just slide\u0022 business, which makes it utterly useless for pretty much anytime I would want it for atmospheric work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(In particular with spaceplane reentry - \u0022Let\u0027s go from a 45 degree angle of attack to -5 in 5 seconds!

A small component of that is just absolute versus body-relative orientation, but nowhere near all of it - and that would tend to increase AOA, not decrease it. Stock SAS is supposedly a PID controller, but I have no idea what they did to mess things up that badly - it doesn\u0027t seem to have an I or P term, or it would at least try to return to its original setting later.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder - is it possible to read the target position of stock SAS and just reset it every game tick?
