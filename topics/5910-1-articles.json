We appreciate the interest you\\\u0027ve shown in purchasing one of our fine models. Please relax during our presentation, and we\\\u0027d like to remind you that that the models can in no way hurt you, despite what you may have heard and/or read about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout too much ado, let\\\u0027s begin by introducing the smallest of our craft, the Mark 7 \u003Cstrong\u003EBroadhead\u003C/strong\u003E! The Broadhead has had a long and illustrious career with us, being the craft we use to push the envelope with new and exciting technologies. Among other things, its latest iteration boasts solid rockets capable of speeding it to supersonic speeds while still under 5km and a full suite of RCS thrusters for vacuum operations! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot45.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot45.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot46.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot46.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts final stage serves three purposes: It\\\u0027s a fully-functional Munar rover, it has enough power and fuel to make the return visit, and it\\\u0027s a stylish command post for your crew to spend their time in orbit comfortably! Despite rumors to the contrary, this final stage has been proven to be 100% reliable, all of the time, with no exceptions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot5-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5-1.png\u0022\u003E (Hey, they lived!)\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext we have the Broadhead\\\u0027s older brother, the Mark 3 \u003Cstrong\u003EBodkin\u003C/strong\u003E! Designed to be bigger and heavier than the Broadhead, the Bodkin sports eight massive liquid-fueled engines in its first stage, a large secondary stage for inter-orbital maneuvers and a new \u0027Ion Engine\u0027 for final-stage guidance. In addition, it comes sporting the latest in casualty-avoidance technology, the Emergency Command Thruster , meant to pull your crew away from the violently out-of-control ball of death your rocket has become! This wasn\\\u0027t added for any reason, of course, purely for legal reasons. The fact that it\\\u0027s only on the Bodkin has no bearing on anything, and we resent your implications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot44.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot44.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird is our experimental rocket, the Mark 1 \u003Cstrong\u003EPilum\u003C/strong\u003E! The Pilum features new fairing techniques that drastically improve aerodynamics while still in Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere as well as eight swept-wing tail fins that are absolutely capable of surviving the heat from the liquid engines directly above them! Sportier, sleeker and more maneuverable than the Bodkin and Broadhead designs, the Pilum is for the wealthy spacegoer that puts style above such minor matters as functions, stability and safety! Additionally, each Pilum is made of 100% recycled soup cans, meaning you\\\u0027re saving the environment while earning the respect of your gravity-bound neighbors!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot50.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot50.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot51.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot51.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERounding off our pure rocket designs is the Mark 4 \u003Cstrong\u003EHydra\u003C/strong\u003E! The Hydra was built after we got too many lawsuits after the Bodkin kept crashing- er, that is, in our completely controlled computerized tests where absolutely no one got hurt. In fact, I think they didn\\\u0027t like it\\\u0027s color and that\\\u0027s why they sued us. Yep, that\\\u0027s gotta be it. In any case, we took the Bodkin\\\u0027s ideas and ran with them. The Hydra is capable of putting a truly huge amount of fuel in orbit, giving you all the delta-V any incompetent pilot would ever need (which was, in fact, its goal- to allow incompetence to pull through anyway)! Its second stage sports the NERVA Nuclear Fission engine, which practically sips fuel while blasting completely harmless U-236 into space! In addition, its practical, stylish and suave Lunar Command Pod is perfect for your next Munar get-together!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot47.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot47.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot48.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot48.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot19.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot19.png\u0022\u003E (This last one is zoomed out, but it\\\u0027s the Lander on the Mun. It then got home safely.)\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we have our two hybrid spaceplane/rocket projects, the \u003Cstrong\u003EAvalanche\u003C/strong\u003E and the \u003Cstrong\u003EAdamant\u003C/strong\u003E! We\\\u0027ll cover the former first, the Mark 4 Avalanche. This spaceplane was originally built to be an orbital shuttle capable of putting satellites into space, it initially suffered from what our engineers have called a \u0027fatal terrestrial magnetism\u0027, whatever that means. It\\\u0027s currently undergoing a redesign to become a light spaceplane for qucik flights to anywhere in Kerbin! Book your tickets now, they\\\u0027re gonna be going fast!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot27.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot27.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, we needed something to put our wreckage- er, our communications satellites in orbit. So the boys in the lab came up with the Adamant Heavy Lifter, the biggest and baddest of Soup Ind.\\\u0027s fleet! Weighing in at over four thousand tons when loaded, an Adamant-class lifter is capable of putting over three times its weight in a stable orbit, then returning home safely. Being a spaceplane, it does handle like a... what was the term... ah, yes, \u0027like a brick wall sinking in jello\u0027, according to the engineering specs. Still, it handles beautifully in the atmosphere, which is where it counts, and so long as you give it roughly 1,000km or so to decelerate once in Kerbin\\\u0027s airspace, it\\\u0027ll give you a safe water landing with no trouble!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot35.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot35.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i891.photobucket.com/albums/ac117/Leeksoup-MKN/screenshot38.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot38.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, act fast!
