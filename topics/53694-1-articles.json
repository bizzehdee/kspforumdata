I just bought KSP at Steam over the weekend, and I\u0027ve been playing it for two days. In my first day, I successfully put a craft into orbit around Kerbin, and on my second day, I put a craft in orbit around Mun (but did not land), and successfully returned it to Kerbin. In the process, I have built, flown, and crashed more craft than I can count. I have a pretty good feel for the construction process and the orbital mechanics, and the interface (I have no problems with the navball). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have decided that I now have two main goals: build a permanent space station around Kerbin; and build a permanent station on Mun. So, my question is, where do I start? One thing I can\u0027t seem to find anywhere is how to build the modules to make them self-sustaining. Yes, I\u0027ve seen the tutorials, but most of them skip over the details of module construction. Are there any sites or tutorials that can explain this? I\u0027m looking more for the \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E and the \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E, and not just the \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T22:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you mean by self sustaining? Kerbals currently don\u0027t have life support so you can leave them in a module as long as you like. If you mean things like resources, you want solar panels and batteries to keep your stuff from running out of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to fuel, you would need to fly new shipments and dock them to your station. Being able to refuel other ships in orbit with your station is quite handy too!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skylinkdave","CreatedById":93715,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T02:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, sorry, I guess by \u0022self-sustaining\u0022 I meant \u0022can run on it\u0027s own power indefinitely.\u0022 And can they be made to do interesting stuff?

AS far as using the stations for anything, you can put science pods and transmitters on them but they currently don\u0027t server to be better than just a regular landing craft. There are plans for a science lab to be added into the game soonish to make bases and stations more useful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skylinkdave","CreatedById":93715,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T19:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApparently it\u0027s a lot harder to land on the Mun than it is to simply orbit it; I must\u0027ve failed 5-6 times in my attempts at putting a lander on the surface.
