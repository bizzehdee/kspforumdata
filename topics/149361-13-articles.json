Anybody remember the shout box on the forums back then? My experience back then was a good one. Till one day I changed careers in my personal life\u00A0and no longer had the time to moderate at which time I pm\u0027d Harvester to let him know my situation he was very understanding and told me If I ever wanted my position back to just let him know. The communication between the moderators was great and it was a good environment. I learned alot and meet alot of good people. Capt\u0027n Skunky was a really cool guy gave me alot of advice. I think he was actually the first community manager(whatever happened to him?) Anyways I\u0027ve been watching the progress of KSP through the years. It\u0027s been one hell of a fun ride I got ta tell ya. When Harvester left I was like \u0022What?\u0022 and it did concern me and after that all this \u0022stuff\u0022 started happening with either a very general reply or no replys at all from squad! What happened to the good ole days when squad would just come out with it and be honest with their fans? Why allow for all this speculation and NEGATIVE hype man? And I got to hand it to you moderators because iv\u0027e been there....How do you moderate with one hand tied behind your back? I get it... I really do. It must be frustrating as hell. In regards to Roverdude...You guys need to back off Rover man! He has stated on his Twitch stream numberous times \u0022He\u00A0loves what he does period!\u0022 And it shows every time he streams. What alot of people dont think about is when he is streaming he is doing it on his own personal time making and modding things HE likes that HE wants in the game. And he\u0027ll come straight out and tell you he dont take requests he makes what makes him happy and gives him joy...and then turns around and gives us a great free mod. Now does that sound like some money hungry so-called squad puppet? That is just the most uncoolest thing I have ever heard on these forums since 2011. After all he has contributed for free to the community and to the game itself and all the joy and free knowledge (do you guys realize how much this knowledge would cost at a school or college)\u00A0he has given to people he invites into his home on Twitch.
