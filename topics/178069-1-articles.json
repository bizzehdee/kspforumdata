Unfortunately I haven\u0027t had much time to work on any new mods lately nor have I been able to get the Starman mod to its full glory. To tell you the truth, I have absolutely no idea what I\u0027m doing when it comes to most things in the KSP Mod Making community. Currently I\u0027m on the 7th revision of the mod and I\u0027m looking to finally get it to a place where everything I can do with it has been done. Currently, its just a 3D model of a Tesla Roadster with a basic looking Starman sitting in the seat. When I first created it, I never intended on its public release. Certain things didn\u0027t line up or look right and even still, they don\u0027t. A few months ago I made the final model that I intended to use for the mod. It features a much nicer looking Starman, and some fixes to the car itself. Of course KSP didn\u0027t like the model and it refuses to render things correctly. Starman\u0027s body is completely invisible and only the main part of his helmet can be seen. The steering wheel on the Roadster is also partially invisible in the middle. I\u0027m not entirely sure what\u0027s wrong. I don\u0027t know if its shaders or the amount of polygons or anything that it could be. All I know is that the people who have enjoyed playing with this mod in-game have loved it, and I think it would be fitting to finally get the model looking right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 If anyone could help me try to figure out what\u0027s wrong with this thing, I would extremely appreciate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tDsSeTV.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tDsSeTV.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022648\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPicture of the updated model\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
