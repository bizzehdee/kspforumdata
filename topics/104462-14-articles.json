Keep in mind I did not identify the same issue you saw. These are totally orthogonal problems. Remember, this debate started because I don\u0027t agree that a mistake was made. I\u0027m not saying that the right choice was made, but I also have not seen proof that the wrong one was made. I\u0027m open to hearing your reasoning. If you\u0027re confident you\u0027re right, you should be able to convince me. I\u0027m reasonable. I\u0027m a scientist. I\u0027ll agree as soon as I see good evidence or hear the proof. But lacking that, for now I think you\u0027re trying to solve a problem we don\u0027t actually have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem *I* saw was that the categories had too many choices for so few judges. If 100 people were voting, okay. Five? Too many choices. My proof for this is fairly simple: we needed a second round of voting after the videos that did not receive more than 1 vote were weeded out. My proposal to fix it would be to have two rounds built into the process. In voting round one, anyone and everyone can propose anything they want. No restrictions. Judges would then whittle this down. (The manner of the whittling process can be debated. Perhaps this is related to your pitch in a way. Maybe it\u0027s a panel of three experts in the field who decide what 3-5 choices best meet the category requirements. I\u0027m not 100% decided on this part.) I think 3-5 choices may be okay, but certainly NOT more than 5 choices. Then we have \u0022real\u0022 voting in round two. Ideally this would be by more than 5 judges, but we\u0027ll work with what we can get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a second issue actually. The number of judges was too low IMO. I have not put a lot of thought into how to get more other than by asking Squad/Kasper to help by making this more official. (Actually, I already did that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But we have a year to figure it out.) The more we get, though, the more the third problem matters. So...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw a third issue. The voting process itself was not streamlined. I received LONG emails, split into two parts in some cases, and it was difficult weeding through it to get the choices. I also pretended I was a judge by going through the mock process of voting. I had to watch a lot of stuff, and some categories were hard to work through. Then I had to basically create my own ballot. My solution here is tied to the first problem. If the field had already been whittled down then I\u0027d have less to go through. The second part of this solution is to create a voting ballot to make getting back choices easier for everyone involved; judges and organizers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have other things I\u0027d change, like HOW we know which judges are appropriate, and how the votes are tallied, but these were not true problems this time. I\u0027d just be future proofing against possible problems that we didn\u0027t have yet. I\u0027d rather focus on things I did perceive as problems first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T16:19:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EP.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI welcome any feedback, but we have a year to think this over.

Why not just use the experts to make the final decisions? It\u0027s already been said why that would obviously be way easier than doing both that and getting several dozen people to make votes. As well as why it\u0027s fairer. To be honest, you don\u0027t seem to have much in the way of arguments against that, other than: \u0027I want evidence\u0027 and \u0027I don\u0027t see the problem\u0027. Both of which are demands placed on the system by you Felbourn, the plan doesn\u0027t need statistical proof nor your personal approval to function correctly. What in particular makes you think that your solution is easier and yields better results? It\u0027s a longer and harder process that is prone to more inaccuracies due to voting from people who will likely not all properly evaluate each and every piece of content of every single category. It\u0027s a lot to ask of someone, but any less would be an inaccurate result, wouldn\u0027t you agree? Surely it would be easier to split up that work into one category for one person who is a complete expert and will fairly analyse all the content? Experts who you already have access to, because you needed them to whittle down the nominations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day it\u0027s not your competition man, it doesn\u0027t really matter to the success of the experts system whether \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E like it or not.

These are all the videos and channels that matched the criteria of being made in the last year, and were appropriate to a category rule (so a \u0022tutorial\u0022 category needs to only have tutorials in it and so on). Judges are verified as experts in at least one category, probably more, after perhaps checking out their content, or getting opinions from respected community members.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first step where we differ.

For example, maybe it\u0027s the same 5 of this year, plus Owner, and maybe I throw myself into the mix too. That would be 7 right there. I think we could get 7 easily next year too. So now we all talk amongst ourselves for a little bit and decide which 3 of us will do each category. Let\u0027s give the judges these fake names: Able, Baker, Candice, David, Eddie, Fiona, and Greg. Maybe Able, Baker, Candice do category X. Able, David, Fiona do category Y. Baker, Fiona, Greg to category Z. And so on. Who decides this? The judges themselves decide. If you think you\u0027re the right choice for Artistic, you suggest that, and most likely the other judges will agree. Or if we want to simplify this, another option is you tell Owner and he decides. Or another idea is the judges have a pre-ballot to decide it. If you get someone like me to help (aka someone compulsive and \u0022into\u0022 organizing things heh, and designing systems) then this step can go quite smoothly. (The only rule I\u0027d want to see is no judge in a category where they are a finalist. That\u0027s a conflict of interest since they could not vote for themself without it ruining the credibility of the whole system.) There are many ideas here, and you may have ideas of your own, but the end result is we\u0027d have 3 judges per category.

I think 4 could be a good # of finalists. Not more than 5. You probably want at least 3 so there\u0027s some mystery. So... yea say 3-5 finalists with 4 being the best number. Notice the categories we had this year had well more than 4 finalists. That made things harder. Again there are various options on how to whittle this down, and once again getting anyone who\u0027s good at organizing things [looks at self] would help make this go quite smoothly for the judges. This way the 7 judges have all had a chance to give input, but the final decision is not in the hands of ALL 7. It\u0027s in the hands of the 3 category experts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis step exists in the 1 judge system but of course is simpler. Still, I think the extra effort is worth the credibility gained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4 finalists are voted on by 3 judges, and one winner is selected. Most likely each judge would sort the 4 finalists into an order and give more \u0022points\u0022 to the top videos. For example, just one idea... perhaps you have 4 finalists and you give one of them 3 points, another one gets 2 points, and a third gets 1 point. The max score would therefore be 3\u002B3\u002B3 = 9 points. This is actually how I did it this year. You each ranked the videos and I gave 2 points for your first 1st choice and 1 point for your 2nd choice. The video with the most points won. Anyway, there\u0027s a few ways to do this part too, but the basic idea is you do this in a way that experts are deciding, yet with a lower chance of a tie by scoring. With 3 judges there should not be tie, but if there could be then designate 1 judge as the ultimate decider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have left some of the details above as \u0022it could be this or this or this\u0022 because I\u0027d want time to think, and get feedback.
