Other bodies also have this system but it was most visible on bop. This is a relatively light affect and it adds a lot to the feel of the game, and how pretty it looks, while masking the currently underperforming AA system. It also makes Jool properly shine, and other bodies in the Joolian system have a nice glow to them. BUT the problem is that this isn\u0027t on all bodies in the game. The mun could really use this system to highlight the highlands around the mares of the mun, and make kerbin stand out more in the sky.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTLDR: MAKE BLOOM AFFECT EVERY BODY\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust an idea, let me know what you think of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
