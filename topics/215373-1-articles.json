Nate,\u003Cbr\u003E\nProps to the whole team.\u00A0 Patch 1 has been awesome thus far.\u003Cbr\u003E\nQuestion:\u00A0 What was the thoughts behind making KSP2 this very large thing to do everything rather than focus on making it a solid, extensible framework and let the modders do the heavy lift.\u00A0 I think it\u0027s a given that once KSP2 reaches stability that the modders will be the first to give interstellar, colonization, multi-player and so

opportunity Nate. I always thought the original game struck an awesome balance between realism and fun gameplay. I\u0027m wondering what some of the tougher decisions you\u0027ve had to make with respect to this in KSP2 were and how you went about making them. Also any of the smaller but interesting ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s easy to see the passion that went into the game so far, keep it up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-17T23:24:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2023 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by rjbvre\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
