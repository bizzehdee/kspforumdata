My friend shot nearby him to warn him off... at the same moment I realized he was the server owner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe server owner shot my friend, and then told both of us that our bases were built on major industrial loot spawns (his had low value spawns, mine had a medium and a low) and had 24 hours to get all of our stuff out (which I was doing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to convince my friend to say, tried to tell the owner what happened, and I was intending on asking him to at least teleport my friend back to his base to get his stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this is going on, the chat flares up with the other players trying to figure out if their bases are illegal or not, and what the rules actually are (they had been previously defined as \u0022no construction in major cities, no building in major loot spawns.\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen he defines major loot spawns as \u0022anyplace that spawns more than trash loot.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHAT\u0027S EVERY SPAWN LOCATION IN THE GAME!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe could\u0027ve easily defined it as \u0022any loot spawn,\u0022 but he didn\u0027t, so the server rules seemed almost designed for misinterpretation. They were also largely inaccessible (being located on a website you had to sign up for).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter we stated our opinions more, he perma-banned me, my friend, and the 3 or 4 other people arguing.

I also think there should be rules for what admins can and can\u0027t do, and that every admin and mod needs to know the rules and punishments well. There are too many horror stories of admin abuse, and good small to medium sized servers of practically any game are hard to find unless you or a friend owns them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, arguing with an admin should be encouraged instead of being a crime, to keep the server fair.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-12T00:26:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2014 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Noname117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T20:18:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing banned from a CnC Renegade server for landing 2 headshots shortly after eachother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn two guys that were standing idle on top of the plateau on Walls_Flying.
