I almost missed one, which i only found back because it was on a short-term mission that i remembered about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started an excel spreadsheet where i detail stuff. for every mission that i\u0027m not going to make in one session, i write down the important details. deactivated probes are written down, along with fuel left and science equipment: i packed enough extra fuel that i may be able to recycle them some day (i already discovered one that i could squeeze some more science out of).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI make sure to have every active mission with a planned manuever. even if the manuever is 0 meters, simply a planned node to remind me that i should go check on that mission later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand then i have to sort the manuevers, see which craft is the next one where i have to perform something. this would be rather trivial if i could sort my missions in order of planned next manuever, but if such an option exhist, i did not find it. so i have to look the big list on the tracking station to see which one is scheduled first. Hoping i don\u0027t have two critical manuevers planned at the same time. when i do, hoping that one of the two can be delayed or anticipated a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand in all this, a single distraction, a single forgetting to set up a node before moving to another ship, or not noticing that the game has automatically renamed one of my ships as a relay, could cause me to miss a mission. lost. forgotten. buried in red tape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t expect there to be some holy grail to fix this mess, but i\u0027d like to hear your strategies to cope with too many missions to track\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-18T15:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game is\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esupposed\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0to be mentally challenging! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the basic answer is: if there is some aspect of the base game that you don\u0027t enjoy, then there is always a mod to change it. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E is the one most often used to deal with your issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-18T15:11:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, there is the widely famous mod Kerbal Alarm Clock, which keeps a list of events you need to deal with in order of how close in time they are, and even pulls you out of time warp and pops up remindes when you forget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you still have to remember to set the alert/make the maneuver node.
