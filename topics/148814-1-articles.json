There is also a Phantom force pushing my helpless little rovers off to the side at around 6 m/s. It also sometimes looks as if the rover is floating a couple inches off the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have ensured that there is enough electrical charge, comms sig, and that the wheel motors are oriented correctly.

In terms of the problem happening on a \u0022stock\u0022 install, \u00A0I had simply deleted all the contents from Gamedata and my save, so I guess it wasn\u0027t entirely stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI installed a brand new game and the rovers worked fine. I THEN installed half of my 73 mods which again broke the rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to delete that install and re-install KSP again fresh. I began copying mods over in groups of 5, and starting KSP each time, a new group of 5 were installed, all the way to the exact half that I had copied over before. I could not get a single mod to break the rovers. After that half got installed, I then started copying over the other half in groups of 10. Still, nothing broke the rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy original save file was lastly copied over and the rovers are still functioning just fine. Mission accomplished.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JohnWittle","CreatedById":153557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-02T10:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you post your output_log.txt? It\u0027s inside the \u0022KSP_Data\u0022 or \u0022KSP_x64_Data\u0022 folder, depending on which version of KSP you are running. Try to post everything after you load the launch pad or runway scene if you can, but ideally upload the whole log.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust as a tip, wheels in KSP 1.1.x do not work very well at all; the updated wheel physics in 1.1 improved things but it\u0027s still a sad situation. The \u0022Stock Bug Fix Modules \u0026amp; Stock Plus\u0022 mod by Claw (one of the KSP developers) does a pretty good job at getting wheels to sort of work well enough to be usable; I recommend you install it and select the Wheels module (actually, all of the modules are good and generally make the game a much smoother experience, the mod is meant to fix the problems which the KSP team feels aren\u0027t worth putting out a whole new release to fix, or where the fix code is haphazard and they want to wait for a better solution before pushing it to stock). Who knows? It might fix your problem on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
