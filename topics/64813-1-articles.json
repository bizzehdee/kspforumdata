I have been working on a nice large carrier hull because I am tired of FPS drops and having to build them with hundreds of panels. Apparently the inside of the model is always missing no matter which way I flip the normals. I have just noticed that out of habit I have made the inside a separate material. I am going to try to separate the inside mesh form the outside and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeels kind of crazy to have a problem like this after my animation worked flawlessly on the first attempt and everything else is generally going to plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a question about how to get the part context menu in the VAB like on the new landing legs. That way The cargo bay doors can be opened in the VAB. I have done pretty well just reading all the info required to do pretty much anything I need to be able to do. But the documentation on this seems to be unavailable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Payload","CreatedById":4540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T22:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yea, that was definitely the problem. Separated out the mesh and it works just fine now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you have a choice to use all of the same materials on a single mesh or to separate the mesh and use more than one material. This kinds sucks though. I generally generate procedural textures using a lot of material trickery and then bake them. I guess I can still so that I just need to be sure to leave most of that for last after the model has been processed in Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T00:45:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you just looking for a way to have textures on both sides of the mesh? You can just select everything that you want two-sided, duplicate it, and switch the normals on one set.

That\u0027s what gives you the ability to right click on something in the VAB. I\u0027m not sure about making it permanent (like launching with landing legs extended).

There are no problems with normals. I set the inside of the mesh to have a separate material than the outside. I just had to separate the two parts. No problems all is well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly there is a way to setup VAB toggles without a plugin. The stock parts do it. I was just asking if anyone knows how to do that. I would like to be able to open the bay doors in the VAB. You can just clip inside and place anything you want inside with no problems but I would still like the option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T02:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Payload\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Payload\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EClearly there is a way to setup VAB toggles without a plugin.
