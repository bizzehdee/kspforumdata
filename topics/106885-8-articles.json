Yea, it was first challenge that I personally really enjoyed ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) When you have decouplers and RT-10 Hammers there is not a challenge to gain speed, but to break your speed enough to deploy chutes is challenging. And you are not having drogue chutes or dedicated aero-brakes to do the task.\n\nGoogle replied that most ppl goes orbital and not performing dedicated suborbital flight. But I have found multiple solutions.\n\n1. Add girder segment just behind your cockpit. It produces drag heavy enough to stop a 1.5-tonn ship falling steep on Kerbin to deploy chutes. But it also symmetrically produces drag during lift so you need more powerful booster.\n\n2. Add more power to hit 70 km height in more easy trajectory so your path through dense lower atmosphere is longer and enough to brake. But again - add more boosters.\n\n3. I don\u0027t like that \u0027add more power\u0027 idea when I recognize that what I already have is powerful enough. So I personally carefully designed that craft on the picture. It has slightly aerodynamically unstable upper-stage so mk1 cockpit\u0027s flywheels have enough power to interrupt that nose-down descend and effectively break with all the broadside. You can achieve less than 100 m/s speed during final few thousand meters that is overkill. Piloting that craft is tricky and the whole thing was very fun ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nOf course, when you have control surfaces later on you can effectively brake while exceeding maximum angle of attack.

Currently, it looks like there are two obvious paths.  The first is the beginner\u0027s path, which follows the contracts.  The second is the NASA path, which follows the abilities of the rockets (the \u0022milestone\u0022 bonuses help build this path).  My main issue is with the \u0022beginner\u0027s path\u0022, mainly because it wants to go to Mun first, and also because that it puts an artificial \u0022450k Mun-tax\u0022 to block you from a kerballed landing (and soil sample).  \n\n**The \u0022NASA path\u0022 [how I ran this game]:**\n\n[optional] probes to Minmus/Mun (strongly recommend for beginners) [make sure you have thermometers and barometers before going to Duna].\n\nprobes to Duna/Eve (barely any more delta-v than Minmus/Mun, but complications and need for external websites  and examples make them less than beginner friendly).  [Duna unlocked ~500 science, and I botched the landing.]\n\nkerballed mission to Minmus [monster/unwieldy kicker plus 2 liquid stages and tons of delta-v gave me 5 different landings on Minmus (not beginner friendly, especially that rocket.  Still had pretty wasteful landings) full science dance=\u003E3000 science.]\n\nkerballed mission to Mun [quit before this.  Basically the tech tree is unlocked enough to no longer be \u0022starting out\u0022]\n\nHowever, the contract system gives us these in roughly the opposite order.  To add to the injury, the cost to unlock soil samples is 450k funds, which is quite a lot at that level (but you should cover it after a Duna probe).  There isn\u0027t much point landing a kerbal on Mun/Minmus without unlocking this level.\n\nThis might not be much of a bug.  You probably need to learn enough about orbital mechanics via \u0022put a satellite in this orbit\u0022 missions to go to the Mun by the time you can afford the soil samples.  My real objection is putting Mun first, mostly because the lack of flat areas and the high delta-v requirements (landing on Minmus is beginner friendly, not so Mun).  Note that NASA fired Mariners1-7 (all to Mars) before launching Apollo-11 (to Moon).  The Soviets fired plenty of interplanetary probes in that time as well (but presumably they knew the issues and were willing to do \\*lots\\* of hand/slipstick calculating on paper)."},{"CreatedByName":"Entropiated","CreatedById":143248,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T21:19:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2/5/2016 at 3:08 AM, nosirrbro said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Welp, I think I will definantly stay with sandbox, career is really only for those which are relatively new and have difficulty setting and having fun with their own goals, as a way to introduce first timers to all of the parts in a sensible mannar, or for anybody who loves to grind for a long time until they get to the sandbox point, where it just turns to sandbox where you get told mission ideas, many of which are weird, boring, tedious and often confusing.\u0022\n\u003E \n\nWas it really necessary to slag off those people who happen to enjoy career mode?

Gives the game some structure, and it presents challenges that just aren\u0027t there for me in the sandbox mode. My only complaint so far, and this only happened to me yesterday, is about the impossible contracts that pop up. I\u0027ve had DIFFICULT contracts come up before, but always found a way to complete them. But yesterday I got a contract to \u0022Test a launch clamp while flying over Kerbin.\u0022 Stupidly, I accepted it, thinking the moment of rocket launch would count as \u0022flying.\u0022 WRONG. As far as I can tell, this mission is impossible because you can\u0027t just attach launch clamps to your craft without them automatically being bolted to the ground. Eventually I had to drop the contract and just take the hit in funds and reputation. Word of caution to anybody playing career mode: do not accept this contract."}]}
