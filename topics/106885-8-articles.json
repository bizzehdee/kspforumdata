I don\u0027t like that \u0027add more power\u0027 idea when I recognize that what I already have is powerful enough. So I personally carefully designed that craft on the picture. It has slightly aerodynamically unstable upper-stage so mk1 cockpit\u0027s flywheels have enough power to interrupt that nose-down descend and effectively break with all the broadside. You can achieve less than 100 m/s speed during final few thousand meters that is overkill.

I began the grind, and it just really lost me. I left, came back in a few hours, and finished off the grind, finally completing the mission. It was rewarding, but then I noticed that I would need to restart the cycle and add in the grind. Thats when I stopped. I could have kept going on, and eventually the grind with occasional fun mission would stop and just have missions, but at that point it only happens because I unlocked most of the tech tree and upgraded everything, at which point it becomes essentially sandbox except because I still have funds I am discuraged to make more roleplay oriented craft, my favorite kind of craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelp, I think I will definantly stay with sandbox, career is really only for those which are relatively new and have difficulty setting and having fun with their own goals, as a way to introduce first timers to all of the parts in a sensible mannar, or for anybody who loves to grind for a long time until they get to the sandbox point, where it just turns to sandbox where you get told mission ideas, many of which are weird, boring, tedious and often confusing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-05T07:09:18Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2016 07:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by nosirrbro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"suicidejunkie","CreatedById":155878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T17:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I haven\u0027t bothered with non- career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake only the contracts that sound fun or can be added to what you were going to do anyways, and you\u0027re golden.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoney is no object once you\u0027ve got the T3 science labs paid for, but the simple existence of that number is important psychologically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main trick would be finding good difficulty settings, and I\u0027m thinking I need to scale the finances down more (Building costs are too high compared to the rockets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T18:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222395267\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022106885\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454694655\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155878\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022suicidejunkie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n25 minutes ago, suicidejunkie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main trick would be finding good difficulty settings, and I\u0027m thinking I need to scale the finances down more (Building costs are too high compared to the rockets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I remember right, the Funding Penalty slider controls building costs.

\u00A0Since starting with the science unlocks, it seems that they have made it more for experienced KSP hands to have new goals with KSP. \u00A0Once they added the part limits (and made things like the \u0022open the tech tree in two missions\u0022 effectively impossible, it seems like it is more for beginners. \u00A0Currently, it looks like there are two obvious paths. \u00A0The first is the beginner\u0027s path, which follows the contracts. \u00A0The second is the NASA path, which follows the abilities of the rockets (the \u0022milestone\u0022 bonuses help build this path). \u00A0My main issue is with the \u0022beginner\u0027s path\u0022, mainly because it wants to go to Mun first, and also because that it puts an artificial \u0022450k Mun-tax\u0022 to block you from a kerballed

probes to Minmus/Mun (strongly recommend for beginners) [make sure you have thermometers and barometers before going to Duna].\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nprobes to Duna/Eve (barely any more delta-v than Minmus/Mun, but complications and need for external websites \u00A0and examples make them less than beginner friendly). \u00A0[Duna unlocked ~500 science, and I botched the landing.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nkerballed mission to Minmus [monster/unwieldy kicker plus 2 liquid stages and tons of delta-v gave me 5\u00A0different landings on Minmus (not beginner

\u00A0To add to the injury, the cost to unlock soil samples is 450k funds, which is quite a lot at that level (but you should cover it after a Duna probe). \u00A0There isn\u0027t much point landing a kerbal on Mun/Minmus without unlocking this level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might not be much of a bug. \u00A0You probably need to learn enough about orbital mechanics via \u0022put a satellite in this orbit\u0022 missions to go to the Mun by the time you can afford the soil samples. \u00A0My real objection is putting Mun first, mostly because the lack of flat areas and the high delta-v requirements (landing on Minmus is beginner friendly, not so Mun). \u00A0Note that NASA fired Mariners1-7 (all to Mars) before launching Apollo-11 (to Moon). \u00A0The Soviets\u00A0fired plenty of interplanetary probes in that time as well (but presumably they knew the issues and were willing to do *lots* of hand/slipstick calculating on
