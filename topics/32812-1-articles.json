But, unfortunately for me I do actually want to build some sort of a reusable space plane for future mission. And so I decided to try piloting, and building my own plane. The following video is the results of that decision:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rV-hIDZRGOk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you all enjoyed the vidoe, and I would of course love any feedback/suggestion on flying or any plane design tips you may have.

Also - you need to kill\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BB\u00C2\u00BF engines earlier, 100m/s is hardly a healthy speed for landing. I\u0027m not a good pilot either so I just add a lot of wings so I can glide at 40 m/s just above ground almost indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use only the SPH for all my designs and it is HARD to balance all 4 force centers with only 1 plane of symmetry. So do expect twitchiness unless the craft is fine-tuned empirically. Getting a reusable spaceplane took me a week of hard work. Check out my tutorial on balancing, it might help:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33681-Jods-list-of-aerodynamics-issues\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33681-Jods-list-of-aerodynamics-issues\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kottabos","CreatedById":36583,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T13:12:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the additional info Jod, and thanks for the tutorial link a lot of helpful stuff.
