Sorry if the report is long and gets a bit messy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt started as a nanocristalline diamond caveman (parts 1-6, there\u0027s no strict need to read those), and when I needed an interplanetary mission to finish I decided to go big and do a Jool 5. So I started building a big mothership, which required well over 100 launched and capped at 530 tons and 900 parts. (parts 7-15). Then part 16 is the trip to Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy original plan was running the Jool 5 as part of the NCD challenge (which includes a no reload policy), but I immediately lost the Tylo lander. At that point, to avoid jeopardizing the NCD challenge, I decided to skip the difficult landings and just do a reduced mission (Parts 17-21) - luckily I included a backup lander pod for such an occurrence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, completed the NCD, I reloaded back to just arrived at Jool, and I did the Jool 5 with some reloads (parts 22-26). Technically you don\u0027t need to read parts 17-21, as those are not part of the Jool 5 continuity; except that I referenced stuff from them, as in \u0022I brough Navis Sideralis Neanderthalensis back to Pol in the same way as described already\u0022, so I think they can be confusing if one has not read parts 17-21.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a third level Jool 5, the second submission in caveman (if I didn\u0027t miss anything), the first with commnet enabled (basically means, no kerbal on a ladder, had to use the heaviest pods for everything). I also got 11395 science that could deserve a mention in the Jeb level; it\u0027s a pittance over what can be achieved there, but it was still quite complicated to achieve, as science jr and goo cannot be refreshed and I had to bring 20 expendable containers to run those experiments (almost) everywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongratulations \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204876\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@king of nowhere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0on completing the Jool 5 Challenge!

I\u0027d be glad to go into the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe challenge here was to land the Jool-5 using only one engine. I decided to not go with a mammoth \u002B mining setup because I don\u0027t like mining, so the obvious choice was the Rapier (Rapier craft have a max payload fraction somewhere between 50 and 60 percent, but a Mammoth can get maybe 25% if you\u0027re lucky).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main design constraint here was to get a craft that could do the Tylo landing using one Rapier engine. I decided pretty early on that a single stage design would be really massive and maybe not even possible, so I came up with something pretty similar to the final craft - having a single drop tank that\u0027s dropped on descent, detaching more tanks with EVA construction on the Tylo surface, and doing the ascent on one stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother design constraint was to get a plane that would be balanced with cargo and without cargo. Normally this would mean putting the engines and cargo at the center of mass, but this obviously wasn\u0027t possible. This meant that I had to deal with some center of mass shifting between ascent and descent. I minimized this by using the fuel tank cage design that you see in the final mission, so the payload can fit between the Oscar tanks and sit nearly at the center of mass. This made docking a bit harder, but it made the ascents much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane itself is a pretty standard root fairing body \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, except the fairing is wide so it can fit the payloads. I always use the Big-S wing strakes for a craft because they have a free fuel tank, which saves some dry mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow for the actual mission:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI launch six modules into low Kerbin orbit - five fuel tanks and one service module (containing a probe core, the Tylo drop tank, and some liquid fuel for Laythe). I probably could have gone with four fuel tanks instead of five, but I wanted to be safe. The first and most of the second fuel tanks are used for a Mun transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe path to Jool is similar to what I normally take. I use gravity assists off of Mun to get an encounter with Minmus, use Minmus to increase Mun relative velocity, and use Mun to eject into a resonant orbit of Kerbin. Then, I pass by Kerbin and Mun one more time to get enough energy to get an encounter with a different planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried a different gravity assist route after getting the final boost from Mun, just because I wanted to have a little fun with it. I went Kerbin-Duna-Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin-Jool, as I\u0027ve never seen anyone use a Duna assist while outbound to Jool. Normally you would use an Eve assist instead, but it\u0027s not actually that much more effective because your Duna/Eve relative velocity is pretty low on the first encounter, so you don\u0027t make full use of Eve\u0027s deeper gravity well. Additionally, Duna\u0027s inclination relative to Kerbin is smaller, so it\u0027s easier to set up an assist in the first place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon encountering Jool, I use an assist from Tylo to capture around Jool, then Laythe and Vall assists to put me onto a Tylo intercept with very low relative velocity (~6 m/s capture burn). I leave three full fuel tanks in elliptical Tylo orbit and take the mostly-drained fuel module through a Vall assist to aerobrake around Laythe. Then, I leave it in elliptical Laythe orbit. This will again enable extremely small transfer burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the Laythe landing, I pull off all the unnecessary parts from the craft using EVA construction, transfer to the fuel tank, and pull as much fuel as I can from it. Then. I do the Vall landing before transferring to Tylo. The reason for this is that a Vall-\u0026gt;Tylo transfer needs much less of a capture burn than Laythe-\u0026gt;Tylo, and I have enough fuel to do the Vall landing without needing to drag another fuel tank along with me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Tylo landing is the hardest part of the mission. I take two fuel modules down to low Tylo orbit (in retrospect I probably could have used just one) and then do the Tylo landing. Then I bring the fuel tanks back to an elliptical Tylo orbit and dock with the final fuel tank in elliptical Tylo orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other two landings are pretty trivial, as I don\u0027t do any fancy docking stuff again. I did do multiple Pol flybys to correct inclination and relative velocity, but I had enough spare fuel to not need this and this was just for fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve got any more questions about it, please let me know!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JacobJHC","CreatedById":152333,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-10T01:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224110415\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172495\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221648890702\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207172\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022camacju\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/2/2022 at 5:11 AM, camacju said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzwbNFPQago?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe single engine Jool-5 is finally complete!
