All those flags we planted ! Was it all for nothing ?\u0022*\n\n*- Bob Kerman to Ike, the Sun, and the leprechaun on his shoulder*.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT : I have changed the title of this thread. I first thought it was a specific compatibility issue between KSP 0.90 and 1.0. But it appears to be a more general, corrupted savegame issue, as I\u0027ve read people reporting the same problem when they switched to 0.90 a few monthes ago.\n\u003E \n\u003E Actually, I do not know if a version upgrade is more likely to break .sfs files. I\u0027ve found out that the corrupted data (that I had to fix to pursue my career in KSP 1.0) were already there in my 0.90 saves... And it worked fine then.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, a workaround has been found. I hope it can help anyone struggling with the same issue.\n\nHello everyone,\n\n(something more close to a proper bug report below these few lines)\n\nI haven\u0027t seen much people on the forum reporting issues after loading their 0.90 savegames in KSP 1.0. Maybe most have started a new career, or maybe, and hopefully, everything worked fine for all of you who wanted to continue with a game created before the 1.0 update.\n\nWe\u0027ve had a few immediate issues here when we loaded our 0.90 savegame. Three issues, actually. The first two aren\u0027t that bad after all. I\u0027ll mention them just in case they may be related and could help finding a solution to the third and more annoying one.\n\n**1)** **Valentina did not show up at the astronaut complex** **.**\n\nWell it\u0027s not surprising, and it\u0027s ok, I can add her manually to the ROSTER section of the .sfs file.\n\n**2) A few vessels are unselectable in the tracking station, and thus unflyable.**\n\nAll are manned vehicles : a station orbiting Minimumsmn (what, that\u0027s exactly what I said, \u0022Misniminimusm\u0022) and two large mobile bases on the surface of the Mun. I found an in-game workaround for this, but perhaps there\u0027s a quicker way. I may start a new thread about it.\n\n**3) Everything goes wrong at the astronaut complex.**\n\nThat\u0027s the main issue and the subject of this thread. This is really threatening our career : a wrong maximum number of active kerbals is displayed, it\u0027s impossible to recruit kerbals and kerbalettes, eventually the building becomes unaccessible. Also, only a few of the kerbals on duty appear in the \u0022assigned\u0022 section.\n\nWhile I know we have never been assured that a savegame would be compatible with a later release, everyone at home feels a bit sad right now at the idea of abandoning the career we started 6 monthes ago.\n\nLet\u0027s be honest, we\u0027re totally depressed. Plume locked herself in an Oscar-B tank and has been refusing to come out for days.\n\nAny hint that could help us pursue our mission, - make our kerbals proliferate in every corner of the system like hordes of euphoric muppets -, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers !\n\n(starting now with the appropriate report)\n\n--\n\n**Operating System :** Windows 7 64-bit\n\n**KSP version :** 1.0.2.842 32-bit\n\n**Mods / Add-Ons :** All stock\n\n**What happens :** After loading a 0.90 savegame (career mode) in KSP 1.0, everything goes wrong at the astronaut complex :\n\n- Wrong numbers of active \u0026 maximum active kerbals displayed. (\u002210 out of 12\u0022, as if the building was at level 2, though it is level 3).\n\n- kerbals and kerbalettes can not be recruited.\n\n- After exiting the building, it is impossible to enter it again.\n\n- only a part of the kerbals currently on duty are displayed in the \u0022assigned\u0022 section, though they are still here and there, on EVAs or aboard vessels.\n\n**Logs and save files :**\n\nHere\u0027s a link to the last persistent file of our game, created in version 0.90, before it was loaded in KSP 1.0 : [persistent_(before).sfs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7up8rltymm3xedf/persistent_%28before%29.sfs?dl=0)\n\nHere\u0027s a link to the updated persistent file, created after the first one was loaded in KSP 1.0 : [persistent_(after).sfs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7bvssj0u44avdco/persistent_%28after%29.sfs?dl=0)\n\nAnd here\u0027s the [output.log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ive5nwisyic5m3v/output_log.txt?dl=0).\n\n**Steps that can be reproduced :**\n\n**1) Take the** [**persistent\\_(before).sfs**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7up8rltymm3xedf/persistent_%28before%29.sfs?dl=0) **file and load it in KSP 1.0.2**\n\n**2) Check the astronaut complex building level**.\n\nIt is displayed as a fully upgraded, level 3 building with an unlimited capacity of kerbonauts, as shown on the capture below.\n\nI have checked the persistent file before and after loading the savegame. The building level value is correctly set to 1.\n\n[![719257KSPissuesv090to10astronautcomplex0.jpg](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/719257KSPissuesv090to10astronautcomplex0.jpg)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=719257KSPissuesv090to10astronautcomplex0.jpg)\n\n**3) Enter the astronaut complex**.\n\nAnd things go wrong. See cap below.\n\n[![510296KSPissuesv090to10astronautcomplex1.jpg](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/510296KSPissuesv090to10astronautcomplex1.jpg)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=510296KSPissuesv090to10astronautcomplex1.jpg)\n\n(note : oh hey ! we can recruit \u0022Mind\u0022 Kerman.)\n\nPlease take note that we have a total of 71 kerbals. 14 are available and learning how to braid macram\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 out of optical fibers at the KSC. 57 are currently assigned. Noone\u0027s missing.\n\nActive crews window : There\u0027s no number displayed in each state tab. The 14 available kerbals are all listed (you can\u0027t see that on the cap, but it\u0027s ok). However, the \u0022assigned\u0022 tab only shows 8 kerbals, the crew of a single vessel, \u0022Station Le Futu\u0027 2000\u0022. Yet I checked, and the rest of them are up there, in their vehicules or on EVAs.\n\n(Everyone appears in the new persistent file as well. And it seems that existing kerbals have been updated : the new, gender information is here.)\n\nIt is stated that the maximum number of active kerbals is 12, as if the building was at level 2. The current number of active kerbals,10, is also wrong.\n\nApplicants window : New kerbals and kerbalettes are here, but can\u0027t be recruited. Hiring cost is incorrect : 0 kredit (kerbit ?). Clicking an applicant has no effect.\n\n**4) Exit the astronaut complex and try to enter it again**.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t work. Every time I leave the astronaut complex, I have to exit to the main menu and reload to be able to get in. \n\n**5) See what happens when an available kerbal is dismissed.**\n\nLooks like this puts things back in order, but it\u0027s only temporary. See picture.\n\n[![727676KSPissuesv090to10astronautcomplex2.jpg](http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/727676KSPissuesv090to10astronautcomplex2.jpg)](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=727676KSPissuesv090to10astronautcomplex2.jpg)\n\nNumbers of available, assigned and missing kerbals are now displayed and correct. Same for the total number of active kerbals.\n\nThere\u0027s a hire cost now, and kerbals can be recruited.\n\nIt didn\u0027t bring back the crew members that weren\u0027t listed in the \u0022assigned\u0022 tab, though.\n\nThe problem is, every time I exit the buiding, it still gets unaccessible. Again, I have to quit to the main menu and reload to be able to get in. And then, unfortunately, the building goes back to the state described at step 3 : the maximum number of active kerbals is back to 12, it is impossible to recruit applicants, and so on.\n\n--\n\nWell, I most certainly need your help.\n\nAnd thanks for reading me !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T20:55:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 08:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Plume \u0026 Akakak**"},{"CreatedByName":"astronautjustin","CreatedById":142973,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T00:58:22Z","Content":"I think I see part of your problem, your persistent doesn\u0027t have your kerbals in it, it should, unless I\u0027m missing it.

Remember that the first seat is always \u00220\u0022, not \u00221\u0022. If you have 4 kerbals inside a Hitchhiker Storage Container, for example, their respective idx should be \u00220\u0022, \u00221\u0022, \u00222\u0022 and \u00223\u0022.\n\n--\n\nThere\u0027s possibly an exception for the kerbals that are assigned, but on EVA (including the ones in external command seats). In my save file, their idx was set to \u0022-1\u0022. I didn\u0027t change it to \u00220\u0022. Everything works fine, though, so I don\u0027t know, maybe \u0022-1\u0022 is a valid idx for a kerbonaut on EVA.\n\n--\n\nAnd that\u0027s it. Going through my whole roster and fixing the idx values saved my career.\n\nThe \u0022active crews: 10 (max: 12)\u0022 message is gone, everyone is here under the assigned tab, I can recruit kerbonauts again. And in the Tracking Station, I can now access the ships that were previously unselectable and unflyable.\n\nHope this will help.\n\nCheers\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T02:29:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 02:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Plume \u0026 Akakak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sheppard","CreatedById":93282,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:15:12Z","Content":"I have the same problem \u002B one more inconvenience: I\u0027m missing Valentina from my old 0.90 save game.

Then exit the game. The new persistent file you\u0027ll find in the \u0022saves\u0022 folder of KSP 1.0.x is the one you\u0027ll have to modify.\n\nDon\u0027t change your original 0.90 savegame. Always keep it untouched somewhere, or keep a clean copy of it.\n\nNow yes, it is definitely laborious to go through your whole ROSTER (list of kerbals) and then search for all the ship parts the assigned kerbals are seated in.\n\nI wish you good luck. Hopefully you\u0027ll be able to continue your career. Let me know if this worked for you.\n\n--\n\nA thought : now I notice that all the wrong idx values I had to correct for assigned crew belonged to kerbals seated in Mobile Processing Labs.\n\nThe fact that the Mobile Processing Lab had no Intra-Vehicular Activity view prior to 1.0 may be a reason.\n\nA few other ship parts had no IVA view in 0.90 (like the MK3 Passenger Cabin) and may cause similar issues. But I can\u0027t confirm. Mobile Processing Labs were the only \u0022no-IVA\u0022, manned parts I had in flight.\n\n--\n\nFor Valentina, it\u0027s not a big deal actually. Indeed, you just have to add her to the ROSTER section of your persistent file.\n\nTo know what lines you should add and where, start a new career game, then immediatly exit the game.\n\nOpen the persistent file of that new career in a text editor.\n\nSearch for the ROSTER section (CTRL\u002BF in NotePad, look for \u0022ROSTER\u0022).\n\nScroll down, you\u0027ll see Jeb, Bill, Bob, and below Bob you\u0027ll find Valentina.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E KERBAL\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  name = Bob Kerman\n\u003E \n\u003E  gender = Male\n\u003E \n\u003E  type = Crew\n\u003E \n\u003E  brave = 0.3\n\u003E \n\u003E  dumb = 0.1\n\u003E \n\u003E  badS = False\n\u003E \n\u003E  tour = False\n\u003E \n\u003E  state = Available\n\u003E \n\u003E  ToD = 0\n\u003E \n\u003E  idx = -1\n\u003E \n\u003E  CAREER\\_LOG\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  flight = 0\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E  FLIGHT\\_LOG\n\u003E \n\u003E  {\n\u003E \n\u003E  flight = 0\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E  }\n\u003E \n\u003E  **KERBAL**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **{**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **name = Valentina Kerman**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **gender = Female**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **type = Crew**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **brave = 0.55**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **dumb = 0.4**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **badS = True**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **tour = False**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **state = Available**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **ToD = 0**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **idx = -1**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **CAREER\\_LOG**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **{**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **flight = 0**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **}**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **FLIGHT\\_LOG**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **{**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **flight = 0**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **}**\n\u003E \n\u003E  **}**\n\nAll you have to do is copy Valentina\u0027s lines (bolded here) and paste them in the ROSTER section of your cherished career save file.\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"Icallix","CreatedById":170481,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-19T20:05:23Z","Content":"Hey guys, my astronauts disappeared and then I made this process.
