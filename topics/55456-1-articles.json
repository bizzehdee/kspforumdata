Ever since, they\u0027ve had at least one \u0022novelty\u0022 vehicle that they included, usually more--a vehicle that\u0027s not really a great racing vehicle, but is just there because it\u0027s fun to drive, or it\u0027s cool, or it has a place in history (like GT4 having the 1886 Daimler Motor Carriage, the 1886 Benz Patent Motor Wagen, and the 1914 Model T in it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, it was a twofold thing--first, they were planning to do a fairly detailed model of the moon for their upgraded sky model, using SELENE elevation map data to do it. And then they were talking with their friends at GM (they\u0027ve had a close relationship there ever since GM decided to use GT5 DLC for viral marketing of the newest Corvette) and found out that GM not only contributed heavily to the LRV, but actually now owns the legal IP rights to it. Someone said, \u0022Hey, guys, why don\u0027t we bring the LRV in so you can drive it on the moon?\u0022, and thus this was born. (They chose to make the driving area the Apollo 15 EVA route because 15 had the best scenery and most interesting driving conditions up there in the mountains.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd note the detail level--if you look closely, you\u0027ll see that they even modeled the field repair (using a map and a clamp) of the bottom of the left front fender, as done in real life on the Apollo 15 LRV. (All three flown LRVs ended up with broken fenders, all fixed the same way--but a different fender each time.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T13:37:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMany electric sports cars have sound generators that play into the speakers to give sense of speed/power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tobmaster","CreatedById":57953,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T14:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts actually surprisingly fun launching off hills on the moon with the LRV...
