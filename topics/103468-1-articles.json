This isn\u0027t my install. :S\n\nI\u0027m crashing on boot from a client that worked yesterday. I booted KSP in offline mode on steam once and now it is broken. I verify the game cache and steam says one file needs to be redownloaded and then does nothing. When I load the game it gets all the way through the loading screen but never makes it to the title screen.\n\nMods installed are CollisionFX, one that adds mk3 plane parts, and one that adds a giant reactor type engine, and maybe one or two more. All seemed to be pretty popular when the guy that uses this installed them, but he doesn\u0027t remember and I don\u0027t play modded. If anyone knows how to check this that would be great.\n\nCrash dump is 2MB, will not paste anywhere. What part do you guys need? I\u0027d love to upload as an attachment but I don\u0027t see that option.\n\nKSP version is 0.90, windows is 8.1 home, running a 4670k, 8GB RAM, and a R9 280x on the Omega drivers.\n\nIf you need anything else let me know."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T20:52:54Z","Content":"Hi,\n\nPlease provide us with the output\\_log.txt and the error.log (which will be found in the crash folder [the one with the date of the crash and some numbers - it will usually be above the GameData folder] here C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program).
