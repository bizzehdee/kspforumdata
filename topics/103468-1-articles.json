This isn\u0027t my install. :S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m crashing on boot from a client that worked yesterday. I booted KSP in offline mode on steam once and now it is broken. I verify the game cache and steam says one file needs to be redownloaded and then does nothing. When I load the game it gets all the way through the loading screen but never makes it to the title screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods installed are CollisionFX, one that adds mk3 plane parts, and one that adds a giant reactor type engine, and maybe one or two more. All seemed to be pretty popular when the guy that uses this installed them, but he doesn\u0027t remember and I don\u0027t play modded. If anyone knows how to check this that would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrash dump is 2MB, will not paste anywhere. What part do you guys need?
