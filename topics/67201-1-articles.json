Once you\u0027ve aligned your orbital plane (see previous posts), the easiest way to get an efficient burn is to set a prograde burn until it just touches the orbit of Minmus and the rendezvous markers show up. Then, drag the maneuver node along your orbit to bring the markers together. If your starting orbit is eccentric, you may have to add prograde/retrograde thrust to keep it barely touching Minmus\u0027s orbit.

I went to Mun orbit and from there to Minimus orbit. I don\u0027t think I bothered with changing the plane of the orbit at all as I got the rendevous popping up. Quite a mess of confusing lines there for a born again Kerbal noob. And there\u0027s not much fine control on the engine thrust when the orbits are at extremes but I really enjoy the navigating.

It takes quite a bit of dV (about 220) compared to the transfer burn. (about 930)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do is start with a fairly circular orbit them make a maneuver node and drag the prograde handle till the AP is a bit past the orbit of minmus. Then I move the node by the circular base untill my projected path intercepts minmus as seen from above in the map view. You should be about a quarter orbit in front of minmus\u0027s current position.
