Other than the announcement of PS4/Xbone version coming which will require some understanding of GPGPU offloading to even hope of running off their measly processors as it is now, I\u0027m not seeing much going on around the development anymore so I decided it\u0027s time to ask what is/isn\u0027t going to happen anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance there have been a number of features planned or considered that have come and gone over the years, it\u0027s been a very long time since we even heard anything about some of these ideas and they are on a list of *not to be mentioned* items. Now that\u0027s all well and good except the game has been in full release for a while and we\u0027ve never really been given much of an update on what may or may not be planned and the restriction makes discussion difficult. So instead of directly discussing one of those ideas I want to ask in general, what happened to all of the ideas that never came to be, for instance enhanced IVA was something that never truly got announced as planned but hoped for, but it\u0027s likely a huge challenge given the game system we have. (kerbal size v rocket size) I\u0027m guessing it would be safe to assume that this will not be making it into KSP and would only be remotely possible if a sequel were to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut others have gone unmentioned for a very long time despite being possible within the games scope as is, for instance the second gas giant planned to for Eeloo to orbit. Is this ever coming or has this been abandoned? I feel like Eeloo has been sitting alone for rather too long now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese and many of other features have been mentioned in the past but all have faded into obscurity over time. Perhaps I\u0027m also rather out of the loop, but me and my friend would often take breaks and have no trouble finding the info on what is coming, when it\u0027s coming and how it may effect the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps someone here can enlighten me and maybe I\u0027ve missed tonnes of info on what\u0027s planned. (no I don\u0027t mean the dev updates, I always read them)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a long time fan of the game I\u0027m having difficulty coming back without being bored fast due to the lack of any particularly major content updates. DLC was talked about in the past so perhaps any possible ideas have been mentioned?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T17:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDevs refuse to state what their plan is, so there\u0027s no way to figure out what they\u0027re thinking for the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rationale for this is that if they say \u0022We want to have feature \u0026lt;X\u0026gt; in the game\u0022, and later find out they cannot implement it, people will get their panties in such a wad that there will be some sort of massive player rebellion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-20T18:29:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2015 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by razark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T18:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure we already had a player rebellion of sorts around the whole 1.0 fiasco and the end result appears to have been a period of uproar on the forums followed by players either grudgingly accepting the game for what it is and using mods to fix things they don\u0027t like or just simply vanishing off the forums while they play other games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, as razark said, Squad has been very hesitant to say anything about their plans for the game beyond the next update (multiplayer and console ports being an exception) so we really don\u0027t know where they want to take the game or what happened to a lot of those features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been some efforts with mods to implement some of the features you mentioned, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118643\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eespecially the planets\u003C/a\u003E.

I guess I\u0027ve just become so used to being disappointed by other early access projects that a bit of disappointment here or there is worth it to me as long as I have a good idea what is still to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, whatever happens with the content from here on out, I really hope this won\u0027t be a one off and that perhaps we can see where KSP may go in the future one day (sequel). I do still feel that a major content update though would benefit the game hugely and regain some of the attention the game has been slowly for a long time now, or at least it appears, I could of course be wrong in my assumption there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T02:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe question posed in the OP is regarding what happened to the features that were widely circulated and discussed throughout the community a year ago that have not been implemented.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike what?
