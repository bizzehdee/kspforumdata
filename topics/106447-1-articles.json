For example, I\u0027ve just docked a ship to my station and I\u0027m wondering which kerbals I should transfer over for my next mission.. but I\u0027ve no idea who is what career or level. Is there a way to see this information in the stock game, or a mod that anyone recommends?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:02:30Z","Content":"If you go to map view, while focusing on your ship, click on the button middle right of the screen to display info on your ship, there should a sub-menu there displaying info on Kerbonauts on board.\n\nNot sure though if level or career is shown."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T01:24:37Z","Content":"The map screen does show profession and level. But I do wish there was a way to tell at a glance.\n\nI\u0027d love it if each type had a different colored stripe or helmet or something, and each level gained put a star somewhere on the Kerbal as well."}]}
