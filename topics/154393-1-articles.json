I\u0027ve got a problem that\u0027s preventing me from completing one of my projects. I\u0027m building a off-shore drilling platform. When Vehicles land on the platform, I want to refuel them with a small vehicle that disconnects from the platform and connects with the landed vehicle. However, when I disconnect the\u00A0Clamp-O-Tron Jr, the refueling vehicle gets launched up to 1,000 meters straight up in the air. If I move the wheels up so they aren\u0027t touching the platform, the problem goes away, but I\u0027m unable to move the vehicle. If there is ANY wheel contact with the platform what so ever, the vehicle goes flying when I disconnect. I\u0027ve tried various spring and dampener settings and it still goes flying. Any suggestions? The vehicle / docking ports are mounted on M-2x2 panel. Is there another material I can use that doesn\u0027t result in my refueling vehicle turning into a bullet? On the flip side, at least I have a way to make extremely fast projectiles without propellant...\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-03T05:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat kind of wheels are you using on the refueler?

I think what\u0027s happening is that the Clampotron engages with so much force that it completely compresses the suspension of the rover wheels. So when it releases, all that stored spring energy is tossing your vehicle into the air. And there is definitely a known bug in the suspension springs in exactly that circumstance -- so they release with extra force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I think you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0use a pair of rover wheels to get around, just so long as they are shorter than the height of the clampotron\u00A0....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027d extend the retractables to get over the clampotron, then retract them to dock.

Then drive around that way until you need to do more docking.
