Right now we have SAS modules that overcompensate ridiculously for small craft but won\u0027t bother shoving a large craft full-force until the aerodynamics already have it circling the drain. If you could match them perfectly to the acceleration characteristics of your craft you\u0027d have rock solid flight\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cjameshuff","CreatedById":152,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-25T23:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=650.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=650.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arrowstar","CreatedById":2521,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-27T04:54:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Douglasdtlltd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Douglasdtlltd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are used to help stabilize the aircraft/spacecraft.

Note that this is not due to instability - I try to remedy that issue by shuffling parts around and adding winglets, if the problem arises - but due simply to the fact that I no longer have sufficient authority to STEER the ship anymore (especially in view of its massive positive stability).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
