Reaching let\u0027s say 400 m/s of horizontal velocity means that before landing I would have to reduce it to around 0, so the smaller horizontal velocity the better. But at the other hand, each second in the flight requires me to fight against the gravity, so the shorter the flight the better. What is the relation ? Does it depend on TWR or something else ?\n\nGoing slowly I would\u0027t waste much fuel for braking but I would have to pull up constantly. Going fast would require a lot of braking but not much pulling up. Is one way superior to another or optimum is somewhere between ? Or maybe that doesn\u0027t matter at all ?\n\nAnd similar concerns about landing from orbit. Are there any advantages/disadvantages of landing from very low orbit ? If I\u0027m at low altitude then I fly fast, so I have a lot of horizontal breaking. If I am high then I go slow and don\u0027t have to brake a lot, but I have to reduce vertical speed a lot. \n\nAlso as there is no atmosphere to slow me down, Is there any difference whether i let my craft to fall all the way and use engines latest possible moment, or reduce speed gently in many burns not allowing craft to accelerate too much ?"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T11:17:16Z","Content":"About the most efficient \u0022hopping\u0022 strategy on the Mun, I\u0027m not sure (it\u0027s a trade off between speed and gravity losses), but landing from low orbit is always better : by the time you have killed your horizontal velocity, you\u0027ll be at a lower altitude than if you had started from a high orbit.\n\nBy being at a lower altitude at the end of your retro burn, you will accumulate less vertical speed due to the gravity, and thus will have less vertical speed to cancel before touchdown, letting you save some fuel.\n\nAlso, using you engines at the last moment is called \u0022suicide burn\u0022 even on an airless body around here, and has been shown to be efficient (and dangerous). I think that\u0027s partly due to the fact that you\u0027re cancelling vertical speed at the last moment, making sure you won\u0027t accelerated too much by gravity before touchdown. The Oberth effect may also have something to do (you\u0027re burning when you\u0027re deep inside the gravity well), but I may be wrong...\n\nPlease note that, a \u0022perfect\u0022 low orbit landing wouldn\u0027t require a huge suicide burn before touchdown by definition.

Basically the lower you are when you brake, the smaller the time gravity has to accellerate you wich means less gravity losses.

The best way to land is using the method detailed in this video, it is more efficient than putting your Pe in the body and then suicide burning. If you do not like this method, then one long suicide burn is better.\n\nYou can\u0027t generalize it this way, at least not without a few footnotes.\n\nThe landing burn shown in that video is actually fairly inefficient, because it involves hovering. The maneuver is designed such that it keeps the vehicle\u0027s velocity vector pointing in the same direction (towards the horizon) for the entirety of the landing burn, regardless of horizontal velocity, right until the last moment where the vector disappears entirely and you transition into touchdown. However, hovering is really bad idea. The engine is not burning fully retrograde. It needs to be diverted down at an increasingly large angle in order to fight gravity, so that the vector can be kept from dropping. It is a very long burn and the craft is losing efficiency from fighting gravity every step of the way, just trying to maintain the status quo while not actually helping the slowdown process.\n\nIn fact, in terms of rocket fuel usage, hovering/preserving the status quo is the *worst* possible thing you can do for fuel efficiency. You can easily confirm this in an experiment where you drop a lander straight down from 10km while firing the engines on a low throttle setting to maintain a constant speed, compared to freefalling and just doing one quick, hard burn at the end.\n\nSo why is this generally regarded as \u0022the best way of landing\u0022? Because it was determined to be *the best way to land an Apollo mission*, specifically. The Lunar Module had a relatively small, puny engine to save weight and bulk, and was built to rely on manual, visual guidance for terminal descent. Technically the computer could handle it, but as Neil Armstrong himself famously demonstrated, the astronauts were very wise indeed to visually check out the projected landing site and decide themselves whether or not it was actually safe to let the computer touch down there. This slow, ponderous and somewhat wasteful descent was the most \u0022efficient\u0022 one they could fly because it maximized overall mission success probability, not because it actually saved the LM fuel.\n\nThe most efficient landing is theoretically achieved by assuming the lowest possible safe orbit, then lowering the periapsis to exactly touch the surface at your intended landing site, and then finally performing an instantaneous suicide burn at periapsis that removes all lateral velocity in the moment of touchdown. That is, of course, physically impossible to pull off in practical application, but it it highlights one important factor: for efficiency you want to have the shortest possible burn to null your total velocity. To get that, you need to 1.) run your engine at full throttle, when you decide to run it - running it at less is always wrong; and 2.) burn fully retrograde\\* as long as possible.\n\nThis minimizes the time spent decelerating horizontally, while also minimizing the amount of vertical speed the lander gains from gravity during that time. As the burn progresses and your horizontal velocity gets lower and lower, you slowly turn the engine towards the surface in a smooth, gradual motion that keeps following the retrograde marker on your navball and touch down the exact moment when vertical and horizontal speed both hit 0 m/s together. This method is called a \u0022reverse gravity turn\u0022 due to the similarity to a rocket launch played in reverse. It is the most efficient practical trajectory you can fly while still allowing for the fact that engine burns are not instantaneous and there might be obstacles to clear that steepen your path of approach.\n\n\\* Due to sines and cosines, burning 10 seconds at a 45 degree angle imparts (or removes) both more horizontal and vertical speed than burning 5 seconds vertically and then 5 seconds horizontally... even in the absence of gravity. Always follow the retrograde marker.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T14:01:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 02:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:04:41Z","Content":"@streetwind\n\nOh, colour me surprised.

I just couldn\u0027t figure out why I was running out of fuel, then decided to look it up.)\n\nBut yeah, this hover trajectory is quite safe. Your vertical speed is near zero. The only thing that can endanger you in that sort of approach is encountering a cliff face that you cannot dodge because your engine is too puny. Thankfully in a real space program like Apollo, they knew there were no such cliffs anywhere near the landing site.
