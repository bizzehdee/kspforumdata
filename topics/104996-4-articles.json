But after some thought I figured it might make them look too generic and one-size-fits-all. Different sizes and appearances definitely help give some variety, and make stations look more unique.\n\nFor the aeroponics and compact med bay module, I\u0027m even thinking about making them a non-standard diameter, like 3m instead of 2.5 (or whatever 0.1m increment still fits inside the stock cargo bay). But, if there is opposition to it, I\u0027\u0027ll stick with 2.5m diameters for those."},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T04:05:16Z","Content":"A little more texturing progress\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
