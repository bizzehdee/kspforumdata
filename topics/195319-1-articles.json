Make sure you\u0027re using the right version of it for your version of KSP- for KSP 1.8 and later you should be on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E 4.1.3 but for KSP 1.4 to 1.7.3 you should use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E 4.0.3 instead, they\u0027re mutually incompatible due to a change in the Unity engine used by KSP that was introduced in 1.8 and broke a whole lotta mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should also delete the four module manager files inside GameData (not the plugin itself but the files it generates: ModuleManager.ConfigCache, ModuleManager.ConfigSHA, ModuleManager.Physics and ModuleManager.TechTree) and let it generate those files again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the problem persists after trying that, check the log files- KSP.log is inside the KSP directory itself but provides limited information, Player.log/Player.txt provides a lot more detail but can be harder to track down as it depends on your KSP version and operating system (if you\u0027re on Windows and running a fairly recent version of KSP you\u0027ll probably\u00A0find it at C:/users/your user name/AppData/LocalLow/Squad/Kerbal Space Program- AppData is a hidden folder so enable \u0027show hidden\u0027 to find it). You should also check the logs in Logs/ModuleManager inside the KSP folder itself to see what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E is complaining about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
