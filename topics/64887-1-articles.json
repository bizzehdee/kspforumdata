For example Venus and Jupiter respectively. There has been a rather heated but civil debate on the viability of these in the Venus Terraforming thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I think Venus isn\u0027t worth considering to inhabit in this fashion beyond science stations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJupiter in turn, has plenty of Hydrogen and Helium, and thus probably Helium 3, since it\u0027s basically made of that stuff. Helium 3 is the perfect fuel to run Nuclear Fusion reactors with, and it\u0027s present on the moon in I think something on the order of 1-50 parts per billion. Hydrogen is also the fuel of choice for nuclear lightbulb engines, and thus it wouldn\u0027t be a big problem to ferry things between the upper atmosphere and low orbit. The aerostat stations themselves would likely need to be built off-world, and then brought down into the atmosphere by some sort of nuclear powered SSTO space plane in pieces. Or via parachutes. Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are probably better, since they have lower gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJupiter however, has another advantage.

Also, this would transform Mars into a place from near vacuum for air into one with choking deadly air. Think of it in terms of cold, deadly air at Mars instead of practically none. I do not see the advantage, as Venus would still possess a high pressure, hot choking atmosphere even if a Mars air bulking were successful.

A titanic 1 km^3 ballon could lift over ~200,000 tons (the mass of two of the largest curise liners). Of course spherical ballons are not nessassary, the mass of ballon fabric is negliable (At thick mylar is 10 g/m^2 that only ~0.2% the mass) So we could go with many smaller ballons of varying shape (ice-cream cone shape would probably be ideal). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could also fill the ballons with hydrogen, the lift advantage would 2.75 times the breathable air, but the change in radius of the ballon would not be much, from 79 meters to 56 meter and of course it would not be breathable and would require a litte more complex extraction for sulfuric acid, verse breathable air made for CO2 via photosnythesis or carbonate fuel cell and nitrogen extract from venusian air via membrane pumps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T15:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like breathable air is the best choice for lifting gas, as it makes all that volume habitable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T18:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the lifting gas is a tad on the heavy side, perhaps replacing the nitrogen with helium, like in scuba tanks?

So the apparent wind would be almost zero. That is the point to have 96hrs night/day cycle.\u003Cp\u003EBut dispatcher, you dont need to forget, that any flying vehicle that would approach it would have the same speed than the city. Your concern maybe come from turbulence winds. But venus has mostly horizontal and costant winds. Not vertical like earth (this are dangerous for any airplane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you wanna mine the surfuce, a nuclear hot air ballon would be enoght to trasport things between surfuce and the floating city.

On the other hand, you\u0027d need to balance atmospheric pressure against temperatures. At 50 km, by your table, the temperature is still excessively high. 350 K is about 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C.

We just need to rise the city 2 km to have 37c. Also do not forget that even if we have 50c, we can go outside of the habitat without feel so much the heat. Becouse the humidity of Venus is just 0,1% at that level. So thermal sensation is very different. A 50c in venus can be feel it like 32c at earth. Of course, you will need to drink water more ofter to not dehydrate if you are outside of the habitat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also some thermal differences in different latitude points on venus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rakaydos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf the lifting gas is a tad on the heavy side, perhaps replacing the nitrogen with helium, like in scuba tanks?

Heck with surface area of a balloon no less! Heat is transferring physically from the outside air to the balloon skin to the inside air, you need to add insulated layers to prevent this. All the extra weight in insulation and power plant and cooling system may make it worth it be a little higher! You can\u0027t radiate heat away either as the air around is emitting more IR radiation!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe density of Venus air at 50 km is 1.612 kg/m^3 at 350 K, the density of breathing air (79% nitrogen, 21% oxygen) at the same pressure but at room temp of 295 is 1.253 kg/m^3, so the lifting force is 358.4 g/m^3. If we go to an altitude of 57 km where the temperature is 285 K or 10 K below room temp which should still be in the range of passive temperature control, the breathing air would be 43% N2 and 57% O2 at 0.37 bar, the breathing air would weigh 457 g/m^3 while the outside air weighs 688 g/m^3, that is a lifting force of 231 g/m^3 or 64% of the low altitude. If we go to equal temp altitude lifting power is 284 g/m^3 or 79% the lower altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for making O2, that easy enough, a carbonate fuel cell can make O2 out of CO2 (actually it makes O2 on one side and CO on the other) the carbon monoxide we can dump or use in a *separate* balloon as lifting as gas, as good as nitrogen in lifting force. Nitrogen would need to be separated from venus atmosphere, a multiple stage CO2 scrubber could remove all the CO2 and nitrogen would be all that is left, plus trace gases, or we could go with good old fashion Liquefaction, but that may be more energy intensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
