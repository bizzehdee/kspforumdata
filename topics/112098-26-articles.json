When i built the frame for my lander I put a 3.75 meter fairing base right behind it and a 2.5 meter fuel tank inside it, so it would be big enough to accommodate 2.5 meter parts (mainly for the crew lander), but also small enough to fit in the 3.75 meter fairing.\n\nSpeaking of the crew lander, I have a prototype to share. I experienced soil erosion with this one too, but it didn\u0027t get bad until I sent the test pilot on EVA to make sure the exit hatch and ladder worked fine. Since i don\u0027t have to detach anything from this one I\u0027m not quite as worried about the bug affecting this lander, but I still want it to stop. Come on, I put ***\u003Cu\u003Elegs\u003C/u\u003E*** on it with the expectation that they would help it stay still!\n\n![BVPyzLs.png](http://i.imgur.com/BVPyzLs.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-06T21:43:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 hours ago, Majorjim said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The FSPS on the cargo lander **IS** the ISRU.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Majorjim said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have read through a 15 page NASA study on the DRA 5.0/constellation mission.
