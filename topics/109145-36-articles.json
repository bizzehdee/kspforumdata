These engines seem to seriously underperform in actual use in comparison to their listed stats.  Examples below.\n\nSpoiler\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B13Bfbd-pPp0MVpyR2R3MTJFd2c](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B13Bfbd-pPp0MVpyR2R3MTJFd2c)\n\n[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B13Bfbd-pPp0YnBZMlFSZlZadUk](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B13Bfbd-pPp0YnBZMlFSZlZadUk)\n\nThe first image is a test plane for a drone to fly on Eve. On the static test I\u0027m getting at most 101 kn thrust @1851 Isp. The Isp I\u0027m not worried about but the thrust is a lot lower than the stated 120 kn thrust asl. The second shows the drone in flight at about 5k altitude and 282 m/s speed. The engine is barely producing 70 kn thrust and dropping all the time. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? The engine is getting plenty of IntakeAtm as the shock cone callout shows. So why is it not coming close to the performance listed in it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E description. At these performance levels, particularly for it\u0027s weight and cost the engine is not a very good choice since it can\u0027t reach the speeds and heights where a rocket could reasonably take over for it for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and infinite flight duration while nice doesn\u0027t make up for lack of performance. \n\nOr am I misunderstanding the purpose of these engines? Where you intending them to be basically weak turboprop engines with infinite fuel?"}]}
