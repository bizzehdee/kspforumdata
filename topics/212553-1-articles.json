Much as I love it, I want to see it grow, so here\u0027s a big list of issues I ran into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunning a RTX 4070TI, Intel I7 10700 @ 3.8GHz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there\u0027s any more info that would be helpful to provide I\u0027ll gladly do so.

I have not seen this occur in timewarp, only during physical simulation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEngines continue to gimbal when turned off.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPausing/unpausing the game causes multiple popups to appear instead of only one.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPausing/unpausing the game prevents maneuver node creation and the ability to time warp to a specific point in an orbit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen in orbit, sometimes vessel can spontaneously disappear. This occurred as I was near my apoapsis and attempting to time warp specifically to it from a short distance away. Flight report\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nManeuver node predictions are inaccurate. After performing a burn according to a maneuver node, I did not have any encounter with the mun despite the maneuver originally showing an encounter.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSometimes, when reverting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E after a crash, the game no longer allows you to launch a new craft. In this state the game also does not recognize any of the workspaces I have created, listing only stock workspaces.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe ADTP-2-3 is listed as a small to medium methalox fueled adapter, when it is a Large to Medium adapter.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is no visual feedback that an autosave has occurred when in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, only an audio cue.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen dragging a part with symmetry onto a part that already has symmetry applied, the ghosts of parts sometimes stay behind when moving along the surface of a craft. Reproducible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSometimes, the pre-launch countdown (or first stage) immediately activates on loading onto the launchpad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(at 3840x2160) Many part descriptions are cut short without enough room to display the entire text, but shift is deactivated as a prompt to expand the information box.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMany part descriptions do not fit even in the extended window.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Launch Assembly button to designate which assembly will be launched sticks to the cursor even when deselected\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen hitting alt to duplicate a placed strut, the game attempts to re-orient the already placed strut while leaving an extra strut at the previous attachment point.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGame mistakenly sometimes mistakes 1x timewarp for pause. Noticed occuring when attempting to use physics timewarp.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nColor manager sometimes refuses to close, and the button in the corner of the window is unresponsive\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is no ingame toggle for integration with, for example, RGB on logitech etc keyboards\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInstead of providing stability to the rocket as a whole, struts only provide stability between parts they are directly attached to. Very noticeable with tiny nosecones strutted atop boosters, causing major part dislocation (though without breakage)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nClouds have odd grainy effect when paused with a rocket inside them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen on a ladder on a moving vessel, the kerbal can become displaced from the ladder of the object, though still able to climb up and down about as much as he could on the ladder itself.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen leaving a ladder in this way, the kerbal is instantly killed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOdd pop-in of flowers on Kerbin- Looks like the entire image used for flower textures is showing up instead of just the petals, or stalk, etc\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSometimes, on separation of stages, parts become entangled and do not move away from one another.
