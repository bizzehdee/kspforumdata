Using similar RCS VTOL technology to our successful Kestrel and Ibis Munar return spaceplanes [the Ibis the more successfully successful of the two,] the \u003Cem\u003ESpacehawk\u003C/em\u003E is capable of ferrying small packages to the Mun in [partly] reusable style!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E//Consumers are warned that the Kerbin descent stage is currently unpowered, and as such will not function as a Munar return vessel alone. It does have its own RCS supply, however, allowing it to land on the Mun even if the descent stage is damaged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E//Consumers are warned that the Munar return stage is too unstable for atmospheric flight.
