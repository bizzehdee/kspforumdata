I had a question. By modifying custom asteroid\u0027s orbit mechanics, I managed to get a custom set of asteroids. But I have no idea how to tell KSP to give these custom asteroids, only certain kinds of resources other than ore. Could someone walk me through this or give a hint or two?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, how would I get a custom model for this? I tried modifying the potatoroid files from squad, but I\u0027ve no idea to get these custom potatoes to be used in these custom orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T00:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been watching to see if anyone has an answer - appears not.
