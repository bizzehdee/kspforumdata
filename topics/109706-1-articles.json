The old ascent strategy of boosting straight up to 10,000m and then pitching over is null and void with the new aero. Start your gravity turn at about 1,000m, or when your velocity is in the 50 to 100 m/s range. Just pitch over 5 or 10 degrees and continue pitching slowly, staying as close as possible to your prograde marker as possible. Do not pitch over too much or you will start to tumble. Aim for 500 to 600 m/s when you hit 45 degrees on the navball. At that point you should be well above 20,000m, where the atmosphere is very thin, and you can safely pitch over father from your prograde marker to pick up horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso adding control surfaces near the bottom of your rocket or some reaction wheels near the top can help you stick to that prograde mark.

When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabalizer wheels, and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach 1 (340 m/s).

I aim for an off-the-pad TWR of 1.2 using atmo thrust. This way you shouldn\u0027t have to lower your throttle so much. By the time your thrust increases with altitude and fuel burn-off, you should be able to maintain a decent TWR without going too fast.
