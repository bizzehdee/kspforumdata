I think KSP is a very different game and I don\u0027t think its wise to get all into belts and splitters and all that fussiness, but there is something compelling about carefully designing a colony for max efficiency in some simplified way. I for sure think it would be fun and in-spirit to think about harvesting ratios, generator requirements and inputs, and balancing resources to produce sustained growth. Its important to keep in mind KSP isn\u0027t Factorio and you would never want that many intermediate resources, but in some heavily simplified way getting from raw ores to rocket parts should require at least a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E setup. The question that interests me is how would we want to think about plumbing and other design factors?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe already know statics and structure will be a factor; if you build too tall and skinny or get too greedy with cantilevers you might have problems. But what else? Radiation seems like it could matter and might drive some clever setups keeping big reactors and fuel plants at least a little distance from habitation modules. What about internal habitation continuity? Maybe it\u0027s not necessary for them to function, but there could be an efficiency bonus built in. Some of Nertea\u0027s heat system mods also could be really interesting to incorporate in some form.\u00A0 Plumbing could be simplified--just consider that most modules have universal, automatic plumbing and resource transfer but that obviously open structural components don\u0027t, so you\u0027d want to connect up some systems like fuel plants, and ore smelters to storage tanks and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr maybe you\u0027d prefer that none of this was a factor and it was all just role play and aesthetics?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-27T17:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get the target is making something that doesn\u0027t require constant babysitting, and that\u0027s ok, but that doesn\u0027t tell anything about the complexity of the set-up or the amount of intermediary tiers between a temporary habitation module and a full blown autonomous space city.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you could automate crew management and rotations with the supply routes system (for something easier to visualize imagine ISS crew rotations) you could introduce homesickness as a concern for pre-colony bases, if you don\u0027t make a base/colony population die when is not managed but just stop working you could have any kind of complex life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, based on that, imagine if the game was set up in a way that makes almost impossible to build a fully autonomous colony in one single place, a way that makes you almost always want to spread out your mining operations over a big area (talking about hundreds of KMs), a system in which you have extracting buildings/craft efficiency coming mostly from the crew present (working 60% slower without crew or with an over-stressed crew).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA system like that would put most of the complexity not in\u00A0 the production line but on the transport of resources between the mining outposts and the central colony, the complexity would be mostly in creating and flying all the cargo and crew missions required and the supply route system would turn the babysitting into a infrastructure setup situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you stop before finishing the setup the \u0022not a colony yet\u0022 base would just stop working, no deaths or building collapsing, just Kerbals going on strike and machinery reverting to their uncrewed values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would give the most \u0022Kerbal Gameplay\u0022 out of the colony system, while also making the player choose their own favorite mission type by placing the central colony hub in different places (love spaceplanes SSTOs?

On the one hand theres nothing at all wrong with universal plumbing. Let\u0027s call that Option 1. In this version, much like KSP1 if a part is connected to any other part you can consider it plumbed for electricity, fuel, monoprop, crew transfer, ore, whatever. If you want to make it \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E like it\u0027s logical thats completely up to you. The next level, let\u0027s call it Option 2, is that there are 2 levels: parts that are plumbed and parts that are not. In this version crew cabs, fuel tanks, reactors, whatever, would be universally plumbed as in Option 1 but some parts like structural trusses would not conduct fuel or crew or anything else (maybe ec) and would require running bypass conduits. Next would be Option 3x--anything more complicated than that. You could for instance require habitation continuity with crew corridor parts to make sure habitation and science labs and greenhouses and such all worked together, but that all other parts were considered universally plumbed for everything else. Or you could have a few types of systems that required continuity--fuel systems (fuel pipes), Processing (resource conveyers), Coolant systems, Habitation, etc. Each of these would have a category of parts that were automatically plumbed when physically attached, or could be connected by point-to-point conduits like the external fuel duct or in the early game flexible hoses. You wouldn\u0027t have to get all Factorio about it with logic gates or directionality, but it would make you think a bit about design and linking up like-systems.

Maybe for that reason I wouldn\u0027t suggest proximity bonuses. Infraspace is pretty great but its based on proximity in plan, which gets a little more complicated with broadly interconnected 3-d designs. I think the only reason you\u0027d want continuity of systems is if you wanted a way to visualize and maintain these systems anyway--like making sure your heat was dissipating properly or optimizing ore harvesting and resource processing chains. If you could toggle through and highlight interconnected processing systems (blue), Heat (red), Habitation \u002B LS (green) with little flags indicating inputs and outputs it might be easier to make sure everything was balanced. The other advantage is it would simply be on or off, connected or not connected. You could do deliberate things like route coolant to radiators from a reactor without bleeding heat into nearby parts. So long as they were connected they\u0027d function as a separate system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut, who knows.

But I digress, thinking about other games I\u0027ve played in the past. The more blatant complexity added to the game, the less likely I\u0027m going to play it for long. KSP is a very complex and challenging game. But once you learn the complex parts, it gets easier. No less challenging, but easier. Now, adding anything beyond simple resource connections is adding needless complexity to an already complex game. At some point it will become too much. Would you rather spend your time designing your next mission or troubleshooting why the ore isn\u0027t making it through your colony to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E?
