How do I make it so the collision mesh is actually hollow? Not finding much info on Google, any help would be appreciated.

When KSP 1.1 comes out, all colliders will have to be convex, so I\u0027d suggest doing convex right now. Besides, non-convex colliders will fall through the launch pad and runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027ll need to do is make several small convex colliders to build up the walls all the way around, rather than one big hollow one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sticky32","CreatedById":148749,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T21:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much, that was the problem, just had to break it up into 24 pieces to get them small enough.
