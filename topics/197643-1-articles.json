Either the ship is unmanned, or the ship has a pilot but no computer core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso randomly if I use docking autopilot it will not dock at all, and the part where it says error x, y, z will have a huge number, like -1000m/s or something. I sometimes have to select another docking port, or manually move the ship closer until it will work correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using 1.8.1 and real solar system. I used principia but got sick of it because it was causing serious performance issue on my computer ( if I try to time warp at 600,000x which is necessary if I want to go to planets like Saturn or something, it will stutter badly).\u00A0 So I deleted Principia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using the development version.
