As you can see on the image, the thrust seems to be pointing backwards. I don\u0027t know why. When I try to launch the plane, it refuses to move and crawls at 0.8 m/s at full thrust. Then if I try to tilt upwards with the wings, it will increase speed and shoot of at 100m/s. If I stop moving wings, the plane at full thrust will decelerate and crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know why this is happening?
