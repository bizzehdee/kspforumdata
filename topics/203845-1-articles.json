But since I\u0027m too lazy to confirm, I\u0027ll just share my thoughts anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe experiments should have at least some portion of relevance to particular parts. For example, the rough terrain of the Mun from a surface sample leads to the development of the first sets of rover wheels. The thick atmosphere of Eve leads to the development of more in the aerodynamic area, and perhaps some further development of other command pods with better pressure resistance...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter \u0022pressure resistance?\u0022 That\u0027s an interesting idea. From what I can recall, the real-world Venera 4 was destroyed by atmospheric pressure on Venus.\u00A0Is it possible that atmospheric pressure could be an important part of choosing parts? It\u0027s interesting to think about. Anyway, assuming that it\u0027s real, a 2.5m lander can probably has just barely enough strength against air pressure to survive, which means that it \u003Cem\u003Edefinitely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0wouldn\u0027t survive entry into Jool\u0027s deeper atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess with the tech tree, KSP 1 has a set of parts for certain named categories, even when they don\u0027t always make sense. Is a thermometer a science instrument, or a safety tool? Many would think of it as a science instrument, but it\u0027s in a section named \u0022survivability,\u0022 as if it would help you to know \u0022oh, the thermometer is giving a reading of 500 celcius,\u0022 what would you even\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in that situation with a thermometer? Perhaps those thermal guages on your spacecraft could only show up by having a thermometer on your craft? Anyways, I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest splitting the tech tree into two halves: \u0022Engineering research\u0022 and \u0022Science research.\u0022 Considering research in real life, engineering and science are both very important to one another, but neither is actually the other. An engineer can design an engine, but without the science to even provide the theory, where could that lead?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say you want to work up to a Metallic Hydrogen engine.

Someone since then expressed something akin to why not have 1 tech tree and each tech can require multiple kinds of relevant science currencies dependent on how those sciences relate to the tech being developed. Some of these different science points could come from experiments as is already the case while others come from actions like running an engine for X amount of time or flying with wings experiencing lift for Y amount of time etc.. Something akin to flight experience or part test time. I imagine each of these could be sub-segmented down to maintain\u00A0more substantial\u00A0relevancy and other research types could other then experiments and flight experience can be dreamed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA problem with this might be creating too many currencies and overwhelming the player with over nuancing the tree but I think a balance can be found in this. As for the tech tree as a whole I think a tree structure isn\u0027t the problem so much as the categorization and the order in which things are researched. I find it a bit surprising SQUAD never tries to balance this in any of their updates (They dont change cost, position, order, etc ever) which just leads me to believe they overall don\u0027t care much about career/science modes in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-17T10:28:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\npersonaly i think it would be cool if it worked somewhat like this: you get different parts after a certain amount of time but you can speed it up by ex investing currency in it or doing mor science experiments(some experiments speeding up engines and others speeding up stuctural etc) or if you use jet engines a lot you will research jet engines faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeLacy","CreatedById":212799,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-18T07:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the part requirements should be revamped and the Science at the most should get split into Engineering research and Scientific research.

At a certain point you are either continuously grinding, or you have all the science and basically unlimited funds. There really wasn\u0027t a solid balance between the two, never mind the fact there\u0027s a whole solar system to explore! The grind became more of a distraction for the means to the end, where the means are rockets and the end is exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why I personally think the idea of science/research should be secondary to more ambitious endeavors of building, and exploring where you get \u0022progress\u0022 by going places instead of just doing things the game tells you to. KSP 1\u0027s main blockers being contracts more or less \u0022telling you\u0022 where to go and what to do. I think science\u002Bfunds should be merged together into RND.
