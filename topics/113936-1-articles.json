I just spent my evening setting up my development environment for 1.0.3 and finishing updating and releasing one my mods specifically for that version. I\u0027m almost sure that my release will work with 1.0.4 since its a very minor update, but I still have to download that version, install my mod and verify it works now. I\u0027ve been on the forums much of the afternoon and evening, so shouldn\u0027t it have been obvious at some point that a new version had been released? It\u0027s just slightly irritating that I could have been developing and compiling my mod for 1.0.4 this entire time."},{"CreatedByName":"Yellowburn10","CreatedById":107558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T02:39:09Z","Content":"1.0.4. was announced on the daily kerbal, and it was to fix a bug with loading old craft files to 1.0.3.
