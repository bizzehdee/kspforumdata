Although I have not found a solution, or I am implementing the recommendations incorrectly, or missing something altogether. Thanks for reading the \n\nKSP Version: V1.0.4.861\n\nbuild id = 00861\n\n2015.06.23 at 17:19:17 CEST\n\nBranch: master\n\nPurchased via Steam\n\nInstall is clean\n\nAttached: crash folder, save folder, and screen shots\n\nDetails: KSP Crashes on reverting launch, or to tracking station, or space center. \n\nBoth my PC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s one 32bit Win7, and another 64bit Win 8.1 OS, Nvida Geforce840M, i5 2.6GHz., are now having the same crashing issue. I have received an automated response from KSP Support on the 11^th^ July. I have read and made the KSP support recommended changes at:\n\n[https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=19](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=19)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92228-Known-Issues-Self-Help](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92228-Known-Issues-Self-Help)\n\n1) Made the changes to the 32bit PC dual core sys using the process affinity, although MS won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t allow me to make changes to DEP. I have put KSP in another drive away from C: programs. Actually it was never there. Changed the read only file (although it keeps re-checking itself when I go back to confirm the changes), even though the computer visually made some process change. \n\n2) KSP is now crashing on my 64bit system, with one i5core. 4RAM, and graphics card. My 64bit sys has been reformatted, OS, and minimal programs reinstalled. \n\n3) I am using and interchanging some of the old save files between the two pcs, maybe persistence files too, depending on which pc I use.\n\n4) Note that it appears to only crash on more complicated designs, or something with the type of saved file being loaded. Not really sure, but I have read many posts in the KSP Forums to resolve this issue, looking for viable solution. \n\nThanks for your time and help.\n\nspacejohn\n\n**Crash details, save folder, Sys, jpg**\n\n[**https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0pjh4ui6c9tushs/AACNoGAJoQMUuvcxm1gzdRa3a?dl=0**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0pjh4ui6c9tushs/AACNoGAJoQMUuvcxm1gzdRa3a?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"spacejohn","CreatedById":148274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T08:01:36Z","Content":"What does this KSP error report mean?:\n\n\u0022\n\nUnity Player [version: Unity 4.6.4f1\\_99f88340878d]KSP.exe caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005)\n\n in module KSP.exe at 0023:003f5510.\n\nError occurred at 2015-07-24\\_185900.\n\nD:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\KSP.exe, run by John.\n\n81% memory in use.\n\n3992 MB physical memory [730 MB free].\n\n0 MB paging file [1387 MB free].\n\n0 MB user address space [2209 MB free].\n\nRead from location 00000138 caused an access violation.\n\n\u0022\n\nspacejohn\n\n**Crash details, save folder, Sys, jpg**\n\n[**https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0pjh4ui6c9tushs/AACNoGAJoQMUuvcxm1gzdRa3a?dl=0**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0pjh4ui6c9tushs/AACNoGAJoQMUuvcxm1gzdRa3a?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T14:53:57Z","Content":"Hi Spacejohn, it looks like your graphics driver is out of date, your dxdiag says it has a released date of 4/9/2014, but I see the [**latest on the Nvidia**](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/86506/en-us) site was released on 2015.6.22, so I\u0027m guessing you\u0027re using the driver that came with the card?\n\nPlease try updating your driver, though your crash looks memory related, so I\u0027d try reducing the texture quality in-game as well."},{"CreatedByName":"spacejohn","CreatedById":148274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T04:57:20Z","Content":"Hi Sal\\_vager,\n\nThank you so much for getting back to me.

I am not sure, but could the same games saves, from my two different systems (32bit and 64bit) be an issue? It never used to crash on my 64bit. I am just searching for solution. I used to play for hours with the crashes and reloading the game on my 32bit, but now the 64bit crashes too.

One more thing... I have installed more RAM for 8GB total, installed updated driver, and minimum rendering and graphics on everything. It still, ONLY crashes on Reverting the launch/KSC - game play is fine. I am a high school Mathematics teacher at an international school in China. I would like to introduce KSP to all my students over her. KSP has some real Math and Science applications that we could use on certain lessons with my Chinese students. We only need to get it to figure out why it is only crashing on revert. I am overlooking something, but cant figure it out by myself. Would please take a closer look one last-time? I have sent updated dxdiag files. Or even remote access? \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6d3sehdwtqmp68a/AAA0JD_-Jj4w71NYFXrFD1v9a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6d3sehdwtqmp68a/AAA0JD_-Jj4w71NYFXrFD1v9a?dl=0)\n\nNote: the game plays perfectly fine all the way to landing on Duna, except when going reverting back to the space center with certain vehicles or planes, which are usually created on another PC then plllayed on another. But then, that may not be it because I re-created the Duna ship and rover again, from scratch on the same PC, which I have attached the new DxDiag files, and KSP saves - and it still crashes. The ship is Scott\u0027s Duna Rover or Ike core and rover save ships. \n\n I don\u0027t play any other games except Civilization V with over 3000 hours - Now my new possible new favorite is KSP! Only if..\n\nPlease help, if possible.\n\nThank you, \n\nTeacher John"}]}
