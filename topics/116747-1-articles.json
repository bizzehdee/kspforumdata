I have received an automated response from KSP Support on the 11\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E July. I have read and made the KSP support recommended changes at:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=19\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/?page_id=19\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92228-Known-Issues-Self-Help\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92228-Known-Issues-Self-Help\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Made the changes to the 32bit PC dual core sys using the process affinity, although MS won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t allow me to make changes to DEP.

One more thing... I have installed more RAM for 8GB total, installed updated driver, and minimum rendering and graphics on everything. It still, ONLY crashes on Reverting the launch/KSC - game play is fine. I am a high school Mathematics teacher at an international school in China. I would like to introduce KSP to all my students over her. KSP has some real Math and Science applications that we could use on certain lessons with my Chinese students. We only need to get it to figure out why it is only crashing on revert. I am overlooking something, but cant figure it out by myself. Would please take a closer look one last-time? I have sent updated dxdiag files. Or even remote access? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6d3sehdwtqmp68a/AAA0JD_-Jj4w71NYFXrFD1v9a?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/6d3sehdwtqmp68a/AAA0JD_-Jj4w71NYFXrFD1v9a?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: the game plays perfectly fine all the way to landing on Duna, except when going reverting back to the space center with certain vehicles or planes, which are usually created on another PC then plllayed on another.
