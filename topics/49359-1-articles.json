I was reminded a few days ago when I happened to see someone reference the latest version on an unrelated forum. I can\u0027t remember the last time I had more fun playing a video game. There seem to be some bugs, the career mode needs specific goals, things are generally a little confusing and the process of entering into the game feels entirely incomplete, or even un-implemented. None of that, in the least, takes away from the fun of a game that allows you to... well you all know what it does. It is wonderful.
