The aft Aerospikes have different throttle output levels to compensate the offset center of mass. But if you take this thing as it is, activate infinite fuel (which you must, because fantasy tech ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ) and throttle up, it should fly straight.
