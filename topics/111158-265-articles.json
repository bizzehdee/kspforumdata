There are a certain number of them going \u0027round, and people attach value to them only *\u003Cu\u003Ebecause\u003C/u\u003E* they\u0027re finite.  Imagine that we installed a forum update so that every post that everyone makes automatically and instantly gets 1 million likes.  That\u0027s *\u003Cu\u003Eamazing\u003C/u\u003E*, right?  Everybody would be overjoyed because everyone would have tons of affirmation, right?\n\nWell, no.  All that would do would be to completely devalue likes and make them meaningless.  That little rush you get when a post of yours gets a lot of likes?  You only get that because not everything gets likes.  Since they\u0027re in finite supply, *\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u0027s\u003C/u\u003E* what gives value to a thing.  It\u0027s an unavoidable rule of economics.  Increasing the \u0022likes supply\u0022 is only going to result in \u0022likes inflation\u0022 and nothing more.\n\nSo, although we understand people\u0027s desire to give likes to things and feeling like they \u0022want more\u0022... raising the limits wouldn\u0027t improve folks\u0027 feelings of kudos, any more than printing a bunch of money will make everyone richer.\n\nThere\u0027s another issue at play, as well:  Raising the \u0022likes\u0022 limit would disproportionately give influence to the loudest voices.  Suppose we allowed 1000 likes per day per person.  The vast majority of members aren\u0027t going to use anywhere near their quota (heck, they\u0027re not even using their current 25), because they simply don\u0027t have *\u003Cu\u003Etime\u003C/u\u003E* to read 1000 things in a day... but folks who are especially determined and want to make their voices heard above everyone else would have a very  disproportionate influence.  The net effect would be that the large majority of likes in the forum would come from a tiny minority of very \u0022loud\u0022, determined people, and would become less representative of the forum population as a whole.\n\nAnd that right there is, to me, perhaps the strongest argument not to raise the cap.  Our observation has been that the very large majority of users-- we\u0027re talking over 95%-- don\u0027t come even close to hitting their 25-likes-in-a-day cap.  That doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re apathetic, that doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re not reading stuff in the forums, and they do issue likes; it\u0027s just not *dozens a day*.  If the overwhelming majority of users don\u0027t hit the cap, then that means that the cap is essentially irrelevant to them.\n\nIf you\u0027re one of the few people who is hitting that cap and feeling constrained by it... well, that means you\u0027re especially passionate and/or happen to have a lot of time to devote to the forums, and that\u0027s great.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  But the fact that you\u0027re hitting the limit means that your \u0022voice of approval\u0022 is already considerably \u0022louder\u0022 than everyone else\u0027s, and isn\u0027t a persuasive argument to make it even more so.

Just like posts in the Lounge don\u2019t count for your post count.    \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There are some that think post count and reputation count actually mean something.   They don\u2019t.    To prevent abuse of the system, we\u2019ve put limits on it.     End of story.\n\u003E \n\nHow deeply am I supposed to read 6 paragraphs of someone telling me that value isn\u0027t \u0022magically created\u0022 and expounding their belief that too may likes ruins the forum?\n\nYou keep talking about abuse, but I don\u0027t understand how that works. On the one hand I keep hearing that likes don\u0027t matter. On the other hand, too many likes from one person somehow skews the content of the forum? How does something that has no value break the forum? Alternatively, if there\u0027s a value that we are worried will be inflated, what is the thing, or unit of \u0022currency\u0022 actually earning that will lose value?\n\nThis is far from the \u0022end of the story\u0022 if we are having a discussion- and this particular phrasing is another example of dismissiveness I\u0027ve encountered from mods in 48 hours.

I can play KSP2 on my own without ever sharing, but I have a great desire to see this game in classrooms and on every teenager\u0027s computer. The internet gives me a way to share my gameplay with others and inspire others.\n\n[@Gargamel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/) [@Snark](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/)  When I come to these forums I hope to do exactly that- share and like what others have shared. I particularly enjoy the challenge section where I\u0027ve seen some of the most unique challenges. \n\nBut what I don\u0027t understand is how one day, when I\u0027ve been looking forward to finally spending time enjoying the game and the community that supports it, I find out that if I offer too many likes in one area then I won\u0027t be able to \u0022appreciate\u0022 something else because of some arbitrary limit hidden behind a veil of \u0022data\u0022 and \u0022committee deliberation\u0022.\n\nIf I\u0027m allowed 25 likes a day, but don\u0027t get to sit down and give the attention I want to the community until one of seven days... Why set it to a rolling 24hours? Why not set it to a rolling 7 days so that I can have all of the likes I could have used over the entire week?\n\nAnd how did you come to the conclusion that limiting likes was the best solution rather than just dealing with abusers?"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-09T14:40:14Z","Content":"Don\u0027t fixate on the likes you weren\u0027t able to give.

The rest of the commenting rules are pretty lax, so there\u0027s a balancing act to be made here. I really haven\u0027t felt censored, but the like limit feels like a wierd box to be in.
