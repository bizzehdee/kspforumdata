Ramjets depend on a ram-compressed flow of atmospheric air for combustion, making them useless for launch and for orbital insertion. An air-augmented rocket uses a stream of atmospheric air only as added reaction mass, greatly increasing specific impulse in a fashion similar to a turbofan bypass. They can afford to use fuels with greater energy density, because so much of the reaction mass is external. Best of all, because their core is more or less an ordinary rocket, they have no problem functioning from a standstill or in a vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s17.postimg.org/af67kjtfj/air_augmented.png\u0022 alt=\u0022air_augmented.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(For reference, there was a prior forum post on air-augmented rockets \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/76791-rocket-diffused-ram-jet/\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, though it didn\u0027t go into many details.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most efficient turbofan engines are built with extremely high bypass ratios, exceeding 10 kg of bypass air for every 1 kg of airflow through the central turbojet. Of course, the primary difference between a turbofan and an air-augmented rocket is that the power is delivered to the air mechanically in the former case, but thermally in the latter case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAir-augmented rockets have not historically been very successful. In most cases, adding a shroud around the outside of an existing rocket was a large weight cost in exchange for only a modest increase in thrust specific fuel consumption, and because they weren\u0027t optimized for using the air as reaction mass, most of the added thrust was the result of secondary combustion between the fuel-rich rocket exhaust and the atmospheric air, making them essentially very inefficient ramjets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf, however, an air-augmented rocket engine were designed in an inside-out configuration with a central bypass rather than an external bypass, you\u0027d end up with a much simpler, more compact, potentially much more efficient design:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s2.postimg.org/g0d3pf8y1/central_bypass.png\u0022 alt=\u0022central_bypass.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch a design could allow a really, really high bypass ratio, causing thrust specific fuel consumption to drop ridiculously low.

You can also think about it in terms of momentum; if you slow down air as it comes into your engine, you have to speed it back up to the same speed to even break even, and eject it out the back at a far greater speed to get net thrust. That\u0027s the problem that scramjets have encountered; they can get combustion to work just fine, but the body of the craft is absorbing so much kinetic energy from the onrushing air that they can\u0027t get net thrust above a certain point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole reason for having a very large central bypass is that you can slow down the incoming air as little or as much as you want.

deployment altitudes of chutes. \u00A0The 500m/s limit comes from the limit of a drogue chute) and lands before the rocket hits 20,000m. \u00A0Since Kerbin has a delta-v requirement to LKO of ~3000 and Earth has a delta-v requirement of ~9000m/s to LEO, a KSP\u00A0first stage that stops at 500m/s (500m/s delta-v plus most of your gravity losses) would correspond to about 1500m/s on Earth (about mach 5). \u00A0While I\u0027d expect such a beast to go quite a bit faster (don\u0027t ask me how to survive the compressive heating, I just launch kerbals), that isn\u0027t far off what you might expect. \u00A0[Please ignore that a lot of such first stages are going to be SRBs or other high-thrust engines, if only to get to the correct speed at a low enough altitude to land before the physics

understanding of\u00A0orbital mechanics, I think it has increased my ignorance of SRBs (hint, they don\u0027t appear to be *anything* like KSP SRBs). \u00A0My guess is that you might be able to get away with a single stage SRB, with high thrust and a short burn (removing the O-ring issues that doomed Challenger, and lowering transportation issues).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your SRB is blocking your main engines... \u00A0it\u0027s probably a waste of time. \u00A0 Unless it\u0027s a

doomed\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EChallenger\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0are long since fixed. \u00A0 No need to avoid joints since doing so only (very) marginally increases safety and (very) greatly impacts total
