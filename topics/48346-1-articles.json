Most of my larger SSTOs use these same ratios of jets/rockets. But smaller ones can be made with a single jet, 3-4 intakes, and 2 LV-909s or even two rockomax 48-7S\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you may have found with staged rockets, less is sometimes more. This is even more true for SSTOs. A staged rocket can always get further by simply putting the whole rocket on top of a bigger rocket. An SSTO carries all of its mass forever (unless you strictly mean \u0027to orbit\u0027 and then drop stuff), so without refueling their range is hard-limited by the performance of the parts available. So bigger is nearly identical in performance, at best, but often is actually worse due to other inefficiencies, especially with new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTOs can be made arbitrarily simple by adding intakes, so if you really just want to get one up use 6\u002B intakes per engine and it should be (comparatively) easy. I usually find 3 to be plenty, but I have a bit of experience. Unless you are airhogging you will not reach 30km on jets alone.

The turbo jets are the best for this role and do quite well in atmosphere and handle mach 3.5 and better the best. I use FAR so I can\u0027t tell you much about the stock drag model or how it works because I have never dealt with it for any length of time. But you will want your wings to be pretty simple in construction or at least strutted so they don\u0027t flex to much.

A heavier plane flies lower, encounters more drag, and has a lower top speed. My first SSTO actually decoupled the landing gear and parachuted back to Kerbin because the landing gear was so heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip #2: Start small: one turbojet to get your initial speed up and shoot your plane into space, and a pair of Rockomax Radial Rockets to finish up your orbit. One radial would work fine, but then you have unbalanced thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip #3: Bring only the fuel you need: one mk1 fuselage for jet fuel, and a FLT100 for rocket fuel (that\u0027s right, the small one - you don\u0027t need much). You\u0027ll probably have enough fuel left over to make a powered landing at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip #4: Drag is not your friend either. While weight causes drag, so do wings. Yet you need wings for lift. You will need to find a balance, but for a really small plane, a pair of delta wings, a pair of small control surfaces on the delta wings, and a pair of forward canards should be sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip #5: Rudders work best in pairs. I\u0027ve seen some strange yawing action when using one, that seems to be canceled out when using two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip #6: For your first SSTO, airhog to the max. Many find it objectionable, but your first attempt needs a large margin for error, and having a couple dozen ram air intakes for that one turbojet gives you that that margin for error. Once you\u0027re used to how things work, feel free to tone it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip #7: Start with getting a stable airframe that you can easily fly. Part of this is in design (CoM should always be in front of CoL; be aware CoM shifts around during flight so compensate for the shifting), but part of it is in flight testing before you send it into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip #8: Practice your landings.

To design one, assume your payload fraction is about 4% of your rocket\u0027s total mass and plan your engines accordingly (a launch TWR of 1.2 is good for an SSTO rocket). You then take the mass of the engines and add it to that of your payload; you get the constant \u0022deadweight\u0022 of your rocket, leaving just the fuel tank mass as the only bit you need to determine in Tsiolkovsky. Most fuel tanks in KSP weigh nine times as much full as they do when they\u0027re empty. You work Tsiolkovsky backwards and with that information figure out how much fuel you need for the 4550, and then put everything together in the VAB. Simple stuff, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight profile is just like any other launch: straight up to 10k, 45 degrees at 090 to 25k, then follow the prograde marker on the navball. Keep your gee meter in the green; that means throttling down as you go - expect to make your orbital insertion burn at one-third throttle. When you\u0027re up, cut it loose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractical payload limit for an SSTO rocket is 45 tonnes - by practical, I mean \u0022as much as you can expect to lift with nine Mainsails\u0022.

From what I understand, though, you want to head up to about 25,000 and go horizontal (may be higher; a high as you can go without flaming out the engines). Say on your jets and pick up speed (though watch your throttle so you don\u0027t flame out). When you\u0027ve got orbital velocity, kick in your rocket and give yourself a push upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T22:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall SSTO, 1.2 ton launch weight, 0.3 tons in orbit.
