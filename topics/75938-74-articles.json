They also have a strange behavior when moving at high speeds - they seem to catch on the terrain now and then with a little jerk or twitch. I think it\u0027s a function of how fast you are accelerating, but I\u0027m not sure. Low thrust on that same engine resulted in smooth-ish movement, high thrust = twitchy. Maybe it just has to do with them clipping into the ground though.
