Once you start adding more realistic aero, obviously less souposphere means smaller rockets. This plagued FAR/NEAR users ever since those mods were created, which is why many of us were drawn towards larger scaled solar systems (i.e. 64K) among other reasons such as a grander sized solar system, realism, etc. Now that the souposphere is gone for everyone, the people that never played with FAR/NEAR are now subjected to this problem of having orbit-capable tiny rockets. I tried playing the 1.0.x game with stock scale, and I just cannot do it... it\u0027s just too easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing KScale2 (2x scale) for my \u0022stockalike\u0022 install, and I have to say it\u0027s the best scale I\u0027ve played that best matches the original feel of the game I had when I first started playing KSP around 0.21. It feels like KSP pre-1.0, but with more realistic aero. Double-sized Kerbin with the new aero has a launch to low orbit \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv that roughly matches the pre-1.0 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv. The \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for non-atmo maneuvers is about 50% more than stock (e.g. takes about ~1200 m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to transfer to the Mun), but honestly that doesn\u0027t make the game that much more challenging. It actually balances the parts better by making the 2.5m and 3.75m parts less overpowered for launches (slightly larger payloads for interplanetary transfers \u002B the higher launch \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv). I think Squad dropped the ball on the solar system size. It should have been doubled with the 1.0 release, but unfortunately it\u0027s too late since game breaking changes shouldn\u0027t be introduced to a released game; oh wait...
