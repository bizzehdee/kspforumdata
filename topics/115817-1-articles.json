If so, could you point me at it please? I know that having lots of parts in one area slows things down, but I\u0027m unsure what other factors might come into play. I\u0027m playing KSP 1.04 on 64-bit Linux, in case that\u0027s an issue, and I do not mind turning graphical effects way down if need be if that\u0027ll help speed things up. Is there anything other than using least posisble number of parts and turning graphics quality down that can help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in anticipation,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEsme\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T20:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGraphics quality, par texture resolution(also increases RAM usage?), game window size, the ground scatter (a big hit), aerodynamic effects (another big hit), lights (for some), many parts, lots of smoke and staring at celestial bodies at low orbits (might be because of ground quality too)seem to decrease the performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
