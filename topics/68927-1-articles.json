When I press edit I get a blank edit box with no text in it. I suspect that if I try to save that it will erase the post so I haven\u0060t tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot edit the roll of honour to add people or shorten it, or make a back up of the HTML, likewise I cannot edit the even longer post lower down that page with the previous rolls listed. But I can edit a shorter post below that from the same page and time, so it is not date and must be the length of the posts causing edit to break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is someone has tweaked something to limit post sizes and I would like to ask it if it can be tweaked so that I can save the K-Prize roll else the thread\u0027s roll of honour mechanic is lost with all hands. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T00:01:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, I\u0027m thinking this is some side effect of the 500 Internal Server Errors that people are getting when editing posts at the moment.
