There are no lightsabres, little green men, or warp drives. Mankind has moved out to other planets and moons, as well as the asteroid belt. One of the things I was considering including in the setting is some good old-fashioned war between factions. The question becomes this: in a realistic fictional setting, what are the challenges to something like this? Is it even possible?

Now, while a lot of things approach black body emission and are effectively black bodies, on a whole, treating an entire spacecraft as a black body is stupid. By cooling some sections of a spacecraft, a spacecraft can anisotropically emit its heat, so that in some directions it looks a lot cooler than its overall average temperature and heat production would otherwise force it to be.

However, the background is so faint in space that emitting nothing at all (being at absolute zero) would be almost as good as being at like, 4 kelvins. However, being at 0 degrees K is ALOT harder than being at like, 4 degrees K, so your idea to \u0022emit nothing at all\u0022 would not ever be done, because it is much harder and actually worse than matching the background apparent temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne problem with hiding in space would be when you occulted a bright star from the point of view of the enemy, but that\u0027s where the high velocities and long distances of space come to your advantage.
