Point is, right now, KSP is hard to handle even if you have the hardware in house that should run it smoothly no matter what. You still experience lag on any kind of machine. Even the newest 24 core CPU on the market for insteads. Simply because KSP almost run on one core entirely/not fully have the support to use the other onces as it should.
