Even if that event happens to span 13 billion years of slow stretching down to CMB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m just now reading Lawrence Krauss\\\u0027 \u003Cem\u003EQuintessence\u003C/em\u003E about the history of dark matter, and among its general excellence it points out that special relativity has a second line of reasoning, implicit in Maxwell\\\u0027s equations 20 years(?) earlier - the speed of an electromagnetic wave is dependent on two quantities that are quite measurable in the laboratory and affect all sorts of stuff. If c were not fixed for all inertial observers it wouldn\\\u0027t be a matter of a subtle wiggle in a cunning experiment; serious laws of physics - chemical reactions, atomic cohesion etc. - would break down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who likes to play with relativity, you may enjoy Poul Anderson\\\u0027s hard sci-fi novel \u003Cem\u003ETau Zero\u003C/em\u003E. It\\\u0027s about a Bussard ramjet that gets trapped into going faster and faster \u0027forever\u0027, and gives gentle but detailed explanations about the mathematics of the relativistic velocity factor tau, and how the ship\\\u0027s ever-increasing speed affects the universe around it - fighter-style realtime dodging between star systems on the fringes of a whirling galaxy sparkling with rainbow supernovae is a rather memorable image.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
