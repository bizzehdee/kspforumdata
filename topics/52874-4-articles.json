I don\u0027t buy into the hand-wavey, pseudo-scientific explanations for the tiny size and high density of the Kerbolar system\u0027s planets, I just take it to be that they\u0027ve been scaled down for gameplay purposes, and imagine Kerbin to be the size of earth (not the size of Charon). With that scaling, Laythe would be almost earth-sized, far larger than Europa, and comparisons between the two aren\u0027t really relevant. Laythe would be able to hold onto a far thicker atmosphere, and with a substantial greenhouse effect caused by the right composition of atmosphere, could easily maintain a saltwater ocean near the equator, especially when combined with upwelling of warm water from tidal heating of the core. I doubt it would be habitable though, as most potent greenhouse gases are toxic at partial pressures needed for use as a buffer gas. Sulphur Hexafluoride maybe?

The X-rays would simply be scattered to the point by the atmosphere itself. Ozone would likely form due to the UV radiation but the ozone formed could become an ozone layer behaving fairly similar to Earth\u0027s, however the particle radiation can break down ozone which could prevent the formation, however believe that the UV rays would not be too big of an issue as long as the proper minor UV shielding such as powerful sunscreen. Due to the particle radiation, there could be a decent amount of irradiated substances in the atmosphere and on the surface however the proposals of underground and underwater living would still likely be fairly feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Horn Brain","CreatedById":49626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T22:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022czokletmuss\u0022 data-cite=\u0022czokletmuss\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo what would be the radiation level on its surface then, assuming Jool\u0027s magnetosphere is as powerful as Jupiter\u0027s?

It take surprisingly little to stop radiation. I\u0027ve stood with 3 metres of water between me and more than 100 spent nuclear fuel rods, any one of which would give you a lethal dose in well under a second. My radiation meter showed only a minimal difference between standing there, and sitting in an office. Now, gas isn\u0027t nearly as good at stopping radiation as water (especially not when the water is boronated), but when you have 60km of the stuff, the gas only needs to be one two-hundreth of a percent as effective as the water. And that\u0027s assuming that the radiation outside is as severe as that coming from a nuclear fuel rod, which is wouldn\u0027t be, unless there\u0027s something very fishy going on at Jool!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, (damn you), you made me interested, so I had a stab at working out what the radiation level would be. I used data from here: (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection\u003C/a\u003E) for the halving thickness of air (150m at full pressure). I assumed that the halving thickness scaled linearly with density, and the density scaled linearly with pressure (not quite true, as the temperature will drop the higher in the atmosphere you get, and the density will actually be higher for a given pressure). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI whacked that into an excel spreadsheet, and starting from the top of Laythe\u0027s atmosphere (density, height, and scale height from the KSP wiki) for each 100m increment, I worked out the density of the atmosphere, and from that, the expected halving thickness. I then divided the 100m increment by the expected halving thickness as a rough linearisation to work out how much of the radiation would be absorbed, and fed that into the next 100m increment until I had reached the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, the radiation dose rate at sea level on Laythe, assuming a dose rate at the top of the atmosphere of 5.4 Sv/day (Europa\u0027s environment), and an earth-like composition for Laythe\u0027s atmosphere, is \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E1.8uSv/hr\u003C/span\u003E. This corresponds to an annual dose of \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E15mSv/yr\u003C/span\u003E, which should pose no risk to human health (although Kerbal health is anyone\u0027s guess).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareful though, the higher you climb, the greater the dose. If you get above about 600m, you\u0027re going to be getting a dose of \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E100mSv/yr\u003C/span\u003E, which is firmly linked to an increased chance of cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be noted that those figures are likely an overestimation of the dose, as they underestimate the actual density of the atmosphere, and assume that all of the radiation is hard gamma radiation, which it isn\u0027t.
