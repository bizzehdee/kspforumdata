I never said why, but I knew why even as it happened. It has happened before during Hydra development. The explosion was from KSP thinking an engine inside a fairing below the primary fairing was actually penetrating the second fairing as if it were solid instead of hollow. KSP tries to shift the parts out of each other, but at a certian limit it explodes instead. This is easily testable in the game with creative use of non-physical time warp to get two parts to intersect.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SubzeroSpartan7","CreatedById":100972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T02:55:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the last episode you said you might refuel the craft at the Mun.
