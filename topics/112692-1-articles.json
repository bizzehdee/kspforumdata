Burnt out temporarily, but indeed only temporarily. However, I thought it\u0027d be fun to post a little thread detailing what I\u0027m going to be up to in the next two weeks, something that I am super proud of and excited to be a part of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.schooltheatre.org/thespianfestival2015/home\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EInternational Thespian Festival!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve provided a link to the main page, but basically ITF is a big gathering of student actors, such as myself, from all over the nation and I believe a few other nations as well. I\u0027m not sure which ones are going specifically, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach year, ten schools from the US are picked to perform on the main stage, which means we perform for a nationwide audience. I am lucky enough to be a part of the designated Troupe 1887 from Riverton, WY, and we are performing \u0022Unexpected Tenderness\u0022 (by Israel Horovitz) on the main stage!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMY school hasn\u0027t had the privilege to do so since, like, the 1970\u0027s, so it\u0027s a huge honor to be a part of this thing, and I figured that, if the wifi\u0027s good enough for me to make use of, maybe I\u0027d give some reports on here about what the troupe and I are doing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still mainly inactive on the forums for the next two weeks, and as a matter of fact have a one-night only performance of the show starting here in about six hours, so I\u0027ll leave this here until I get more information. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is so exciting! Thanks for reading, and I will be posting here with updates!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
