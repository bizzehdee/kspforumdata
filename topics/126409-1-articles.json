But it keeps crashing when I try to start the game up when KSP gets close to using 4 gigs of RAM. Turns out I am using 32 bit KSP.

Have deleted and reinstalled numerous times but it still is not there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAm I missing something?

There are too many stability issues with the Unity engine, so the 64-bit version is on hold.
