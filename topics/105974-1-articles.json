Our catalog includes fifteen new missile weapons and and two new unguided munitions! Place your orders today!\n\n*Promethium industries is not responsible for any damage to any persons or objects of any kind and from any source that may possibly be traced to any of the items sold by our organization. All sales are final.*\n\nAfter a long Hiatus I have returned to resume development. School is not yet over so do not expect a miracle since i am remaking all parts and there are at least 150 of them planned.\n\nI will add more details when the forum stops crashing and wasting half an hour of post edits but i wanted to say thank you to SpannerMonkey for maintaining this mod in my absence.\n\nUntil i get things fully underway still refer to his P.E.W Continued thread for an up to date version.\n\nDevelopment progress will be posted on my youtube channel periodically \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHhDcPcC_jNkLuyaUstDtEg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHhDcPcC_jNkLuyaUstDtEg)\n\nIn the spoiler is the current status of all parts in the mod. Some are not listed because hey a man has to have secrets ;). suffice to say what IS listed is going to be epic and what inst will be even more so.\n\nI also want to say thank you to everyone who has downloaded this mod whether long ago or just yesterday. I do this not for money or fame but because i love doing it for you and seeing what others can achieve with my work.\n\nSo once again. Thank you.\n\n| Air to air Missiles | Name | Role | Guidance | Faction | Country | Status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | AIM-7- Sparrow | MR AIM | Radar | NATO | USA | Unity |\n|
