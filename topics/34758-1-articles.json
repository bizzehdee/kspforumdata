Well now you can, with the R-Universe Industries Life-Tech Set! The Life-Tech Set can be used to analyze the surface of celestial bodies across the Kerbol system for signs of life. It also includes futuristic bio-fuel technology, with a tank and an engine. Bio-fuel is renewable but bio-fuel engines don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t generate as much thrust as liquid fuel engines!

I\u0027d like to thank everyone who has helped me out on the way with various questions I\u0027ve had about plugin coding.

The parts seem a bit unwieldy for their size and there are multiple copies of each part for different systems. I tacked a sample gathering and a sample analysis cores to opposite sides of a lander, took it to the Mun, gathered samples and then wasn\u0027t able to transfer it over, so I\u0027m guessing fuel lines are necessary. I tested back on base and if the units are stacked, the analyzer will recognize the samples and process it. I found that the sample didn\u0027t drain into the analyzer and there was no way emptying the sample unit for a fresh sample. I\u0027ve also noticed there are no differences in the large or small parts, other than mass and physical size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZyrac, I know it sounds like I\u0027m highlighting a lot of rough spots, but I think this is a really neat mod and would love to see some more come from it.
