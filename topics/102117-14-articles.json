Even if all the initially announced features make it into the game without adding any new bugs and manage to fix all the old bugs and balance and polish everything (a really big if) the career mode is still fundamentally broken. All the systems might technically be in place, but they\u0027re not implemented in any cohesive way and progression is basically broken, and I\u0027m not sure a simple balance pass will really fix the fundamental issues. This is the mode that reviewers and new players will play because they assume this is how the game is meant to be played, which simply isn\u0027t true at this point. This game is still just a big sandbox, and career is sandbox that holds you back early on by forcing you to grind funds and science points instead of guiding new players through the game as was originally intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still puzzled (and more than a little annoyed) by this whole thing, it seems like starting with the curse decision Squad has made major decisions behind closed doors with minimal community input (replacing spaceport with curse, the jump from .25 to .90, and now the 1.0 release) and haven\u0027t relented at all despite the massive community backlash (i.e. to all appearances they basically ignored the community), yet now that there\u0027s a hard deadline and Squad is getting worried we\u0027re finally being asked for input. I\u0027m not trying to put down Squad, but I am kind of frustrated with this whole situation, as there\u0027s obviously something going on behind the scenes that\u0027s not being communicated that has the potential to really harm this game by forcing Squad to cut corners and release before it\u0027s ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, if you really must go forward with 1.0, my priorities would be as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECritical\u003C/strong\u003E (i.e. don\u0027t even think of shipping without these)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFix frustrating bugs (anything gamebreaking, memory leaks, gui bugs, EVApult, editor, decoupler, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolish (consistent textures and UI, fix typos and small glitches, IVAs for all parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart Balance (doesn\u0027t have to be final, but don\u0027t ship with broken placeholder values for parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAero \u0026amp; heating (these are way overdue and have a large effect on the early game, you don\u0027t want to be changing this later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer balance (fix the nonsensical contracts and tech tree, fix early game balance and progression)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProper tutorials so new players and reviewers aren\u0027t totally lost (make these easily discoverable, maybe have a way to jump straight to a tutorial from career instead of having to back all the way out to the main menu)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHigh\u003C/strong\u003E (Highly recommended for 1.0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFix more bugs (planet destroyer, occasional kraken attacks on very large vessels, stuff that takes a fair amount of effort and knowledge of the bug to reproduce)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerformance optimizations (game loading time, physics performance, memory usage, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeltaV readouts and engineer reports (makes rocket building a lot easier)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few new parts to fill holes in the current lineup (nothing too fancy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMedium\u003C/strong\u003E (if there\u0027s time, otherwise push to 1.1 or whatever)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome kind of main quest series of contracts for career (visit all the anomalies and bring back samples?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFemale Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobust modding interfaces for everything (i.e. nothing hardcoded, should also include a planet modding interface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImproved graphics (especially planet clouds and textures)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELow\u003C/strong\u003E (probably best to push to the next update at least)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISRU/mining (doesn\u0027t affect early game at all, can be easily added later for more endgame)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore launch sites\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther features\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity 5 (wait until it\u0027s ready first)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally hoping that this next update does the game justice regardless of what number it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: In light of the post below, I would also agree that Squad should focus more on parts of the game not accessible to modders. My list above would be for a situation where Squad is committed to continued development and wants to make the best initial impression given limited time constraints. If there is any chance at all that this game won\u0027t receive the dev attention it needs after release, then Squad needs to double down on bugfixing, performance and implementing a robust modding interface to build a solid foundation that the modding community can build on top of. Games that are mod friendly tend to have much longer lifetimes (and sell more copies in the long run because of it) even if the initial release isn\u0027t perfect (case and point: the elder scrolls games).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-19T17:04:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2015 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T16:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed with the above post.

I\u0027ve seen mention of this also being the case if the part contains more that two types of resources (with a work-around being to not place those resource defintions contiguously in the part CFG). But with the decouplers, that work-around doesn\u0027t work, and I can think of use cases where you might want to decouple ALL BUT ONE of the attachment points, so the omni-decoupler option doesn\u0027t work either. Right now, to keep the parts bug-free, they can\u0027t have any more than two detachable nodes if they\u0027re not omni-decouplers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* ModuleJettison currently has a few issues. The jettison direction vector seems to impart spin on some panels, rather than define the actual direction, when using multi-panel fairings. The only stock part to do this is the nuclear engine, and it uses two panels, and it seems that the jettison directions are hardcoded and not truly honoring the settings in the CFG. Unless of course I\u0027m doing something way, way wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* ModuleJettison also disconnects ALL FAIRINGS FROM ALL NODES, and not just the ones associated with the node that actually detached, and whether the decoupler was in the same part or not.
