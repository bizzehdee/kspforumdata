Just think of Apollo 13, where they had to improvise an adapter to use the CMs CO2 scrubbers in the LM. With a 3D printer, they just could have printed an adapter, designed by the engineers on Earth. That is also why NASA is exploring 3D printing on ISS: They want to use it to print all those little things that you might have forgot to bring up with you. A 3D printed screwdriver might be of worse quality than a normal one, but at least you have one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-27T18:17:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2016 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tullius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T19:15:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222825834\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477570697\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022147982\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kunok\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, kunok said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3d printing is just a fancy new name to the additive manufacturing, a concept somewhat old.

It\u0027s their (Musk/Bezos) money, if their \u0022save humanity\u0022 notion is Mars, it has no impact on me at all, who I am I to say they should spend it on some other pet project to save humanity---they can spend it the same way Bender would, for all I care.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m all for the billionaire space race, but the idea that Mars is economically feasible is pretty comical. Bezos has a better business model, IMO, the tourism market is just a matter of cost when it comes down to it. Like most things, it\u0027s just a matter of price. We spend 10s of thousands on a vacation, for example (direct costs for travel someplace like Europe for 4 people, plus opportunity costs (lost income))---but a few hundred grand is out of the question. If a week in orbit was ever on the same order of magnitude as a week on the other side of the Earth... where do I buy my tickets?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
