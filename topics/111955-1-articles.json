With a physical \n\nedition we didn\u2019t want to give you just a USB drive or disc with the \n\ngame on it, but we wanted to make something a bit more special, that\u2019s \n\nworth investing in. Like every Gamer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Edition, the Kerbal Space Program\n\n collection includes a Steam code, is packaged in an individually \n\nnumbered presentation box and is part of a one-off run that will not be \n\nrepeated.\n\nWhat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s in the box?\n\n- Four hand-painted \n    Kerbal figurines - Bill, Bob and Jebediah Kerman plus a standard \n\n    Kerbalnaut, each showing varying emotional reactions to the adventure \n\n    that awaits.\n\n- A stirring diorama backdrop - which optimistically suggests you have made it to the moon.\n\n- Official Kerbal Space Program \n    mobile - allowing you to ponder the hypnotic vastness of space and the \n\n    quantity of space junk and unlucky Kerbals you have scattered across it.\n\n- Official Kerbal Space Program patch - proudly displaying the Latin motto of the program: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDemum Pervenius\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 (lit.
