For example, somebody already built a submarine (using Jumbo tanks as balast to stay underwater) and nothing got deleted from that ship. Also when a badly hyperedited floating platform bugged out to ocean floor (-600 m) in some challenge I was doing, it surfaced after five or so minutes, jumped into the air and crashed down and only by that time things started disappearing.
