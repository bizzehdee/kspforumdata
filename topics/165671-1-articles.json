I just updated to 1.3.0, and had a strange graphical issue where when I went to the astronaut complex, it looked like there were no active Kerbals or Kerbals available to hire, even though the tab showed\u00A0I had 8\u00A0active Kerbals, and there should have been Kerbals available to hire on the other half of the screen even if I had no active Kerbals. I tried deleting\u00A0a few mods thinking one might cause problems with the new version, with no change.\u00A0I figured I would back up my KSP directory and do a clean install. I deleted the entire KSP directory and used Steam to download and install a clean copy with no mods/changes, 100% stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow when I am in the game, if I click on the astronaut complex, the buttons on the left side disappear (the buttons for entering the various buildings/complexes), and the \u0022apps\u0022 buttons in the lower right go away, and the red exit/back button in the upper right goes grey, but it doesn\u0027t actually go into the complex, and only the escape key seems to have any effect at that point. If I hit escape, all the on-screen buttons/controls come back. I can enter other buildings like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and the R\u0026amp;D building. If I go into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, it looks like the marker lines on the floor are painted with what looks like snow from an\u00A0old TV tuned to a channel that doesn\u0027t exist (static/snow). The normally white lines are white/black static, and the normally yellow lines are yellow/black static. If I build a rocket and launch it, the Navball has a circular section in the center where I can see the outdoor scene/launchpad that should be behind the navball. There are probably more graphical anomalies, but I haven\u0027t taken the time to do a thorough inventory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running Ubuntu 16.10. I was running graphics drivers for my GTX 1060 direct from nvidia, version 375.26. I tried updating the drivers to the latest version 384.69, but that caused no change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas how I can get back to a working installation of KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikep554","CreatedById":181494,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-20T04:14:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just solved a big part of my problem. When I said I had a stock install, I had forgotten I had made one modification. I am using a 4k TV as a monitor. In order to make the game playable, in the past I manually\u00A0edited the settings.conf file and changed the UI_SCALE value to something higher than the 1.5 (150%) normally allowed through the gui. I had the setting at 3. I changed it back to 1.5, and I can now enter the astronaut complex, and the navball is working normally. With the advanced tweakables, I have all the objects with individual controls set to 150%, and it is just barely playable with the overall UI_SCALE at 1.5. The biggest problem, which has always existed since I have been on 4k, is some text is still almost microscopic. A good example is the speed/apoapsis/periapsis data when you hover the cursor over an object in orbit in the map view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I still have the static/snow lines on the floor of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
