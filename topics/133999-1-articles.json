When I press launch, the game works at normal FPS until after KJR starts doing its magic. After physics are fully initialized my game drops to 10 fps. Once I jettison the boosters, FPS automatically jump back to 30. When they crash/disappear I get another FPS boost which takes me back to the normal 40/50.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nHappens with anything radially attached and exposed to the airstream (not with things radially attached but kept inside a fairing).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHappens when the parts are attached either to procedurally generated parts, stock parts or mod parts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHappens at all symmetry levels, even x1.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHappens with any radial decoupler\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHappens even If I\u0027m not using decouplers (i.e. non detachable boosters)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how long this could\u0027ve been happening so I can\u0027t track exactly which mod caused it.
