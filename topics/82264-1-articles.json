I think the rear nozzles are just far enough back not to be damaged. I agree that copying the harrier would be ideal for that reason, but it would limit design possibilities in other ways. Maybe I could make another engine with identical thrust that is a 1.25m diameter in front and .625 in back. The added benefit of a design like that, front and rear vertical engines, is you could limit thrust one one engine to balance your center of thrust, making balancing MUCH easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see by the last video though, you can definitely build with a single engine, which gets rid of this problem entirely. You just have to be more mindful of your center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe animation is WAY too fast. This was a prototype, which I got working in game just before my computer froze and I lost my working files in Blender and Unity. So I have the exported part, but I have to rebuild it if I\u0027m going to make any changes to the mesh, textures or animation. No biggie though, because now I know everything I need to go from a box to an animated VTOL engine and . . . knowing is half the battle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T18:24:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022norcalairman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022norcalairman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe I could make another engine with identical thrust that is a 1.25m diameter in front and .625 in back.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Why not a set of various widths?
