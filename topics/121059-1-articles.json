The problem is that they need A LOT OF ELECTRIC CHARGE! I have made a spaceplane with enough DeltaV and all, but my problem I can\u0027t stop the Gigantor solar panels from blowing up from heat.

Perhaps you need to place a radiator nearby to shed any accumulated heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s during ascent, keep in mind that the Gigantor needs to be stowed/not activated all the way to space. Secondly, unless you\u0027ve mounted them in-line/end on, they generate much more drag, and this causes heat. Always mounted them so when stowed the long bar is parallel to your normal direction of travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ulico","CreatedById":136006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T01:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I have no idea why I haven\u0027t been using a cargo bay!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T02:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the KAS attachment system mod, so you can attach them after you get to space, and stow them away when you go back.
