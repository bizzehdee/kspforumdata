Parts (like NTRs) would be point sources, so I\u0027m assuming they could be handled as calculating a vector between origins, ray casting to see if any shadow shields are in the way, and attenuating the source strength by the vector magnitude (inverse square) and total shielding level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best thought I had for tracking Chronic and Acute exposures was to implement a \u0022radiation\u0022 resource, \u0022Rad-hardness\u0022 would dictate what percentage of radiation received is stored, and the counter would tick down over time to simulate the bodies repair of the damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not 100% real, but I think that mechanism would be a good balance for game-play/implementation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds awesome!
