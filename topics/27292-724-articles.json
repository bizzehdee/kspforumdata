I\u0027d get rid of the nose-mounted intake in favor of a more aerodynamic nosecone though. nosecone intakes produce a LOT of drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecondly: you\u0027re packing an awful lot of fuel, especially oxidizer. Try cutting down on the fuel a little. It might seem counter-intuitive, but less fuel = less weight, both because you\u0027re saving weight on fuel, but also on tanks. If you\u0027re simply looking to get a small amount of kerbals (1-4) to orbit, going smaller is usually better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elastly, while your rabbit\u0027s foot looks pretty cool, I would advise against designs that use double wings. You really don\u0027t need that much lift surface, and remember that the overwhelming part of speed your SSTO\u0027s need to get into orbit is horizontal, not vertical. Keep your designs as sleek as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: looking at the bullpup in the latest picture: your CoL is a bit far away from the CoM to my liking. Personally I would move the wings forward a little or add canards to compensate, but that\u0027s just me. If you can handle her as she is now, don\u0027t worry too much about it, but I personally think it\u0027s easier if you keep the CoM and CoL markers touching throughout the flight\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-25T07:37:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cirocco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T08:07:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe handling is all right on the Bullpup.

I needed to de orbit using my mono propellant, but I couldn\u0027t get docking mode to translate forward and backward thrust. I only have 2 RCS thruster blocks on my craft. Does that have something to do with it? (I tried in rotation mode and translate mode. Neither worked.)

Manned vessels don\u0027t count... but you might find something like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93067-1-0-4-Modular-Rocket-Systems-v1-7-3-(2015-07-07)-Stock-alike-Parts-Pack\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMRS\u003C/a\u003E handy, since it adds a mk1 cargo bay that\u0027s about the size of the docking port you\u0027re using. Also, monoprop; dead weight on a ship this size \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Rabbit, I \u003Cem\u003Elove \u003C/em\u003Ethe design, but I don\u0027t think you need those extra monoprop tanks, they\u0027re heavy, \u003Cem\u003Eand \u003C/em\u003Ethey\u0027re causing extra drag. The 75 MP in the docking port and 15 in the capsule is more than enough for multiple dockings, assuming you get to a rough approximation of the right position using main engines (i.e. about 50m directly in front of the port you want to attach to). You look like you\u0027ve balanced the RCS around a near-dry weight, which is good, and I bet you can dock with less than 10 monoprop if you line up carefully first and tap H. (Tip for this; get your station to point its docking port at yours, then point yours at its. Then you have a perfect \u0027up\u0027 vector in order to dock and there\u0027s no MP wasted on translation manoeuvres. You can even build planes with only one direction of RCS and still be able to dock them in this manner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZMDi9I3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZMDi9I3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E has perfect RCS balance and can approach from 40-50m with the H key, and not deviate. If you have a pilot/probe/mechjeb on the station, you can get it to rotate to track your docking port as you approach, which even allows for a little bit of lateral movement, since the magnets on the ports will catch you if you\u0027re a few degrees off.)\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also suspect you don\u0027t need the lower pair of vertical stabilisers on the Rabbit, which would again cut out some drag. 1.0.4 has proven to be less about raw thrust, and more about sleek, smooth, low-drag shapes. On that note, I suspect that the right-angled leading edges on your wings are bad for drag, but I don\u0027t have a suggestion that won\u0027t change the design completely...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom suggestion; take a small nosecone and put it on the back of your rapiers. The thrust comes from the four nozzles around it, and will be unaffected, but you\u0027ll lower the drag and get better atmo efficiency \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33312-Showcase-SSTOs%21-Post-your-pictures-here\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESSTO Showcase\u003C/a\u003E thread for a range of good designs and helpful peeps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-25T08:35:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2015 08:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T08:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I definitely researched SSTOs heavily before attempting to make these, but it\u0027s all different once you start making one of your own.
