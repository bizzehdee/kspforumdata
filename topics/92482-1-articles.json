I was looking through some of the file folders in my installation of KSP and saw something that really alludes to a future feature about private contracting that I haven\u0027t seen any discussion about.

I\u0027ve been visiting here for a loooooong time, but never have had the opportunity to join in discussions and such. I actually didn\u0027t think that this thread was my first post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so I saw that Agencies that offer contracts are going to have different mindsets, which will affect the types of contracts given by each agency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example... Commercial, Conglomerate, Hasty, Pioneering, Scientific, Kerbalminded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach mindset seems to have a specific quality, like offering contracts specifically to do something that has never been done before, or setting up conditions against losing Kerbals, or even completing the mission in a \u0022Hasty\u0022 manner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in there is a company that competes against companies we have a negative standing towards, and even companies that offer higher stake reputation gains or losses based on the success or failure of a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo reputation will be specific to certain companies. You can be on the bad side of some, or the hero of others, and I think it will affect how much a contract from a company can provide if completed based on reputation with that specific company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this in anyway is a post not allowed, please forgive me being na\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AFve about the forum rules. I would not be offended of a moderator deleted this thread if it violates any sort of player/developer guidelines. Secondly, if this is being discussed elsewhere in the forums, just disregard this as a double post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T22:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEr, I think that\u0027s an already-implemented feature. Agencies are the companies that offer contracts, and they offer different ones based on your overall reputation and your history of completing contracts for them. I believe the different mindsets affects, as you suspect, the types of contracts offered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baconation","CreatedById":122914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T22:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I wasn\u0027t sure if it was something that was fully realized within the game yet. I was thinking the interface may change within the system to be more emphasizing on those mentalities for each agency. Seeing as the contract generation stories each are based differently on the type of mentality of each agency. Gamedata/Squad/Agencies is where I found this information. I\u0027ve logged almost a thousand hours of playtime and had yet to see any elaboration in the game on those mentalities, or even something that mentions it in game on the UI, or within some sort of informative parameter. I think right now, the contract system is very basic, and with the implementation of the Fine Print mod, we will see a much more substantial contract system, that will hopefully include more information in-game about the mentalities of these agencies. I just think it may be too confusing for the player if it was something that was never visually implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T22:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could be right, they might be planning to make the underpinnings of the contract system more visible to the player.

It should add a good feel to the whole contract system and really have the player focus on whether they want to be in good with certain companies and such. Just seems like it will create more of a personalization in each person\u0027s career save without really affecting craft files and such for sharing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
