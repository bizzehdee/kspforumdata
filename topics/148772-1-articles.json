I\u0027m planning to make an animated KSP movie.\u00A0(Now you read the first sentence, please don\u0027t yell \u0022WHEN IT WILL COME OUT!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the general idea of a story:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYears after (actually, 100 000\u0027s of years after) Voyager 1 \u0022\u0022\u0022somehow\u0022\u0022\u0022 ends up in a trajectory towards Kerbol as Kerbals discover it. Having no idea what it is, Mission Control will suspiciously redirect an \u0022asteroid redirect\u0022 mission secretly to find out about the alien device, which will cause some rumours to spread through Kerbals. It will be a little like 2001, but, er..., in a Kerbal way, monolith replaced by Voyager 1, the evil AI replaced by some other hostility-towards-unknown-supporter\u00A0Kerbal group. Some conflicts will happen between science-supporter Kerbals and not-so-sure-or-hostile Kerbal group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of the movie,\u00A0science-and-peace-supporter\u00A0Kerbals will examine golden record, will start a project like SETI, and will send a signal into space like Arecibo Message,\u00A0in a search for civilisation just like theirs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have completed almost nothing until now, just wanted to see if people wants to support this. I need more story, and hopefully, more and better 3d models. I have some models in my hand, but they are not enough in means of number and quality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be very nice if I could somehow ask Squad, but I don\u0027t exactly know what to say. \u0022I wanna make a movie give them all!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-27T14:16:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2016 02:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by HAL 9001\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-27T23:28:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinda sounds like a follow-up to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/20137-nassault630/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002220137\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/20137-nassault630/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nassault630\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EVOYAGER\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0film, based off Scott Manley\u0027s Interstellar Quest series.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/EgIVnvunLuQ?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HAL 9001","CreatedById":165619,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T19:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhoah, I was following Nassault, but I didn\u0027t even see that!
