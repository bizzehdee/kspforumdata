We can all sit and talk until the cows come home about every pro and con of each sort of orbit/transfer/rendezvous technique there is. But if you manage to get your Kerbals to the Mun, by getting a slingshot off Minmus via the sun, (apart from being worshipped as some form of sorceror) it will make you feel warm inside and people will probably try your method of doing things. \u003Cp\u003ETutorials help with KSP, and there are many fantastic ones out there. They only help to a certain extent though, sure if you wanted to you could copy everything you have seen in guides and either fail or succeed each time. Take what you think works best for you out of each thing you watch, read or listen to. Apply it to your own designs, if it works for you, keep it, if not then bin it.

To lower it, burn retrograde (the other way).

This isn\u0027t the cheapest way to do it, but it\u0027s the easiest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen trying to match orbits for a rendezvous, first make sure your inclinations are matched so both orbits are on the same plane, then get the orbits fairly similar.

This will move you to a lower orbit, which has a shorter period, so you\u0027ll move forward closer to your target. If your target is even with you but farther outward, burn pointing forwards (prograde). This increases your orbital velocity, which makes your orbit get larger, which moves you outward towards your target. Et cetera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next thing to learn would probably be phase angles. If you\u0027re seen video tutorials for how to get to the Mun, you\u0027ve probably seen the technique of getting in a low Kerbin orbit (LKO) and then waiting until you see the Mun rise and burning prograde at that time to get a transfer orbit that will be at the Mun\u0027s orbit when the Mun gets to that point in its orbit. Burn much earlier or much later and you get to the Mun\u0027s orbit when the Mun is in the wrong spot. That\u0027s because the Mun happens to be orbiting at just the right distance so that the angle it\u0027s at when it rises is just right to make that work. This is either a happy coincidence, or evidence of intelligent design (on the dev\u0027s part, to make things easier for seat of the pants flying). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe angle between your ship and the Mun, centered in the middle of Kerbin, is called the phase angle. and in this case (LKO to the Mun) its a little less than 90 degrees. If you\u0027re in a higher orbit, or going to something in a different orbit (like Minimus), it will be different. It\u0027s a measure of how far your target will move around it\u0027s orbit while you\u0027re moving around your transfer orbit. It takes a bit of math to figure it out, but it\u0027s not too bad. I\u0027ll leave the math as an exercise to the reader, since this is getting too long. Do a web search and I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll find the formula.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-19T04:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had some problems with orbital mechanics when i first started as well.

Between these two people I have been able to play this game XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as ship design, I think the two most important things to know are TWR and Dellta-V. TWR stands for thrust-to-weight ratio and is most important when you are in a gravity well (ie. taking off from Kerbin, landing on Mun, Minmus... etc) The higher your TWR, the faster you will escape Kerbin\u0027s lower, denser atmosphere. The second one, Delta-V is easy to understand but a little harder and more labor intensive to calculate. Basically, delta-v is how much energy your rocket can expend to move itself about. It stands to reason that to get into orbit requires less energy than to reach the moon. There is an equation that can help you to calculate exactly how much energy your ship can give you , but it is not REALLY necessary. Honestly, until now I haven\u0027t even bothered with delta-v and have been able to get to every celestial body in the Kerbol system as of yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR Pebble_Garden and Illectro have very good instructional videos, and learn about Thrust-to-Weight ratios and at least understand the concept of Delta-V\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nivvydaskrl","CreatedById":6789,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-19T14:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt risk of sounding terribly self-promoting, my blog here on the KSP site (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/blog.php/6794-nivvydaskrl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/blog.php/6794-nivvydaskrl\u003C/a\u003E) has a lot of the math for various fun things, and I\u0027m always looking for more things to write about.
