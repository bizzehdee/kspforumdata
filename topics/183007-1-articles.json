Should the kerbals be able to transfer from the command pod to the lander can through the docking port? If so what actions do I need to take to \u0022open\u0022 the docking port to allow transfer - does this need to be done before or after docking?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did manage to EVA out all the crew and get them settled but that was kind of a let down to be honest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically the setup was Lander Can:Docking Port\u00A0 -\u0026gt;\u0026lt;- Docking Port: Mk2 Command Pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-21T23:11:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Stock Tech Support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat was preventing you from moving them?\u00A0\u00A0 Was the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E option not there?
