Sure the average player won\u0027t reach 30 launches in a month, but there will be plenty who would just see the need to switch launch sites as an annoyance rather than a serious mission planning consideration. With a hard limit on launches exists, it would force decisions about what to launch and when because you would not want to be suddenly in a position where you couldn\u0027t launch the final piece of an interplanetary craft because you\u0027d launched too many communications satellites, or where you couldn\u0027t resupply your station with life support because you launched too much in support of an interplanetary mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I guess another way to implement this would be to just set the cooldown timers to something much longer, like a few months.
