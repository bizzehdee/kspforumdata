My signal strength at the time was such that I there was about a 100-200 day communication window and then you have to wait for Kerbin and Duna\u0027s orbits to align again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure you can already see where this is going...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I detach a relay from the parent ship, I have this 5 second period of vulnerability, in that the relay doesn\u0027t have its solar panels deployed. I just need 5 seconds to get to a safe distance of about 20 feet and deploy them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I detached it, and \u003Cstrong\u003E2 seconds later\u003C/strong\u003E lost signal to Kerbin.

The battery would go on to die over the next 2 years of orbit required to get another transmission window. A probe with a dead battery cannot unfurl its solar panels to charge its battery, so it\u0027s a catch-22. I will have to send a new relay satellite, or send a manned mission to manually unfold the panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realize that if I had switched to another craft immediately and time warped, KSP would not calculate battery drain on the relay, but I decided this felt unrealistic to me, so I\u0027m choosing not use use this game mechanic to save me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUgh... what are the chances?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-11T06:51:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2019 06:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Xavven\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperMiiBrother","CreatedById":192341,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-17T01:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223538560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182093\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221549867848\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022100398\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xavven\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/11/2019 at 1:50 AM, Xavven said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I detached it, and \u003Cstrong\u003E2 seconds later\u003C/strong\u003E lost signal to Kerbin.
