So, the mod works fine, great mod by the way, I find it incredibly essenential, especially the model rework pack. Anyway, when I have th mod installed on my game, there is this white pill shaped object both in the editor and in flight. The pill looks like the unity player asset or something from the whack-a-kerbal? This is getting very annoying to deal with through the game, especially on EVA\u0027s and whatnot.\n\nIf anyone needs any additional information like the ksp log or screenshots or anything, I\u0027d be happy to supply them.

I\u0027ve read so many of the pages on this thread and I\u0027ve tried every suggestion I read: deleted all other mods; re-installed IR and Legacy parts; reinstalled with surface sampler, rework, and sequencer; verified integrity of game files for KSP via Steam; deleted the .ksp file in AssetBundles; etc. (That is only what I remember.) I followed these instructions but the tab is still not there. The weird thing is that I had it working fine last weekend. It let me save the craft and everything. If I try to open the file for the craft now, however, it says there are invalid parts. Also, when I click on the IR button on the bottom-right, it says on the top-right in red letters \u0022NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\u0022 Also, when I open any of the Rework Part .cfg files, under editor parameters, \u0022category = none\u0022, which means it isn\u0027t set to the robotics tab or any other tab. For the Legacy Parts, this parameter equals \u0022Utilities\u0022.\n\nWhen I first installed IR, I did not install any parts so it just had nothing in the robotics tab, and everything else worked fine.\n\nI also wanted to know if there is any way to get this mod on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E; I couldn\u0027t find it. I deleted \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, thinking *maybe* it could be the cause of all this--it was the only thing I did relating to KSP since IR had worked. I downloaded (and deleted) it yesterday.\n\nHere is what i\u0027m doing:\n\n1) Download everything.\n\n2) Paste Downloads\\IR-2.0.11-Final-Core.zip\\IR-2.0.11-Final-Core\\GameData\\**MagicSmokeIndustries** into Kerbal Space Program\\**GameData**.\n\n3) Paste Downloads\\IR-LegacyParts.zip\\IR-LegacyParts\\GameData\\MagicSmokeIndustries\\Parts\\**Legacy** into Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\MagicSmokeIndustries\\**Parts**.\n\n4) Paste Downloads\\IR-LegacyParts.zip\\IR-LegacyParts\\GameData\\MagicSmokeIndustries\\**IR\\_TweakScale.cfg** into Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\**MagicSmokeIndustries**.\n\n5) Paste Downloads\\Rework\\_Repack\\_1.1.2.zip\\GameData\\MagicSmokeIndustries\\Parts\\**Rework\\_Core**, **Rework\\_Expansion**, **Rework\\_Utility**, and **Rework\\_TweakScale.cfg** into Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\MagicSmokeIndustries\\**Parts**.\n\n6) Paste Downloads\\IR-Surface-Sampler-master.zip\\IR-Surface-Sampler-master\\GameData\\MagicSmokeIndustries\\Parts\\Rework\\_Utility\\Plugins\\**IRSurfaceSampler.dll** and **IRSurfaceSamplerLocalization.cfg** into Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\MagicSmokeIndustries\\Parts\\Rework\\_Utility\\**Plugins**.\n\nThere are files in so many places for the Surface Sampler mod, I\u0027m just going to leave that out, but it would be more of the same pattern as shown above.\n\nThis has not worked, and I\u0027ve tried at least six times.
