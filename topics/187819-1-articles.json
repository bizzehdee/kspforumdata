What I\u0027d like to see more than anything else though is the ability to create \u0022internal\u0022 spaces; the game actually understanding that something is sitting in a shielded spot and should not be affected by drag and stuff - without having to specifically put it inside a fairing or prefab cargo bay. Of course I still also want the \u0022old fashioned\u0022 fairings and bays and stuff for convenience when making those simple rockets that just go somewhere and deploy something and they\u0027re done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy do I want to be able to build custom shielded interiors? Story time.\u00A0Ever since I first threw my wallet at the screen when I found KSP on the Steam store it has been my dream to send a majestic carrier ship on a grand voyage to visit new worlds up close\u00A0and have it launch a smaller ship for landing on planets with\u00A0too unforgiving gravity for the carrier itself, however this smaller ship should also be powerful enough to get back off the surface and dock safely\u00A0inside the motherships hangar. How close have I gotten to this in the years since? Not close at all. The first thing I learned was that a shielded interior volume is solely the privilege of cargo bays or fairings, crushing my hope of ever having a hangar actually do anything\u00A0to the ships properties\u00A0other\u00A0than add dry mass. At least Breaking Ground added hinges so\u00A0a hangar can have doors that open and close, but yeah...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that fairings can be used for is to create a little more freeform geometry, something I\u0027ve appreciated in colony building - you can use massive fairings as really clean and beautiful exterior walls for buildings. Unfortunately really large fairings cause\u00A0severe lag and trying to clip decor into them (a colony building without some windows is.... pretty dull)\u00A0has wildly unpredictable results, anything between nothing bad whatsoever happening and extremely aggressive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E. Yet another thing that can be done with fairings is to\u00A0make them open ended; \u0022close\u0022 them around some other round thing (if you use another fairing for this you can fine tune the width) and then move that thing out of the way and you have a big protected interior space. Unfortunately accessing this space can be... unpredictable at best. Sometimes you can get other things to go in there and sometimes the end is a solid\u00A0invisible wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore freeform EVERYTHING! That would be my greatest wish today. I\u0027ll always want to build something far beyond what a game can handle but every step further down Freedom Road will bring me happiness. An array of procedural parts would be like 5 good leaps and an extra jump of joy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-29T17:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223662688\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187819\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221567093876\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all reality, I\u0027d rather see the old procedural fairings mod become the new stock fairing.
