I was wondering if there was a setting to have it enabled there as well (the atmospheric scattering, the sunflares, and the reduced ambient space lighting). \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The Tracking Station can be a cool place to take a visual tour of the solar system and it would be great to enable the enhanced visual settings while in it.\n\u003E \n\nSince the move to 1.1, loading atmospheres is much faster and only takes a split second, technically there shouldn\u0027t be any reason to have effects disabled in tracking station anymore, I\u0027m planning to enable it back, but have to change a few things there and add null checks for PQS since tracking station has no PQS."},{"CreatedByName":"Tekener","CreatedById":117427,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T01:20:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3.5.2016 at 4:43 AM, Diesel5187 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/) any chance you can update the mod on CKAN so it says it\u0027s 1.1.2 compatible?\n\u003E \n\nYes, would be nice, otherwise CKAN refuses to install it ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hookswords","CreatedById":104719,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T04:05:55Z","Content":"I just wanted to stop by and thank you for all the hard work you put into modding.
