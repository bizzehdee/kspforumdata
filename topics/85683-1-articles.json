Let me state that pretty much EVERYTHING (including you, me and everyone) is radioactive but on a very variable scale, some things are absolutely harmless while others seriously dangerous. Uranium is on the edge of the harmless side giving off small amounts of alpha radiation (a pack of bananas is more radioactive then a handful of uranium ore). Hopefully this explanation gives more insight into the complex world of radiation and why things branded as radioactive can be quite safe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun fact: nuclear power plant workers handling pellets wear gloves not to protect themselves but the fuel from contamination.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-29T21:51:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2014 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by xenomorph555\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T21:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUranium is pretty radioactive, as anybody who\u0027s had the classic demonstration with a bit of pitchblende (uranium ore) and a Geiger counter in school can testify.

That only really happens during fission, you\u0027d have to get a reaction for that to occur. But I do agree with you about the radiation levels of uranium. I own a geiger counter, and even in granite (3-5 parts per million uranium), I get about 140 uSv/h (micro Sieverts per hour), compared to only 15 uSv/h of normal background radiation. It is definitely something that is fairly radioactive (fuel grade uranium is something like 2000 ppm, not totally sure), especially when refined.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-30T02:05:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2014 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by YourEverydayWaffle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duxwing","CreatedById":42282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T02:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I think we can agree uranium should be secured and would not devastate whatever lay downrange should the rocket fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next important questions are: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Who should launch uranium into orbit?
