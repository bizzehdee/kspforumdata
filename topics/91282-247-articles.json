Nation E is the upstart, having risen in silence following the previous planet-wide conflict. Nation A and Nation B have already collapsed after a limited nuclear war. Nation A was better off than Nation B, with much of its nuclear arsenal surviving and the successor states to nation A (referred to from here forth as Nation F) have allied with Nation C.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation C suffered the worst of the economic fallout (no pun intended) of the limited war between A and B, Nation D is doing relatively fine, while Nation E has devolved into total totalitarianism and expansionism. Nation E has reached its limit, and is \u0022at the borders\u0022 of the other nations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe C-F alliance have a combined force of 30 SSBNs, each with 16 SLBMs, with 10 MIRVs each. They also have an ICBM force of 950 missiles each with one warhead. 18 IRBMs are also operated by Nation C, within striking range of major cities under the control of Nation D. Nation F also has 285 strategic bombers capable of carrying four bombs and eight cruise missiles each, along with 72 stealth bombers capable of carrying 16 bombs each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation D has seven old SSBNs with 20 SLBMs each, with 10 MIRVs per SLBM, and 10 new SSBNs with 16 SLBMs each, with 10 MIRVs per SLBM. It also has 1400 ICBMs, each with one warhead. Nation D also possesses a small force of 100 four engine turboprop bombers carrying six cruise missiles each, and 50 jet powered swept wing bombers also capable of carrying six cruise missiles each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation E has 50 SSBNs with 18 SLBMs each, with 10 MIRVs per SLBM. It also has 20 ICBMs each with 10 MIRVs. Nation E also possesses a large number of strategic bombers but only 100 weapons for them, resulting in an operational nuclear bomber force of six subsonic stealth bombers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA conflict has erupted between the C-F alliance and Nation D at a historical flash point and has escalated to a full scale nuclear exchange. Their entire ICBM forces and Nation C\u0027s IRBMs are depleted and their strategic bombers are well underway to each other\u0027s homeland and rerouting is unfeasible due to positioning of airborne tanker assets and the destruction of their bases by missiles. This leaves their SSBN force, about 2/10ths of which has been fired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the forces look like this-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC-F Alliance- 27 SSBNs, with 432 SLBMs, with 4320 MIRVs in total. A 30% weapon absolute failure rate (not even a fizzle) will occur, although of course the participants in this conflict have no way of knowing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation D- 16 SSBNs with 295 SLBMs, with 2950 MIRVs in total. A 37% weapon absolute failure rate (not even a fizzle) will occur, again, no one knows this and it is of no value to either side but I thought I would mention it anyway just in case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation E- 50 SSBNs with 900 SLBMs, with 9000 MIRVs in total. Also 20 ICBMs with a total of 200 MIRVs between each other. A 30% weapon absolute failure rate (not even a fizzle) will occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation E must split its forces between Nation D and the C-F alliance. It has utilized real time reconnaissance footage and AI to calculate the optimum targets (remaining population centers, ground based military forces of D and C-F have been annihilated and there is no point in hitting the cities that have already been destroyed). However, D and C-F have agreed to a cease fire and will launch their remaining forces against Nation E, resulting in a total of 7270 warheads targeting Nation E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to ABM forces-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation E- ICBMs are defended by 60 KKV interceptor missiles. Space based ABM forces consist of 10 single launch Smart Rocks type crewed battle stations with 100 Brilliant Pebble type missiles each. Accompanied by 10000 Brilliant Pebble type satellites. Brilliant Pebble type satellites are unarmed while the Smart Rocks type battle stations are equipped with anti-satellite-interceptor grenades similar to the Shield-2 anti-satellite system (complex?) and a 30mm chaff dispenser. A Brilliant Eyes type targeting system exists with unarmed satellites. There are also four large tracking stations in GEO built upon re-directed asteroids, with ASAT defences including anti-satellite-interceptor grenades, a carbon dioxide laser, and chaff dispensers. Nation E\u0027s ASAT forces include sea based interceptor missiles (similar to SM-3), with an assumption that in this scenario ultimately 10 will end up being in the dynamic launch zone necessary to hit an enemy satellite, air launched ASAT missiles, 50 of which will be assumed to end up in the dynamic launch zone necessary to hit an enemy satellite, and Skif type ASAT sats, which are controlled from the Smart Rocks type battle stations. There are around 60 of these Skif type satellites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC-F alliance- no ABM forces. ASAT forces consist of a limited number of sea based interceptor missiles (similar to SM-3), with an assumption that in this scenario 2 will ultimately end up being in the dynamic launch zone necessary to hit an enemy satellite. Nation C possesses 20 Skif type ASAT sats with one laser per satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation D- Nation D has built numerous ground based interceptor missile sites armed with nuclear warheads but these have already been overwhelmed during the initial exchange with the C-F alliance. Nation D does not possess any other ABM forces- unfortunately, it was just about to begin ground tests of production ABM sats when the war broke out. Nation D does possess a vast ASAT force, including 110 Skif type satellites with both a laser and a recoilless rifle with 4 shots, 2 Soyuz-PPK type crewed ASAT spacecraft with 8 ASAT munitions, 20 nuclear weapon (1 kt yield) armed \u0022suicide attack\u0022 space probes (10 in LEO and 10 in GEO shadowing enemy ABM platforms), and 30 Skif type probes with a laser in GEO shadowing enemy ABM platforms. The ASAT platforms in GEO are themselves being shadowed by enemy ASAT platforms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 10% failure rate is assumed for Brilliant Pebble type missiles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 97% hit rate is assumed for surface based (including air launched) ASAT missiles. A 70% hit rate is assumed for kinetic orbital ASAT munitions. I am unfamiliar with effective lasers are in combat in real life so I don\u0027t have a comment on that. 20% of the nuclear armed space probes will fail completely. 5% of the laser weapons for Skif type satellites for Nation D and E can be expected to fail shortly after (2 minutes) combat begins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation E decides to launch a full scale attack on both Nation D and the C-F alliance 15 minutes after the nuclear exchange between D and the C-F alliance ended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-01T13:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNation Z wins\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022A10a0QXTazL._RI_.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022160.00\u0022 height=\u0022900\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A10a0QXTazL._RI_.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-01T14:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224038289\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221633094559\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n58 minutes ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelic populations have a chance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor first few months, before the forager teams start arriving from the less relic but a little glowing territories for food.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill better to be a little radioactive but developed than unite with nature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224038289\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221633094559\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206402\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunlitZelkova\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n58 minutes ago, SunlitZelkova said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think modern civilization would ever have a chance of returning- food, water, and shelter come way above maintaining knowledge for the hundreds of years- more likely thousands- necessary to restore some form of civilization (and not just tribes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s hard to fall lower than early XX, and unlike in early XX the humans will have clear vision and knowledge what to do,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, probably a whole half-century would be required to restore to the 1970s level, enough comfy for living.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe XVIII century population is also not a problem, as the XX problems were caused by the overpopulation of the developed territories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust think how many monasteries were there in XVIII.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll those people were intentionally excluded from the repopulation process.

So many cities in Japan had been bombed (apart from those being saved for nuclear attacks) that in early August (prior to Hiroshima) Major General LeMay warned that the B-29s would probably run out of targets to bomb by October.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJapan was on the verge of a major famine at that point, and malnutrition was virtually universal.

Obviously, after a nuclear war there will be no occupation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example is the current global crisis (a disaster that reaches everywhere)- lots of division, and you have people working together to \u003Cem\u003Eget by\u003C/em\u003E, and they are getting by, but nonetheless, this crisis is unlikely to end in a pretty manner. But with total nuclear war there will be no authority to save people, so *some* who work together will survive, but will also have to contend with the *many* who don\u0027t, but being humans, also survive too.
