From the video (shown below), it appears to be able to use a mobile phone camera as it\u0027s POV and I would assume it was remote controlled (but this is off the main question).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question being, whatever became of that rover? In the video it says stayed tuned for more information about it, but it\u0027s been 3 (going on close to 4) years since then, and the Kerbal Space Program YouTube channel has remained silent on the topic (despite releasing update videos). So where is it? Did they put it up on a shelf and forget about it? Or did they pass it onto someone else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot has happened since 2013. The game has exploded in shape and appearance, but more importantly, Squad members have come and gone and (this is complete speculation with no evidence between it whatsoever) is it possible that they could have passed it onto one of the few who left as a parting gift?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo just simply curious what ever happened to that little thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nVideo in question-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQYQWzRYJJs?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-04T05:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167737-uomocapra/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022167737\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167737-uomocapra/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@UomoCapra\u003C/a\u003E, do you know they\u0027re\u00A0still there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-04T06:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003Eit gained sentience and is secretly\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:16px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr it was\u00A0fitted with a robotic arm and used to steal office lunches or something. \u00A0So it would be gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T23:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was being a jerk, so they kicked it\u00A0to the curb. \u00A0Good riddance, I say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
