If that\u0027s going to cause width problems with extreme speeds the K,M,G suffix system could be borrowed from the drum altimeter, I\u0027m only a noob but is it ever going to be more useful to know that you\u0027re going 1234567 m/s than 1234 km/s?\n\nI\u0027m sure it\u0027s not the biggest problem out there but I feel better for getting it off my chest...\n\nthanks for listening.\n\nj"}]}
