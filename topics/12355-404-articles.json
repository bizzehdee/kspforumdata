The \u0027limit to terminal velocity\u0027 option kicks in during ascent but not nearly as early as it used to. Perhaps the new aerodynamics stuff in v1.0 is causing issues?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve created a custom window to show me terminal velocity and I\u0027ve kept an eye on it over the course of a few launches, and it doesn\u0027t seem to behaving correctly to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding is that terminal velocity should be around 110m/s at around 1000m, and should climb as the atmosphere thins during ascent - I remember reading a tutorial ages ago when I first started playing which said that I should be doing 110m/s at 1km altitude and 220m/s at 10km. Previous versions of mechjeb accelerated at about this rate by throttling down due to hitting terminal velocity very early during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s what I see: When my ship is on the pad before I launch, the terminal velocity reads either NaN or ~70m/s. But as soon as I launch (less than 200m from the pad), It reads somewhere around 400m/s and starts falling during ascent. As the terminal velocity figure falls, my ship\u0027s speed increases. this goes on until somewhere around 5kms altitude, at which point the ship has accelerated up to about 330m/s and terminal velocity has dropped to 330m/s, so the \u0022limit to terminal velocity\u0022 option kicks in and mechjeb throttles down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a little while (I think it\u0027s around 8km altitude), the terminal velocity speed starts rising again and mechjeb throttles back up and gets me into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a while since I played kerbal (I heard about the 1.0 release and decided to see what was new), so perhaps something has changed or I\u0027m missing something. I seem to be using more fuel to get into orbit using mechjeb than doing it manually and limiting my speed as mentioned above (220m/s at 10km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there are any logs or more detailed info I can provide to help track this down, or tests you\u0027d like me to do, please let me know.

Thanks, smjjames. As for the turn shape. It was something I figured out along time ago. I should probably experiment with it again. The idea is to pick up as much speed in the atmo as I can as well as minimize the time it takes to get to orbit. I make lots of revisions to my designs so the faster I can test them the better. Also, making course corrections at those speeds in atmo can rip your ship apart or slow it down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AgentMOO","CreatedById":126295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T17:57:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK so maybe it did have something to do with my craft...
