I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s a priority. Somehow measuring the damage per second and calculating the points system might be more interesting. The strange thing I encountered: AI uses cannons for long range and machine guns for short. It should be the other way around: with the lower fire rate and higher drop-off it\u0027s more difficult to hit at larger distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I can\u0027t get the AI to fire only when the guns are in range (less than 700m).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see Bahamuto\u0027s AI road map.
