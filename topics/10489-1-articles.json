It is a slow ascent rocket so initially your vertical speed will hover around 100 @ 90% throttle. The boosters for launch are more for getting the rocket into that speed so it can cruise on its large fuel capacity. Once you have jettisoned the boosters and external fuel cells your speed will pick up to around 600-1000 if you maintain 90% throttle. By the time you have reached the height for orbit you will have around 1 and a 1/2 fuel cells left for the transfer from vertical to horizontal speed. To make up for the lack of fuel I usually put the nose 15-20 degrees below the horizon so gravity can speed the craft up. This is usually enough to gain the magic number for orbit (around 2500 m/s if I remember correctly). What you do in orbit depends on the payload you have, which can be stock or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think???\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chillman1212","CreatedById":16988,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T18:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\\\u0027t stock but I do like design very much =P\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mGGCwnAnnwn","CreatedById":25108,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T02:57:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule with nosecone and that isn\\\u0027t stock but everything below is.
