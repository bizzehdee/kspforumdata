I suspect that a few default values for the parameters in the DLL would fix that issue, or at the very least a \u0022final\u0022 layer MM patch to apply default values to scaletypes that lack a definition for that parameter would do the trick. It\u0027s not my problem right now though and, try as I might, the developers in that thread are really slow to investigate and fix problems like that. It probably stems from a feeling of \u0022and who do you think you are telling this awesome individual how to code his successful plugin that is beautiful and smells sweetly.\u0022 It\u0027s a \u0022battle of the lost staplers\u0022 event waiting to happen.

I came across this little beauty in a mod that implements suspension-based auto-balancing for landing legs (not the best implementation due to it relying on the length of the suspension instead of creating a leg with multiple joints which can adjust itself further than the main spring-suspension of the foot, but it\u0027s the best we\u0027ve got so far.) From what I can tell, it uses a stock method that allows the part to update it\u0027s drag cubes. I immediately thought of the problem we\u0027ve been having with tracks appearing to be inside a fairing, but burning up as if they were not, and my idea about a dummy retraction state for the wheels that would mimic a \u0022shielded\u0022 state on the part and, as a side effect, pull all the suspension into a tight \u0022fully retracted\u0022 position for easy fitting. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve probably seen this already, but in case you haven\u0027t, it might be an interesting place to start. If not, it\u0027s just one of my uneducated discoveries that I felt like sharing. Anyway, the method I\u0027m going to post below is a custom method in the mod called \u0022AutoBalancingLandingLeg\u0022 (at least, it lacks and spaces or dashes in the code decompiler):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[COLOR=#0000ff][B]private[/B][/COLOR] [COLOR=#ff0000]void[/COLOR] [COLOR=#191970][B]setDragCube[/B][/COLOR]([COLOR=#ff0000][B]float[/B][/COLOR] [B]value[/B])\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    [B]base[/B].part.DragCubes.[COLOR=#191970][B]SetCubeWeight[/B][/COLOR]([COLOR=#0000ff]\u0022DEPLOYED\u0022[/COLOR], [COLOR=#00008b]1[/COLOR]f - [B]value[/B]);\u003Cbr\u003E    [B]base[/B].part.DragCubes.[COLOR=#191970][B]SetCubeWeight[/B][/COLOR]([COLOR=#0000ff]\u0022RETRACTED\u0022[/COLOR], [B]value[/B]);\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be of interest to check it out. the \u0022SetCobeWeight\u0022 method is found in \u0022Assembly-CSharp.dll -\u0026gt; DragCubeList\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it goes without saying that you\u0027d probably have to look into some custom drag cubes for your parts... but that\u0027s another story altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022damerell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022damerell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould there be any harm in decreasing the existing crash resistance and structural/torque failure figures?
