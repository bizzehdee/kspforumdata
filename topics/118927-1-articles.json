Its complicated to make, but there is a thread here that shows teh style (and has a few parts that are 100% STOCK you can download to get started). Its a hair outdated, but these parts should still work and it shows you the concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMyself, i liek to make both this style and vertically stacked building (vertical is easier to create, less time, but more parts as every component has to have its own dedicated engines/deorbit mechanisms). It is also a little tough to actually line up (as to place a module atop another module u need to basically dock while pushing against gravity the whole time), but its in my oipinuion far easier and less time consuming to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe other option 9not as cool as the 2 above methods but the easiest and still functional) is to have separate buildings for everything u want that are just landed in teh same general area and placed nearby, kerbals will walk from one to the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
