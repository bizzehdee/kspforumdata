These will be added soon once I am happy with the performance. I have had lots of messages from eager people and so for now the code is out there as a bit of a taster. The modular approach to adding \u0027widgets\u0027 means that once we have streaming support (camera views!) and a non-restricted API (as per 2.0 spec), there is no limit to what can be added really. I\u0027m happy to take requests too, if other people have ideas on what buttons/switches they\u0027d like to see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now priority is performance and bug fixing however, so if you find something that doesn\u0027t seem to be working right, give me an idea of your browser/OS/device/resolution and i\u0027ll look into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m naming my next ship the KSS Sli.
