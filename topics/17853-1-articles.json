I don\u0027t bother, and instead this is my rendezvous plan: I get into an orbit that is in the same inclination, with aproximately the same periapsis and apoapsis as my target. Then, if I am behind in the orbit I lower my periapsis so that I orbit more quickly and wait to catch up. Once I get close, you bring your periapsis closer up so you don\u0027t overshoot. Then, when you are within 1-5km (your choice really), burn towards the target as you see it and slowly do the fine rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are in front of the target in the orbit, just raise your periapsis instead to go slower. This works for any orbit. It can take a large number of orbits to complete though, so be patient \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T17:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf he is coming in near 80, you won\u0027t be able to get a sub orbit on that side of the planet easily. Your best bet would be have a circular orbit of kerbin and wait for him to get in close. He will pass by close and start to fly away again, at which time you can, at the kerbal\u0027s periapsis, elongate your own orbit. if you are cutting inside of the kerbal\u0027s, you will begin to catch up. How much to elongate your orbit all depends on the difference in speed. If you build a rocket with tons of extra fuel, once you are at your Ao, it isn\u0027t to hard to play chase around since the orbital velocities are so low. This of course depends how far out the kerbal\u0027s Ao is. The toughest part about a capture like this is if you are playing the chase around, then you might end up flying right past. But plenty of time for the focused pilot to make corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Personally, a nice rescue ship I find to be the three man capsule. (trick is getting the other one off) For your seeker stage, the 45 maneuvering engine (not the small stock 1m and not the big one, that nice medium) mounted to a tank with four supply tanks around it should be able to get the job done with more than enough fuel left. If you have your original craft the kerbal fell off of, can also have him hang on and try flying him back to meet up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-26T17:12:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2012 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Markus Reese\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T17:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried this yet, but shouldn\u0027t the process be almost exactly the same?
