Once you\u0027re in orbit, you create the maneuver nodes when your engines are powered down (ie, 0% throttle)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust in case it\u0027s the circularization burn when you take off, here\u0027s a rough outline of go to go from the Launchpad to orbit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake off vertically\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you hit 100 m/s aprox., tilt east (that is, 90\u00B0 in the navball, usually the D key unless you rotated the command pods) very slightly, about 5 degrees\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep tilting your rocket very slowly and carefully while you\u0027re under 10,000 meters and specially before you break the sound barrier (about 330 m/s. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s hud has a match indicator. That, or I added it manually). Don\u0027t tilt your rocket when you\u0027re around match 1: the drag is higher and that means your chances of tilting over are higher\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove 20,000 meters, keep tilting your rocket east gently. The idea is to have it nearly horizontal by 30-50 km, but it depends on the rocket\u0027s design. You don\u0027t really have to be that precise at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually, your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E will be above 70km.

By the time you have it around 75-80km, cut the throttle. That\u0027s when you plan the circularization burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the map view, click in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E icon and keep pushing the prograde handler of the node until the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is above 70km.

Generally speaking, you divide the burn time by two and you use that result to determine how much time before the node you need to start burning.
