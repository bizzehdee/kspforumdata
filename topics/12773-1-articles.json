I call it the moon carrier. The carrier manages to carry the rocket to at least 14000 meters before the air gets too thin. It has a fairly high AOA at this point, actually aiding the launch of the next stage. The second stage launch you into orbit. With the third you land on the Mun, and return safely.

Bar that hic up I can get the whole plane section out of atmo thus allowing a very snug and light payload.
