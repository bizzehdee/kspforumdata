One thing thats been featured in the 1.0 preview videos is the smoke ejecting from the sides of the launch pad and spread across the ground during landings/launches. First of all, it looks amazing. Great job SQUAD. It\u0027s those little things that really make the game feel more complete. But secondly, could the new smoke be adapted or be a precursor to a cloud system the same way destructible buildings were for upgradable buildings. I mean just look at it; it\u0027s voluminous and translucent and really looks like they could be clouds or dust storms on atmospheric bodies. I don\u0027t know a bit of coding so I don\u0027t know how easy it would be to adapt it. \n\n![oVOrFzu.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/oVOrFzu.png?2)"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T00:28:31Z","Content":"Just make EVE stock...please."},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T00:29:44Z","Content":"Maybe, but I doubt it. There\u0027s nothing really going on there that\u0027s different from the exhaust your rockets create, just some tweaked settings and a different texture.\n\nFilling the entire sky with clouds that detailed would likely kill the framerate. They would have to be lower resolution and fewer particles."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T05:59:12Z","Content":"The jets there I think might be generated by some code that makes these plumes of smoke whenever there is an engine firing into the launchpad. (I\u0027m not a coder, so you\u0027re all probably laughing right now.) The smoke when landing is probably just an animated texture that displays when you have an engine plume close to the ground.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nActually, taking a.second think, there\u0027s probably just a thing that emits engine-like smoke when there are engines on the launchpad.
