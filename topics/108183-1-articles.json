That spoils all the technologies that you will ever be able to research. This mod is for those who liked the 0.90 way of the tech tree rendering: you could only see techs that you are able to research or have already researched. That kept the intrigue of development through out the game.\n\nThere is also a tiny config file to affect the way how the technologies are hidden in the tree.\n\n**[Download from SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/145/Fog%20Of%20Tech)**\n\n**Usage:**\n\nJust extract the contents of the zip into your GameData directory.\n\nBy default the mod hides techs that are unresearchable yet and leaves the researchable ones visible (just like it was in KSP 0.90).\n\n**Configuration:**\n\nOne more thing you may complain about a stock tech tree design is that the technologies are becoming available to research when any of their parent technologies are researched. For example, to research Stability you need either Basic Rocketry OR Engineering 101. As if for invention of automobile it was sufficient to invent only a wheel or only an engine. You can change that in several ways:\n\n1. (Supported by the stock game and is not related to Fog Of Tech): For stock tree edit the KSP\\_Folder\\GameData\\Squad\\Resources\\TechTree.cfg and change every value of AnyParentToUnlock property from True to False. That means you\u0027ll need to research all of the parent technologies in order to research the particular one.\n\n2. You can just set parentTechsToShow=ALL in Fog Of Tech\u0027s configuration file. That will make the plugin just hide all the techs that haven\u0027t all of their parents researched without the need to edit stock tech tree.\n\nThe other possible value is ANY: with the default tech tree effect is the same to the default plugin action. But if there is a tech that requires all of its parents to be researched then it will be shown immediately after you research any tech that leads to it despite it is still unresearchable (see the title screenshot: Flight Control has been modified to be such node there).\n\n**Compatibility:**\n\nSince the mod affects only the way of tech tree rendering it should be compatible with the most of custom tech tree mods.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-07T07:47:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2018 07:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Ser**\n  \nOfficially updated for 1.2"},{"CreatedByName":"Beetlecat","CreatedById":92207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T23:30:15Z","Content":"Nice!

Any player who did career a few times has a clear idea of where the tech nodes are, and what comes with them, but this knowledge takes away the uncertainty that is integral with research programs. In reality, not always a path of research gives fruit (though sometimes brings discoveries that were not even considered), and certainly the effort required to give results is not fixed and completely known beforehand. A way to allocate science points towards one goal (without that meaning that goal will have to be reached with exactly that many points, so the exact amount required for each tech node remains unknown but yet credible) could go a long way towards making the research part of the game more interesting."},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T13:08:57Z","Content":"\u003E If ever you wanted to develop the concept further, what exactly is required to unlock each node (and parts with it) should not be known\n\nSo doesn\u0027t showing only the nodes that are available to research at the moment do the thing?

Physically and logically there\u0027s much less certainity in real life than it is implemented in video games.\n\nSure hiding the nodes further up does help. But still, it doesn\u0027t take much for players to memorize where they are, what parts are in them, and even easier, what exactly the cost in science points is to get there.\n\nI know, the revised techtree in KSP 1.0 makes knowledge with the older techtree less useful, but it won\u0027t take long before players (used to career games) can tell everything in it with closed eyes.\n\nDependencies are required, sure. It is only logical that one path of research brings to Basic Rocketry before Advanced Rocketry. Not telling dependencies should go, but what exactly is required to make that \u0022next step\u0022 shouldn\u0027t be known before that research is actually successful. I\u0027d say, e.g., let a player push scientific points with the rocketry path - he will eventually unlock those nodes, one after the other in the logical succession they need to be. And however, to achieve success with one specific node (where a double dependency exist), the player must have not only unlocked the previous nodes, but also keep pushing more points with the specific research lines. E.g., we have Fuel Systems after both Advanced Rocketry and General Construction: I\u0027d say to unlock that, a player has to keep pushing both those lines (rocketry and costruction) further, but should have no knowledge of exactly how much each line has to be pushed for Fuel Systems to unlock. And while he may not find Fuel Sytems not having pushed the construction line hard enough, he may instead be advancing towards the unlock of Heavy Rocketry, or Propulsion Systems, to the point he may be given the option to have one of those unlocked before Fuel System.\n\nThe exact mechanic of this all may require some effort to make right. It would be a significant change in the way the game is played, and certainly would take time to balance correctly.\n\nAlso, KSP currently implements specific constraints about the nodes (e.g. each part availability is tied specifically to one node) and that sure limits the uncertainty. A revised, much longer techtree would help a lot to give a better granularity to this concept, but then every part (not only the ones in stock, also those in add-ons) should be associated to nodes with that techtree. Of course, different techtrees have been proposed already, and some are certainly better to go along the idea shown above."},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:39:21Z","Content":"diomedea, yes, that would be a completely different approach to the way science is modelled in the game. I have many complains on that way too: why have we to \u0022buy\u0022 technologies for science points? Why there\u0027s no difference of what kind of field data are used to develop a certain tech? Why the techs are developed momentarily? Looks like the present science model is so \u0022gamy\u0022 and has a level of abstraction that is hardly understandable in real life terms. I think it requires not even modification but a serious overhaul. Definitely it\u0027s out of scope of this particular mod but it would be great if someone could do that."},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T06:55:39Z","Content":"Have tested the mod with KSP 1.0.4, still seems to work fine.
