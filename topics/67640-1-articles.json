My name is Robin, I\u0027m a 26 years old french guy and I\u0027ve been playing the game for a while but it is just recently that I took upon myself to really try and master the orbital mechanics and flight maneuvers of this wonderful game ! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just wondering if all the satellites I\u0027ve sent up have any purpose other than just the fun of launching ? Do they actually serve for communication with probes, or tracking the newly implemented asteroids ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to do a whole new career campaign and I was wondering if i would have to just roleplay on my own or if the game mechanics were actually taking all those features into account... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sure seems to be nice community and I\u0027ll do my best to be a part of it ! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Crichton","CreatedById":102565,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T14:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this works in 23.5, but you should check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56399-0-23-RemoteTech-2-0-23-5-Not-supported%21-Wait-for-0-24%21-Busy%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERemoteTech\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T20:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum! With stock, satellites with the Gravioli scanner will give you science at near and far altitudes. That\u0027s about it for useful satellites. Mods will give you more things to do with satellites. Kethane, ScanSat, and Remote Tech are ones that spring to mind for enhancing satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kialar","CreatedById":60893,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T20:40:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESalut voisin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(hello neighbor!)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T20:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as sandbox goes, nothing you put in orbit really does anything useful (with the notable exception of refueling stations). Mods exist that can extend this quite a bit. Life support, reentry damage, terrain mapping, resource scanning and gathering, communication requirements, are all in the mods section and can be fun to play with. Since the update, I don\u0027t know if everything is current, but don\u0027t be afraid to experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor career mode, probes become a little more useful as lightweight science gatherers for going places that may be too difficult for a return mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going stock, you\u0027ll be role playing a bit if you want to put up satellites for fun.
