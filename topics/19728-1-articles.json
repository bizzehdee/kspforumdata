That\u0027s why I\u0027ve got a few ideas, which might be able to help you keep the servers up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Peer 2 peer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might, or might not be feasible for you to implement peer 2 peer technologies in your patcher. If you do, make sure it\u0027s transparent (as in, you clearly let people know you\u0027re using their network connection for this purpose), and provide the option to turn it off. Why should you let people turn it off? Because, there are some countries (like mine), where a lot of ISP\u0027s put a limit on how much data you may upload each month. It\u0027s not fun to find out you have been kicked to small band because a certain game decided to drain your upload while patching. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A queue system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA queue system definitely seems like a good idea. This way, when your server has reached capacity, you at least give feedback to the users about what is going on. It also allows the user to keep the patcher running while they do something else, instead of having to try and connect every now and again. It also allows you to keep some system resources at hand to keep your forum and website going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt certainly would mean the situation is handled gracefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A server upgrade\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most obvious solution is of course a server upgrade. It is certainly a viable solution. The only constraint on it, is how much money you can/want to spend on an upgrade, which will only be used on patch days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Steam\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also possible to use steam. This way, you let an external company worry about deploying the game. I\u0027m not sure what the conditions are for that service though. And some users might not like using steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are the ideas I could come up with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe download doesn\u0027t need to be super smooth, or super fast (Everything is still in alpha after all). But overloading the server, which also needs to handle your website and forum, doesn\u0027t seem like a very good idea. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomato3017","CreatedById":464,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T11:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy to do if the servers are setup in the correct manner.

Given the number of users and the size of the software, it\u0027s TBs of data, and Amazon is charging about 120$ for 1 TB, so it can go to 1000$ for a single patch.
