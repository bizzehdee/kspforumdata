Probably the easiest way to go about destroying earth is to collect massive objects in the Kuiper belt, slow down their prograde motion and it if properly targeted to cross the ellipitcal of Earth and both intersect at the same time . . you would of course with several 100 kilometers of mass destroy all life on the surface, but the radial velocity would suffice to cause the earth to alter course. If the impact occurred when earth radial velocity was the smallest you could cause earth to essentially cross close to Venus during the southern summer and basically sub equatorial rainforest would be toast anyway.
