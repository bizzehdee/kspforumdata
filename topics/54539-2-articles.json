Pressurizing the whole thing is just not practical. The best on-the-budget solution is a simple space-suit tied by umbilical to the life support system. Since the odds of a spark are now absolutely minimal, you can feed pure ox to the suit, requiring it to maintain only 1/5th bar. And all the \u0022life support\u0022 is going to consist of is an air circulation system with some CO2 scrubbers and a bunch of oxygen tanks connected to it via pressure regulator valve. I can get most of the supplies at a diving store.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside is that pilot is going to be limited to liquid food, but that\u0027s probably not an issue for a short mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves radiation protection and thermal regulation. Radiation shouldn\u0027t be too problematic. Might be worth it to look into which types of glass provide better protection, and maybe do metal coating like they do on space suit visors. Other than that, since it doesn\u0027t have to hold pressure, it doesn\u0027t have to be anything fancy. The metal body of the bus should provide adequate protection elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves temperature. Again, I vote for simple solutions. Make all of the top and side coating reflective. Underneath, attach some panels reflective on one side and black on the other. Between the panels, paint alternating black and reflective stripes. Flipping panels from one position to another switches between reflective and black coat, basically. Between that and adjusting orientation of the bus, it should be possible to maintain comfortable temperature of the frame. And since there is no air, the suit is going to be in radiation equilibrium with the walls of the bus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill leaves a lot of sub-systems. The thing will need propulsion, at least enough to re-enter. Maneuvering system. Navigation. Communication. Power. The total is going to be in millions, easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and like I said, there needs to be a return vehicle stored on board. There is no way in hell this thing is landing in one piece. Pilot would have to bail out during re-entry procedure. Return vehicle would need to have a heat shield, parachutes, life support, communication equipment, and probably a raft, since the only sane place to re-enter would be over an ocean. It\u0027s not much, but it\u0027s still a whole separate vehicle to build and test, and this one would have to be from scratch and 100% reliable. Not cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. And yes, I\u0027d also vote short bus if it\u0027s meant to actually do anything up there. It would make it easier to re-enforce the frame and add all the necessary equipment. Would be easier to maneuver as well. And somehow, if you are launching a school bus into space, short bus just seems appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dharak1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dharak1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEdit: K^2, on the subject of reentry We could use a teardrop shaped capsule That is dropped out of the bus.

That would include environmental testing in vacuum chambers and vibration testing, which are extremely expensive. Non-space-rated materials, like oil, paint, rubber, glue, etc... will probably burn off and evaporate in space, which would become a cloud of debris and might be considered a hazard. Anything that might break off during the launch (windows, mirrors, seats, bodywork...) could damage or unbalance the rocket during launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will also need a launch licence from the FAA: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/licenses_permits/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/licenses_permits/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you wouldn\u0027t be able to get any of that paperwork with a cobbled together school bus.

Although cork *is* an accepted heat-absorbing material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you dropped the manned component of the mission, that begins pushing the mission towards the realm of possibility. If the \u0022Space Bus\u0022 was completely stripped down of everything that wasn\u0027t needed (engine, transmission, axles, seats,) that should drop it\u0027s mass down to about 10000 pounds. You could squeeze a Boeing 702sp into our craft at that mass (that\u0027s another ~12000 pounds.) You can order spacecraft paint online, and I\u0027d say that it would cost roughly $10000 to paint the whole thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight plan would have to be something that prevents any unneeded problems for our insurance, so take the easiest option - immediately boost it into a graveyard orbit. Looking at some space history brought me to the OSCAR 10 satellite. It functioned on mostly off-the-shelf hardware, including solar cells from Radio Shack. If we could purchase a number of solar cells, and just keep and use the most efficient, that\u0027d leave us with a (although less than ideal,) power source. That leaves us with about 5000 pounds of room to play with. The actual amount will probably be lower than this, but it\u0027s still a bit of room to play with. We could possibly make use of the 702sp by selling space for some lightweight scientific equipment on board, helping cover the launch costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
