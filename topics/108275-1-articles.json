If you don\u0060t care where you land landing directly costs slightly less dV. I don\u0060t know how much it could be but I think the amount of dV you can save is so tiny that it\u0060s not worth thinking about."},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T21:19:19Z","Content":"Give you some time to pick your exact landing spot, and also a circular orbit is a safe place to sit in case there\u0027s an issue - call it abort to orbit procedure."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T21:23:53Z","Content":"If you have a 10km periapsis at Mun, and you burn there to set up a descent and then descend and land, you use exactly the same dV as you would if you circularized at 10km, took a breath, decided where to land, and then burned down to descend.\n\nYou can save a tiny little bit of fuel by getting your periapsis even lower from way out and then just burning to land when you hit it, but that savings could easily be eaten up in any inefficiencies that come from not knowing where you\u0027re going to land and having to move to a nearby location."},{"CreatedByName":"Chozo Nomad","CreatedById":60301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T21:46:27Z","Content":"I see. I figured that might be the case. Thanks guys!"}]}
