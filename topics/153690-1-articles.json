The general problem with inflatables is you need to fill them with stuff, so really what good does the inflatable part do for you except require multiple launches? So I thought maybe just having some big empty space for astronauts to feel a little less claustrophobic would be nice. And maybe put some excercise equipment in there too. And that\u0027s when I thought, hamster wheel. If you make a wheel 5 meters across, and tether someone to the middle of it, and they start running, then if they hit 8\u00A0miles an hour (that\u0027s not bad at all really), their feet will experience 0.5g of centripedal force.\u00A0Now, they will feel some tidal forces. Their head will experience about .1g in this scenario. Running at 12\u00A0miles an hour (5 minute mile pace) gets their head up to .23\u00A0and their feet to 1.2.\u00A0Basic idea is, launch an inflatable with a five meter diameter internal environment. Have a pole run through the center, and a tether attached. It might need to be able to swing the person a bit to get them started, but once they\u0027re moving they should be able to propel themselves forward. Nice, lightweight 0 energy solution for artificial gravity for long term habitation. So, for anyone with more knowledge about medicine, the question is, would simulating gravity by running in a circle have any benefit? I\u0027m thinking thirty minutes to an hour a day (probably not all at once) should help somewhat. They already have those bungee chord treadmill things after all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOptional design: Make it a bike attached to a rail, easier to get to speed and keep the body more prone to avoid tidal issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossible issue: The mass of a grown human running around will throw off the center of mass, and will introduce some angular momentum to the station. Might need to be compensated with something. Maybe the bike solves this a little bit, just add a counter weight to at least preserve a center of mass. If gravity is an issue on the Moon or Mars though, at least those won\u0027t be problems. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T21:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond issue: have you seen footage of astronauts walking on the moon?

Think of it like a car going along the side of a track, the faster it goes the harder its pressed against the track wall. From an observer outside, what is happening is the astronaut is propelling themselves forward to collide into a wall, but instead of colliding they redirect themselves along the wheel. Faster they propel themselves forward, harder they \u0022hit\u0022 the wall.
