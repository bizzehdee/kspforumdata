Well. Balanced. Mechanics. It\u0027s the reason the most complex computers on the planet can\u0027t solve chess but checkers is boring for 10 year olds. It\u0027s the reason Eric Barone outsold most AAA games with a dorky 8-bit Harvest Moon clone. The holy grail of any game is \u0022easy to learn, difficult to master\u0022. This is \u003Cem\u003Ehard,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0just like any great piece of engineering, because it requires the discipline to remove everything that\u0027s extraneous, to ruthlessly simplify the rules such that only the smallest, most delicately balanced and integrated set of strategic choices make all the difference. It\u0027s not that tipping one single thing will ruin your experience, you\u0027ll be fine if you\u0027re close, but to truly master the system and make the most out of every choice means fully understanding each element of the game.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd even when in truth everything is deterministic there should be the sense of improvisation. I\u0027ve played KSP for a long, long time and I\u0027ve gotten pretty good at it. Still, when I launch something as simple as a Minmus surveyor the experience still feels improvisational, because I\u0027m looking at that timing till Minmus intersects the ecliptic plane, optimizing for a polar orbit, making course corrections to perfect my altitude for circularization. When you plan for a Jool mission you tend to pack fuel for the worst, but when you get there there are all of these unique opportunities for gravity assists between different moons and you\u0027re kinda flying by the seat of your pants, which is terrifying and exhilarating.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is the kind of simultaneously totally forgiving and utterly ruthless doctrine I\u0027d love to see applied to colonies and resources.
