(about six time farther than your picture) There is no practical end to the Kerbal universe. In .16 though, you could overflow the position value when you get about 2^127 meters away (even if you build a ship that goes 100 Km/s and travel at maximum timewarp it would take dozens of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe to get that far.) and in .17 it wont overflow until you are 2^1023 meters from the sun, which is just mind-bogglingly large.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
