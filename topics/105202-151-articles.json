My suspicion is that it\u0027s a problem with floating point math or KSP\u0027s heat mechanics at high warp speeds.  The workaround I have for that is to never focus on a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E reactor while running the warp speed above 10,000x.  If I need a higher warp speed, I\u0027ll do it back at the space center.\n\nFor the other problem with resource generation not happening while the craft is not in focus, that\u0027s a limitation of KSP and how it works for vessels that are \u0022on rails\u0022 in the background.

On a base that was landed, I had lost about 8000 supplies when I went back to that base after about a week of warp.  It seemed to have been partially fixed when the recycler fix was made.  Nobody else had verified the problem, so I did a workaround that solved the issue.  In short, I put an undersized nuke on the base, and when everything ran full tilt, was not able to keep up.  But I had a central PDU to handle the shortfall, and it worked when the vessel is active.  It seemed like, when the base is in the background, that the PDU part was being ignored, it ran out of EC and production stopped. But, that still doesn\u0027t explain why the supplies disappeared so quickly.\n\nMy workaround was I stopped the efficiency parts and one bay.  It dropped EC usage so that the nuke can handle it by itself, and all problems went away.  If you can, try and reduce power usage and see if it gets better.  I actually cant reproduce anymore because I replaced that base and disassembled it, so I have not opened a Github ticket."},{"CreatedByName":"TauPhraim","CreatedById":146808,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-01T23:01:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Gilph said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It seemed to have been partially fixed when the recycler fix was made.

I have the Ground Construction mod, when I am active on a DIY Kit and click on the  Life Support Status screen , I get messages about the kerbal refusing to work, then going back to work and it just loops through that...\n\u003E \n\nYes! That\u0027s EXACTLY what I\u0027ve been seeing in my save. I already have a GitHub issue opened for it: [https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/issues/1124](https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/issues/1124)\n\nThere is a save file attached in that issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-01T23:54:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2017 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by sh1pman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jebs_SY","CreatedById":169510,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-02T00:15:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 19.1.2017 at 4:48 AM, Jebs\\_SY said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I still get some constantly repeating argument exceptions when opening the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS window.
