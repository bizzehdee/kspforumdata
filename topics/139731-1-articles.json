Based upon our known laws.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime has no value in a universal quantum singularity, nor spatial dimensions, temperature or mass and since no known theory can describe how the singularity ends or how space-time begins, and it is a non-testable hypothesis, suffice it to say you cannot create space-time simply because its convenient. Somewhere before matter begins, somehow energy poured into the system, that rolled out the fabric of space (the so-called higgs field). Read any text or observe any theory, none describe precisely when the higgs field arose, most argue it began spreading before the end of the initial inflation at which point space and time have a component.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the reality is this, given quantum singularity, given the fact that quantum space and time do not precisely describe the limits of motion in either direction, at the moment that the singularity ended space time and inflation may have begun with a tensor force applied to all energy relative to position in a bubble. All variations in between could exist from an accelerative spreading to as previously stated. But at the end of that process we have what is referred to as the big bang ( a rather heated expansion), where energy from whereever pours into spatial dimensions and heat and temperature exists as we know it, spreading those dimensions out and cooling the universe.\u00A0 For all we know the higgs field could still be pouring into the Universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy interpretation is this since even energy is bound by Einsteins theory of relativity, a bound scalar state that is halved cannot travel away from the other half greater than the speed of light, therefore the spread is a consequence of the quantum state. It does allow halved states to half themselves and repeat, but then that most uniform CMWBR radiation. Therefore much of inflation has to be governed in a self resolving quantum state. This is inenigmatic unless you are considering exotic energy or fields (which I don\u0027t), prior to space-time the universe can be in all time and spatial dimensions or none, but at some point it resolved into the Universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222581705\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463251665\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261954\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majorjim\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Majorjim said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnoring all the other \u0027stuff\u0027 you wrote.

In response to Majorjim, the universe does not need a center now or the center is an observable, but to know the universe you would\u00A0have to have a snapshot of inflation, which did fleetingly have center prior to the general motion outward \u00A0exceeding SoL, the problem is that is prior tobspace-time\u00A0and withou space time how can an exterior position of view exist. We often\u00A0equate the visible universe with the universe, if one was omnisentient, the visible universe would be nothing more than parsect in\u00A0space-time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe brain cannot exist, it would be like a dream still asleep and unaware of actual reality. If we claim knowledge of the universe, we would half to know many facts, how wide it is a any given moment, what dark energy is, where it pour in, why it pours in, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
