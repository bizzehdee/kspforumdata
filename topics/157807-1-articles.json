Your computer consists of many different parts, each of which can individually become a bottleneck in different cases. Adjusting physics delta will only give you more performance if your CPU clock speed is low. It will not do anything if you are running out of memory. It will also not do anything if you have a poor video card, or you are on a laptop with switchable graphics and your graphics driver software doesn\u0027t properly switch when KSP is started.
