You just plug it in and windows sees it as a gamepad. You can make one with push buttons simply by taking the innards out of a cheap gamepad, removing the microswitches and soldering the new switches on. Alternatively you can buy a ready made control board that will work out of the box. I am doing both for this, a dismantled joystick for \u0022Push to activate\u0022 switchs (that just work like tapping a key), as well as a specialist board for toggle switches that converts the \u0022constant on\u0022 signal of a switch into the \u0022tap\u0022 signal of a button.

This is by far the hardest part and its already been done for you, all that remains is to set up an arduino to take this information and convert it to something useful (like moving a gauge, displaying numbers on an LCD, flashing a light etc.). I have my first Arduino arriving tomorrow along with a starter kit and tutorials, I\u0027ll work through them and learn as much as I can. There are also many examples and tutorials online if you google things like \u0022analogue dial control arduino\u0022.
