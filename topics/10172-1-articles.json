The tri-couplers do make your stack awesome, but they\\\u0027re hard to integrate cleanly. Without a totally symmetric rocket, you need a lot of heavy SAS modules.\n\nI\\\u0027d also recommend hard-mounting the fins to a stage that you\\\u0027re going to drop in the lower atmosphere.

If you want to keep something similar, I would be partial to deleting the fins, SAS, and lowermost ASAS.\n\nPerhaps something like this?\n\n![Nimbus4R.png](http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c128/raptor_87/KSP/Nimbus4R.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\\\u0027d also recommend hard-mounting the fins to a stage that you\\\u0027re going to drop in the lower atmosphere.

Four tank stacks get rocket nozzles, while the outer two have fuel lines running to your upper-stage outer engines. You cut out 4.7 mass units of dead weight that way, with no drop in fuel capacity. You can also replace those vectored engines with their non-vectored equivalent, while dropping the extra ASAS and so forth. \n\nLike this: \n\nEDIT: I can confirm it lands on the Mun and back, but RCS is sorely missed coming in.\n\n\u003E ![screenshot8le.png](http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/83/screenshot8le.png)\n\nBy the by, what\\\u0027s the intent behind all the fuel lines already on the third stage?
