Old aero is horribly (but often entertainingly) unrealistic, and the new aero will probably be a huge improvement. It won\u0027t be simulator-level realism, but it will probably work roughly as it should, with most of the eccentricities being bugs or actual oddities of real life aerodynamics (Squad said that at least some supersonic effects will be added, for example)."}]}
