Having LV-T400, or better yet, LV-T800 fuel tanks connecting each LV-N to the coupler seems to be the way to fix the over heating issue. The long fuel tanks dissipate the heat from the engines at a better rate and keep them cooler during long burns. The quad coupler on the other hand causes the engines to rapidly over heat when they are all connected directly to it.\n\nOtherwise, beautiful lifter you\u0027ve got there.
