Below you\u0027ll find a picture and link to the craft file for it, rocket \u0022DO1I-SS\u0022. In going to the launch scene, after giving the rocket a moment to \u0027settle down\u0027 on the launch pad, all tanks show full. At launch, the tanks on the extreme far side of the view (refer to image), as in viewing from the North, the top-most and bottom-most tanks both begin draining at a very high rate. All the other tanks drain normally, from the top on down. The two engines on that extreme far side run out of fuel *long before* any of the others do, so, naturally, it becomes a serious problem controlling the rocket at altitude. I\u0027ve reviewed the craft file, but I can\u0027t see any difference between those two engines and set of tanks over the others. I\u0027m beginning to think this is a bug. I\u0027ll note that the mods I use are [StockBugFixModules.v1.0.2d.2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v0-90-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v0-1-7e-28-Feb-15%29-Misc-Utilities-%2818-Jan-15%29) and [SCANsat-v12.0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369)... and the rocket has two SCANsat scanners onboard.\n\n[DO1I-SS craft file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/omg92jxizu4v98n/DO1I-SS.craft?dl=0)\n\n![300n8R4.png](http://i.imgur.com/300n8R4.png)\n\n*EDIT*\n\nI find that removing the fuel lines, the fuel drain pattern changes - but the same two engines run out of fuel first.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T02:58:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret**\n  \nadditional notes"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:53:03Z","Content":"Can you post a craft without the Scansat pieces?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T23:33:40Z","Content":"I tried your craft and I\u0027m getting the same result (I edited out the scansat stuff so I could load the ship).

When I went and edited the rocket, I noticed that one of the upper C7 Adapters wasn\u0027t connected properly, *and* one of the lower C7 Adapters wasn\u0027t connected properly either. After making the changes, it does work properly.\n\nI don\u0027t believe the problem stemmed from the root (the OKTO), but rather when I placed the part using the Alt-key (modifier) and rotated it ... somehow. In any case it\u0027s fixed.
