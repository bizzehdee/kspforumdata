Unreliable gauges are not exactly uncommon IRL ( say the fuel gauge on almost all cars is dreadfully innacurate when the tank is either too full or too empty ) because , for better or worse a unreliable gauge is most of the times better than no gauge. In fact we have another unreliable gauge in game, one that spits out crazy numbers when it does not simply drop a N/A on you: the burn time ( and before you say that is a completely diferent cup of tea, notice that the modder responsible by the Better Burn Times mod said in this thread that the burn time was also whoefully complicated to get right due to the \u00A0issue of edge cases \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0) ... and yet the same dev team that had no issues dropping a burn time that works correctly maybe 80% of the times ( and that never warns you that the time it shows might actually be a bad one, mind\u00A0that ) is shy of making a even moderately unreliable dV meter ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy take on this is that the main reason we don\u0027t have a dV meter nowadays is mostly \u0022historical\u0022 : I think it is public knowledge that Harv original idea for the game required very little use for dV meter ( or in fact, any gauges besides the ones that we have in the flight/map UI ) and that Harv was initially extremely resistant to the idea of showing much of numbers in the UI. I think the devs only realized they needed to start showing numbers in the UI when planets came out and we had the absurd situation of having to put protactors against the screen to even have a chance of having a interplanetary travel and so they were forced to actually spit out the manouver nodes, that ,as a lot of people pointed out, make very little sense without a dV meter of some kind ... so I believe that the devs intended to add a dV meter somewhere after that. The issue is that IMHO they understimated the magnitude of the work behind making one and due to that, they simply focused on stuff that looked harder/ more important\u00A0to do in the next updates. This obviously untill 1.0 came out and they actually looked on doing a dV meter seriously , just to discover that it was far more complicated than they thought it was, and as they had so much to do for 1.0, well, the schmelta-Vee thing could wait \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd now, that we are going to the consoles, the task of making a dV meter apparently got again the back seat, but this time is more likely to be just because they want to make it right and know that they can\u0027t make one for\u00A0the consoles release...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Most of the above is speculative, but I think that the above is the most likely scenario, given the tidbits of intel that I gathered around during the years KSP has been around.

I want in!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have skimmed the thread, read NathanKells posts, but not every single post, just so that you know. Just want to have my say how I think it should be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I think a delta-v readout in flight and in VAB are two different things, and I would say that the game doesn\u0027t need an in flight readout (but I\u0027m not against it), but i seriously needs a readout in the VAB. That way you would have some guidance while building the spaceship, but still leave some room for error while in flight, which for me makes good gameplay IMHO. And, probably would be slightly easier (=less hard) to code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. A VAB delta-v readout for me is top priority, before fiddling more with the contracts, or implementing the new radar range or any graphics upgrades. A delta-v readout is the single one feature that is needed for a complete game, IMHO (for reasons other have stated above, about accessibility and that this is after all a game, you really shouldn\u0027t have to do a lot of research online or calculations with pen and paper or to install a mod to be able to play it (I\u0027m sure there are those who thinks it is playable under any of those conditions, but for me it\u0027s really not. I have installed KER, but I really don\u0027t like to use mods, for many different reasons.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The delta-v readout in VAB should look very much like KER does today, because KER is really good. But in stock it probably should come with a warning from Wernher (\u0022Remember that the delta-v readout is far from perfect, but Gene (or whoever) kept nagging us about showing at least some basic readout for the most basic designs, because he got bored of all the Kerbals stranded in space when the fuel ran out.\u0022 That way, it would be explained in game that it is a basic help, not an advanced tool to give a delta-v readout for every possible and impossible contraption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The ability for this KER-like readout to calculate TWR, performance of different engines at different altitudes etc would depend on the experiments performed by the player. Haven\u0027t measured the gravity on Mun? Then you can\u0027t use the readout to calculate TWR for Mun. No readout in high and low atmosphere of its composition? Then you can\u0027t pull the slider and find out how your jets/engines will perform. This probably would need a re-balance in the tech-tree so you unlock the most helpful science parts early on, but it would in my opinion make for a really, really good game play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmognome","CreatedById":153969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-09T09:30:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222504069\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135502\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460182546\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Enceos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Enceos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile Mr. Malah makes another dV readout mod which integrates beautifully with the stock engineer\u0027s report:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ya3U7rC.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ya3U7rC.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ya3U7rC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you provide a link to the mod?
