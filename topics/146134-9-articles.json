If a spreadsheet program does math wrong, or a health record program crashes or returns wrong data, it gets fixed and fast, because there are potentially millions or billions of dollars on the line, and part of the agreement of buying a product line is also buying support for that product line. Always is, always has been, always will be.

or what tradeoff you make, there would still be no way to get to the state of something as big or as polished as Microsoft Office, because Squad simply isn\u0027t big enough for that.\u00A0 The cash

I got a complete game, with a few bugs which didn\u0027t include being unable to save the game and, while at some point weird dancing dragons showed up between patches, it was a rather smooth experience.

I agree. And that allows game developers to sell excrements. Why not? excrements is cheap. Quality is not. It requires money. But as long as customers accept excrements, excrements is what they\u0027ll have. Why bother with expensive quality, if cheap excrements is acceptable? And a game like KSP without the ability to save is excrements. And it\u0027s a scam. There is no way around it.
