Especially for taking off, I warp until I see Kerbin come up just above the horizon(meaning that\u0027s East), and launch towards it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, the navball depends on the orientation of the controlling part. So if your controlling part is pointing upwards(which for most Mun lander designs it will), your Navball will not be particularly useful. Alternatively, you can slap on a docking port on the front of your rover and control it from there(right-click the part and select \u0022control from here\u0022). You should get the correct heading then. You can, and probably should, test it on the launch pad during the assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pinchy","CreatedById":143038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T10:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes Melfice - I understand the directions on the navball as you state - the issue is that there is no way as far as I can tell which way you are facing relative to the Navball directions - ie you want to go 90degrees East but you don\u0027t know if you need to push WASD keys to get there....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Umcookies","CreatedById":144324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T10:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pinchy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pinchy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes Melfice - I understand the directions on the navball as you state - the issue is that there is no way as far as I can tell which way you are facing relative to the Navball directions - ie you want to go 90degrees East but you don\u0027t know if you need to push WASD keys to get there....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere sure is, you\u0027ve never noticed that reticle that\u0027s always in the middle of the navball?
