I know how to control roughly where I land on Kerbin after deorbiting, but Laythe is a very different beast and I have trouble predicting where I\u0027m going to land. I have some experience with Laythe landings but almost every time my craft would skip off the atmosphere and mess up my trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy craft is in a 60x60 km low orbit and my target is an equatorial island at about 109\u00BA longitude. I have plenty of fuel left to run the rapiers in air breathing mode but would prefer to land as close as possible to the island, ideally just east of it.
