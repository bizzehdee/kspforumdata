If I hold a yaw with the aircraft, it quickly starts naturally and uncontrollably yawing to that side (Even if I have let go of the yaw key.), entering a spin shortly afterwards. The larger the tailfin control surface the quicker it experiences overyaw, but it is still experiencing it with a relatively small tailfin control surface. I honestly have no clue what is going on here, though I think it relates to the aerodynamics of the aircraft in some way over-exaggerating a yaw movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have some pictures of a couple overyaw events below. I tried to do a couple full overyaws and then a partial as well, but the first partial didn\u0027t last long and the second turned into a full overyaw movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/MiTOL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
