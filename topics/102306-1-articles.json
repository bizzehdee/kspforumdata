Accelerate until you reach 2050-2100 m/s of surface speed at altitude 33-34 km (pith 0...20)\n\n5. Pith to 10 and start increase vertical speed, start gently decrease throttle from 35 km (1/6 of thrust per kilometer), at 2/3 of thrust start atomic engine, when one jet will be starved of air stop turbojets and closing intakes by pressing \u00221\u0022 button\n\n6.
