Launch a satellite in near kerbin, circular obit. Launch another craft (rocket, space plane, etc) and try to get it to meet up with the satellite. Basically, your trying to get close enough to the craft so you can dock, just like how the space shuttles met up with the spacestation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny parts are allowed, just make sure they\\\u0027re reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe closest distance is the winner. Please screen capture the satellite distance as proof.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure both the satellite and the craft are both going the same direction.

They must be within 300 meters of the target satellite in order to count. Highest number of junk around your target satellite wins and none of the craft can be debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, to help you guys out, I have a guide that will definitely help. With it, I have rendezvoused with Mun, and have safely got back to Kerbin after a Kerbol mission.
