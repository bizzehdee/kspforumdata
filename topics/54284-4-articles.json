It\u0027s ugly, unwieldy, and I have no idea where the hitbox is and if it even needs to intersect the ground to function. Instructions on these characteristics don\u0027t exist, and I cannot easily test it because testing the auger requires a functional ore deposit under it, which more often than not requires me to engineer something that can piggy-back it to a deposit, which in turn requires both engineering time and flight time beside multiple crash tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese issues by themselves are each small, but small issues like this stack into multi-hour headaches.

I\u0027m sure CTD-causing bugs and mod core functionality are higher up on the list. However, the auger design is what I encountered, what frustrated me greatly, and what in my opinion needs to be improved upon before more features get implemented.
