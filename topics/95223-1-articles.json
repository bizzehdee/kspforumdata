When you try to post, you get the error that you\u0027ve been re-logged since the window was opened, and refreshing does not fix it. You have to open a new tab and copy\u002Bpaste the link into the new tab to be able to post. Then you have to copy your post from the old tab and paste into the new tab. It\u0027s annoying to have to do that. I leave tabs open on posts because I often can\u0027t find them the next day if I don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
