You\u0027d heat those radiators up so far that they\u0027d emit IR energy like crazy and be very efficient even at a small size. And yes, you\u0027d use heat pipes to get to them, then the coolant would go back into the radiator to heat up the coolant again, and repeat. This is how electricity is generated, it\u0027s an ideal engine cycle (Brayton Turbine in the case of the SAFE400).\u003Cp\u003EInteresting thing is when you heat a radiator up that far they don\u0027t need to be that big either, the hotter the radiator\u0027s temperature, the more kWt it loses to space. (the increase is to the 4th power)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason the ISS needs such big radiators is they aren\u0027t very hot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, even on the ground, most of your heat loss is through radiation not convection or conduction. Actually being on the ground means that you\u0027re radiating at a grey body, so it\u0027s not as efficient. In this case facing out into black space, yep... this is working as it should from what I can tell. Those two radiators facing the sun shouldn\u0027t be radiating as much, but those two perpendicular to it would be very effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the radiators for the NTRs: I haven\u0027t been watching this thread super close, but the NTRs should be losing all of their bulidup heat through the propellant while running. It\u0027s when they\u0027re not running that something must be done to cool the reactor (which could be done by turning down the fission reaction, which means you would have to spin it up again before you could use the engine again). Probably using it as a generator to turn those watts of thermal energy to electrical energy, then you\u0027d radiate your heat energy off into space. Basically using it like a giant RTG, large radiators should not be needed. I\u0027ve yet to fiddle with the stock NTR... but from prior use and other engines it sounds like it\u0027s backwards. It generates a lot of heat while running and is cool when it\u0027s idle. The heat is what makes it work and have its high ISP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK, there\u0027s several things wrong here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Conduction through dense atmosphere, such as on the launchpad, is many many times more efficient than radiating, at all temperatures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-2000K is about 1726 degrees Celsius. That\u0027s well within the temperature tolerances for many solid materials. While a command pod shouldn\u0027t be sitting at temperatures that melt steel, there\u0027s no reason a carbon radiator doesn\u0027t operate at temperatures well below its triple point in atmosphere (4330C) or its sublimation point in vacuum (5530C).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-NTRs are solid core rockets. Their temperature can increase or decrease depending on how far the neutron poison control rods are inserted/rotated. There is no reason that propellant flow is always enough to cool the nuclear core. While it might be true for chemical rockets, because of their massive fuel flows (up to 1.2 tons per second), it is not true for the LV-N which only has a fuel flow of 7.6kg/s to dump its heat into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Converting waste heat into electrical energy does not make that waste heat disappear.

At that point it possesses a decent, if unexciting, middle-red glow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GR-1 doesn\u0027t get that hot, even if dissipating 1350 kW instead of the strictly required 1250 kW. It\u0027ll stabilize around 940 K, at which point it has a dull reddish glow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GR-EXP, finally, is completely bored by its task and stabilizes at no more than 825 K. Its glow is so weak, it\u0027s barely visible even in the dark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tested with emissiveConstant of 0.95 instead of 1.00, which generally increased the stabilization temperature by 20 K to 30 K.

Even the XR-500 running at 1250 K is still in no danger of melting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the deployed radiators actually getting their lower conductivity after quicksaving/quickloading, the radiators also have a very generous breathing room in terms of heat transfer capacity. For example, with the \u0022wrong\u0022 conductivity the GR-4 has so much backflow that the whole ship stabilizes somewhere a bit above 400 K, and the radiator at 225 kW transfer capacity is well balanced to keep it there. But with the correct conductivity, the radiators have no trouble cooling the entire ship to 273 K (below which they do not cool) and keep it there with performance to spare. Even adjusted to 210 kW capacity, the radiators are still easily sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow obviously, engines also produce heat. The overcapacity of the radiators helps cool the ship during and after burns.

With emissiveConstant at 0.95, I tried to get them to 1200 K, which is roughly the same heat range as the standard radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 55 kW GR-EXP can dissipate 220 kW at a temperature of 1200 K, with negligible conductive backflow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 225 kW GR-4 can dissipate 300 kW at a temperature of 1195 K, with minor conductive backflow of about 3.5 kW\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1350 kW GR-1 can handle 3300 kW at a temperature of 1199 K, of which 125 kW is conductive backflow and 3175 kW is radiated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was pretty surprised by how well the GR-EXP performs, and how little difference there is to the GR-4.

That\u0027s well within the temperature tolerances for many solid materials. While a command pod shouldn\u0027t be sitting at temperatures that melt steel, there\u0027s no reason a carbon radiator doesn\u0027t operate at temperatures well below its triple point in atmosphere (4330C) or its sublimation point in vacuum (5530C).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-NTRs are solid core rockets. Their temperature can increase or decrease depending on how far the neutron poison control rods are inserted/rotated. There is no reason that propellant flow is always enough to cool the nuclear core. While it might be true for chemical rockets, because of their massive fuel flows (up to 1.2 tons per second), it is not true for the LV-N which only has a fuel flow of 7.6kg/s to dump its heat into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Converting waste heat into electrical energy does not make that waste heat disappear. You\u0027ll always need to dissipate the full amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom when I was looking into this earlier (and what I remember from my physics and chemistry courses in college):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn an atmosphere, that is not moving, you can saturate the air and have limited further conduction. Now this in the real world is usually not a big deal because the hot air will rise and carry heat away. In which case yes, the active cooling of the radiator by the external fluid (the atmosphere) will be incredibly effective. Far more than radiation against a gray body which you always are on when you\u0027re on the surface. I don\u0027t think KSP is modeling atmospheric convection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep about 1700C, and you need to run the coolant through that, it also needs to maintain structural integrity. I was mostly looking into the SAFE400 and the temps it was operating at, 2000K required a carbon radiator. For the reasons you stated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre we controlling the NTR\u0027s core as such that we can over-do it and the propellant is not enough? Point of the NTR is to get it as hot as possible in a stable way and run it. For game play purposes, the propellant should be enough to get it done. And the control rods should handle it for when its deactivated. Much like prior KSP NTR behavior, that is unless we can crank that heat up to get an ISP boost understanding it will run for a limited time and we are responsible for that extra cooling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot waste heat, total heat. Some of the heat energy becomes electrical energy in the converter, rest is waste heat. Yes you do need to get rid of all of that. So if you have a 2000 kWt reactor, 400 kWe converter, you need to dissipate 1600 kWt to the environment somehow or otherwise use it... though limits there as you approach the ideal engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T03:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBingo!

At that point it possesses a decent, if unexciting, middle-red glow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GR-1 doesn\u0027t get that hot, even if dissipating 1350 kW instead of the strictly required 1250 kW. It\u0027ll stabilize around 940 K, at which point it has a dull reddish glow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GR-EXP, finally, is completely bored by its task and stabilizes at no more than 825 K. Its glow is so weak, it\u0027s barely visible even in the dark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tested with emissiveConstant of 0.95 instead of 1.00, which generally increased the stabilization temperature by 20 K to 30 K. This didn\u0027t negatively impact any of the radiators. Even the XR-500 running at 1250 K is still in no danger of melting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the deployed radiators actually getting their lower conductivity after quicksaving/quickloading, the radiators also have a very generous breathing room in terms of heat transfer capacity. For example, with the \u0022wrong\u0022 conductivity the GR-4 has so much backflow that the whole ship stabilizes somewhere a bit above 400 K, and the radiator at 225 kW transfer capacity is well balanced to keep it there. But with the correct conductivity, the radiators have no trouble cooling the entire ship to 273 K (below which they do not cool) and keep it there with performance to spare. Even adjusted to 210 kW capacity, the radiators are still easily sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow obviously, engines also produce heat. The overcapacity of the radiators helps cool the ship during and after burns. Depends on your tastes how much overcapacity you\u0027d like to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I tested just how much room for capacity the conformal radiators actually have with their areas as they are. With emissiveConstant at 0.95, I tried to get them to 1200 K, which is roughly the same heat range as the standard radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 55 kW GR-EXP can dissipate 220 kW at a temperature of 1200 K, with negligible conductive backflow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 225 kW GR-4 can dissipate 300 kW at a temperature of 1195 K, with minor conductive backflow of about 3.5 kW\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1350 kW GR-1 can handle 3300 kW at a temperature of 1199 K, of which 125 kW is conductive backflow and 3175 kW is radiated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was pretty surprised by how well the GR-EXP performs, and how little difference there is to the GR-4. I mean sure, the former is meant to be mounted in sets of 4 and the latter in sets of 6, but still. Interestingly enough, the heat capacity estimation in the VAB (which I still have in my version) mirrored this from the start, showing the GR-EXP surprisingly close to the GR-4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood stuff. The GR-EXP probably performs well because it\u0027s technically quite large, similar to the GR-4. The main issue would be that KSP calculates part area in terms of a cube, so it\u0027s not accounting for the fact that the GR-EXP is concave on the inside, which would significantly cut into its effective radiative capabilities when open. KSP just sees it as \u0022pretty big\u0022. The GR-4 is probably more accurately modeled in terms of effective radiating area. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will probably adjust the names of the XR series too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut generally, once I fix the heat conduction bug, this is pretty good, no? \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAwesome\u003C/span\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all this testing, guys.
