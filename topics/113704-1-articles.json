Looking at various deltaV-maps I cannot find the answer myself, so maybe some pro out there can help me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. My mothership is currently landed on Minmus surface and has 700m/s deltaV left. I want to launch, get into solar orbit and then get back to Kerbin. Do I have enough deltaV for doing this? If not, how much would I need?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I have a small dinghy attached with a separate deltaV of 3500m/s. Once in solar orbit, I want to undock it and go on a quick solar suborbit with it and then re-dock. (Yes, it is one of those tourist contracts). How do I do this most efficiently; do I have to enter solar orbit by burning retrograde (to Kerbin\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s solar orbit) out of Minmus orbit instead of a prograde burn before I undock the dinghy?

You don\u0027t have to wait half a year, and you don\u0027t need hundreds of m/s of dV to return. All you need to do is to manage your Minmus ejection so that you\u0027re in an elliptic orbit around Kerbin whose apoapsis just \u003Cem\u003Ebarely\u003C/em\u003E leaves the SoI. That will take a few weeks of calendar time, but it means you\u0027ll leave Kerbin\u0027s SoI with a very low velocity relative to Kerbin, which means that you can then use a fairly low dV burn to head home again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your dinghy question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat exactly is the dinghy supposed to do?

If it\u0027s just \u0022orbit the sun\u0022, you don\u0027t need the dinghy at all-- simply peeking outside Kerbin\u0027s SoI is all you need, because you\u0027re orbiting the Sun the moment you do that. You\u0027re already doing that with your main mothership, so no extra dinghy shenanigans required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you\u0027ve got one of those \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Esuborbital \u003C/strong\u003Etrajectory on the Sun\u0022 contracts, I\u0027d say that 3500 m/s would be nowhere near enough.
