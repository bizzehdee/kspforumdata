However, I decided to download a few of the larger ones and realized a point of confusion. There seems to be no way to get some of the ships in space, as far as I can tell, despite seeing screenshots of them...in space. For example, in this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/58495-Comrade-s-Spare-Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/58495-Comrade-s-Spare-Parts\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Co-21F won\u0027t launch from the SPH runway or the launch pad.
