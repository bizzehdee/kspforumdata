If I use radial decouplers they almost ever instant explode while decoupling in low and high atmosphere, even if I add powerfull seperatrons and all is exactly centered. the top of the external tank/booster always crashes into the midle section of the rocket. but it also happens if there is nothing attached to the seperators.
