There are entries in the background handler that look like this:\n\n    navBallCenter = 320,302headingBarPosition = 320, 22, 128, 18\n\nThe first number on each (320) needs to be changed to move the navball and heading bar to the right. You will need to look in the config file, near the top, for \n\n    screenPixelWidth = (something)\n\nWhere (something) is a number. Change both \u0022320\u0022s in the PFD to half of \u0022something\u0022. That should center the ball and heading strip on the screen. You can also tweak that number to move it around (the 320, 302 are the x,y coordinate of the center of the ball)."},{"CreatedByName":"Diddly Feelerino","CreatedById":116824,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T14:10:42Z","Content":"That seems to have fixed it, thanks very much! =D"},{"CreatedByName":"icecubecookie","CreatedById":39045,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T14:38:37Z","Content":"somehow i managed to fix the black screen problem by removing the entire JSI folder, installing v0.20.0 of RPM and then overwriting the JSI folder with the v0.22.2 JSI folder and files"},{"CreatedByName":"Adyx","CreatedById":70890,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T20:51:48Z","Content":"The black screen in the HUD can be fixed by placing **ladder.png** from an older version of RPM into \\GameData\\JSI\\RasterPropMonitor\\Library\\Components\\HUD.
