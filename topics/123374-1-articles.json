It is a lonely job, and a thankless one for the most part. Until something goes wrong. Until a ship is in distress. In the 23rd century, this job has moved into outer space. A network of beacons allows ships to travel across the Milky Way at many times the speed of light. These beacons are built to be robust. They never break down. They never fail. At least, they aren\u0027t supposed to.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI absoluetly love Hugh Howey\u0027s writing style. He has a knack for creating deep and fascinating characters. After reading his Silo Series (\u0022Wool\u0022, \u0022Shift\u0022, and \u0022Dust\u0022) I\u0027ve decided to read pretty much anything he ever decides to write and with Beacon 23 I was not disappointed. It\u0027s a nice quick read (only about 250 pages) but he still manages to fill it with a believable environment. While I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible for him to ever top \u0022Wool\u0022, this is still a fun read and I like the perspective of a man all alone in a tiny beacon (23rd century version of a lighthouse) with the huge void of space all around him. The main character is a war veteran dealing with PTSD and also extreme self-inflicted loneliness.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EAlso, even though it has nothing to do with space, Hugh Howey\u0027s Silo Series is a must-read in my opinion -- currently my personal all-time favorite books.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T20:55:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYay.
