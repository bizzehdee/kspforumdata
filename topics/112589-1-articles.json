Cheap science at under 0.9t!","CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:28:28Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:28:28Z","Content":"Want to add a probe to your mission that isn\u0027t heavy and doesn\u0027t cost a lot so you can grab some cheap extra science? Then you need the Bitsat! Kerbal engineers have been struggling with budget cuts due to so many mission failures and have resorted to taking any old parts they find in dumpsters, gluing them together, and reselling them as \u0022new products\u0022.\n\nThis tiny probe uses RCS propulsion to get around. Its dual solar panels and tiny battery will keep it humming along all the way down until it crashes into the surface, or doesn\u0027t crash, whichever.\n\nStats:\n\nWeight : 0.855t\n\nDelta V : 1940\n\nFunds cost (without science gear) : 3570\n\nUse, remove or replace the existing science stuff glued to the sides with whatever you want! Glue removing solvent sold separately.\n\nComes with 5, yes that\u0027s right, FIVE antennas! 4 of them are just for looks, but I mean, look at it! Cool right? (Ensure you extend antennas for maximum coolness factor)\n\n[![TDsPnsdh.png](http://i.imgur.com/TDsPnsdh.png)](http://imgur.com/TDsPnsd)\n\n[![u8sRzMZh.png](http://i.imgur.com/u8sRzMZh.png)](http://imgur.com/u8sRzMZ)\n\nOrder yours today! The first 500 customers will receive the satisfaction in knowing that they\u0027re one of the first 500 customers to own such a nice probe!\n\nOr, download it for free, which is also cool\n\n[url=\u0022[![u8sRzMZh.png](http://i.imgur.com/u8sRzMZh.png)](http://imgur.com/u8sRzMZ)\u0022]DOWNLOAD FROM MEDIAFIRE\n\nHow to use: Attach a decoupler to the bottom of it like any other rocket. To fly, ensure RCS is on and throttle up. For more detailed instructions on how to fly a probe, please google \u0022KSP how to fly a rocket\u0022.\n\nCheers!\n\nXT"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T19:45:53Z","Content":"Cute probe."}]}
