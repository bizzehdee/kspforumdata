As you can see from my signature this has so far been successful. It just mean I try to plan carefully and test as much as possible before actually putting kerbals at risk. However, it does not seem appropriate to send an entire empty ship to Duna, so I need to plan this a bit more carefully. And I need your help on how to look through these numbers and see if they match up with requirements. I\u0027m not a rocket scientist afterall, and not that comfortable interpreting the Kerbal Engineer Redux readouts. Comments are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA prerequisite for my design was to use the larger command pods. It seemed unrealistic to send single-man pods on interplanetary missions, so no Mk1 pods. In addition, I decided to make a crew cabin a requirement for extended operations, so both the orbiter and the lander must include a crew cabin. It was just a very simple way to simulate some sort of life support requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship can be roughly divided into three parts: the lander, the orbiter, and the transfer stage. The combined multipart ship, called Duna Endeavour, will start out from a 100km Kerbin orbit. The transfer stage will bring the entire craft from Kerbin to a 53km Duna orbit. The lander, called Duna Explorer, will bring two kerbals to the surface of Duna and later return them to the orbiter via a seperate ascent stage. The orbiter, called Duna Orbiter, will keep a single kerbal in orbit during the visit, and later bring all three kerbals back to Kerbin. So, a classical apollo-style approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used: various KSPX tanks, and the 1-4 adapter for the transfer stage rocket mounting. I have made a personal modification to integrate MechJeb functionality into the stock command pods, so that should not be a prerequisite mod to load the craft. Kerbal Engineering Redux, obviously, but only used during design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe transfer stage\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Om2E2Dl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPICTURE\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stage has an initial TWR of 0.11 making it rather slow to accelerate. It worries me that maneuvers might become difficult to execute accurately. The good part is that it prevents wobbling. It has a delta-v capacity of 4364km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe lander\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/EVANtvf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPICTURE\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/xaDCEVw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPICTURE (ascent)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander has a TWR of 1.47, and a delta-v capacity of 2547km/s. The landing will rely heavily on parachutes, with two drogue chutes and four main chutes. It is divided into a lower descent stage and an upper ascent stage. The descent stage contains a mixture of fuel tanks (306/374 fuel/oxid), which is hopefully sufficient for the deorbit and landing burns. The descent stage will be left behind during ascent, and therefore contains all the unnecessary equipment, like landing gears, landing lights, floodlights, sensors, crew cabin, solar arrays. The ascent stage will be topped up with fuel from the descent stage before launch, and will return the crew to the 53km orbit and rendezvous and dock with the orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe orbiter\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/UpDtWM6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPICTURE\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbiter has a TWR of 0.94, and a delta-v capacity of 6976km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for those curious about how I got this into orbit, then: I didn\u0027t. At least not in this specific configuration. The four-engine arrangement on the transfer stage does not allow it to be placed on top of a lifter. So I will use hyperedit to bring this design into orbit. However, I *did* do it with an identical design except for a single LV-NB atomic rocket from the KSPX package. The transfer/orbiter parts were launched together as a single payload and the lander seperately and docked in orbit. To launch the transfer/orbiter payload I first had to drain all tanks by an extended burn while still clasped to the platform, and subsequently top of all tanks via six refuelling missions. It was doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EQuestions\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Is the transfer stage powerful enough to bring the craft from a 100km Kerbin orbit to a 53km Duna orbit (aerobrake-assisted)? If not, I hope the orbiter can compensate without compromising the rest of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

With 4\u002B km/s on your transfer stage, you don\u0027t really need to aerobrake to get to low Duna orbit with fuel to spare. Likewise the almost 7 km/s of the orbiter are \u0022a bit\u0022 too much: With a bit more than one you can do a Duna-Kerbin transfer. The only place where you are a bit light in excess delta-v is the lander. If you spend a lot to brake before landing (I mean, if you are \u003Cem\u003Eawful\u003C/em\u003E at landing, because it\u0027s also a bit overkill), you may run short on ascent. However, you could just give legs to the orbiter and take it down to rescue the kerbals, in that case, it has the delta-v to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, this mission could go on a diet.

I am also considering to attach additional \u0022deadweight\u0022 like probes and rovers to the craft if I can find a suitable place for it. I believe the low TWR would prevent the orbiter from doing a landing - or a takeoff, at least. I think I will remove the four droptanks on the orbiter, and see if that helps. But yeah... who doesn\u0027t like to have some extra fuel onboard?
