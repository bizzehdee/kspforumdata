I\u0027m looking for suggestions on how to stabilize the wings if possible? \n\nThese 3 screenshots show the part from IR that I\u0027ve tried to use for rotating them (I\u0027d first tried using the \u0027IR rotatron\u0027 but that proved even less stable then the current part. [http://imgur.com/Smzkhrf,PkdnbWv,3nuerRM](http://imgur.com/Smzkhrf,PkdnbWv,3nuerRM)\n\nYes, the rudder being red was just my own personal flair. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAlso included is all the different screenshots I\u0027d taken of the craft, first just to show off getting the wings to rotate in properly (which was a royal PITA on its own. The rotational parts kept working backwards, or against each other, I still am having issues there to be honest) but then there are also shots showing the wings flex up and down, massively... and that\u0027s where I\u0027m looking for help, how can I prevent this?\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/1jTgT](http://imgur.com/a/1jTgT)\n\nMost of my work is using the B9 procedural wings, with a few other mod parts... wheels from KAX and the cockpit is from the Quiztech aero pack.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T06:33:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 06:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by caitiemew**"},{"CreatedByName":"soulreaver1981","CreatedById":38542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T08:29:19Z","Content":"when making the wing, use the docking washer standard like you did.\n\nthen place the wing and put a nother docking washer on top (a free moving version this time) put a cubicstrut on that and strut the cubic strut to the rest of the plane.\n\nhere is a video of me explaining it.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7LZPmddZOM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nhope it helps\n\ngreetings\n\nsoulreaper\n\nps line everthing up using the offset and rotate tools"},{"CreatedByName":"caitiemew","CreatedById":11900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T12:43:35Z","Content":"THank you very much, that worked tremendously well.
