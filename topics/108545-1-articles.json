I\u0027m looking for suggestions on how to stabilize the wings if possible? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese 3 screenshots show the part from IR that I\u0027ve tried to use for rotating them (I\u0027d first tried using the \u0027IR rotatron\u0027 but that proved even less stable then the current part. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Smzkhrf,PkdnbWv,3nuerRM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/Smzkhrf,PkdnbWv,3nuerRM\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the rudder being red was just my own personal flair. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso included is all the different screenshots I\u0027d taken of the craft, first just to show off getting the wings to rotate in properly (which was a royal PITA on its own. The rotational parts kept working backwards, or against each other, I still am having issues there to be honest) but then there are also shots showing the wings flex up and down, massively... and that\u0027s where I\u0027m looking for help, how can I prevent this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/1jTgT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/1jTgT\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my work is using the B9 procedural wings, with a few other mod parts... wheels from KAX and the cockpit is from the Quiztech aero pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T06:33:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 06:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by caitiemew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulreaver1981","CreatedById":38542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T08:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhen making the wing, use the docking washer standard like you did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen place the wing and put a nother docking washer on top (a free moving version this time) put a cubicstrut on that and strut the cubic strut to the rest of the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere is a video of me explaining it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7LZPmddZOM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehope it helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreetings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esoulreaper\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eps line everthing up using the offset and rotate tools\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"caitiemew","CreatedById":11900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T12:43:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETHank you very much, that worked tremendously well.
