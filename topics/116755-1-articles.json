Could a gizmo like the offset/rotation ones be implemented that duplicates a part (and parts attached to it) and allows you to offset them? It would bring up a set of axis markers like the offset tool, and once you pull a marker it copies the related parts and slides them along the selected axis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlt-clicking would still be easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T21:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptainTurbomuffin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptainTurbomuffin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlt-clicking would still be easier.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo bad the part copy gets confused; and rarely preserves the exact orientation of the part you are copying.

If I used the rotation/offset tool to offset something, this shouldn\u0027t be resetted if I move the part again, in place mode, or I just copy it. But instead of inserting a new mode, the copy mode, where this would work, it would be easier to make it work with Alt-clicking. Of course, I keep seeing people who never never ever use hotkeys. For them, it would still be better, if once you\u0027ve clicked the \u0027copy\u0027 button, your next click will copy a part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
