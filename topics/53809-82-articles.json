I\u0027m about half done building a Minimus-based Station Science station(also has MP and LF storage for \u0022miscalcuations\u0022 during ordinary exploration missions) and the parts count is already getting high enough to halve my frame rate. When I send up complicated parts deliveries(i.e. solar arrays, KAS crate deliveries, fuel trucks, etc...), or when my satellite passes by, it gets pretty hard to dock anything. If this helps alleviate that I\u0027ll use it in a heartbeat. I\u0027m concerned that its going to get pretty ridiculous by the time the rest of the parts are attached...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe frame rate issue you are seeing is due to the fact that the physics system in KSP is single threaded, and with lots of interacting parts, the work for any given frame is increased and that eventually becomes the limiting factor on how many frames per second can be rendered, but it has nothing to do with memory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod will help you run more mods and have access to more types of parts by reducing the memory required for the texture for each type of part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou probably want to make it easier on the physics system by keeping the part count low.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SleepyWeasel","CreatedById":121169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T02:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh yes I was afraid of that.
