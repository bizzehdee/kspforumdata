I\u0027ve gotten semi-advanced rocket designs going right to the edge of 30 parts. I\u0027ve gotten into orbit, successfully changed apogee and paragee, etc. Sure I\u0027ve crashed a few times, but when that\u0027s happened it made sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the things I never, never, ever, \u003Cstrong\u003EEVER \u003C/strong\u003Ehad problems with was re-entry and chute deployment. I\u0027d re-enter, get heated up, not explode, slow down, pop the chute and land. Water. Land. Didn\u0027t matter. In three days it got so I could do this phase of the mission with my eyes closed. In fact, it got to a point where I said, \u0022Yea, this game is pretty accurate, but I\u0027m surprised re-entry is that easy.\u0022 \u00A0Now, please remember, all of this was re-entry from low Kerbin orbit of, say, 70km when I didn\u0027t reach orbit, and 120km when I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as of 27 September, suddenly, I can\u0027t successfully land at all. Whenever I try it, when I press the space bar to pop the chute, it either says that the chute has been destroyed due to heat and aero forces, or it pops up and sort of explodes with the module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve always manually deployed the chute (I say this because I\u0027m getting the impression it can be automatically deployed based on ACL and altitude, but I\u0027ve never tried that).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve checked my staging.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is unmodified Kerbal. The only settings I\u0027ve played around with were tweaking the audio settings and changing the screen to full screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve re-built rockets from the ground up (thinking there was an issue with that particular rocket), and I can\u0027t even do this now with a simple, single stage, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy issue is that 2-3 days ago I could do this with my eyes closed.

The \u0022destroyed due to heat and aero forces\u0022 had never come up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething has changed and for the life of me (or, in this case for the life of Jebediah) I can\u0027t figure out what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else experienced a sudden change in parachute deployment behavior?

If you just go up and spend a few minutes suborbital, you will fall almost straight down. \u00A0Watch your speed - that is critical for safe deployment. Do not rush it, it is perfectly ok to deploy at \u0026lt;2000m.

But this setting is unimportant if you always wait to safe speeds to even arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, the chutes fully deploy (spread out and slow you to landing speed). \u00A0This is governed by the altitude tweakable. \u00A0The default here is generally fine, though you can speed up landing by lowering it to 800m or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like your problem is linked to reentry speed, which is not something these settings would probably help with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kinnerc","CreatedById":169482,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T00:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFolks:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany, many thanks for the help today, folks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to be finally fixed.
