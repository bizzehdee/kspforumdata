Or maybe a rescue mission. But a mission profile pod of this nature just eludes my logic on how to implement it in gameplay. I probably lack imagination, too, but that\u0027s why I don\u0027t mod. And me learning how to use everything there is to learn to make a mod is like me trying to read ancient greek. Yeah, I can see it, but I can\u0027t do a thing with it.
