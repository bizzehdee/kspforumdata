Actually, I collected almost 4 times more responses than what I expected!!!\n\nYour help is absolutely invaluable and I cannot find the words to thank you properly!\n\nI will start sending out the gift boxes a bit earlier than planned, probably around the 25th of May. So stay tuned and be patient - it will take me quite some time to reach you all ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Thank you!**\n\n*Hello people!*\n\n*I am a final year student in the Netherlands and I am doing a marketing research for my graduation thesis. I need to find out what games you like and where you play them. To do so, I created this questionnaire - and it\u0027s all about games* ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*I would be eternally grateful if you\u0027d spend a couple of minutes (no more than 10, I promise!) to fill it in.* \n\n*If you do fill it in, and if you have a Steam account, then I can send you a small gift - either a CS:GO, Dota, or a TF2 box. Just leave your details (Steam account URL and Steam Trade URL) at the end of the questionnaire, and as soon as I close it I will start sending the items. I will make sure that everybody receives something* ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*Happy gaming!*\n\n*@dimdimdov*\n\n*EDIT**: I just posted the questionnaire on the Steam* [*subreddit*](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/365syn/would_you_fill_in_a_gaming_survey_for_my/) *cuz I will need some extra responses.
