So far all I have is the idea and a lump of third party code that adds TrackIR support to Unity3d...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is something I was discussing with my brother (HarvesteR) and he did say TrackIR support is one of those things that he wishes he had more time to do - but perhaps, might be a job better suited for a mod at this point, since most players don\u0027t really have such hardware even if those who do (like me and him) greatly miss being able to use it on KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand, while I\u0027m at it, I thought I\u0027d add a couple of features I\u0027ve missed since a while ago and that everyone can enjoy - regardless of fancy hardware or not - and that\u0027d be a camera shake effect on high G load situations (there is such a plugin for Orbiter, so if you know that, you may already know exactly what I mean)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyways, the point of this is to make flying from IVA as immersive as some of the newer mods have made it interesting - perhaps add a set of ambient A/C sounds when inside...
