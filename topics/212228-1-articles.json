While some players and critics have praised its improved graphics, user interface, multiplayer mode, and interstellar features, others have criticized its bugs, glitches, performance issues, and lack of innovation compared to the original game. In my opinion, while KSP2 looks like a visual improvement, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003Eit has not met my expectations\u003C/span\u003E. I got into Kerbal Space Program when KSP2 was announced, and I had fun with it after having installed many mods to make it a more polished experience (like the tutorial fixing mod.) However, I firmly believe it will be a while before the studio fulfills their promises, and\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e74c3c;\u0022\u003E I feel like they have overpromised and underdelivered\u003C/span\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s important to keep in mind that game development can be a complex and challenging process, but the game\u0027s problematic development history suggests that there may be more difficulties ahead. The developers have promised to update the game regularly with new content and fixes. I hope that they will be able to deliver on their promises and address some of the issues that the players have raised. In the meantime, I plan to continue playing the original game and keep an eye on KSP2 updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your thoughts on Kerbal Space Program 2 so far?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s discuss!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-23T04:27:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2023 04:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Devblaze\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFormatted appropriately.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T06:42:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel a need to get this observation off my chest somewhere, so I\u0027m picking this thread:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the video before his official embargoed KSP2 preview, Scott Manley mentioned going to the big event with all the other space Youtubers.

While you can get useful feedback from an early release that helps deliver a better experience on the full release, this does not replace dedicated testers, nor even reduce the numbers you need. QA department is staffed with professionals who know how to not only look for problems, but look for regressions, reproduction steps, do some early triage in terms of how severe the problems are, and so on. Yeah, your entry level QA employees might not have any prior experience with this, but people who manage them directly most certainly do, and it\u0027s not something you can outsource to fans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, yes, an early access is a way to generate revenue. Though, it\u0027s not so much for the sake of actually getting the money to finish the game - as that\u0027s going to be provided by the Private Division anyways, but rather to show the actual interest in the game and help the publisher to determine what sort of marketing to do, whether to get started on future DLC content and so on. This isn\u0027t really for paying for the remaining development - that\u0027s covered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of it as a game on Kickstarter. Have you seen some mid-size games that have a funding goal of $100k? Do you really think any game these days costs that much to make? Cheap mobile games start at about $2-3M budgets. A lot of the Kickstarter games with $100k funding have $10M\u002B from publishers attached to it if the goals are met. That 1% of the budget isn\u0027t covering any of the production costs. It\u0027s just there to make sure people actually want to buy the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re in a similar territory with the KSP2 Early Access. Intercept gets to see where people who aren\u0027t professional testers are struggling, whether due to bugs or due to some UI choices that seemed like a good idea, but aren\u0027t actually working out. Private Division gets to see how many people want to buy the game, not just hyped for it, but actually prepared to spend the money on it, and can plan accordingly. We get to try out the game early and also get it for a bit less than what it will cost when fully released. So long as everyone understands what this is about and has the right expectations, this is mutually beneficial to everyone involved, including people who are going to skip on the early access and wait for the full release. The only way this becomes a problem is if people expect something that this isn\u0027t, like a polished experience with good performance. If that\u0027s what you want, wait a few months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T10:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me the biggest issue seems to be the performance (which i seriously hope will be fixed in future versions).\u00A0 I can fully understand the game now working properly on my current POS GPU (GTX 1050 TI, like the 3rd best card you could get at that time), and the CPU if enuff, but if the streamer build is anywhere near accurate then why would a sub 200 part rocket lag badly enough going thru atmo (at least until boosters are dumped) to slow the game to like sub 20 FPS and slow down from realtime rendering?\u00A0 Yes KSP1 is old, but ive never experienced lag going thru atmo on a craft below 300 parts, not even if i give it 30 engines on the 1st stage.\u00A0 Dat and the streamer PCs were very high spec last i checked so if they experienced that kind of lag there is a good chance you are screwed on a

does get painfully slow and laggy, the game is still playable.\u00A0 One of my hopes for KSP2 was that they would have slightly better high part count optimization (perhaps they will eventually in a few more years), but right now in KSP2 on a super beefy rig 151 parts ran worse then a 500 part \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with way more engines on

(maybee this is cause i\u0027m so used to scatterer and love its alien feel, but in general its a step backwards).\u00A0 I\u0027m certain there will be mods to make the scatters cooler/more alien so no worries here.\u00A0 As for the terrain tex, scatterer\u0027s is prettier imo, however its also a bit buggy and occasionally has tiling issues and artefacting so its a bit of a give/take.\u00A0 The one point of praise i can give KSP2 here though is that compared to pure stock KSP1, its a much better looking game in every

EA, but given that the current game isnt even remotely close to the original trailer, it is a bit dissapointing (especially with the absurd minimum GPU requirement.\u00A0 Who these days plays games below 1080p so you may as well consider any GPU below the bare minimum to be useless if indeed the game has such insane requirements once it launches and we start seeing some legit benchmarks on less

I hope that they will be able to deliver on their promises and address some of the issues that the players have raised.
