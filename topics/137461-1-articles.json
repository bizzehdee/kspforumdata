It surprised me since 1.0.5 is compiled on Unity 4 (Unity 4.3 I believe, a very old Unity version), and 1.1 was recompiled on 5 (5.2 I believe, a somewhat dated version of Unity 5). I should be surprised since the upgrade also slightly changed the .cfg files I believe. But read the link below, and follow the instructions. You\u0027ll know when it works when it shows up for selection in KerbalKonstructs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129560-kerbin-city-for-105/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T23:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not remotely surprised. Whilst the colliders on statics was briefly a problem caused by \u003Cstrong\u003EKSP \u003C/strong\u003Ediscontinuing legacy support that was needed for statics, community members stepped up and got an interim fix in place, giving me time to concentrate on work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurns out, that support of collider-types that are more suitable for statics than parts wasn\u0027t dropped in Unity 5 and I then adopted and tweaked the interim fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless, I personally am rather pleased that KerbinCity works with Kerbal Konstructs and that in fact it only needed the configs of a very old mod to be updated to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-21T00:03:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2016 12:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AlphaAsh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERemoved erroneous jab due to poor eye-sight\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
