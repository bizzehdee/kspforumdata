Looking at modern graphics cards I see the memories can go up to 4 GB.

It is not, it just has to be enough (2GB is enough for everything on Full-HD, even 1 GB is good enough for most games). The interesting factor is the power of the chip and here you dont need that much for KSP. You should choose a card from the newer generations (AMD 7XXX or R7/9 2XX, Nvidia GTX 6XX/7XX), the have MUCH more power than the older generations and are way more efficient, also they have better featuresets so and never DirectX versions so you can play new games for a longer time before you have to switch again. Regarding the Brand: Nvidia and AMD are tied on Graphic Power (a R290X is as good as a GTX 780ti, a 280X as good as a GTX 770 etc.) but they differ from price per performance, at least here in Germany Nvidia is allways more expensive than AMD, but that can differ in you country.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding SSD vs. HDD: ALLWAYS choose a SSD (i would choose Samsung 840 Evo Series).
