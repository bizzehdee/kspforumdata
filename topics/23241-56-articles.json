I didn\u0027t take any screenshots, but I\u0027m using the S2 fuselage, with the large HL wings mounted on top of the fuselage. With the engines mounted underneath, the center of thrust is almost exactly in line with the center of mass (until I figured this out, the attitude problem was much, much worse.) Even so, getting up in altitude (typically 25KM\u002B) results in my thrust wanting to kick the nose up and over. I can manage this by managing my thrust, but it\u0027s still obnoxious. I don\u0027t know how complex the aerodynamics and physics are, but is this because the engines underneath are exerting an umm, \u0027axial\u0027 force that cause it to nose up and over?
