Such a motor could drive a length of truss, and to that we could add solar panels. This would give 2 axes of sun-tracking, very much like the ISS. (It rotates its trusses as the main sun-tracking facility, and uses the solar panels\u0027 own tracking for smaller adjustment.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs well as the code changes, the motors used would need some model or textural cues as to how it would align to the sun when activated:- a small greeble (such as a box with a sun-pointing lens) would be sufficient. If it was set up to be a model variant that would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-19T19:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it would stop tracking when the craft was not active, wouldn\u0027t it?
