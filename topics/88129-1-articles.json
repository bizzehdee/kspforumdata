Ok. Yes, that is your exact problem. With FAR enabled, with or without DREC, you must key your TWR to no more than 1.42 at liftoff. For optimal fuel efficiency, try to key all subsequent stage TWRs to match across stage events. In other words, if MECO is at TWR 2.0, do what you can to tweak the next stage\u0027s TWR to the same number, since I\u0027ve found that mid-launch aerodynamic failures can be made more likely by herky-jerk G-force changes across stage events, moreso than actual high G-load. (High G-load itself is a problem for DREC, but that\u0027s a separate issue.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that MechJeb is explicitly and exclusively familiar with stock aerodynamic values, \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E FAR or NEAR aerodynamics. Indeed, the whole reason that stock aerodynamics is so awful is that it essentially simulated flying through mayonnaise. FAR-atmosphere is much thinner, much more \u0022wispy,\u0022 which much less drag on most designs (FAR calculates drag by aspect ratio and collision mesh values with respect to the airstream, and takes some other calculations with respect to the size of the attachment nodes [the green spheres where parts interlock in the editor] whereas stock just does a flat calculation based on mass and only mass and nothing but mass -- an aerodynamic nosecone, having mass, will only INCREASE drag, for example.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that MechJeb is calculating terminal velocity based on how fast you\u0027d have to be going for stock aerodynamics (digital mayonnaise) to cancel out your acceleration and give you a constant speed, which requires ENORMOUS comparative thrust. Since you\u0027re flying through FAR aerodynamics, which tends to be much less atmospheric drag than stock would present even at high altitudes, your MechJeb-governed throttle is WAY in excess of what would otherwise be called for to limit your acceleration to below terminal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important to know what terminal velocity even is. Even if you know what it is, some readers of this thread won\u0027t, so I\u0027ll explain it anyway: thrust accelerates you forward / away from exhaust, drag accelerates you backwards / away from aero-dynamic prograde. When thrust \u003Cstrong\u003EEQUALS\u003C/strong\u003E drag, then speed doesn\u0027t change, and you continue flying at that speed until the balance between thrust and drag is upset. When drag is greater than thrust (or thrust drops below drag) speed in direction of travel decreases, resulting in a net acceleration backwards. When thrust is greater than drag (or drag drops below thrust) then forward speed increases, resulting in a net acceleration forwards. The math can get frustrating, especially during vertical launch, because downward gravity is ALSO acting parallel to drag, thereby effectively increasing it -- which is exactly why in a FAR-model ascent you want to begin your gravity turn asap, typically before 1000m altitude, to begin the process of splitting the gravity value from the drag value. In stock, since the aerodynamics are GREATLY worse than the gravity losses, it\u0027s important to get out of the lower atmosphere (highest drag envelope) asap before turning horizontal, which is why you see people going from 0-45 pitch at 10,000m altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb has some devbuilds that can more or less fake their way through FAR-based calculations, but since FAR itself is a mod and is constantly being updated to keep up with changes in the game, it\u0027s difficult to accurately peg MechJeb\u0027s inner workings to compensate. Generally, in FAR-regime launches, you have to learn to control your ascent manually. Using MJ to circularize at apoapsis is fine, however, and these problems would obviously not present in vacuum (relaunching from Mun / Minmus, for example.) Alternately, you can manually program in a series of vector changes in SASS, or manually modify the launch curve int he default MJ launch ascent module, though that\u0027s not for the faint of heart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a further alternative that most assuredly will not solve your problem but will minimize the inconvenience of the symptoms, is to use tweakable settings on your launch and mid stages to limit your thrust values to a TWR of ~1.3 at liftoff as I describe. Below 1.2, and you lose way too much dV to gravity. Above 1.4, you run a very heavy risk of aerofailure toward the end of the stage, where TWR spikes (because thrust remains constant but mass decreases due to empty fuel tanks, yielding higher TWR.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt bears mentioning that overreliance on sepratrons can itself be an inefficient way of coping with other design flaws, as elsewise suggest above. That said, using sepratrons is not necessarily a bad thing. One possibility is to aim them differently, perhaps at 80 degrees to vertical instead of inward at hard 90 -- 10 degrees up would result in slight retrograde thrust, pushing the booster aftward much quicklier, 10 degrees down would blow the booster slightly forward to compensate for airstream drag during sep.) Similarly, altering your control inputs to allow for stage sep in the final moments BEFORE booster cutoff (allowing the boosters to still be under thrust at time of sep, allowing them to not be so violently smacked by the retrograde airstream) or, the opposite, cutting throttle at booster cutoff so as to coast through booster stage sep, so that can drift outward on decoupler force alone, before re-maxxing throttle to fly off (total coasting time typically ~3 seconds, \u002B/-, if well timed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T14:02:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MisterFister\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MisterFister\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis means that MechJeb is calculating terminal velocity based on how fast you\u0027d have to be going for stock aerodynamics (digital mayonnaise) to cancel out your acceleration and give you a constant speed, which requires ENORMOUS comparative thrust.
