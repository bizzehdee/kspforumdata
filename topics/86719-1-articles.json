In my understanding, the phase angle is the angle made by two objects orbiting a third object. But quite often, the phase angle is negative, and that\u0027s the part I don\u0027t understand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the second satellite in orbit is behind the first one\u0027s orbit, the phase angle should be between 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. However, KER\u0027s measurements sometimes indicate negative angles, like -310\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, which confuses me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have looked around on the Internet without much succes, hence my question here. Can someone help me understand the principle ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carsogen","CreatedById":120905,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T23:24:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there Sovnheim, I believe it\u0027s just which direction KER \u0027looks\u0027 to calculate it.
