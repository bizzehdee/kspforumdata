Say you had a radial intake as well as an inline one. At low altitudes when the extra intake air isn\u0027t needed, the air from the radial intake could be directed along the side of the engine, cooling it, and then it could flow out the back of the aircraft. For higher altitudes when there was less air, the air from the intake could be redirected into the engine, adding to its air supply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a sound idea, or would it not work? I don\u0027t know much about IRL spaceplanes really, and i know that real jet engines behave a little differently than KSP jet engines (although i\u0027m not sure what the implications of that are).

In fact, the most powerful jet engines ever created were high-bypass turbofans. They actually generate quite a bit of thrust and most of it is generated by the fan rather than the exhaust (which is what makes them high-bypass rather than low-bypass). This is kind of why they tend to be more fuel efficient, rather than trying to derive thrust directly from the combustion products exiting the back of the engine (like a rocket), the engine is instead designed to use more of the energy from the combustion to drive the fan which is producing the thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA turbofan is really just a ducted fan that happens to be driven by a gas turbine.
