Is the image ring always ~1-1.5 solar diameters for the typical 550-1000 AU distances, no matter how distant the object being magnified is? If so, does this make it unsuitable for observations of distant galaxies? Can this work for more distant stars, and if so, why isn\u0027t it already in use given that there are a number of distant (non-trivial redshift) galaxies with annoying foreground stars?

If we would be able to see the horizon, that is the 100% proof that black holes exist, and analizing the light distortion finger print, it would tell us a lot about its nature..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERotation speed, gravity variations and compare all that with our predictions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor planets, you\u0027ll be in the wrong wavelength, or that it\u0027ll be so weak that the magnitude will be very low. Even if those are not problem at all, you\u0027ll need some super-high-res detector with super-tiny pixel size - a gravity lens doesn\u0027t have any applicable aperture (and so no resolution power). Or a large telescope, which would be a waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor black hole of Milky Way, still the same - you\u0027ll need some goodly resolving things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022UmbralRaptor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022UmbralRaptor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELikewise, though I would expect \u003Ca href=\u0022http://eventhorizontelescope.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eground based competition.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure, those are 2 very different techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore applicable to me, considering the fact that they\u0027re there already.
