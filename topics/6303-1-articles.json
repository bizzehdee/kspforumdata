I got down to about 20 meters and I was cruising along. I got down to about 10 meters and I was just cruising along. Not very fast, maybe 75-80 m/s. When I got down to about 7 m there was a little bit of a hiccup and I almost ditched, but caught it at the last second and was zipping along at literally 1 meter! It was insane. It looked as though I was sitting on the water\\\u0027s surface, but I was still going like 75 m/s. I was wondering how long i could keep it up for when I finally messed it up and it caught on the water and floated to a stop. It was crazy, I was literally skimming the waves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you posted this challenge, I\\\u0027m going to have to recreate it and see how fast I can get it going ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-04T02:10:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/REUzuUou8jM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ronox","CreatedById":3693,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-04T05:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHahah, @Tim I had one of those moments today, trying to do some scudrunning on the mun I realized I was dropping fast went full throttle for a good 10 seconds to have the ground come halfway through the closest particle coming out of the engine at five hundred something m/s.

I tried to test the power of its parachute system; both while fully fuelled and when having expended all its fuel. The full tanks were too heavy for the chutes.
