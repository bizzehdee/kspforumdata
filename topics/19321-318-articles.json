Not entirely bad thing, depends what you expect from your plane, for small fighter a like agile craft it is OK, although not very effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for your problem. It is pretty much \u0022normal\u0022 for FAR to calculate drag at engine mount like in picture. Don\u0027t know exactly how much of realism FAR caluclates, but it is not entierly unrealistic. When any body travels fast in fluid it leaves area with low preasure in rear area. That low preasure creates forces that pulling back that body - that is why it is called drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only surfaces in front, but surface area at back is equaly important when comes to drag. You will find more info and better explanation on wikipedia for this than I am able to provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps ferram can give more insight what is calculated and what not in FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that you are near mach 1 at only 1.3 km, almost sea level flight.

FAR calculates lift/drag based on frontal cross section of mesh over lenghth of part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine mounts adds some more frontal cross section area than standard MK2 to Mk1 adapter.
