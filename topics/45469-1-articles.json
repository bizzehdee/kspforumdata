Going from microgravity to 1g would obviously be tougher(read: you as a pile of mush on the ground vs. you floating freely in space), but I\u0027m sure we could come up with a process of slow reintroduction of gravity by either slowly spinning up a habitat module or slowly accelerating back to earth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
