Sometimes, other (not the current one) ship icons\u00A0disappear (fade out) on their tracks. If you didn\u0027t hover your mouse on the icon in time, it will fade out into nothingness and you\u0027ll have to exit and enter the map view again. This problem is not all that big, at least there\u0027s a workaround. The problem with asteroids is more serious: for example, the icons on top of the Map View say that there are currently 7 asteroids visible, but I can see only three. I\u0027m pretty sure that these are the parts of the same problem - asteroids too fade out for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to isolate the reason\u00A0I want to ask is\u00A0anyone having the same problems with stock (unmodded installs) or perhaps someone knows what might be the issue here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-16T09:22:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe icons are supposed to do that. Yes, they do it in stock. There have been several feedbacks to the devs that the fadeout times are too quick. You can also get the ship to fade back in if you look from the correct direction at the correct magnification (especially if you are looking from the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E as the faded out ship). Maybe a button to temporarily unfade all ships would be nice. I haven\u0027t looked closely at the asteroids -- maybe the fading is a more serious issue there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
