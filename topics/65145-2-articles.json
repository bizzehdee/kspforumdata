Not only was I able to launch the entire generation ship as a whole unit, but I was able to take over half capacity of fuel with me. Jebediah Kerman himself manned the historic mission. He will dock with Triskelion Mk. V, where command of the mission will be passed over to Donory Kerman. When that is done, the Triskelion ship will fill its fuel banks with whatever it can from the Triskelion Mk. V, and the Mk. V will deorbit. Preparation is not yet done.
