I believe Nintendo had a network in development for players to watch TV, receive the news and view the stocks I believe from their NES (may be wrong as to the specifics as it\u0027s been a while since I read on this, but it was in development). Not to mention SegaNet which existed very briefly in the 90s which allow players to DL games and play them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut your referring to more modern games with internet and I say it\u0027s both a curse and a blessing. It\u0027s a curse since games have been less stable since the debut of the downloadable hotfixes become wide spread. Not to mention, since we\u0027ve become connected, cheats and secrets have become a subject for those hotfixes killing. Back in the 90s, it used to be what everyone who played video games used to talk about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to prove this, was through the Mortal Kombat hype during the 90s. Kids used to share secret moves and codes they\u0027d discover or read up by connecting their 1992 computer to their phone and calling specific places to receive information in a new technology known as \u0027the internet\u0027. However kids would also talk about tricks and cheats for other big games too, like Legend of Zelda, Sonic, any big game would have kids who would spend hours scanning every inch of the game looking for these secrets, but because of the introduction of comparable scores and progress, they\u0027ve become extinct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow because player\u0027s experience has to be shown and kept fair, glitches that had cool and potentially unfair effects have been fixed and cheat codes like invincibility, and infinite whatever has become rare.
