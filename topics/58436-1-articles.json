The main problem I\u0027ve had is that whenever I launch a ship, it tilts. Now, I would like to just say now that I\u0027m playing on career, so as far as I know SAS is of the table. I\u0027ve managed to get one or two small ships out of the atmosphere, and I did some sciencey things with em, so I have some science. I have looked EVERYWHERE for a solution, and I\u0027ve check everything from fuel distribution to center of mass, and so far I\u0027ve had no luck finding an answer, and I was wondering if someone could lend a hand?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T02:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first and most important question: does this happen without the mod installed?

This authority is provided by 4 kinds of devices: SAS from capsules and reaction wheels (though you said you don\u0027t have the reaction wheels yet), steerable fins (not all of them are, so check their VAB descriptions), RCS (which works only poorly in atmosphere), and engines which have a pivoting \u0022gimbal\u0022 mount and therefore have \u0022thrust vectoring\u0022 capability as listed in their VAB descriptions. Very small ships can get by with nothing but the capsule\u0027s inherent SAS, but as your design gets larger, you\u0027ll need to add more of the other devices to retain control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T11:10:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeither your pod/probe has not enough torque,or center of thrust is not inline with center of mass.Or something breaks at launch.OR you are going really fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ewhy do you even install mods if you don\u0027t know how to play the game \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T11:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would point out that if the \u0027tilt\u0027 gets progressively worse as you climb then my suspect would be an erroneous fuel-line.
