I equipped the satellite correctly per the contract\u0027s requirements, flew it to the Mun, and reached what appears to be the correct orbit. Seriously, folks... I\u0027m within like 250 meters margin of error on the Apoapsis/Periapsis and the inclination appears to be right, though I\u0027m not entirely sure how to check it for exact precision in comparison to the requested angles. All of that being said, and despite the fact that my satellite\u0027s orbit is virtually identical to the requested one... I can\u0027t get a green checkmark on the \u0022Reach the designated orbit around the Mun with minimal deviation\u0022 contract requirement. Is this a bug or am I doing something completely wrong??

Looking at the orbital parameters, it is a retrograde orbit, because it says the inclination is 157\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. If it were a prograde orbit, the inclination would be 23\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 I think. Anything more than 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (a polar orbit) is retrograde, so make sure you are moving clockwise as you look down on the moon, not counterclockwise. If you mouse over your ascending and descending nodes (the an and dn markers), the wrong direction will make it say 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 rather than 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T23:19:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can tell in the map view which way to put the satellite by the movement of the dots on the target orbit.
