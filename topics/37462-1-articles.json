But I\u0027m not clear why. I have several flights now that are listed as \u0022crashed\u0022 or \u0022landed\u0022 (yay me!) and I can\u0027t imagine why I would want these listed in my flight list. Shouldn\u0027t I just end these? What about other test flights? I have a handful of space debris on decaying orbits that I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out why I would want to not End. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr have I missed the point and I\u0027m not far enough along yet. That the only issue with End Flight is when you have multiple flights taking part in some activity that needs to connect in space? If I deploy something with a flight, and I click End Flight, will everything in that deployment disappear? Or just the parts that have touched down?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T02:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEnd Flight causes all of the CURRENT ship to vanish.

I don\u0027t read manuals. or do tutorials especially youtube ones. i quickly found my kerbal drifting further and further from the pod. I decided to launch a rescue mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhile putting it together i noticed the Kerbal was missing. I assumed maybe he got toonfar from the pod and I couldnt teack him. Or maybe captured by Eve as he and the pod were on a hyperbolic trajectory taht crossed Eve. (i didnt understand how these things work or about rails...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etwo missions, a probe and a fast rescue ship failed to find him. I installed Crew Manifest to see if i could figure anything out with that. i figure now that i accidentally did an end flight on him not knowing what it did. I spent a real time WEEK lookimg for him. very frustrating\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T20:48:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo do you go into Tracking Station M and clean up all your old landed flights by hitting Abort? or Fly then End Flight?
