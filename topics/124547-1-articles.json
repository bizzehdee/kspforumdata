SpaceX came in and shook that all up though because they are undercutting the launch market, ULA had to find a way to be viable and that was with Vulcan, and unfortunately around the same time Russia started their thing with Ukraine causing the politics to shift and the engine ban. ULA can still make a Delta IV, they just dont want to because unless someone is buying a DIV:H the other launch masses are much more economically covered by other rockets namely Atlas V, and Falcon 9. so they have a rocket that was competing against another of their rockets but was priced a whole lot more. Also both DIV and AV are old enough that they really should have had a Mid-life evolution (like Ariane 5 [ going from Ariane 5 to 5 ECA]) but that has not happened and with the ban on RD180\u0027s for govt launches (note the ban does not stop them from buying more for commercial launches) they cant really compete for the government contracts because Falcon 9 is SO much cheaper (current issues not taken into account).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think maybe a Delta H2 O2 Core that is Atlas core diameter, but Delta core length, (with SLS Dark Knight SRB derived SRB or Space Shuttle SRB derived SRB as boosters) using a reduced thrust RS-68 would be a good idea. But it probably would be difficult to make modular, so perhaps that\u0027s why that route was not taken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point of speculation: Perhaps the ICPS (which has about 10T more propellant then Centaur), coupled with another set of SRBs (for a total of 8 SRBs) could prevent the need for the development of ACES. It would also give the stage the benefit of greater use, and more mass production.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T11:05:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fredinno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fredinno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe license to RD-180s for use on Atlas expires in 2022.
