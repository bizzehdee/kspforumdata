Landed safely in some low hills. Jeb steps out to do an EVA. Apparently his foot slipped on the ladder and he rolled down the hill to his doom. He didn\u0026#39;t even roll that far. Maybe 50 feet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was so disappointed to have Jeb die in such a pedestrian fashion I didn\u0026#39;t even think about reverting.
