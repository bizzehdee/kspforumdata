Living in Michigan, most spiders I find are harmless- almost cute, once you suppress the primal disgusted fascination and adoration for the things. Of course, the Brown Recluse is also known to inhabit Michigan. I have read up on this guy, as well as other common types here, and I can\u0027t figure out what this guy is. It\u0027s been in the window sill above my bed since June. I didn\u0027t bother her, she didn\u0027t bother me. She has white, orb-like egg sacks that are about a centimeter in diameter, suspended in her web. The web itself isn\u0027t neat like a garden variety spider would spin- instead it\u0027s almost like a cobweb that\u0027s still occupied. She is dark brown, and her exoskeleton has a bit of a sheen to it. Her markings are kind of a khaki color. She is currently angled away, and being in a basement bedroom I can\u0027t reach a better angle to view her. As such, I can tell that she has multiple thin bands of the same color on her legs, so thin as to be hardly noticeable. Along the bulbous end segment (forgot what that\u0027s called) she has what looks like triangles, tip pointed towards her head, connected by thinner bridging rectangles. The triangles start large right up near the mid section, where the violin would be if she were a recluse- if it\u0027s there she\u0027s too angled to tell- and they get progressively smaller as you get closer to her far rear. I count about four triangles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would include the pick but it\u0027s on my phone- so there\u0027s no link to provide. Any suggestions going off what I could see would be appreciated- it\u0027s gotten bigger since summer, and there are 3 of those web sack things in her web. Please answer soon- I want to go to bed, not be kept up all night imagining something crawling on my back. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T05:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can upload the picture to tinypic or another image hosting site and then post it here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T05:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would trap it and toss it outside but Michigan is probably too cold for that at this time of year...
