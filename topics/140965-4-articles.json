It assumes that complex systems originate only from systems of comparable or higher functional complexity; therefore, life started from very simple systems, and complexity increased gradually through evolution. Life did not start from nucleic acids because nucleotides were not available in sufficient quantities as resources. The simplest hereditary system requires autocatalysis which is functionally linked with local environment. According to the \u0022coenzyme world\u0022 scenario, life started from non-polymeric coenzyme-like molecules (CLMs) that performed hereditary functions before the emergence of nucleic acids. These molecules multiplied via autocatalysis and modified (i.e., encoded) the properties of their local environment. Dependency on the local environment later promoted the cooperation between multiple autocatalytic systems, which in turn increased the functional complexity and evolutionary potential. Polymerization of CLMs and development of template-based synthesis is a possible evolutionary path towards the emergence of nucleic acids. Genome complexity increased slowly during the evolution of life, which is consistent with the principle of gradualism. Backward projection of this rate indicates that life started long before the formation of Earth, and the transition from coenzyme world to RNA world happened on another planet over 10 billion years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;font-size:medium;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;font-size:medium;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-05T00:17:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2016 12:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Aethon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T19:35:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can convince yourself of anything you like, so people beleive god put life on earth, some people believe the bear in Ursa brought life to Earth.

Recent advances in exoplanet studies provide strong constraints on all astrophysical terms in the Drake equation. Using these and modifying the form and intent of the Drake equation, we set a firm lower bound on the probability that one or more technological species have evolved anywhere and at any time in the history of the observable Universe. We find that as long as the probability that a habitable zone planet develops a technological species is larger than \u223C10\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csup style=\u0022color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:15.95px;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u221224\u003C/sup\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:11px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:15.95px;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;\u0022\u003E, humanity is not the only time technological intelligence has evolved.

Assuming our galaxy started forning about 2 to3 billion years after the universe formed, and our earths material is about 6 billion years from the time it was scattered into the void that formed our star. So from that 13.7 billion we subtract 9 leaving 4. That assumes there star formation at the center of the galaxy and spread succesively out with at least 1 generation of star formation. Since our region is depopulated of stars it was probably on of the last to go through blue then 2nd gwneration star formation. Therefore a maximum likeli hood estimate of the time to density appropriate form formation of elements in sufficient quantities to create life is about 8 billions years post big-band in areas ofvthe galaxy with our star density.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The false dichotomy. You assume that if life formed somewhere in the galaxy that it could commute anywhere else in the galaxy within a few billion years. That is mythology. Life can arise all over the galaxy and may never reach earth because. 1. The unlikeli hood that life will leave its bioneogenesis planet. 2. because of the gravity well within the star 3. Because of the temperatures and pressures required to get\u00A0life off a planet and into deep\u00A0space at velocities sufficient to reach a destination before cosmic radiation essential scrambles it to nonsense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. I have never said life does not exist elsewhere in\u00A0the galaxy, i presented a range were many lifes could exist, but\u00A0i also have\u00A0open the possibility\u00A0there is only one, or rather more likely that Earth is one of the older biospheres. If Earth is one of the older non-sterile biospheres then it makes no sense about seeding it from elsewhere.

What I said, based upon the observed, is that life could be rare enough that communication of life information such as intelligence or living material may occur at minute distaces on the galactic scale, with few\u00A0exceptions\u00A0few and far between. So that even if you are correct is some infrequent instances, it\u00A0does not mean you are correct in most or all instances.
