Unfortunately, if this is the case, it is not possible. KSP does not allow for part \u0022trees.\u0022 In other words, it will only attach one part to another part with out attaching to other two to the same part. The one exception to this rule is strut connectors. You can strut the two that don\u0027t attach to the part you want them to attach to. I know it is unrealistic and a pain in the butt some times, but that is just how the game is programed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"abihoooo","CreatedById":57415,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T05:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/wyexun4ky2rmjq7/Ion-Powered%20Space%20Probe%20Extreme.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is my fix for your craft.
