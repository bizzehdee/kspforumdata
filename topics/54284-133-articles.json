I use EPL extensively and in 1.0.2 everything worked fine with that container out in space. But in 1.0.5 (plus updated mods) I can\u0026#39;t build that container in space any longer since it requires the resource \u0022EVA Propellant\u0022 (listed in the build UI of the dock as needing 10, having 0). I have no way of producing that up there (at least that I know of, and Monopropellant will not do the trick it seems). I also tried to remove the EVA-tank and add it again but to no avail.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI CAN, however, build and \u0022launch\u0022 that container on Kerbin, but it would be madness to fly it to Gilly just for a bit of EVA Propellant :-)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan somebody confirm this?

I didn\u0026#39;t actually encounter the problem of EVA Propellant myself, but at one stage this weekend, I was considering putting an EVA tank into a container and realized it would not work for exactly the reason you have trouble: there\u0026#39;s no way to make EVA Propellant.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, actually, there is :) (just not in EL yet).

This causes the subsequent problems of the progress bar being extended out to the left and the progress percentage becomes NaN (and ETA 0s) (I think I got all that right, I wasn\u0026#39;t paying [i]that[/i] much attention). Fortunately, the build of the container and tank progresses properly and completes, providing a box with a full tank. This is caused by EVA Propellant having a density of 0. I will see if I can come up with a nice solution to the density (probably add a density override (that works only for resources with 0 density) in the recipe).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[COLOR=\u0022silver\u0022][SIZE=1]- - - Updated - - -[/SIZE][/COLOR]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHmm, this appears to be a slightly hairier problem than I thought, mostly due to some implementation details in the recipe system.
