I have it so w,a,s,d,q,e and throttle are all bound to their respective axis/ throttle, but they only function if the throttle or joystick is in the \u0022all out\u0022 position, so no fine tuning. I was wondering how I could get that fine tune by making the controls sensitive to the little movements of the joystick. Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I used the Axis settings in KSP, but I\u0027m still not getting incremental control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution: I just assigned the axis bindings in-game with no 3rd party software.
