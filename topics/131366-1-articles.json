There are piston \u00A0driven propeller craft today, but they are \u00A0dwarfed by the number of jet turbine driven aircraft, weather turbojet, turboprop, \u00A0or ducted fan models.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you are really feeling the need to have a reason to use a piston engine turning afree \u0022unlocking\u0022 jets, \u00A0then just reducing the thrust of the jets would work, but it wouldn\u0027t be satisfactory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo instead of making nuclear rocket engines weaker, give them downsides that make them NOT the only solution to every problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real life, craft with this type of engine would have a \u0022shadow sheild\u0022 to protect he crew from radiation, as it would be too heavy to sheild the entire\u00A0craft. Trying to simulate complex radiation emissions and shielding is obviously beyond themail scope of the game, \u00A0and it doesn\u0027t \u00A0address existing space radiation or shielding for long term deep space missions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe a useful compromise would be to incorporate \u00A0a heat shield like solution. Treat \u00A0radiation like reentry heating to a degree, and require that the ships be built in a way that the non hardened \u00A0portions of the ship lay in the \u0022shadow\u0022 of your radiation sheild. Parts or kerbals extending beyond this shadow during engine ignition would suffer heat damage and go poof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would need a simple way to show this during ship design, maybe something as simple as a shadow map style overlay view or a stage recovery \u00A0style colored overlay.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in summary, \u00A0by fudging radioactive \u00A0emissions of the engine as a balance against their superior thrust and isp would allow more interesting design decisions, not less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example: if the engine blows up the launch pad you still need chemical rockets for a 1st stage booster. Maybe a special atomic rocket launchpad could be an end game goal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are going to make an atomic rocket tug, you\u0027d have to make sure the cargo won\u0027t be damaged, and more to the point you \u00A0may need chemical rockers for maneuvering close to a space station or any other craft when rendezvous and docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinall like a heat shield, \u00A0it adds extra weight, so the better protected your craft, the heavier it\u0027s dry weight, so even if the LV-N had better thrust and better is than any chemical rocket, you wouldn\u0027t use it all the time because it may just make more sense to build a simpler and lighter craft \u00A0than deal with the reaction control needs of a larger heavier craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Right now for my personal use I un-nerfed \u00A0the lv-n\u00A0because it\u0027s a single player game and I can do what I want. However I\u0027d rather see an official fix that keeps their real life awseoeness without making them a boring cure all to every problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armisael","CreatedById":152425,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T18:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth approaches are\u00A0inventing nonsense that doesn\u0027t really apply to the engine - real NTRs have their shielding inside the engine already.
