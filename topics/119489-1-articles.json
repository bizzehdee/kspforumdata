But what happens when you destabilize a field and no EM leaks out, this seems to defy physics. What these authors are offering is a way around the problem, that if the charges enter a toroidal pattern the lost EM is fed back into the system conserving the energy. Anyway read it yourself and see if you can come up with a clearer understanding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/anu-ntl082615.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/anu-ntl082615.php\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe potential here is to have less loss in things like display devices, or say transmission in fiber optic cables, or all sorts of other devices. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey claim that it also gives the possibility of creating tiny x-ray lasers, this might someday be useful in the treatment of cancer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T16:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid that all I\u0027m getting out of this is that it\u0027s a horribly written press release.
