Your SRB first stage is welded onto that decoupler on the bottom of the main stack? thats neat...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cant tell what all the engines are, there are a few odd choices however and Im not sure you can easily orbit that. As soon as your SRBs go you are on what? a skipper? with 0.87 atmo TWR its really gonna struggle, even given that you\u0027ll be up around 10km. Then it looks like a poodle above that, which is a good munar transfer engine, and produces much more dV than in the atmospheric screenshot, but due to the low dV of the rocket at this point you will end up circularising on it, which wont go well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe top stage with the radials is probably thrusty enough for your mun launch, though those have heinous efficiency they would work well to assist your weaker launch stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt probably all adds up for a mun landing on paper if you hop between vac and atmospheric dV display, but you dont have thrust in the right places and im not confident this will orbit kerbin. That skipper or whatever it is under the bottom decoupler is definately gonna need a friend at anyrate, and you will need more dV if you plan to have the \u0027guessing poodle\u0027 as a transfer and not have to double as circulariser(it really wont do that well, its gonna suck).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome tweaks I would make off the top of my head. Halve the fuel on the poodle or whatever that third stage is, give what you removed to the skipper. give the skipper four of those radial buggers, you want at least 1.0 sea level TWR to have any hope of making the climb from where the SRBs deposit you. Ideally it needs another stage, that poodle is awful in any kind of atmosphere. In a perfect world you shorten the skipper stages fuel very slightly, call it the topstage and stick a mainail below with gas for days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander is quite top-heavy looking, but you dont appear to have radial decouplers yet. Its tricky to lift 4 guys out in a hitchhiker like that, you are on a narrow base. You can fake radial attachments by using the little girders, but since you probably dont have fuel lines you then move all the gas to the radials, engines under them and put the legs out there too for more stable landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: just went away and had a fiddle in the VAB, using what I read to be your tech. I cant come up with a solution to be honest, not without busting weight caps. You capped at 140? More boosters pushes really hard off the pad but doesnt help you massively longrun since they get pretty bad pretty quick as you climb.

Don\u0027t try to do everything all at once. If you try to use the same craft to rendezvous with multiple targets in low Kerbin orbit, then transfer to the Mun, then rendezvours with multiple targets in munar orbit, then land on the Mun, then take off again, then transfer to Kerbin and land... that won\u0027t work in any efficient manner. Rather, build a craft that collects all your stranded Kerbals, and then design a different craft that lands on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo improve your current design to that end:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use a mk1 pod instead of a mk1 inline cockpit. You can still attach all your parachutes, and even add anoter chute instead of nosecone. The rocket will be pointier and smaller, and the radial parachutes will be better protected from reentry heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Speaking of reentry heat, you do have a heatshield below the Hitchhiker, right...? Just asking because I know you can mount the decoupler so that it is invisible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Since you\u0027re not landing on the Mun, get rid of the thumpers, the landing legs, and any science gear you might have brought. Also get rid of the fuel tank between the Hitchhiker and the adapter. Losing all that weight will greatly improve the performance of your other stages too, without you having to do anything about them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, your screenshot confuses me. If I read that right, you have a Poodle stage with an X32 tank giving you only 629 m/s worth of dV? That makes no sense. It should be three times that much or more. The Poodle is the most efficient chemical engine in the game, and the payload above it isn\u0027t large enough to dominate the x32 tank to that extent. So either something is screwy with the way you built, or with your staging order (though it looks fine from here), or with the way that KER calculates your dV. For example, if you built at least partially bottom-up, that may result in KER not understanding the craft structure correctly. Always try to build top-down, meaning: never put extra propulsive stages above your root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: your rocket should have way more dV than it shows, but you still shouldn\u0027t try to do four rescues and a Mun landing and return in the same flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T08:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E10km is only .1763 sea level pressure, so very nearly vacuum thrust already. 636 out of 650 kN.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T08:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESoo I didn\u0027t feel much like describing everything seperately so instead I whipped up something in the VAB quickly which is almost the same, costs 2000 funds more, wheigs a little less and has the same exact amount of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, that trick for geting radial decoupling weas new to me as well and at ~1000h ingame time there aren\u0027t many things I haven\u0027t seen so thanks for that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just played around, minmaxing the stages a little. You see, on the first two or three stages the additional couple hundred kg from the cockpit won\u0027t make a huge difference, however, on the final stage it\u0027s really well worth using the lander can, since that has a lower mass and it will actually be carried the entire way. Basically make you stinginess with added weight directly proportinall to how long you will be carrying that stage with you, the further the stingier. Also I made the lander design two stage which has two main advantages, more dV due to dropping unnecessary weight and more stability because the center of mass is lower down and you have a wider base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the rocket is mainly unchanged apart from the fact that I use two skipper engines instead of just one as that allows you to carry quite a bit more fuel to orbit at little additional cost. I also slightly increased the length of the first liquid fueled stage since otherwise you would be wasting precious lifting capacity. One thing I did, then reverted because I don\u0027t know what you have unlocked was stick some winglets (preferrably with control) at the base of the first LFO stage, this will give you control early on, since the SRB\u0027s are ungimballed and the radial lander design shifts the CoL far forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from the screenshots, this setup will give you around 4000m/s of dV once in orbit, which should be way more than you need for going to and from the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the craft file in case you wish to muck around with my design/take a closer look.

Assuming you have the tech I think the best way to do things would be to stick a small, automated lander on the top to recover the single kerbal from the surface, then land only that. Also go to the mun first for two reasons, if you postpone the landing that means you are essentially lugging a whole load of dead weight around the whole time. Also, you will not get stranded in munar orbit since you will be taking all the fuel you wanted for the kerbin rendevousz. Then, if you start running low in munar orbit already you can go straight back to kerbin and not have to worry so much about leaving people stuck in orbit around another body, requiring a seperate (and expensive) rescue missin. Remember you can very carefully aerobrake yourself back into a circular orbit without spending another ~850m/s to slow down. Just aim for around 30km (at least that worked well in .90) although to be more precise I reccomend getting the Trajectories Mod or whatever it\u0027s called now which will display your orbit after aerobraking.
