Very broadly speaking, if we limit it to games, you are looking at one of the following categories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Algorithm improvements. Sometimes you can just rearrange how operations are performed and make the code faster. This can be literally reducing number of instructions that have to be executed, reduce time lost to memory latency, or reduce time interacting with OS or hardware. Usually, you don\u0027t see big wins in something like this after the game is released, but every once in a while there\u0027s a stupid mistake that somebody missed that makes a huge difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Threading optimizations. Sort of related to the above, but when you are working with multiple threads running in parallel, you are sometimes losing time on threads having to wait for each other. So by simply rearranging when operations are performed you can sometimes get huge performance wins. Again, usually, you get that out of the way before the game is released, but sometimes, improvements like that can come in after release. A particular case is if the code was originally optimized for a very specific core count (*cough*consoles*cough*) but later, re-optimized to cover broader range of possible CPUs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Removing unnecessary code. Things like writing logs can really slow performance down, and sometimes that\u0027s accidentally left in the final game. Finding and removing that stuff helps and it\u0027s more common than you\u0027d think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Engine/Library/Driver improvements. Especially if you\u0027re using 3rd party engine like Unreal or Unity, just because you\u0027re done working on the game, doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re done improving the engine. Sometimes, it makes sense to switch to a new version of an engine, and sometimes, it runs a lot better. (Also, sometimes worse, but that\u0027s what you get with relying on 3rd party software sometimes.) Likewise, an update to something like a graphics drivers might fix something your game has been relying on, in which case, it\u0027s a welcome surprise of better performance. It\u0027s rare, but it happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Hardware improvements. Just because your hardware didn\u0027t change, doesn\u0027t mean the code wasn\u0027t updated to make better use of hardware improvements you already have. This could be done with an explicit change to the game code or be picked up as part of the engine or library updates as in the previous section. In either case, you end up with your hardware better utilized giving you better performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Code optimization. If computer executed the code the way it\u0027s written by programmer, things would run at least ten times slower than they do. With a modern compiler, code is first converted into some sort of internal representation, with compiler removing anything that\u0027s found to be unnecessary and simplifying some loops and function calls. Then the representation is converted into machine code for particular target architecture, and compiler removes redundancies, shifts things around to make better use of registers, and may even rearrange order of instructions to make them fit better into the pipeline. When CPU executes instructions it will also convert them into micro-code and potentially re-arrange them to improve execution. Now, the programmers have very little control over any of that if any. But updates to compiler and associated libraries can result in better code produced by simple recompiling the project. Likewise, the way your CPU converts instructions into microcode is subject to firmware updates. Some of the optimizations also have to be enabled, and again, you\u0027d be surprised how often games ship with some of the code unoptimized. Obviously, if it was a global disable, somebody would notice, but a few unoptimized functions in a core loop can really slow the game down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are tools that let you examine what\u0027s going on with the code. We can look at time spent on specific function calls, how busy individual cores on the CPU are, when various calls to OS and hardware are made, how much time has been spent waiting for other resources, and so on. But it\u0027s still a lot all at once, so learning how to improve your own code and how to look for problems in code handled by someone else is a huge part of being a games programmer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-25T12:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224046860\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221635147358\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, man, layers upon layers.

(within a certain limit of course)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, a little. The actual semiconductor physics of it is complex - I\u0027ve spent a year on a condensed matter track before switching to particle theory, and most of it is still bizarre to me, but in terms of practical consequence, what you have control over is clock frequency, voltage, and temperature of the die. The thing you actually care about with performance is the clock frequency. The number of instructions performed by CPU, outside any time wasted waiting on memory or whatever, is a multiple of CPU clock frequency. (You can also overclock memory and GPU also with their own limitations and caveats.) The problem is that there is a limit to how fast transistor states can switch, so if you get the clock speed too high, you end up with errors. You can compensate for that by increasing the voltage applied - kind of equivalent of throwing switches harder to get them to move faster to a new position, but there\u0027s a limit to that before you risk physical damage to the circuits. (Again, not unlike physical switches.) Finally, cooling the die helps to reduce thermal bounce, which both allows you to go a bit higher on the voltage and helps given voltage settle the transistors faster. So if you can cool the die more, you technically can get away with even higher clock speeds, which is why you see all the records set with liquid nitrogen setups. That really only helps you to squeeze the last drops of performance, though, so just a good cooling setup is adequate for most uses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut where it comes back to power consumption is that both increasing the voltage and increasing the clock speed increase the amount of power consumed by the chip. And 100% of power consumed becomes heat, so even if you aren\u0027t trying to drop the temperature down, overclocking usually requires a good heat management setup just to prevent overheating. And laptops are disadvantaged on both of these. You have limited amount of energy available to power the CPU - certainly on batteries, but even when plugged into a wall, that portable power supply can only do so much, and you are limited on the thermals as well. Laptop just doesn\u0027t have room to fit a good cooling setup. Because of that, the laptop CPUs are usually designed to be more power efficient and less performant, but they do usually come with multiple power modes. You need very little CPU power to browse the internet, and being able to throttle down is important to conserving battery power. What usually happens is that the clock speeds will go down, voltage might adjust down as well, and some cores might become disabled to make the batteries last as long as possible, and only kicking into high gear when you\u0027re playing a game or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven with a laptop, the manufacturers will usually stay on the safe side of keeping the thing reliable, so you can usually squeeze a bit more performance out of the system, especially, if you\u0027re plugged into the wall. Whether it\u0027s easy to configure will depend on the motherboard and CPU used. I have been able to overclock some laptops a little bit to make the games run better, but there is really not a lot of room to work with usually before you start running into heat throttling. That is, CPU detecting that it\u0027s overheating and starting to drop the clock speeds. (If it continues, it may shut down entirely.) So if you want to tinker with performance, you really ought to be doing that on a custom-built desktop actually designed to take the punishment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-26T11:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

PC) are available, so the problem has moved elsewhere except for the GPU.\u00A0 And I wouldn\u0027t call it so much a \u0022covid shortage\u0022, but a \u0022lean manufacturing\u0022 dogma and \u0022cut out any robustness in the supply chain in the name of cost-cutting\u0022 shortage.\u00A0 Covid just lit the match to a disaster waiting to happen.\u00A0 But most of the PC parts are available again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as far as I can tell, you might as well claim the reason you can\u0027t get a RTX 30xx board is more a lack of surplus.\u00A0 AMD sells the 5600G for $250 (for a chip with everything working, i.e. the 5800G expect to pay $350) and it uses up 180 mm**2 per chip on each wafer.\u00A0 Unfortunately, it doesn\u0027t look like AMD will even try to supply the 6600[XT] at list price ($330/$380), which uses 237mm**2 of the same class of wafer (TSMC 7nm, although one is \u00227N\u0022 and one is \u0022Finfet\u0022).\u00A0 Presumably they mostly use the same machines) and the GPU requires 8GB of extra-expensive GDDR6 ram, an entire circuit board, and cooling system.\u00A0 You can see why such a chip would be one of their less profitable lines and last in line\u00A0 for production.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNvidia is a bit more curious.\u00A0 The 30xx line is made by Samsung at its bleeding edge line, so perhaps has a shortage (it also uses massive chips considering the tiny transistors, a 3060 uses 200mm**2, 3080 and up use 625 mm**2, and everything else (including scavenged 3060s) use 400mm**2.\u00A0 On the other hand, the 16xx line uses 284mm**2 of TSMC\u0027s older 12nm line, but perhaps a spat between TSMC (and other companies needed 12nm for their bread and butter) prevents them from shipping these.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to remember is that while nvidia may have started as a graphics company, they moved on to become a HPC (high performance computing, i.e. supercomputer) company.\u00A0 And now they are even more an AI (machine learning) company as well.\u00A0 They have (well had at one point, perhaps Intel is recovering) a higher market cap than Intel, and you don\u0027t get there by making boards used in a small percentage of Intel\u0027s machines (Intel itself makes its profit on servers, laptops, and desktops.\u00A0 In that order).\u00A0 AMD might have been a graphics company during the dark days of phenom and bulldozer, but is trying to position itself as a server company (those ryzens make great ads and test vehicles for EPYC processors).\u00A0 GPUs are an afterthought, although I\u0027d assume they want to compete with nvidia in the datacenter in AI (presumably the reason they bought Xilinx).\u00A0 GPUs just aren\u0027t a priority, and they use a ton of somewhat constrained silicon that could be used more profitably and strategically elsewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other issue is that as long as you can mine etherium economically at these prices, expect the miners to drive the price up to this point simply by competing with one another.\u00A0 Perhaps AMD is already making \u0022enough\u0022 6600XTs, and the miners are all driving up the price.\u00A0 Supposedly etherium was supposed to go from \u0022proof of work\u0022 (spend as much GPU power as possible) to \u0022proof of stake\u0022 (own enough etherium as possible) which would kill the miner\u0027s chance to mine the most profitable GPU-based cryptocoin, but that appears to be more or less indefinitely postponed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-28T09:13:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

transportation, but the die shortage. There are only so many factories in the world capable of processing silicone wafers into chips of various quality. The process is energy, resource, labor, and equipment intensive. That means that coming up short on even one of these can cause problems. COVID has acted as a catalyst for a perfect storm of shortages across the sector, and now the demand has backed up. The problem is that absolutely everyone with need for a high end chip is competing over the same manufacturing capacity. PC and console components (RAM, CPU, GPU, SSDs...), cell phones, car computers, components for servers, routers, and gateways, and a bunch of other tech you might not even think of in day-to-day. Some of the lower end stuff can be shifted to older processes, but a lot of it can\u0027t simply because it was designed with more modern components in mind. The recent releases of new generations of consoles, GPUs, and CPUs kind of matched up to bring the problem to the attention of the consumer, but just because demand for these died down a bit and supply had a chance to catch up a little, doesn\u0027t mean the problem went away. On the contrary, we are expecting the situation with some of the existing manufacturing to get worse, as some areas are now also impacted by draught, labor shortages, and potentially makes it difficult to replace some of the equipment used on production lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are new facilities being built, and supply will eventually catch up.
