My question is is there a way to go to and return from Eve in career mode with no mods and still make a profit from the mission rewards? It seems all your craft need to be massive when returning, let alone how big they must be at KSP launch. Is the only way to do this efficiently by putting the craft into ksp orbit first and then launch another rocket that sends a booster section to the Eve landing craft to get it to Eve and back? Any thoughts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother unrelated question I have: how viable is it to pick up dropped stages? if you drop a stage before your going to fast to destroy the parachutes, wont the stage stop playing along with physics after your 3 some kilometers away from it? I think I remember one instance where I launched a rocket and dropped a stage while below 2k altitude w/parachutes and was able to recover the debris later, but I remember other instances where I did the same thing but higher up (parachutes did not get destroyed) and I was unable to find the debris of the stage later..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T08:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was an lander who was pretty small, as in 1\u002B6 areospike stages and an small upper stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are so deep into career you should have an mining operation and a fuel depot (large core stage with probe and docking ports) in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will also need to refuel it in Eve orbit or use an tug to take it to Eve, and an ship to return kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 1.0x the cutoff distance in atmosphere is 22 km making recovery more practical.
