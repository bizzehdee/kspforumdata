Just keep it selected through all rotate and offset switches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2, make the re-root tool require just one click of a valid part anywhere. Or make it a hotkey thing like SelectRoot did. Why do I have to click one part that\u0027s connected to the root I want and then click the part I actually want as root? It\u0027s long winded and confusing the first few times before you get used to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3, allow tweakables to be accessed in offset and rotate mode. It\u0027d be perfect - say when I\u0027m making a shuttle engine block or putting landing gear on something and checking it while it\u0027s raised and lowered or balancing tanks around a point with various amounts of fuel in. At the moment, it\u0027s a dance between offset, rotate and place modes with a click-fest on the same part each time I switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose aside, I do love the extended functionality of the editors beta has brought. It makes building planes much easier for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
