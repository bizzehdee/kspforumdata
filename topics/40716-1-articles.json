I was sending a rover to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and came out of warp about 1 minute or so prior to my braking burn and discovered after I hit F5 to Quicksave (or actually fn-F5 on my Mac) that none of my keyboard commands are working - no attitude controls, no engine thrust controls, nothing. My system keyboard itself is fine - the caps lock key button lights up normally, screen brightness and sound volume keys work, and all my other apps are fine. I quit the game and haven\u0027t restarted yet. I wanted to post this and see if what happened to me is some kind of feature that I didn\u0027t know about or if my game glitched somehow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDITED TO ADD: Answered now, see below.

That was it. Turns out neither the booster nor the rover/lander I threw together had a battery. And while there were ample solar cells, I was on a trajectory directly away from the sun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E When I told my teenage daughter about my mistake (she\u0027s watched me play a bit before) she responded appropriately: \u0022Rookie mistake, Dad. Rookie mistake.\u0022 LOL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus endeth the Lunokkerbal-2 mission: a dead rover/lander and upper stage, looping endlessly around the Kerbin/M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn system in a highly elliptical orbit. Lunokkerbal-3 was amply provisioned with both batteries AND solar cells (including an articulated array on the upper stage) to prevent this kind of rookie mistake in the future. Unfortunately, I missed my optimal launch window and tried to brute force it. I ended up depleting my upper stage before my periapsis lowering burn near the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and had to use my lander\u0027s smaller engines to try to kill too much horizontal velocity. I might have made it except I came down in rough terrain and ran out of altitude. Oops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut try try again is our motto and Lunonkkerbal-4 landed successfully after riding a substantially larger upper stage all the way to a stable M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit! Of course, in true Kerbal fashion, I killed my horizontal velocity at much higher altitude than planned; my lander stage depleted its tanks at about 30 or 40 meters above the surface. My landed survived the low-g drop to the surface, and staging resulted in a less-than-optimal separation event; it sort of just rolled off the rover and fell over, like the shell of a molting insect. But it\u0027s down.
