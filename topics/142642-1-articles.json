If so, am I even allowed to use it? I wish to use it for the purposes of modding, specifically for creating my own launch site for the kerbal konstructs mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T01:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would guess that this does belong to Squad (would be surprised if it didn\u0027t).
