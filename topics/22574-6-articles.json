I got a taste of the demo for about 5 minute, and knew I had to buy the game. It\u0027s logged more hours in Steam than FTL and Fallout New Vegas, combined. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was a total rocket fanatic as a kid, and loved building Estes rockets and playing with mounting D-engines on Knex-framed cars, and KSP has brought all of that early fascination and awe, not to mention delicious geeking out on space flight, right back into my life. Love the game, been reading forum articles since day one and dig the community, too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently completed a grueling recreation of the Saturn V, with a Mech-Jeb-for-VAB-stats-only rule in place, and the only other mods B9 and Lazor docking. Matched the stage numbers, engine count, and lem extraction to a T, and only lost 3 Kerbals in testing when the escape trunk malfunctioned. Holy moly- going from gluing the Estes Saturn V together in 7th grade, to meticulously adjusting weight and geometry to struggle against the odds of putting a 3 man crew into Lunar Orbit, that\u0027s a real thrill. I took some awesome screen shots, and since .20 wiped my mod and save files, I\u0027m interested in starting another personal challenge- take advantage of the new one-man lander can, and try a permadeth, mod-free, stage for stage, engine for engine recreation of the failed Soviet N-1 rocket and LK lander. Wish me luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T22:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMade a post introducing my self earlier but thought I\u0027d comment here as well. I just joined the forum yesterday, but have been playing KSP since about the end of March. Apparently I downloaded the .16 demo some time ago (July 2011 apparently) though I didn\u0027t play it much until I downloaded the .18 demo towards the end of March this year. Then I bought the game on my birthday in April. Needless to say I\u0027m hooked. If I can\u0027t go to space my self this is the next best thing lol. Would be awesome if the game was compatible with oculus rift, or even with the anaglyph glasses it\u0027d be kinda cool. Anyway I look forward to all the new things to come in the future as well as maybe helping people newer to the game than my self.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T17:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats on the landing in just 3 days.
