So, to fix that, I\u0027ve create a mod that will allow you to sort your crew roster by various stats, including:\n\n- name\n- class\n- level\n- gender\n- total number of flights\n\nand any combination of the above! It adds a collapsible row of buttons above every roster currently in the game and lets you configure how you want to sort your Kerbals based on the order you push the buttons. So, for example, you could sort first by name (ascending), then by level (descending), then by profession. Ideally you should be able to sort from the editors or the launch panels, as well. It\u0027s very intuitive, don\u0027t worry.\n\n**Download** the mod from [GitHub](https://github.com/JonDahm/KerbalSorter/releases/latest)\n\nSee the **source code** on [Github](https://github.com/JonDahm/KerbalSorter), too!\n\nI want to give a shout out to OakTree42 for his work on an Astronaut Complex Overhaul mod, without which I may never have figured out how to change anything in the Astronaut Complex!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Slightly out-dated.\n\u003E \n\u003E [![NCg5CMI.png](http://i.imgur.com/NCg5CMI.png)](http://imgur.com/NCg5CMI)http://imgur.com/0kKbXJ0\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E v0.4 Beta\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Added tab-switch handling to Astronaut Complex.\n\u003E - Added tool-tips to every button.\n\u003E - Added SortBar to Applicants panel, with compatibility for OakTree42\u0027s KSI-Hiring mod.\n\u003E - Added sorting by number of flights to all lists except the list of applicants.\n\u003E - Added detection for Clear and Reset buttons in Editors and Launch Windows.\n\u003E - Added detection for loading vessels in Editors.\n\u003E - Added detection for selecting vessels in Launch Windows.\n\u003E - Added fly-in animation to the Editor SortBar.\n\u003E - Lists now revert to default orderings when no sorting is applied.\n\u003E - Fixed bug where SortBars in Editors and Launch Windows would stay visible when jumping to Astronaut Complex.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E v0.3 Beta -- First release\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Copyright \u00A9 2015, Jon Dahm\n\u003E \n\u003E All rights reserved.\n\u003E \n\u003E Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n\u003E \n\u003E modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n\u003E \n\u003E  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n\u003E \n\u003E  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n\u003E \n\u003E  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Neither the name of KerbalSorter nor the names of its\n\u003E \n\u003E  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n\u003E \n\u003E  this software without specific prior written permission.\n\u003E \n\u003E THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \u0022AS IS\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n\u003E \n\u003E IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\n\u003E \n\u003E DISCLAIMED.

I\u0027ve also found a way to detect when kerbals are hired/fired, which means I can keep the list of Available kerbals sorted even through changes. Those will be available in my next release (v0.4), which should also contain changes that keep the lists sorted in the other windows, too.\n\nUnfortunately, I still can\u0027t find a way to detect when kerbals are added to/removed from crew rosters in the Launch Window/Editors.

Additionally, I added a sort bar above the Applicants panel in the Astronaut Complex, which disables itself when OakTree42\u0027s KSI-Hiring mod is installed. I also added tooltips to every button this mod adds! Finally, I have the framework set up for replacing the crew auto-assigned when loading a vessel in the Editors or selecting a vessel in the Launch Windows with crew based on the user\u0027s sorting preference.
