I find it hard to figure out exactly what lights I should put and where I should put them on my craft so that I can see them easily on the dark side of Kerbin. Even with lights from 4 or 5 different mods, the lights never look quite like I want them to. I have no idea how hard this would be. Hopefully it would be very simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankyou very much in advance for anyone considering this!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T16:23:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support this!
