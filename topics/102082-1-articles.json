I find it hard to figure out exactly what lights I should put and where I should put them on my craft so that I can see them easily on the dark side of Kerbin. Even with lights from 4 or 5 different mods, the lights never look quite like I want them to. I have no idea how hard this would be. Hopefully it would be very simple.\n\nThankyou very much in advance for anyone considering this!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T16:23:41Z","Content":"I support this!

Meaning they will not react to a change in light sources. \n\nIf you were to straight up switch the sun-light for \u0022mun-light\u0022, all the shadows would still appear to be under the full light of the sun.\n\n[Source for all this: bac9\u0027s blog post on the creation of the VAB.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/747-The-Making-Of-New-KSC)\n\nSQUAD could allow this, as they have access to all the assets, etc. But, it would be a *major* piece of work, as cool as this feature would be."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T17:02:51Z","Content":"Check out [Dimmable VAB](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84553)"},{"CreatedByName":"nodrog6","CreatedById":93747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T03:52:53Z","Content":"I\u0027ve actually been working on a replacement for Dimmable VAB for a while now.
