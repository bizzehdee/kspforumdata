If it takes off too fast, it is either overpowered or can lift more weight more efficiently. If it barely gets off the launch pad, it is underpowered or too heavy. If it wobbles, it needs stitch bracing. If it wants to spin or fly apart, a problem common with strap on boosters, it needs cross bracing. If strap on boosters move inward when they burn out, they needs diagonal bracing to the center core top and bottom. That will often fix the spin issues. If boosters hit the center core upon staging, they need to be more centrally mounted to the radical decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T12:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFully recommend Kerbal Engineer Redux if you just want the numbers.

These days I\u0027ve been building rockets long enough I generally have a good idea \u002B/- about 10% how much thrust and dV I need for various payloads. I generally enjoy the process of iterative design and testing, so most of the time I\u0027ll throw together my payload and test it on the pad. Then I\u0027ll put together my upper stage and test it with the payload, then the next stage down and so on. Just to make absolutely sure I haven\u0027t messed up staging or not strutually sound, etc. By the time I hit the 1st stage I rarely need to tweak the design more than maybe once or twice at most to get the rocket right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther times if the payloads are more modest the design is complete with no testing, I hit the launch pad and go. 95% of the time the rocket is at least adaquete and maybe only 1 in 5 times is the rocket overkill of that 95%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen money comes along, I do hope that SQUAD adds a feature in the VAB that will tell you a lot of the things that Mechjeb/Engineer do, like dV, TWR, etc. That would likely help me squeeze at least 10-15% better cost efficiency out of my rocket program (I am assuming in career there will be a method to test and/or recover failed launches without financial penalty...if not due to cut down testing, knowing exact dV and TWR, etc ahead of time would probably make my rocket program at least 100-200% more cost efficient taking in to account the occasional botched launches and somewhat lower rocket efficiency (IE overkill built in)).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-05T13:00:00Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2013 01:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by lazarus1024\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T14:59:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also take the partially finished ship, \u0022Launch It\u0022, then while on launch pad switch to orbit view (press M), and then hit the littie \u0022i\u0022 in the corner.
