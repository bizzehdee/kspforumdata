One of the reason I play this game is all the amazing mods released since the begining. But as time goes by, the team continue hiring the best modders. Don\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s a great thing for the game itself but I can\u0027t see the value added. Yes we have 3 or 4 new parts once in a while, a new little functionnality but the whole community lose a great mod pack. NovaSilisko stopped updating the Silisko Industries addon, Romfarer won\u0027t probably update his lazor mod for long and now Bac9 who has released my favourite pack for the moment just got hired which means B9 aerospace won\u0027t probably be updated anymore. Only C7 saw his pack added to the game content. It\u0027s a good thing to improve the team by adding talented devellopers, but I think it should not be by taking away a good modder from the community, when we know that mods are what make a good game really amazing. I don\u0027t mean stop hiring modder, but give them more freedom to have time to, at least, continue updating their mod. People will probably say I\u0027m a bad person because I play my game with mod but, that I should not take the habit to play with content that\u0027ll probably be stopped once, but as I said earlier, mods are what make the difference between good and amazing. It\u0027s not a criticism against the team, I really respect you for your job and everything you\u0027ve done. It\u0027s just a little personnal thought I wanted to share with the community to discuss in a civilized way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T03:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut you\u0027ll see more and better work out of these talented people by paying them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg: C7 aerospace, Nova\u0027s new textures for 0.18\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T04:11:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest worry - and this is from first and second-hand experience, some of it very recent and a very similar situation - is that people tend to stop being passionate about what they\u0027re doing when it\u0027s a job and there\u0027s tight deadlines and business-driven compromises being forced on them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T04:13:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I can only be happy for him, it\u0027s a great honor!
