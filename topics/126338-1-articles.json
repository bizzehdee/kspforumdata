Contextual contracts seems like an improvement overall, but are there some other changes that could be more impactful and meaningful to the game progression, challenge, and fun of career mode? How would you improve it? I\u0026#39;ve read some of you would even overhaul it completely -- what would that look like in your opinion? How about that controversial addition of rep penalties to declining contracts?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere are my suggestions to get the discussion started, but by no means do I want to limit the discussion to just these ideas:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST=1]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Patched conics and maneuver nodes should be available from the start. My reasoning here is that game progression should start easy and gradually increase in difficulty, and KSP has done the opposite here. It\u0026#39;s hard for new players to get to Mun\u0026#39;s SOI and back home because they don\u0026#39;t have the tools to see what will happen to their orbit if they burn in different directions at different places in their orbit. Instead, patched conics and maneuver nodes should only work in the Kerbin system at tracking station tier 1, to simulate weak radar and poor precision. At tier 2, patched conics and maneuver nodes could be available out to Duna and Eve. At tier 3, it would be available everywhere. This still creates a sense of progression but allows new players the tools to get around the local neighborhood.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Contracts that ask for \u0022science data around X\u0022 should be replaced with a contract type that requires you to bring a new science experiment part specific to that contract from Kerbin. The science experiment has a unique identifier (just like how waypoints are generated with a unique ID) so it is the only one that can complete the contract. This is to prevent free funds/science/rep from transmitting yet another temperature reading from Mun for no effort because you already had a satellite there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Reduce the electrical cost of crew reports to 10 units. This eliminates the tedium of making multiple launches in early game to get your \u0022while flying over Kerbin\u0026#39;s shores\u0022, \u0022while flying at high altitude\u0022, \u0022while flying over water\u0022, and \u0022while splashed down on Kerbin\u0022 reports. It\u0026#39;s also perhaps a little unrealistic that I can\u0026#39;t get my \u0022in space high above Mun\u0022 and \u0022in space near Mun\u0022 crew reports in a single flyby during very early game without coming dangerously close to losing battery by having to do a transmit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]AND/OR, maybe crews should just be able to take multiple crew reports at different places without overwriting the previous report. This should be really easy to code, guys!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]EVA science while in orbit above certain biomes is tedious to gather, yet also kind of overpowered with the amount of science points it yields. I\u0026#39;d like to see this limited to \u0022in space near\u0022 and \u0022in high space above\u0022 just like goo/science-jr. etc. A camera or telescope part mounted to the exterior should instead be added and serve to take pictures over biomes for science points. This subtle difference would mean a lot IMO.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]The Mobile Processing Lab should cost money for every point of science you transmit back to Kerbin. It\u0026#39;s too easy to finish the tech tree by time warping ahead while it churns out 1000\u0026#39;s of science points for free. The game would be made more challenging and interesting if there was a tradeoff that forces you to make a strategic decision. Also, having it charge you when you transmit the data back is better than having it cost funds over time so that players don\u0026#39;t get caught off guard by a shrinking balance when they time warp.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]In the tech tree, all fuel tank sizes of a given diameter should be unlocked with the first engine of that diameter. Spamming 8 FL-T100s because that\u0026#39;s all I have unlocked and hitting the tier 1 VAB part limit as a result is not really an interesting design challenge, but rather more of an unrealistic and frustrating experience IMHO.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]The tech tree may have improved a little this round, but it still needs more work. For example, on the first Aviation node, you get a whole lot of parts that can technically allow you to build a plane all in one shot. Almost perfect, Squad! But... the Mk1 Cockpit is a part that is incompatible with the small circular intake, so when you first unlock this node, you either have to make your plane with a Mk1 Command Pod instead (which looks stupid), or you have to have more advanced design skills to mount two Juno engines and their associated circular intakes either under wing or along the fuselage, which is something new players are going to have trouble achieving (I got it to work but I have a lot of experience with planes). And why are there 0.625m parts this early in the tech tree when everything else is 1.25m? I think the tech progression needs to be rethought here -- this node is not making a lot of sense. The Juno might make more sense being introduced further down the tree when you have unmanned probes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Here\u0026#39;s another example: The Heavy Rocketry node contains 2.5m engines, but no fuel tanks for it. Those fuel tanks are located in the Fuel Systems node. There is no actual choice now -- you have to unlock both nodes or you have a useless setup, or at least a very stupid-looking rocket when you attach your Skipper to a 1.25m FL-T400 tank. The tech tree should be about choice and be grouped by logical capability. Think about what the player can or cannot design with and without certain parts. Group these parts together and make the node cost more, but don\u0026#39;t scatter the minimum parts needed for a single capability across multiple nodes or the element of choice and strategic decision is actually removed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0026#39;s all I can think of for now. What are YOUR ideas?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hysterrics","CreatedById":151688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T00:24:50Z","Content":"\nThe tech tree could use so much overhauling.

Early game you should have a hard time getting to the moon. The three important upgrades are important because they are vital to expanding your space program in terms of cash(VAB/SPH, Launchpad/Runway and Tracking Station)\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou need to either invest in one of these buildings early game to make the most of your space program.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Invest into VAB/SPH for more parts or more complexity at the cost of weight and flight software. Good for Smaller complex builds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Invest into Launchpad/Runway for more weight, at the cost of complexity and flight software. Good for Large part builds, at the cost of payload complexity\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Invest into Tracking Station for better control/data on your flight. Good for more accurate capable flights, at the cost of launch complexity and size.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo a new player should invest into the tracking station first, theirs no harm in such. Such an upgrade HELPS them through out the game, at the cost of getting more \u0022effective\u0022 launches going first. Better players invest into the other options at the cost of flight software help, since it doesn\u0026#39;t directly affect what you can do, it only helps.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA new player is held down to Kerbin, and thus is FORCED to learn in Sub Orbital launches or basic orbits. This makes sense, and doesn\u0026#39;t hold down better players. No change.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@2 no. Sending a new satellite to do the same job I literally just did should not exist. (Thats what Contextual contracts are here to fix hopefully.)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe removal of repeatable missions as it currently stands is more up in the air. On one hand you get paid off for having the facilities to do it again and get easy cash, on another it is cheap cash.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@3 Better fixed by overhaul of Electrical systems. Solar panels further down the line and fuel cells become more of a priority. Crew reports are hard to spam to prevent amazing players from gathering them all to quickly without electrical support that come in later missions. Thus going through the tech tree to quickly. It also gives a player reason to come back to Kerbin with more advance tech, for atmospheric flight to gather all the free science regardless of skill level. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@4 Same as above\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@5 Like it\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@6 Don\u0026#39;t like it. There is already a building to transfer science to money and vice versa. Adding a part that does the same isn\u0026#39;t necessary. I am on the fence about the Lab giving out science. I could of swore there were preventative measures to prevent infinite spam of the science it creates. Regardless it creates the science very slowly. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@7 Either invest into the VAB upgrade, or deal with it. Its a barrier to making huge ships early because allowing such would be OP. On top of that it would also make the smallest fuel tanks far less useful as you can just use the biggest tanks all the time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@8 Its a jet engine that is totally keeping you from space. Getting it later is irrelevant because by then why use a small weak jet engine when you can use a larger one?\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes its hard to design, and yes it isn\u0026#39;t very easy to build with but if its that difficult then don\u0026#39;t use it. Jets at early game are here because people want a more \u0022logical progression\u0022 which is fine by me. But to say they are hard to build with isn\u0026#39;t justification to put them further down the line where they not only are just as difficult, but more or less useless when compared to the more capable engines that are also capable of getting to space. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@9 Unlock both nodes or you do have a \u0022useless\u0022 part. \u003Cbr\u003E\nSince larger Engines/Fuel tanks are THE most important parts beyond science Upgrades to getting more of the tech tree I\u0026#39;m fine with them being split up and hard to get. \u003Cbr\u003E\nUntil you unlock the max rank on your VAB, part count matters. And thus larger parts/engines help you go further than spamming smaller fuel tanks and engines. So keeping them from easily becoming unlocked is important to keep the player from upgrading to quickly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso I used the Skipper Once with 1.25m parts on top.I had multiple tanks with fuel leading into the engine. Worked well, took up a lot of parts but did its job. So there is a choice, A very important one in fact. Either Spam smaller engines with a large fuel tank OR spam fuel tanks for a larger engine. I used to engine Cluster a large portion of my launchers until they buffed the Mainsail. Thus I didn\u0026#39;t need the Mainsail for a while.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hysterrics","CreatedById":151688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T02:50:23Z","Content":"\nSpeaking of fuel cells, is it just me or do they seem kinda useless as of now?
