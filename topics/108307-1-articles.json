I can open and play KSP from the steam folder, but I want to get it to work through steam because there are new updates and my game doesn\u0027t seem to be updated (I guess this is because of it not working through steam, therefore it is not being updated) \n\nAny help would be appreciated\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:51:58Z","Content":"Hi porgle, did you use the -force-opengl command before with KSP Steam?
