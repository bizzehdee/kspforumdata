Things were not \u0027fine\u0027 at all. Dealing with the old system was a pain in the ass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always been an either-or proposition with DRE with regards to part heating. The new thermal system in 1.0 should have made things better, but (astoundingly) did not. (speaking here of its impact on reentries primarily). Even prior to KSP 1.0 I\u0027d introduced a new system for heating where I knew exactly how many watts of heat were going in and things were still not heating up as fast as they should have been even with artificially elevated amounts of heat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 1.0, the old arguments about \u0027well it\u0027s Kerbin and you\u0027re just not coming in as fast as on Earth\u0027 re-surfaced and as I was trying to work the new system into Deadly Reentry it just didn\u0027t ring true. The truth was that there was more than enough heat going into parts to that \u003Cem\u003Erealistically\u003C/em\u003E should have vaporized them. The amount of convective heat (easily increased by GUI or by plugin) required to solve the problem would have destroyed ships very early in their launches so that wasn\u0027t an option. (sound familiar? How to increase/decrease difficulty in DRE in a manner that satisfies all and doesn\u0027t destroy launchers but still enough to make for \u0027deadly\u0027 reentries?). And as mentioned before, lowering thermal masses means that the impact from non-reentry heat sources. So the solution there is what... just reduce the heat contribution from those sources? You end up neutering the system because these things don\u0027t work linearly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets to feel less like balancing things so much as it feels like playing a game of \u0027whack-a-mole\u0027, that old carnival game where you whack little mechanical moles and several more moles just pop up somewhere else to take their place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, the solution is to keep track of both temperature and heating in separate places. One where convection and radiation occurs and then everywhere else. (the interior)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why \u003Cem\u003EDeadly Reentry\u003C/em\u003E got a skin system. The skin can have a separate max temperature, separate heating properties, etc. And since the skin was only a fraction of the thermal mass of the part (or not; it\u0027s configurable) it\u0027s easier to accomplish DRE\u0027s goal of destroying things on reentry. If it survives, the heat eventually dissipates or propagates through the ship where it can be ignored or used by mods to do whatever. It makes it easier to balance things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as you know, now stock KSP has the same system, more or less. I think there\u0027s some differences in implementation (I wasn\u0027t really much involved) but the concept is there and even the same variables that I used in DRE, just in the parts instead of part modules.
