I know there was an issue where unexpected behavior occurred when multiple labs were connected to the same ship; since scientists anywhere in the ship contributed to research in the lab. When there were multiple labs, the scientists would contribute to both labs, doubling the rate for free. I think they fixed it by making it where only scientists in the MPL contribute.

Things were not \u0027fine\u0027 at all. Dealing with the old system was a pain in the ass. \n\nIt\u0027s always been an either-or proposition with DRE with regards to part heating. The new thermal system in 1.0 should have made things better, but (astoundingly) did not. (speaking here of its impact on reentries primarily). Even prior to KSP 1.0 I\u0027d introduced a new system for heating where I knew exactly how many watts of heat were going in and things were still not heating up as fast as they should have been even with artificially elevated amounts of heat. \n\nWith 1.0, the old arguments about \u0027well it\u0027s Kerbin and you\u0027re just not coming in as fast as on Earth\u0027 re-surfaced and as I was trying to work the new system into Deadly Reentry it just didn\u0027t ring true. The truth was that there was more than enough heat going into parts to that *realistically* should have vaporized them. The amount of convective heat (easily increased by GUI or by plugin) required to solve the problem would have destroyed ships very early in their launches so that wasn\u0027t an option. (sound familiar? How to increase/decrease difficulty in DRE in a manner that satisfies all and doesn\u0027t destroy launchers but still enough to make for \u0027deadly\u0027 reentries?). And as mentioned before, lowering thermal masses means that the impact from non-reentry heat sources. So the solution there is what... just reduce the heat contribution from those sources? You end up neutering the system because these things don\u0027t work linearly\n\nIt gets to feel less like balancing things so much as it feels like playing a game of \u0027whack-a-mole\u0027, that old carnival game where you whack little mechanical moles and several more moles just pop up somewhere else to take their place.\n\nSo yes, the solution is to keep track of both temperature and heating in separate places. One where convection and radiation occurs and then everywhere else. (the interior)\n\nThat\u0027s why *Deadly Reentry* got a skin system. The skin can have a separate max temperature, separate heating properties, etc. And since the skin was only a fraction of the thermal mass of the part (or not; it\u0027s configurable) it\u0027s easier to accomplish DRE\u0027s goal of destroying things on reentry. If it survives, the heat eventually dissipates or propagates through the ship where it can be ignored or used by mods to do whatever. It makes it easier to balance things.\n\nAnd as you know, now stock KSP has the same system, more or less. I think there\u0027s some differences in implementation (I wasn\u0027t really much involved) but the concept is there and even the same variables that I used in DRE, just in the parts instead of part modules. (thanks guys)\n\nNone of this probably really answers your question, I\u0027m just trying to describe to you what it was like dealing with a new system that really was a huge improvement over the old system but didn\u0027t really behave as it should have. And as Softweir says below, I think a lot of it is in just wanting things to behave predictably. Certainly that\u0027s why I took DRE where I did and why they followed suit with stock."},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T21:49:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E None of this probably really answers your question, I\u0027m just trying to describe to you what it was like dealing with a new system that really was a huge improvement over the old system but didn\u0027t really behave as it should have.

I actually liked that one quite a bit, while finding the new one to be an overcomplicated (and quite buggy) mess that really adds nothing to the game that\u0027s perceptible to the player (well...beyond parts randomly exploding for no apparent reason). The more I work with it (and I\u0027ve been doing so quite a bit since 1.03/4 came out last week), the more that impression is reinforced.\n\nI really do appreciate the attempts to explain it, but yeah, you\u0027re right in that for now I still have no idea why any of this occurred ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T22:18:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"}]}
