I tried docking without it and I couldn\u0027t do it. Then after awhile I used it to get close to the dock target and the last 200 meters I do manually just by looking at the navball and looking at the two docking ports with the naked eye. That part seems to be the easiest for me. I have about 470 hours in game - is that considered new? I don\u0027t know, but I rarely try to go further than Minmus, but several times have gone to Duna. I quit the first time because it was frustrating to me trying to get to Duna.
