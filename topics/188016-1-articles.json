Pick which direction is \u0022up\u0022, and rotate your craft to be at a zero degree alignment to that up direction, which should be aligned with your intended docking port as well. That way, from this point the up and down \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls will move you up and down relative to the docking port, and side to side works the same.

Use the same steps described above to refine your axis alignment and rotation until it\u0027s really really close to the same axis as the docking port. This will usually make your nose move away from the docking port target again, so once again use the linear \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls to move you back until your nose is pointed dead at the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n13. Now accelerate toward the docking port again. Continue to use the linear \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls to keep your nose pointed at the center of the docking port.

The closer the two vessels get, the more fighting happens. Then one suddenly wins with great violence, and your ship goes flying away. Answer: turn off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E just before contact -- or turn it off, then on, then off, then on .... Doing that will reduce the violence of the magnetic attraction, because \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E will fight the attraction more gently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Too much speed when the magnet kicks on (as vossiewulf said). Depending on the vessel mass, the magnet can add a lot of speed -- but the magnet may not get the docking port pulled around into perfect alignment before you bounce off. Answer: use your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E retro thrusters to slow you down by half once you are within a couple meters of docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Your vessel is too heavy to turn with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. To get a docking, the ports must be lined up exactly. There\u0027s a reason why docking is considered one of the hardest tasks, both in the game and IRL. You need to control both the linear motion of your vessel, and the rotation, and have everything lined up right at the moment you touch. It\u0027s hard! Answer: more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, more reaction wheels, and take the docking process even slower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Mismatched docking ports. If one of the two docking ports was turned around backwards when you built the vessel, or if they are different sizes, then you won\u0027t be docking today. Answer: do a really really close visual inspection of the docking ports on the two vessels in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and check their action menus, and make sure you can see two identical ports facing each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne tip is to put a pair of something small on the top and bottom of your rocket. Especially if they are tall and skinny such as antennas. They help you aim for your docking, and they let you orient yourself to the camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother tip is to turn off the \u0022roll/pitch/yaw\u0022 axes for your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters. This makes it so that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E only controls rotation, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E only controls translation. This can greatly simplify maneuvering during the final stages of docking -- because all you have to do is control the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-06T04:44:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2019 04:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
