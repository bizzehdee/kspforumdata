Since you typically attach the commandpod version into the DROP before connecting the rest of the rocket, the bug would not be an issue. But with the empty pod, some may try to attach the drop to the rocket before adding the Mk4, and the bug rears it\u0027s ugly head. We can\u0027t fix it. But you can change your build strategy and make it work. A simple workaround would be to build the DROP \u002B empty Mk4 horizontally on top of your rocket then rotate it and connect it vertically in the stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that explanation is clear enough to get you building successfully.

I am at awe of the detail and thought put on this DEMV; this is what I had in mind for future transports to planets. I have figured out the issues with balancing correctly the MKIV and can make my rockets fly straight but I am unable to get the MKIV to drive out of the DROP module. I have connected it \u0022correctly\u0022 within the DROP module and deployed the wheels but it can not drive out. I have even attempted to use the jetpacks but it is like its glued into the DROP module somehow. I can get the MKIV to drive without problem if I do not have it inside the DROP module.
