If you attach something without a docking port to a docking port, then you want Decouple Node. These action groups are most useful with Undock node. I use it mainly as an action group for anything that has more than one docking port docked at one time that needs to be undocked together. Mainly for ships with two docking ports that need to undock at the same time. Decouple turns into undock when you have it in space and you right click on the docking port. You can undock something that doesn\u0027t have a docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
