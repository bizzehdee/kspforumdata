First you got to build the orbiter. Make sure you get its aerodynamics right.\u00A0Test how it reacts to re-entry by hyperediting it into orbit. Then once you get the orbiter finished, add the external tank. Make sure it is 3.75 or is a bunch of 2.5m parts clipped into one another. SRBs do not help at all. It is a lot easier to fly if you build it with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helped.
