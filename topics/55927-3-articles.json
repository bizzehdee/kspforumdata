So far, tweakables aren\u0027t doing a good job of replacing the need for multiple variants of the same parts, which is why I suspect that they\u0027re not done with tweakables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOther than the Space Shuttle? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re talking the philosophy of it, then yes, the space shuttle was excessive for what it was used for most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
