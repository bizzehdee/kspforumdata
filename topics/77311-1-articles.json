I\u0027m having a really hard time making this work as either my Kerbal ends up looking the wrong direction or my basic IVA cylinder is facing some weird/completely wrong angle. I tried dozens of combinations and worked all night on this and nothing works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T21:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emaybe this can help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Vd2Zn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
