If you set up the jammer properly, you\u0027ll be able to do two things: create chaff-like mini jammers (like britecloud) that function as false targets (they copy the radar return of the target and beam it to the radar to lure missiles and lock ons away); and you can set chaff to be 20-30 second active jammers of unlimited strength that use 0 electricity. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E---(update)---\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just occurred to me that having chaff as a transmitter isn\u0027t as smart an idea as I thought. It would probably be easier just to have it block radar in an arc or something based on the size of the chaff cloud(s). Then again, I\u0027m not sure how you\u0027ve set up radar to work so maybe it would be easier to make it a jammer. Hmmm. Maybe you\u0027ve got better ideas...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A deceptive jammer throws off a lock-on after a few seconds (typically under 2 depending on the power of the radar vs the power of the jammer vs range); since we don\u0027t care how it does it, just that it does, can this be added to the radar module? You don\u0027t have to build a DJM, but it would be nice to have that option if we want to build one as a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A radar warning receiver (an antenna part) as well as a missile approach warning radar (a small radial attached part that looks like your flare dispenser) would be nice - they would both use the same threat avoidance ppi (that isn\u0027t an ancient delayed phosphor monitor \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E) for passively picking up active radars - the rule of thumb is that a craft will detect a radar 33% further than the radar\u0027s maximum detection range - and for detecting missile launches and approaches so the player knows when and where to deploy countermeasures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. AI shouldn\u0027t know exactly what countermeasures to spit out (or even when to do so if it doesn\u0027t have a RWR/MAW); when AHM goes pitbull, AI with a RWR knows that chaff is the way to go, but until then, AI and player alike should be dropping a mix of chaff and flare if they become aware of the launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. ACM mode and IR UNCAGE: while most radars retain boresight, modern radars have an ACM mode that acts like a very wide angle boresight, locking onto the nearest target (assuming IFF is being built right in) within their field of view. While not all radars should have ACM, it would be nice to have the ability to differentiate between tech levels of radars. Also, is IR UNCAGE (what you called slaving IR to the radar) in the missile module or can we make it so only certain radar sets have it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Will we be able to tweak radar field of view, or will all A2A radar have a 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 arc? Will we be able to tweak peak power and other goodness? And will all radars have track-while-scan or can we determine which radars have it and which don\u0027t?
