I\u0027ve seen other people manage this completely stock, but I do use Infernal Robotics for the pivoting of engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note regarding the RAPIER engines: in all ship configurations, the RAPIERS are set to switch modes via the Abort button, and only do so manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note: Please use SAS to stabilize the craft, although sometimes this is hopeless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.

Like space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransition: One pilot described it as \u0022trying to make a snake stand on it\u0027s tail\u0022 and \u0022this thing flies like cats swim.\u0022 Once you have transitioned to level flight, though, the high lift ratio of the wings makes everything smooth sailing - until, of course, you do something wrong, and dive into the ground at full throttle, killing everyone on board and several people on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to transition to horizontal flight is to use the 1 and 2 keys to rotate the engines to thrust forward, rather than to use the attitude control keys to control the ship, which do not seem to work at all. Once you are off the ground, begin rotating the engines in small increments to achieve forward velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO?: Not really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommendation: It\u0027s probably best to take of in STOL mode (which can be accomplished in about 30 feet), rather than vertical, as the transition to horizontal flight is, in the best of circumstances, unlikely from a VTOL launch. Turn the engines back about 30 degrees and let her rip. Once you have achieved a velocity of about 80 m/s, you can rotate the engines to full rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.

We don\u0027t know how this happened. We are investigating. You can use this to retrieve Kerbals from those weird orbits they keep appearing in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransition: Once again, it is best to transition to level flight by vectoring the engines forward in small increments (about 10-20 degrees at a time). However, with this new, advanced vessel, you can also use attitude control keys to point it. Kind of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO?: Yes! Wait, really? Let me check... yes! In fact it has enough Delta-V to get you to an orbit of over 100 km, and back down with fuel to land! How did that happen? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommendation: You can take off in full vertical or STOL mode. Either one works, but the STOL takeoff is more reliable, if you have the runway. However, the craft is strangely difficult to point accurately. It tends to dip when you turn or bank, and bank when you turn. Hey, we\u0027re just happy it flies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.

ONE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeoff: The Amazotron XS2 takes off like a pig trying to get out of a muddy bog. You must throttle to 100% and wait for the engines to achieve full thrust to even leave Planet Kerbin, and even then it is a slow ascent. However, it is quite stable doing so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUtility: We\u0027re not sure what you would use this for. We are thinking of selling it to foolish Kerbals as a weekend pleasure craft. And trust us, there are plenty of foolish Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransition: Of all of these craft, the XS2 is actually the easiest to transition to horizontal flight. You can point it, adjust the thrust, do all sorts of crazy things, and you usually won\u0027t even crash! Strangely enough, the vehicle seems to climb best when the engines are angled back at 60-80 degrees, rather than the fully rearward 90-degree angle. However, doing so may make the climb too inefficient to achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO?: Yes! Barely. Don\u0027t count on getting an orbit higher than 100k in this baby and having any fuel left to land. Also, it has no science gear on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommendation: If you really like taking off vertically, this is the ship for you. It is a joy and a pleasure to take off vertically. Did we just say that? Wow, we did. But it\u0027s true! Also, the vessel is flyable with no pilot, since it has a separate command module. So it might be useful to retrieve Kerbals from orbit. Take off without a pilot, return with one!
