Realistic engines would be extremely OP in the KSP world, because all the bodies are so much smaller than they are in real life. An engine with 400 Isp and no balancing downside (heat for the NERV, huge electrical consumption for the ions, and low thrust for both) is, for the purposes of most challenges, very much OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines do exist (although they haven\u0027t been implemented in a launch system), and can have Isp ranging from 800 to 2000 seconds.

KSP takes a slightly near-future / alternate history approach to the space program, with near-future tech like the RAPIER/SABRE engine and spaceplanes, as well as semi-abandoned older tech like nuclear rockets, all of which (including all the other rocket engines and parts) are balanced to accommodate for KSP\u0027s smaller planets. If the lack of present-day realism bothers you, just install the appropriate parts mods, use 64K or another scaling mod to tweak Kerbin up to a more realistic size, and stop griping about the stock game, which is more or less balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T03:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xebx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xebx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe penguin ISP is only 400 when recent LH2LOx engines can have 465 ISP !

In real life, engines are also much higher thrust to weight, the F1 (Saturn V engine) weighed 8.4 tons and had a thrust of 6770 kN, the Mammoth weighs twice as much and produces half as much thrust. Fuel tanks in real life can have a fuel mass as high as 96% of total mass rather than the 88% maximum in KSP. KSP\u0027s liquid fuel is probably not LH2 anyway, as it\u0027s much denser and doesn\u0027t boil off (ignoring hand-waving with the nerva). KSP does a pretty good job of nerfing everything in a balanced and appropriate way to keep an appropriate level of challenge in a solar system 1/10 the size of our own.
