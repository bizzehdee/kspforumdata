I\u0027ve already landed at Laythe and Vall and finished my Tylo landing as well.\n\nPol is not bad since you don\u0027t need a large plane change. If you leave Tylo you can try to use a gravity assist to change your orbit closer to Bop\u0027s. They both have really small SOIs so play around with your maneuver nodes until you\u0027ve got it. If you still can\u0027t get one, leave Tylo orbit and make a correction at the ascending or descending node that brings you into the plane of the orbit, then it should be easy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E hmm why is Corvus Command Pod not allowed? cannot we ferry from kerbin to the mothership?

If you want a Gemini inspired pod try the K2 pod instead, its weight is more balanced. Yes you can ferry crew and cargo up to the mothership before it leaves. You can also send up a mission to retrieve the crew from a low Kerbin orbit after you get back (if your mothership or crew pods can\u0027t land)."},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T18:54:26Z","Content":"@sdj64\n\nJOOL-5 attempt failed...\n\nHi OP, i discovered yesterday a **significant lack of deltaV** on my planned Tylo landing. **** **My Jool-5 attempt is definetly aborted**, i will post some details on my **CRAZY BANANA** thread in the fan works later this weekend.

Realistic engines would be extremely OP in the KSP world, because all the bodies are so much smaller than they are in real life. An engine with 400 Isp and no balancing downside (heat for the NERV, huge electrical consumption for the ions, and low thrust for both) is, for the purposes of most challenges, very much OP.\n\nNuclear engines do exist (although they haven\u0027t been implemented in a launch system), and can have Isp ranging from 800 to 2000 seconds. Our Nerv engine is comparable to the real-life NERVA system, with a similar Isp; though it is balanced with the huge mass and heating issues in-game.\n\nYou really need to stop snarking about \u0022[whatever] is unrealistic/absurd because it doesn\u0027t perfectly match up with commonly used real-life technologies,\u0022 \u0022spaceplanes and nuclear engines are evil and a joke because they don\u0027t exist in a finished state,\u0022 \u0022stop it with the sci-fi and start doing real science,\u0022 etc. You aren\u0027t contributing anything except for an excessively negative attitude. KSP takes a slightly near-future / alternate history approach to the space program, with near-future tech like the RAPIER/SABRE engine and spaceplanes, as well as semi-abandoned older tech like nuclear rockets, all of which (including all the other rocket engines and parts) are balanced to accommodate for KSP\u0027s smaller planets. If the lack of present-day realism bothers you, just install the appropriate parts mods, use 64K or another scaling mod to tweak Kerbin up to a more realistic size, and stop griping about the stock game, which is more or less balanced."},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T03:35:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The penguin ISP is only 400 when recent LH2LOx engines can have 465 ISP !

In real life, engines are also much higher thrust to weight, the F1 (Saturn V engine) weighed 8.4 tons and had a thrust of 6770 kN, the Mammoth weighs twice as much and produces half as much thrust. Fuel tanks in real life can have a fuel mass as high as 96% of total mass rather than the 88% maximum in KSP. KSP\u0027s liquid fuel is probably not LH2 anyway, as it\u0027s much denser and doesn\u0027t boil off (ignoring hand-waving with the nerva). KSP does a pretty good job of nerfing everything in a balanced and appropriate way to keep an appropriate level of challenge in a solar system 1/10 the size of our own.
