The Atlas V is only a temporary measure."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T17:43:21Z","Content":"Aren\u0027t the 181s closed cycle like the AJ26s were? I thought they were trying to get away from that style of engine because it was a little too explodey due to higher chamber pressesure. \n\nEither way I more or less found my own answer I do apologise. Apparently this new [Antares will fly in March 2016](http://www.universetoday.com/116339/orbital-atk-aims-for-march-2016-antares-rocket-launch-restart-with-new-engines/?relatedposts_hit=1\u0026relatedposts_origin=117190\u0026relatedposts_position=0) from Wallops, VA.
