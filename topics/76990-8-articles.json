There is a need for high fidelity realistic real world models. There are quite a few people like myself who like doing historical missions and install only the historical packs. Having a proper SLS however easy it is to rescale is only useful for RSS. Now a scaled down SLS with a 5m core stage that could be useful all around from career to sandbox. I fear that doing ONLY a 1:1 scale alienates a lot of users. I mean I don\u0027t wish to add work but having two versions regardless of how easy it is to rescale in game, would make it very appealing and easy to the average user. Just consider scaling everything down for the average user.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
