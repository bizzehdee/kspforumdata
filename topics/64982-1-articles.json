Someone who replies to this can create a KMP server, and we can have a International Program. We can build stations, ground bases, interplanetary bases, anything, really.

For example,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay I have approval to launch a mission to Jool? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I would reply\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, that would be great/ No, modify it in this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I did not completely copy Lund, I was inspired by him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
