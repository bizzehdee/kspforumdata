They are about as powerful as real jets (without the reduction in thrust with altitude), have the mass of real jets, and are still far more fuel efficient than their real life counterparts. Fuel consumption per unit thrust has not changed with NEAR, so I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about with respect to fuel consumption being wrong. If you can\u0027t get a plane off the ground, then I\u0027m going to take a wild guess and say that your planes are way too heavy; even so, you should have no difficulty reaching a (relatively high) take off velocity of 100 m/s by about 3/4 of the way down the runway with normal-sized vehicles.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only are they more efficient than a real jet engine. They are more mass efficient than any possible chemically-powered engine. Unless AJE and real fuels are installed, jets in KSP have impossible efficiency. The ISP calculations are as if the exhaust air is moving out the back at the velocity one would expect for a chemical rocket, and not a turbojet, where the maximum exhaust velocity should be ~2300 m/s (ideal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, if you are installing real fuels and AJE and such, FAR would be the proper aerodynamics mod to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MunarJetman","CreatedById":120333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T14:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a small question.

I appreciate your stand on the GUI for this, the one for FAR can be a bit confusing. What I would like to recommend is to put a GUI back in the game for NEAR. However this time make it display only basic information about the craft. This way people can start to get a better understanding of what the plane/rocket is going to do and the best way to approach correcting the issue.
