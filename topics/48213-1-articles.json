Well, on Friday I decided to help Yargnit out by purchasing a gift code for KSP to give away during the contest. Due to various reasons the gift code was not used so now I have a gift code I won\u0027t use. This means I\u0027ll be giving you the opportunity to win \u003Cstrong\u003Ea free copy of KSP\u003C/strong\u003E! So what do you have to do? You\u0027re going to have to work for it: whoever promotes KSP in the most original way will win a free copy of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have one week to promote KSP and submit your promotion through the form below. Depending on the number and quality of responses I\u0027ll either put up a poll or choose the winner myself. The winner will have their gift code sent to them immediately through either email or as a forum PM. I\u0027ll then also announce the winner and the way they promoted KSP for some extra glory! You can do anything from handing out flyers to making posters or walk around as a Kerbal for a day!

I would like to highlight two entries before I mention the winner. The first is from Milan (janeLHX) who wrote that he had told one of his best friends about KSP and that that friend proceeded to buy KSP. His friend is now playing KSP all day long and he feels that he should be compensated for the loss of a friend, which is worth exactly one copy of KSP. This one certainly put a smile on my face, but I only have one copy to give away unfortunately. The second entry that really stood out but fell just short of winning is John\u0027s (JRF2k), who not only spams Facebook and Youtube with his KSP exploits but has also sent an email out to his daughter\u0027s Talented and Gifted teacher, informing her \u0022of what a great learning/teaching tool KSP would be for the children she teaches and how it could really ignite a passion for the STEM subjects which we so desperately need\u0022. Unfortunately, John, I only have a copy of KSP to give away and not one of the Kerbal figurines as you requested. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that brings us to the winner of the contest. Like John\u0027s entry the winner intends to use KSP for educational purposes. I\u0027ve seen a few applications for use in schools, but only one can win. I\u0027m glad to announce that Kevin (VolumeMixer) and his students will soon be able to enjoy KSP as part of their curriculum. Congratulations!
