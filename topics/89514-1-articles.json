From a theoretical standpoint I\u0027m envisioning a force behind pushing and the lift causing it to be flip happy because the wings push the plane up too hard. The pushing force pushes it around because there is nothing holding it straight. In the case of pulling, the force itself is holding it straight, like a train.

Can someone confirm or disprove my theories? Here is my understanding of how this CoL stuff works: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Imagine a plane in stable flight with constant velocity. Let us say thrust and drag are centered so they do not cause any momentum. If the forces of weight and lift would not be in line, the plane would turn around the pitch axis. Simple physics. So in straight flight something must happen to bring them in line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The CoL arrow in the SPH doesn\u0027t point straight up, it has a light forward tilt. It always points up, even if you turn a wing upside down. So my theory is that the SPH actually calculates the lift force for an airstream that does not go horizontally but a few degrees upwards. So you see your plane at a fixed angle of attack (around 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0). This is even necessary for stock aero because at zero angle of attack there would be no lift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If you turn the plane around the pitch axis (in the SPH), you see the CoL for different angles of attack. If a plane is hands-off stable in the pitch axis, the CoL must be behind the CoM at high angles of attack, and in front for low/negative angle of attack. The stable equilibrium is the angle where the CoL and CoM are in line (note that trim will move this equilibrium point, see #5). A stable plane will seek this angle of attack, resulting in a speed and climb/sink rate that depends on the thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) This shound work the same for other axes. So turning the plane around the yaw axis should simulate sideslip. If the plane is stable, the CoL indicator should create a momentum to turn the plane back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) If you attach control surfaces at an angle, the CoL indicator moves. This shows how the plane will react to control input.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
