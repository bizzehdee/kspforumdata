Once I have logged in and selected the expansion to purchase, I am redirected to the payment page, which appears to be broken. I am met with a whole load of empty fields to enter my address and payment details etc, but not one single prompt to enlighten me as to which data goes in which field. I\u0027ve tried a few combinations without any success. Is something going on with the store? Has anyone had a similar issue? I am very keen to install the expansion before starting a new game tomorrow...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hextore","CreatedById":160152,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-09T18:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been having the exact same issue today, even tried using the page source to figure out the correct info for each box(they are labeled there).\u00A0 Each time I click submit I get kicked back to the same screen with all the fields blank and no new information or warnings.\u00A0 I thought I was taking crazy pills, but it\u0027s the same on 5 browsers across 3 OS.\u00A0 Something is busted, it\u0027s a shame because like, I want to give them my money and they apparently don\u0027t want to take it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-09T19:34:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Kerbal Network\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-10T00:49:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe proper people have been informed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hextore","CreatedById":160152,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-10T01:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: Appears to be fixed now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BenG","CreatedById":150816,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-10T07:58:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYay!
