But the challenge I set forth is for your to launch your Spacecraft from Kerbal perform a single orbit of an inclination 90 or 270 (\u002B/- 2 degrees) and then perform an LOI on the same inclination with the result of orbiting the Mun with the same 90 or 270 degree inclination after arriving. I think the difficulty here is timing it perfectly to come into the Mun\\\u0027s SOI at the right angle to end up in the perpendicular obit. Let me know your thoughts Kerbal Nation! I will follow up later with my attempts after work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NonWonderDog","CreatedById":10479,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-10T23:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait, you mean transfer from a polar Kerbin orbit to a polar Munar orbit? ??? ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d like to see that, but I think any successes would be pretty much blind luck without better instrumentation.
