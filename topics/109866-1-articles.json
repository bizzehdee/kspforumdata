A mars push is a romantic notion, but until you have Ph.D. boots on martian soil, it will naer amount to much. The private ventures are packaging suicide missions and selling them as huts on tropical islands. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood science is often built on little tiny steps. We have a lot to learn about surviving in low vacuum environments, add to this extended survival without physical support from earth and top this off with living in a climate in which photosynthetic EM is 1/10th that of Earth. It would take the resources, I estimate, of 20 LEO missions to retreive on neo-martian and bring them back to earth. There are better places to learn how to deal with these problems than Mars (e.g.Phobos or an asteroid).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T01:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pipcard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pipcard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut I get tired of this letdown attitude, that we will never get anywhere.
