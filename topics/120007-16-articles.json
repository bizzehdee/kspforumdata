The result is that most of the times, if you\u0027re able to reach orbit, you loose the tail. In most cases, the wing\u0027s spoiler are lost just a few seconds after liftof due to aerodynamic stress. In my opinion, but I can be wrong, this can be due to the small attachment nodes in the VAB. In stock they\u0027re ok, buti in RSS thay\u0027re too small. If I try to revert to launch, the ET becomes much smaller, probably the stock ones (I don\u0027t know the reasons). I think those are easy fixable issues with cfg. By the way, if everything goes well (and sometimes it happen, for unknow reasons) the Orbiter has enough Delta-V for orbit. In orbit probably it will need a little more from OMS, talking about Delta-V, but if I don\u0027t want to follow the perfect STS mission profile, I can use SSME for maneuvers. I don\u0027t know why, but the RCS thruster doesn\u0027t show exhaust in orbit, but they seems to work. For re-enter I have still to find the correct periapsis, but it probably fly well, with a good hand. One last thing I noticed is that the Orbiter has a great pitch and yaw control during ascent, but very low roll authority in high atmosphere. Watching at the SSRW (Semi-Saturable Reaction Wheel), it seems that the Orbiter SAS has two times the pitch and yaw that the roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, for RO we can work on it, I can try to look at the patch, for stock, with FAR or not, this great mod is ready...
