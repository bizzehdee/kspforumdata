In low visibility and for unknown reasons his plane entered a spin and crashed. There are a number of theories and at the time there was more then one investigation leading to some information being split between investigators. There was an official investigation which came to be official and secret conclusions, a secret KGB one and the central community may have also done yet another secret side investigation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe official report was that the crash was caused when Yuri or the other pilot Vladimir Seryogin turned suddenly to avoid an object that had appeared and stalled (the committee secretly believed it to be a weather balloon). From the secret investigations a number of other theories where advanced at the time and years later by those involved or gained access to the classified materials. One of the leading men who was originally involved in the investigation believes that an SU-15 (he refuses to name the pilot who he says is still alive) was flying too low at super sonic speeds during the exercise (again visiblity was an issue that day), passing close enough that the shockwave from his aircraft tossed Yuri\u0027s plane over on itself. Another theory that was secretly investigated at the time was that an oxygen vent had been left open. Yet another was that because of poor information provided by air controllers (who gave outdated weather information) Yuri flew the craft into a dangerous weather system he believed to be at a higher altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T23:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust back from the pub where I was showing my KSP tutorial pictures - including the first manned mission in the orbiter known as \u0027Gagarin\u0027.
