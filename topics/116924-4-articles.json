Therefore, I\u0027d vote for KSP, even if it eventually does get multiplayer in the foreseeable future, this community is a lot more nicer than comments from Minecraft... KSP by far has way more creativity in regards to fun than Minecraft.

After defeating the Ender Dragon, there\u0027s just not much goal to achieve. Yes, it\u0027s a sandbox game where that\u0027s the whole point, but after getting through the End all you can do is build bigger buildings. When I play sandbox games, I like doing things that have some kind of function. I liked making a railway between my Nether portal and my house because its exit appeared in a different spot than the entrance. I liked building a fully automated zombie farm. But both of those things have purpose. My house ended up being a compact block of wood because making it pretty didn\u0027t seem necessary. I\u0027m not saying that I did nothing to make it pretty, but making a house with the sole purpose of looking good seemed utterly pointless.\n\nThat\u0027s why I like KSP. It also technically has no goal (arguably less than Minecraft, even), but it\u0027s easy to come up with your own goals, and achieving those goals often can become stepping stones to greater goals. Everything you build has a role in achieving that goal, and there\u0027s plenty to do in the process of achieving that goal. Want to go to the Mun? You\u0027ll have to figure out how, first, and then actually build a rocket capable of doing it. And it feels so rewarding when you actually achieve those goals.\n\nSo, yeah. KSP for the win, here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-24T14:15:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2015 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hysterrics","CreatedById":151688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T15:10:50Z","Content":"I don\u0027t play much anymore, but there is no reason to choose.
