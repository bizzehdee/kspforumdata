The handling isnt too bad, it seems responsive altough rolling takes a bit of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding with this aircraft can be very tricky since the aircraft doesnt handle too well at low speed and you have to go 80 m/s or below before you can pull your landing gear down. If you pull them out at speeds above that (didnt remember this and pulled out my gears at a speed of about 120 m/s) and everything gets ripped apart. (Fun fact my cockpit survived the splash down even if it hit the water at a speed of 70 m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: remember to never just drive vehicles in to the back of cargo planes without tying them down (docking or decouplers) or they will bounce all around the place and brake into pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDone this a couple of times myself \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E. it once made me lose one of my 4 engined Belugaish aircrafts, couple of rovers and 5 kerbals \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some picks of it.

Its a lot more capable aircraft due to it size (big aircrafts the size of the A-330 to A-340 to the B-747 are difficult to master) being a about two times smaller than the Stratocarriers allowing for a more rigid and efficient design. The top speed of this one is 300 m/s and lifts off at a speed of 50-60 m/s, its also very manouverable making it the perfect transport aircraft for small to medium distances (just put some external fuel tanks on the wings if you want more range) and for operating from small unpaved runways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pGpUPSe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pGpUPSe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ESMenco.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ESMenco.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it folks, two transport aircrafts from my colletion.
