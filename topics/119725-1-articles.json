This means that a similar force from the engines was pushing on a smaller mass, causing a bigger acceleration. The G forces went down later when the shuttles boosters were detached, so less force was pushing on the vehicle. The engines themselves get throttled down about a minutes before the external tank gets jettisoned, to stop the crew and the orbiter experiencing high G loads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T10:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny acceleration that can match the gravity and then just a little bit more (\u0026gt;1G) is enough to get you into orbit, provided you can maintain it for long enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T11:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny acceleration that can match the gravity and then just a little bit more (\u0026gt;1G) is enough to get you into orbit, provided you can maintain it for long enough.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESLS accelerrated just below 2 g until just below Mach, them powered down SSME to control maximum dynamic force......g \u002B F\u003Csub\u003Edra g\u003C/sub\u003E .
