Ok.\n\nThe atmosphere is only slightly unrealistic, a bit more drag as I understand it. The planet itself is what is unrealistic. As I\u0027ve said, you\u0027re launching from an ultra-dense planet the size of Ceres with a fairly realistic simulation (insofar as how it works, parts may be a different matter) of Earth\u0027s atmosphere. Now, I\u0027m *all for* correcting Kerbin\u0027s size to make up for this deficiency, but until and if that happens, SQUAD presumably wants to balance the atmosphere for gameplay reasons. Again, as stated, I can do a completely realistic launch in 1.0.2, unlike when using pre-1.0 atmosphere.\nSo then I decided to test this efficiency claim, at least insofar as how I launch. I have a ten-ton lander on top of a rocket with an orbital maneuvering stage for rendezvous. I put it through what I consider to be a fairly standard LOLAERO ascent: climb to 10km, lean over to 45deg, flatten out at 30km (I haven\u0027t done one of these in like, a year at least). Then I ran my standard 1.0.2/oldFAR ascent, which was to climb to 75m/s, pitch 5deg, and follow/nudge the prograde marker into orbit. Well, I kind of messed up the second launch, but...\n\n\u003E ![r1kYCY1.png](http://i.imgur.com/r1kYCY1.png)\n\n\u003E ![quISpgP.png](http://i.imgur.com/quISpgP.png)\n\nNot like I care about efficiency, but it\u0027s pretty clear to me that I can do better realistic ascents than using the old \u0022climb out of the thick\u0022 method. Adding horizontal velocity early is clearly better for the way I launch.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It is an issue. If I put a plane into a full throttle dive it should not slow down! That\u0027s not a combo of realistic and fun. That\u0027s just stupid.\n\nThere are a lot of things going on regarding drag, but I\u0027m willing to bet you\u0027re changing your angle of attack way too fast and inducing far more drag than you expect. Then, since you\u0027ve slowed down by changing your vector, your engine has to play catch up because it\u0027s not working nearly as efficiently. Someone who knows aerodynamic better can probably explain this better than I can. Also, you need to provide a picture of the aircraft because most of my craft pick up speed while diving, at least up until they smack into the transonic barrier, at which point I need engine power to punch through."},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T08:23:22Z","Content":"I think you misunderstand.

My tests had been with moderately small, simple rockets that did little more than get into orbit. They were small enough and had low enough TWR that at 10km, a 45 degree turn was easy to do.\n\nNot so with rockets with any sort of payload.\n\nAlso, I finally got a chance to build and fly a plane.

Because if it was, it was thrown away VERY quickly with the 1.0.1 patch. The sudden re-emergence of \u0022soup\u0022 makes me wonder if it\u0027s a temporary fix or the direction development is headed in. Aero in 1.0 and 1.0.x feel very different and at times the 1.0.x feels artificial (understandable since it was a hotfix).\n\nI can see low altitude soupiness making the game easier for new players the full release will attract, and agree with comments that 1.0 felt too digital and made the athmosphere of Kerbin a lot more like that of Duna in 0.xx releases. But the 1.0 model was touted as a major improvement, yet it barely lasted a few days.\n\nIt seems very strange that a major feature of a now finally finished game would get discarded like a spent solid fuel booster. Surely that could not have been part of a plan, unless there were divided opinions about it within Squad even before release. Or maybe they went back to the aero that wasn\u0027t generating so many complaints as a temporary solution.\n\n - Did Squad get it wrong with aero in 1.0? (If not, will we see it again?)\n\n - Was the storm of complaints too significant to ignore for several months before the first update/patch?\n\n - Can we ever have a workable aero model without soup in it?\n\n - Is customers building LOL-planes any reason to berate the aero model as unrealistic? (Should Squad kill ways to make bricks fly or let it go?)\n\n**and finally...**\n\n - In light of KSP 1.0 lasting only a few days, should we all play the hell out of KSP, accumulate a small ocean of complaints/bugs, and give Squad a much more detailed and precise list of imperfections to sort out?\n\n 1) I didn\u0027t get to spend enough time with it.\n\n 2) Probably not if all that was fixed were the LV-N and parachute bugs, but development progressed beyond that stage i guess.\n\n 3) I hope.
