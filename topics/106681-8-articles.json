Ok.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThe atmosphere is only slightly unrealistic, a bit more drag as I understand it. The planet itself is what is unrealistic. As I\u0027ve said, you\u0027re launching from an ultra-dense planet the size of Ceres with a fairly realistic simulation (insofar as how it works, parts may be a different matter) of Earth\u0027s atmosphere. Now, I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Eall for\u003C/em\u003E correcting Kerbin\u0027s size to make up for this deficiency, but until and if that happens, SQUAD presumably wants to balance the atmosphere for gameplay reasons. Again, as stated, I can do a completely realistic launch in 1.0.2, unlike when using pre-1.0 atmosphere.\u003Cp\u003ESo then I decided to test this efficiency claim, at least insofar as how I launch. I have a ten-ton lander on top of a rocket with an orbital maneuvering stage for rendezvous. I put it through what I consider to be a fairly standard LOLAERO ascent: climb to 10km, lean over to 45deg, flatten out at 30km (I haven\u0027t done one of these in like, a year at least). Then I ran my standard 1.0.2/oldFAR ascent, which was to climb to 75m/s, pitch 5deg, and follow/nudge the prograde marker into orbit. Well, I kind of messed up the second launch, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r1kYCY1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022r1kYCY1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/quISpgP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022quISpgP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot like I care about efficiency, but it\u0027s pretty clear to me that I can do better realistic ascents than using the old \u0022climb out of the thick\u0022 method.

Then, since you\u0027ve slowed down by changing your vector, your engine has to play catch up because it\u0027s not working nearly as efficiently.

I think saying that \u0022soup\u0022 is back is an incredible exageration as well. 1.0.2 aero is extremely similar to 1.0 and nothing at all like .90 and earlier.
