I don\u0027t know about the rest, but I don\u0027t care about aerodynamics. KSP is a space exploration game, I spend very little time in the atmosphere, as long as my rockets go up and come down in a semi-realistic fashion, I\u0027m a happy camper.\n\nI understand that we have space planes since a long time and people got used to be able to build and fly planes, but I can\u0027t help to think that Squad gave in and lost focus here. Imagine what other cool things SQUAD could have been working on instead of aero. Imagine the possibilities!\n\nSo, simple poll, how do you feel about it."},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:09:02Z","Content":"Hmm.

For that reason alone the core of the atmospheric simulation needs to be as realistic as possible. Tolerances can, and should, be adjusted to make it playable as a game, but things should still behave in an essentially realistic way when passing through an atmosphere so as not to make mockery of the generally very good space flight simulation.\n\nThis can be a difficult balance, as we are seeing now."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:41:08Z","Content":"KSP has always been a space game.

Basically I want a challenge getting to orbit but not so much of a challenge it is not intitutive for someone with a basic understanding of aerodynamics. So build a rocket with the things that can cause drag covered by a fairing you get better performance course, you build a rocket symeterical it will not be pulled one direction by being unbalnced by weight or drag.\n\nFocus on the space part of the game I say, let modders tweak the aerodynamics once Squad thinks they got a good balance between game play and realism."},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:13:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E More things for kerbals to do when they are stumbling around on other planets would be my prefered course of action.\n\nAgreed.

Every, single person, that makes spaceplanes agrees with you? Despite the multitudes of people showing working space planes in 1.x.x in threads where people swear up one side and down the other they\u0027re broken? You sure that it\u0027s not just you needing to relearn the game? Naw, that can\u0027t be possible at all. Everything is Squads fault right? This has nothing to do with giving proper feedback on ISP/Thrust/OverHeat/FuelUse all that IMPORTANT data..so let\u0027s just toss that out the window and keep raging on about how bad everything is and how it\u0027s entirely not our fault that oldschool planes that used bugs to be uber don\u0027t work anymore. I mean, these posts are really just getting plain old. If stuff is actually broken, and not subjectively \u0022broken\u0022 do to your own perceptions? Great. Call them on it. Send them bug reports.

But still, I\u0027m in the \u0022good enough\u0022 camp, if it makes my rockets fly like they should, re-entry as they should, then I\u0027m happy for now. I\u0027d rather have inaccuracies in the lift characteristics of my fins (more or less irrelevant from a rocket building POV) than having the rest of the game delayed because they can\u0027t get it just right and keep tweaking.\n\nAgain, I understand they still work in other areas as well, but it\u0027s gonna be slower for sure.\n\nThe 5th option, btw, is there to provide an edge case option.
