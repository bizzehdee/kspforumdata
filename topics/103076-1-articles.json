The base idea (the wing and tail shape) came from Star Citizen\u0027s 300i fighter: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://star-citizens.de/uploads/gallery/album_10/gallery_81_10_441364.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gallery_81_10_441364.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from this inspiration, I just randomly put parts together to build a ship I like. Being useful wasn\u0027t my main goal, but eventually it turned out to be a pretty good SSTO, so this is why I\u0027m sharing it. I was impressed how stable it was at both low and hypersonic speeds. I could turn around even at 1.4k\u002B m/s and it can fly well at low speeds as well. The only mod I used while testing was the TAC Fuel balancer, but sometimes I even forgot to use it and I barely noticed it on the controllability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if anyone has a similar design, usually I don\u0027t keep track of other\u0027s crafts and I don\u0027t mean to steal anyone\u0027s work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI named the ship Unity, because everything just fits so well to my eyes, and I really like the look of it. The ship has docking clamp, RCS, drone core, RAPIER engines, and a crew capacity of 2. It is possible to attach some custom things to the outer, \u0022vertical\u0022 parts of the wings, and ofc everywhere else where you like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to reach high orbit without any problem and return safely and land at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a screenshot of the craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/x9zkdo1kkzjxjd1/Unity.png?raw=1\u0022 alt=\u0022Unity.png?raw=1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s the download link:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/vx04qckfp0tlqit/Unity.craft?dl=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDOWNLOAD\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T08:42:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 08:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angezerus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T22:26:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E we cannot see the screenshot..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angezerus","CreatedById":129328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T08:45:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry about that, I\u0027m new to dropbox, I had to figure out how to embed correctly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Anyway thanks for the headsup!
