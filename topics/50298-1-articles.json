Would it just be the 965 m/s from Kerbin intercept to Jool section only?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what numbers do I use to get back? The same numbers, only in reverse?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E965 m/s from Jool to Kerbin and another 950 m/s to slow down enough to enter atmosphere?

The 950\u002B965 to get you to Jool assumes that Jool and Kerbin are in the ideal position for a transfer. If Jool is on the other side of the solar system (or worse it is \u0027behind\u0027 Kerbin) you\u0027ll need more. You might try the calculator to see your transfer window. It shows a color coded graph of how much delta V is required if you leave on a certain day and aim for a certain travel time: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2630 for Jool orbit is if you use thrust alone to slow down. Jool, and other planets with an atmosphere (Kerbin, Eve, Duna) can take advantage of aerobraking. Before reaching Jool (maybe just after you enter its SOI) you burn a tiny amount of delta V to nudge your course over so that you\u0027ll skim Jool\u0027s atmosphere. The atmosphere will help slow down your ship for free, though be careful not to go too low or you will unintentionally \u0027land\u0027 on Jool. After aerobraking you\u0027ll be in an orbit with the PE inside Jool\u0027s atmosphere. Once you swing out to the AP you perform a small burn to raise your PE to a stable orbit. This can reduce the delta V cost substantially. Jool also offers the option of using one or more of its moons for a gravity assist to brake, that\u0027s a lot more complex.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
