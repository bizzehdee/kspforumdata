Without it, it becomes static as a normal winglet. Also, the new module now has a \u003Cem\u003ECtrlSurfaceArea \u003C/em\u003Eparameter that allows you to specify the area of the moving piece in relation to the entire winglet area, or simply use it as a non-visual multiplier for control effectiveness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003Eobj_ctrlSrf \u003C/em\u003Eobject will pivot around it\u0027s X axis, as many degrees in each direction as the \u003Cem\u003ECtrlSurfaceRange \u003C/em\u003Eparameter allows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to keep in mind with this new module is that things attached TO ControlSurface parts will not pivot along with the moving part. For that, we have planned to add other types of part specifically geared towards that purpose later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"millsw","CreatedById":4053,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-13T23:33:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, In non tech terms....this means what!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(It sounds awsome, But confusing!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"C7Studios","CreatedById":3895,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-14T00:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh thanks for doing that.

This prevents projects that depend on the deprecated feature from breaking with the new update, and gives developers some time to update them.
