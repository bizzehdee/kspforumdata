Very efficient! But it relies on my craft being at a certain point at a certain time in space around Kerbin to work as shown here. Otherwise when I finally achieve orbit I have to do a lot of work re-optimizing the mission with my actual starting orbital data. I\u0027m not looking for perfect, but I am looking for close, which I know real space agencies can achieve.
