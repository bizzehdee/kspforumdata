At some point designs that previously flew with no problems started having issues with un-commanded throttling. I am using MechJeb on the crafts but I am not using it during the ascent. I engage SAS and set the throttle to 100% before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft 1 has liquid fuel main stage and SRBs. During the ascent the main engine operates normally at first and then just throttles down. I can hold the shift key and throttles back up but then immediately throttles back down again. I press shift again and the same thing happens, after that it just stays down. At staging the throttle comes back up again and remains at 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft 2 has LF main stage and LF boosters. This one just sits on the launch pad with the engines sputtering (rapidly oscillating between 0 and 50% throttle) after 30 sec or so it starts operating normally and lifts off. (Note this design previously flew properly and has a TWR of over 1 so its not a question of TWR \u0026lt;1). During the subsequent ascent it seems to run normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each of the above the issue happens the same way every time I try to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdited to add: Upper stages all seem to fly normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried making a quick test example from scratch today (2 stage rocket with a Mainsail and 4 large stock SRBs (Kickbacks iirc) as the first stage) and that flew as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI replaced the first stage on Craft 1 above and it still had the throttle down problem, but it manifested differently than before. This time it even throttles down after SRB staging and then spontaneously throttles back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone experienced anything like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround the time this issue started I installed the NavyFish docking indicator but I don\u0027t think it happened right after that but I can\u0027t be certain.
