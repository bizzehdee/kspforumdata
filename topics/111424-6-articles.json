(AI was on easy... dunno what the server\u0027s AI is set to) The fight dragged on for at least twenty minutes, until I figured out how to take my own ship out: Go for the turrets. I targeted one of them so my own turrets would concentrate fire and gave the enemy ship the works. A few seconds later, it\u0027s shields dropped below 50% and it all fell to pieces. One of my turrets landed a hit, and at least six of the enemy\u0027s turrets fell off. Thus weakening the defenses. More missiles hit, more turrets fell off. Soon it had none left. I stopped chasing the ship and waited for my rockets to get a lock, and fired everything at once. That finished the battle. All it managed to do to me was knock off a few of my turrets.
