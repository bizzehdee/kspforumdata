The Mission Control Facility at the space center now lets you take on contracts to earn Funds, Science and Reputation. \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;* Budget Essentials:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; Career Mode is greatly expanded now by the addition of Funds and Reputation. Funds are required to launch vessels, and reputation is earned (and lost) by doing contracts (or failing them). In this release, your reputation is already used to regulate the level and amount of contracts offered you. Lower reputation means fewer and less prestigious contract offers, while high reputation means more and more ambitious proposals.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;* Vessel Recovery:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; Vessel recovery is also making its first appearance. Although still not complete, the new recovery system now lets you reclaim some of the cost of all landed parts, and any resources they still contain. The Science Summary Dialog of previous versions has been overhauled to also include information about recovered parts and crew.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;* New UI Toolbar:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; User interfaces in the game have been vastly overhauled, but the largest addition is the new app toolbar, which can be seen in most scenes now, and holds buttons to flip between the messages, resources, currencies and contract panels. Also, it\u2019s mod-friendly.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;* New MonoPropellant-Powered Engine and LFO-Powered RCS Thrusters:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; The O-10 MonoPropellant Engine is a standard engine linked to main throttle controls, but powered by MonoProp. The Vernier Engine, conversely, is a Liquid Fuel\u002BOxidizer powered RCS unit. These should be interesting new additions to the stock parts set.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;* Revised Tech Tree Layout:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; To better fit the new engines above, we\u2019ve updated the tech tree, giving the \u2018flight control\u2019 type nodes a much more logical progression, and added new paths to expand your way through the tree more freely.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;* Repurposed Engine Nacelle parts:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; Those grey, largely useless engine body sections are now given new purpose as combination air intake \u002B fuel tank units, making them a lot more useful for building spaceplanes. \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; There are many more features, tweaks and fixes all around, but these are the highlights.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; All in all, I\u2019m very glad we decided to push this update further. The difference between the state of the game now compared to when we were doing the first round of experimentals is huge.

Ever looked at how much it cost to return a shuttle to service after a flight? Taken as a whole program, the re-usability of shuttle was in fact a net loss over single-use rockets.

But the way the game is now, it doesn\u0027t have random failure or part degradation. I can land and take off again as many times as I want in the world of KSP, so long as I have fuel left. Why should I pay a penalty just for hitting the recover button? When things like deadly reentry are implemented, then yeah, you shouldn\u0027t get a full refund for a scorched heat shield. But in the meantime, with what\u0027s currently available, if I land at KSC, instead of the opposite side of Kerbin, I feel like it should come with a reward.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-10T01:23:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2014 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Otis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
