You wouldn\u0027t want to release a game with that, but I don\u0027t see why a mod couldn\u0027t do it"},{"CreatedByName":"BarryDennen12","CreatedById":50869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T09:59:10Z","Content":"I\u0027m just surprised there aren\u0027t more requests for it, I\u0027ve been assuming there\u0027s a big obstacle that I\u0027m ignorant of. I had wondered if maybe there\u0027d be an issue with headless Kerbals based on whoever you hit \u0027IVA\u0027 on \\*shrug\\*\n\nBut being that there is some extended camera movement for people who use head trackers, I have to believe that there\u0027s a way to get free camera happening."},{"CreatedByName":"BarryDennen12","CreatedById":50869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T14:17:25Z","Content":"Would it be simpler to just learn how to add new camera \u0027spots\u0027 to cockpits? (y\u0027know how when you double click at the front of the Mk2 cabin and you wind up with a rear facing view of the front seats?)"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T14:27:44Z","Content":"There are no big technical obstacles aside from keeping the camera inside the craft. [KerbTrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73184) allows you to move around inside the craft by moving your head for example. You could use it as a reference for IVA movement as it has already worked around the issues involved."}]}
