Also, I would very much question the generalizability of such old samples and also the fact that a meta-analysis of 14 studies is not very large. There are literally millions of people in hundreds of societies from virtually all walks of life and at all ages who have taken standardized IQ tests over the last 80 years. Whether they are valid indicators of \u0022Intelligence\u0022 or not, I think we can safely conclude that the patterns of results in whatever it is they are measuring are representative of large swaths of humanity. Not something I think would be safe to conclude based on one meta-analytic study of 14 studies over 100 years. The other thing to keep in mind is that, \u0022IQ\u0022 is generally based not on reaction time. Depending on what they mean by \u0022reaction time\u0022 it might not even have any relation to explicit or \u0027intentional cognitive process so much as to implicit cognitive ability, which nonetheless is a very interesting index.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuffice to say, the prevailing generalization in psychology is that there has been an increase in IQ since the 1930s in most parts of the world where reasonable data sets exist to allow such an historical comparison. Because IQ is a culture-bound construct, this might only reflect changes in education and institutionalized knowledge sharing, and not really reflect on changes in innate intelligence or any other innate cognitive ability. If people in 2000 spend their entire lives preparing for things that resemble IQ tests, then it stands to reason that they would do better at such tests than people in 1940 who underwent less intensive educational preparation for such things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PwnedDuck","CreatedById":54398,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T22:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E15 and working on a Laythe base, but I can understand that the patience, understanding and design comprehension needed for this game are a few years yet for many people my age, sadly enough.
