I\u0027m curious if there are similar guidelines I need to be looking out for for spaceplanes. So I\u0027ll ask the question outright: about how much lift and how much thrust do you need per tonne of spaceplane?

I fear this is dependent on many factors (number of intakes, how quickly you get up to altitude, how efficient your flight profile is). Reported dVs (using Kerbal Engineer Redux) between 2200 and 3200 (measuring air-breathing engines and liquid fuel) do seem to get me to orbit on my SSTO spaceplanes.

You can get away with fewer surfaces if you pitch up and use the engines to fight gravity.

Perhaps I\u0027ll add this to my intake tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get an I-beam pocket edition and place it somewhere level on your fuselage while you\u0027re working. Press D, W to rotate it and lay it down before placing it. It should be pointing forward. (You\u0027re holding the aft end.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Place a cubic octagonal strut on the I-beam. Press W to lay it down before placing it. Again, it will be pointing forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Place a ram intake on the cubic strut. The back end of the intake should be connected to the front end of the strut. You might have to wiggle the intake around to get the clipping right. (You can put the intake on the back of the strut also, but then you can\u0027t place the nosecone on the back.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Make a copy of the strut/intake combo. Hold left alt while you left click on the cubic strut (not the I-beam).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Slide the strut/intake combo back on the I-Beam until it flips the correct direction. This is about as far forward as you can place it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Repeat the copy/place (steps 4/5) until you have five intakes. You might be able to fit a sixth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrop it in your subassembly folder if you want. When you want to move it, grab it by the I-Beam at the back.
