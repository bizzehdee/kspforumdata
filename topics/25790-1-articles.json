So you can ignore my request for help. lol. Either way, Hello! I\u0027m excited to be apart of the community!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHello, this my first post on the forums. I\u0027ve been skimming around every now and then looking for tips and thought I would finally join the community. I have finally matured through the hilariously fun honeymoon stages of playing KSP through trial and error and am looking for a little guidance on rocket design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve downloaded the Kerbal Engineer Redux mod in hopes of building rockets in a more intelligent manner. The only problem now, is that I have little idea how to use the Engineer mod. I\u0027m not sure what all the information it gives means, and how each piece of information relates to each other. I\u0027ve gathered that delta-v is your ships ability to change velocity, all though I am unsure of all the aspects what that means, and more importantly, how do I determine how much I need. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would really like to be able to do, is decide on a \u0022mission\u0022, for example send a module to land on the Mun (or any celestial body). Then design the payload, and then use the information to be able to design a rocket that, barring any pilot error, should be guaranteed to get me off Kerbin and land my module on the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo could anyone point me to a good tutorial that teaches you how to intelligently build rockets using the information provided in the Engineer mod/in game (information you can obtain with the science equipment for instance)? All the tutorials I have found so far on building rockets, just show you which parts you need in order to make it to orbit, or to the mun and so on. They don\u0027t really go into the properties of those parts to tell you why they work. Scott Manley should really do an in depth YouTube Engineering Redux tutorial to explain how to intelligently build rockets, yea? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-06T23:13:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2013 11:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sethnizzle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T06:05:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
