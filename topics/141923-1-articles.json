Long Time lurker here...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having this bug, where I can not dock a station with a small ship.\u00A0 I\u0027ve done hundreds of docking operations, and it\u0027s more easy for me now than it was when I started playing KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSearching for a solution, I found many posts referring to change a string on the \u0022ModuleDockingNode\u0022 module. Folks who had this bug reported that sometimes the docking port status is set to \u0022Acquired\u0022 instead of \u0022Ready\u0022 so the docking port could not engage. The thing is, after looking into my saving file, the \u0022state =\u0022 is set to \u0022Ready\u0022, but the vessels could not dock and keep bumping into each other. The magnetic force is being applied, but is kinda weaker for what I can remember.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3KqUkhs.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00223KqUkhs.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see above, the two vessels are perfectly aligned. I tried looking into the save file and editing the docking port configuration on both the ship and the station. Both were already stated as \u0022Ready\u0022The only different thing I remember about this is that the station\u0027s docking port is the root part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I do know this is an old bug, but everyone managed to solve it by changing that string. But again, when I looked into the save file, it was \u0022Ready\u0022 instead of \u0022Acquired\u0022...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave anyone seen this before?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, thanks for all the help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trevisan","CreatedById":69985,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T17:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShameless self-bump.
