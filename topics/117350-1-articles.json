Have you reviewed the offer?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, mister Kerman.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, just Dynan. It\u0027s only fair.\u0022\n\n\u0022Alright, Dynan. You surely realize we\u0027re getting a lot of nutcases here. People who want to go into low Sun orbit, scientists who wish atmospheric surveys of multiple spots on Eve, even one idiot who wanted to have a flag planted on Jool...\u0022\n\nDynan\u0027s face tensed.\n\n\u0022...and when I strapped the first capsule on top of solid rocket booster a week after building a rudimentary launchpad by my junkyard workshop, they called me a nutcase too. Today nobody calls me nutcase. They call me a visionary.\u0022\n\n\u0022Of course. That\u0027s why I submitted this contact to you.\u0022\n\n\u0022I can tell a visionary apart from a nutcase, Dynan. But first I need some details explained. Let us recount...\u0022 Jeb pulled the contract from his briefcase and put it on the desk.\n\n![2015-07-31_00001.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00001.jpg)\n\n\u0022...just tell me, what do you need this all for?\u0022\n\n\u0022At Probodyne, we have developed a new kind of rover for the Mun. Safe, reliable, fast, fun to drive. Uses only Liquid Fuel, no need for oxidizer. We\u0027d love to see it used in some picturesque places. It gathers some good scientific data too. Tourists love it, scientists love it. But its fuel consumption is... rather high. We need a base for maintaining a set of these rovers. The scientific data would be best processed on-site. And there should be rooms for staff and the tourists.\u0022\n\nJebediah frowned. \u0022On wheels?\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh... after the tourists get bored with one area and the scientists have looked under every rock, the base should be able to relocate to a different area.\u0022\n\n\u0022There is one more issue...\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes?\u0022\n\n\u0022A docking port. I hope you realize normal docking on the surface is nearly impossible?\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh. I do. It\u0027s a requirement by the Commission of Space Tourism.\u0022\n\nJeb groaned. \u0022Them. Alright. I\u0027m willing to do it... but not exactly as you have envisioned.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes?\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027ll slap some port on it... Now other details. First, launch of so big a facility in one piece would be impractical. It will be assembled on site. Next, I hope you realize how much 6000 units of Liquid Fuel weigh? I\u0027m not bringing it there. The base should be self-sufficient anyway, so it should have an ISRU unit. And the only logical way to make it mobile and not break apart when moving over rough terrain...\u0022 Jeb paused, taking a breath - \u0022...is to make it a train.\u0022\n\n\u0022Building rails?\u0022 Dynan\u0027s eyes bulged more than usually.\n\n\u0022Oh, no. Just standard ruggedized wheels. But the base will be composed of multiple cars connected into a train, connected with flexible joints of a universal grabbing unit.\u0022\n\n\u0022They say bad things about that device.\u0022\n\n\u0022And rightly so. It\u0027s fickle. But you once you master it, it serves you reliably... mostly.\u0022\n\n\u0022So, what kind of cars will be there?\u0022\n\n\u0022There will be the tourist module and the staff module. Living quarters for fourteen kerbals in total. It will also contain science experiments shielded in a bay.\u0022\n\n![2015-07-31_00002.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00002.jpg)\n\n\u0022Wouldn\u0027t it be better to attach them to a lab? And what about that engine on the roof?\u0022\n\n\u0022They are fragile, and since it\u0027s meant to travel on wheels, it counts as a rover. Do you know what rhymes with \u0027rover\u0027?\u0022\n\n\u0022ummm... cover?\u0022\n\n\u0022That too. But I meant \u0027Roll over.\u0027 That\u0027s what they do. They all do it. Big, small, tall, squat, long, short. Some wizard developed a rover with center of mass below the surface of the ground. It was simply incredibly stable on Kerbin, taking high-speed turns without even a little tilt. Do you know what it did first thing after landing on the Mun?\u0022\n\n\u0022It rolled over?\u0022\n\n\u0022Bingo!\u0022\n\n\u0022so how can we prevent rolling over?\u0022\n\n\u0022We can\u0027t. We accept it. We build in such a way, that it\u0027s harmless. The staff car can set itself upright with the cargo bay doors. The front car will roll over the engine to a side, then needing just a small push. Plus it looks cool. Maybe the technicians can rig a fuel line to it for a boost uphill.\u0022\n\n\u0022Okay, I\u0027m trusting your judgment. What\u0027s next?\u0022\n\n\u0022The science lab. It can set itself upright with the reaction wheel.\u0022\n\n![2015-07-31_00003.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00003.jpg)\n\n\u0022What are these struts for?\u0022\n\n\u0022What did we talk about?\u0022\n\n\u0022Do they help it roll back onto wheels somehow? I don\u0027t see how.\u0022\n\n\u0022No, they are to protect the Gigantors. The big solar panels, which would be smashed to smithereens if the lab rolls over. The lab could house two scientists, but I wouldn\u0027t sentence them to actually living there.\u0022\n\n\u0022Next come two fuel tanks. We\u0027ll launch them half-full, so that they aren\u0027t excessively heavy but won\u0027t require transfer stages.\u0022\n\n![2015-07-31_00004.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00004.jpg)\n\n\u0022How are the engines decoupled?\u0022\n\n\u0022We call it \u0027Crumple Buffer Engine Method.\u0022 The craft can land at a velocity exceeding the engine\u0027s rated durability, engine first, and it decouples quite cleanly.\u0022\n\n\u0022So, the ISRU unit and that\u0027s it?\u0022\n\n\u0022Not quite, but yes, the ISRU comes next.\u0022\n\n![2015-07-31_00006.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00006.jpg)\n\n\u0022It has no own roll-over mechanism. It will depend on other modules for providing the needed torque. Still, the gigantors are protected by the drills. Of course in their folded state. There is an operator cabin so it can operate independently. Which it will have to, early on. It will be the first car deployed.\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh, why?\u0022\n\n\u0022This all has to land somehow, right?\u0022\n\n\u0022Of course.\u0022\n\n\u0022Besides the fuel cars, none other has its own landing capability.\u0022\n\n![2015-07-31_00007.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00007.jpg)\n\n\u0022Uh, what exactly is this?\u0022\n\n\u0022A skycrane. It can land the modules, but it will need fuel. The ISRU will provide it. And the last part... finding that ore.\u0022\n\n![2015-07-31_00008.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00008.jpg)\n\n\u0022They won\u0027t flip over?\u0022\n\n\u0022Likely one might. That\u0027s why two. If both flip over, we\u0027ll send more. They aren\u0027t terribly expensive.\u0022\n\n[..to be continued...]\n\n*The Munar Train is complete currently.

Other things kept Jebediah busy. A Dune mission, Eve probes, rescues, Minmus, crew schooling...\n\nFinally the mission began with launch of the skycrane.\n\n![screenshot135.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot135.jpg)\n\nIt kinda aaaalmost went alright. With the teeny tiny exception that the main rockets didn\u0027t have enough fuel to make orbit, and the skycrane had to use own propulsion for the last 600 or so m/s. Which left it with the tanks depleted in 1/3.\n\nThen came the miner. A young female engineer recently recruited after being rescued from LKO volunteered for the mission, having passed her training involving sightseeing of the Kerbin system just a couple weeks ago.\n\nMeet Trazy Kerman, the enthusiast. Not too bright, not too brave, but she loved the big rig which she was assigned to.\n\n![screenshot0.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot0.png)\n\n![2015-08-05_00004.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-08-05_00004.jpg)\n\nThe launch was very standard. It went without a hitch, Trazy sat in the safety of a fairing through the ascent. The rocket guided by a probe core circularized the orbit and deployed the fairing, preparing to leave the payload and return for recovery.\n\n\u0022Hey, Jeb,\u0022 said Bob. \u0022I\u0027m really feeling weird about this.\u0022\n\n\u0022Why?\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027re essentially dropping a truck car into Kerbin orbit. Its only propulsion is the wheels. If there\u0027s a problem with the tug, she\u0027ll be stuck there until we rescue her.\u0022\n\n\u0022We rescued her once, we can do it again. There\u0027s a bunch of SavingKlaws from the last delivery.\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s bigger than the pod we rescued last time.\u0022\n\n\u0022And what was the touchdown speed of that pod?\u0022\n\n\u0022uh... 3.3m/s?\u0022\n\n\u0022So if the rig impacts the ground at 20m/s, she\u0027ll still survive. Plus there\u0027s a tug waiting for her.\u0022\n\n\u0022I have a bad feeling about that tug...\u0022\n\n\u0022Look, she can always get out and push.\u0022\n\n\u0022True that. Let\u0027s decouple it.\u0022\n\n![2015-08-05_00005.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-08-05_00005.jpg)\n\n\u0022Hey, Jeb.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yeah?\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027ve installed the probe core backwards again.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T19:15:47Z","Content":"Ambitious.

Sometimes I\u0027m worried you\u0027ll crash the crafts into each other when you get this precise.\u0022\n\n\u0022No worries, I\u0027m watching it. Let\u0027s buy some donuts, it\u0027s over two hours until the tug catches up.\u0022\n\n...\n\n\u0022See? Right on course. Just some teeny adjustments to get the prograde marker right on target. Now just using the RCS to brake and we\u0027ll pick her up.\u0022\n\n...\n\n\u0022Val, the RCS?\u0022\n\n\u0022Safety off, RCS on, fuel active, I\u0027m firing retrograde and it\u0027s not working!\u0022\n\n\u0022Val, brake!\u0022\n\nValentina quickly flipped the tug around its crossbar axis and fired the main engines. The tug lightly knocked into the rig, sending it spinning, but soon SAS caught up and both vehicles stopped rotating, drifting apart slowly.\n\nValentina flipped the tug back towards the rig and pressed the prograde RCS button. The craft sat there motionlessly.\n\n\u0022Bob, did you install all the needed RCS thrusters?\u0022\n\n\u0022I checked it. Twelve vernors. Two pairs for up/down and rotating along the crossbar axis. Two pairs for left/right and rotating along the claw axis. Two pairs for rotating across the cross-axis...\u0022\n\n\u0022Which translate...?\u0022\n\n\u0022Up/down.

Burn prograde and flip really fast? And hope for the best?\u0022\n\n\u0022Val, what if we used the rig\u0027s klaw instead? Dock it to the probe core, using main engines to get forward speed?\u0022\n\n\u0022And push instead of pulling? If it\u0027s even a little off center we\u0027ll spin like crazy. Also, do you know what happens when you dock a vessel in control to an extended craft?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yeah, same thing as when the Ghostbusters cross the streams. You\u0027ll need to switch to the rig when the tug is about to connect.\u0022\n\n\u0022And if I fail I\u0027ll obliterate the known universe.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well... if you can\u0027t do it...\u0022\n\n\u0022I CAN do it.\u0022\n\n\u0022Really?\u0022\n\n\u0022Just watch.\u0022\n\n...\n\n\u0022Yeah, nice! Trazy is now in Munar orbit and we just need to pick an ore-rich place to start. Can you land her?\u0022\n\n\u0022No.\u0022\n\n\u0022No?\u0022\n\n\u0022There\u0027s not enough delta-V left. She\u0027ll crash.\u0022\n\n\u0022Are you sure? You have still like... 900 m/s?\u0022\n\n\u0022Enough for one perfect suicide burn. If I botch it, she\u0027s dead.\u0022\n\n\u0022So you can do it!\u0022\n\n\u0022No. The rig is held by its klaw. I\u0027d need to detach, move and hold it by the middle, somewhere around the inertia wheel.\u0022\n\n\u0022So?\u0022\n\n\u0022No retrograde, remember?\u0022\n\n\u0022You could flip the tug...\u0022\n\n\u0022And by the time I have her grabbed I won\u0027t have enough fuel for landing.\u0022\n\n\u0022But...\u0022\n\n\u0022But we\u0027re waiting for the second tug, period.\u0022\n\n...\n\n\u0022Perfect! Grabbed just above the center of mass, wheels downwards, and the new tug works very smoothly.\u0022\n\n\u0022Val, move all the fuel from the old tug into the new one.\u0022\n\n\u0022Not all.\u0022 Val grinned. \u0022Need to save a little to deorbit.\u0022\n\n\u0022You just love crashing the spaceships, don\u0027t you?\u0022\n\n\u0022Just watch the fireworks, they will be spectacular.\u0022\n\n...\n\n\u0022Whoa!

The tug was supposed to land on its legs, drop the rig and let it drive away, right?\u0022\n\n\u0022And it didn\u0027t?\u0022\n\n\u0022There\u0027s at least a meter of clearance under the legs. It sits right on top of the rig, on its wheels. Simply put, it\u0027s too short. Not even the passenger modules are short enough to fit under it.\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m not sending yet another tug.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yeah, I hope so. This thing is more trouble than it\u0027s worth. Just give all the rest respective transfer stages capable of landing directly.\u0022\n\n\u0022But what about right now?\u0022\n\n\u0022Just sit back.\u0022\n\nValentina pushed the throttle of the remote control console gently, watching the screens. The rig began rising off the ground and she immediately pulled the throttle two notches back. The rig descended and sat on the ground, the engines still blasting clouds of dust around.\n\n\u0022Disengaging the Klaw.\u0022\n\nThe tug deprived of its load shot vertically up, clearing the craft. Valentina pulled the throttle back, and slowly brought the vessel to a hover, stopping some 100 meters above the surface.\n\n\u0022Now let me find a bit of mostly flat terrain...\u0022\n\n\u0022There, the bottom of the valley stops rising and descends into another depression...\u0022\n\nShe tilted the tug for a moment, and let it float gaining horizontal speed. For a minute they waited as she surveyed the terrain from above, then she tilted it in the opposite direction bringing it to a stop. She throttled it down for a moment to begin descent, then brought the throttle back to a position that prevented the tug from changing its vertical speed. After another minute the landing legs for the first time touched the dust of the Mun.\n\n\u0022Tracy? Drive the rig up to the tug and start refueling it.\u0022\n\n\u0022eeeiiiiiiiiyes!\u0022 sounded from the radio.\n\n\u0022Carefully. Don\u0027t flip it. We won\u0027t have any means to set it upright in quite a while!\u0022\n\n\u0022Got that captain!\u0022\n\nValentina looked at Jeb nervously. He shrugged. \u0022I understand her. How do you think it looked like when I first made it to the orbit?\u0022\n\n\u0022Right. At least she\u0027s driving responsibly.\u0022\n\nThere was a long moment of silence. Then the radio came to life.\n\n\u0022KSC, we\u0027ve got a problem.\u0022\n\nThe three kerbals in the mission control looked at each other in fear.\n\n\u0022...The Klaw doesn\u0027t quite reach up to the tanks of the tug.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ohhh...\u0022 Valentina deflated. \u0022You\u0027re gonna give me a heart attack. There.\u0022 she flipped the landing gear switch on the controls of the tug. \u0022Better?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yeah! Docked, deploying the drills! Whoa!\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022The whole rig together with this side of the tug was lifted as the drills deployed. We\u0027ve got 4.8% ore and starting drilling. I\u0027ll open the gigantors now and start the ISRU in a moment.\u0022\n\n\u0022Great.\u0022\n\n\u0022Wait, Val.\u0022 Bob interrupted. \u0022That\u0027s asking for trouble.\u0022\n\n\u0022How so?\u0022\n\n\u0022The drills aren\u0027t meant to lift that much mass. Now that the tug is nearly dry, they can keep its weight up, but once the tanks are full, they will simply collapse under the weight.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, there\u0027s one simple solution for that.\u0022 Valentina toggled the landing gear switch again.\n\n\u0022Whoa!\u0022 Trazy shouted over the radio. \u0022I\u0027m now hanging off the side of the tug!\u0022\n\n\u0022And that\u0027s how it\u0027s meant to be. Supported by rear wheels and the landing legs. The drills still sit deep enough to gather ore, don\u0027t they?\u0022\n\n![screenshot142.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot142.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T16:25:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T17:25:59Z","Content":"Trazy kept grinning like crazy. She looked at a photo pinned in the cockpit of the rig.\n\nLeeliana, Gima, Michelle and her on Minmus. And Midra, but they never really clicked, Midra being an introverted loner. And Long Way, the craft playing shenanigans with the reaction wheel.\n\n![2015-07-02_00004.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-02_00004.jpg)\n\nLeeliana, Gima, Trazy and Michelle all came from different backgrounds, worked for different firms, all in space industry, but they all shared the same fate: an accident, getting stranded in space in a husk of craft, with diminishing supplies, and then being saved by an automatic probe, a SavingKlaw. Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts manufactured these small unkerbed crafts in bulk and would deliver a batch to the orbit now and then. Then whenever a kerbal was stranded, one SavingKlaw would detach from the delivery hub, arrive at the husk, then deliver it safely to Kerbin surface with help of abundance of airbrakes and parachutes.\n\nThen each of them would have a talk with Jebediah, and enchanted by his charm and charisma, not to mention a promise of very decent salary and reasonable work conditions, they\u0027d accept the job offer at KSC.\n\nThe four became good friends during the month they spent all across the Kerbin system, first a visit to Mun orbit, then a trip outside Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, then a landing on Minmus before return to Kerbin. They spent the time studying together, and learning more than they\u0027d ever learned in their previous jobs.\n\nNow was the time to put their skills to a test. And the remaining three friends would arrive soon.\n\n![crew.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/crew.png)\n\nAny hour now...\n\nShe looked with worry at the deepening shadows.\n\nDusk was coming."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T18:45:56Z","Content":"\u0022Liftoff!\u0022\n\nThe two vehicles on a common carrier soared into the sky, gaining speed rapidly. Michelle held the rudder steadily, in a gentle gravity turn. Soon the white streaks of condensation were replaced by full-fledged flames as the vehicle crossed the upper atmosphere.\n\n![screenshot146.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot146.jpg)\n\nThen the flames went out and stillness of open space embraced them.\n\n\u0022Canyons...\u0022 Gima muttered. \u0022Are you sure you can land in a canyon?\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s really no harder than landing in open field.\u0022 Michelle muttered as she prepared for the orbital insertion burn. She held the throttle gently, observing the numbers on the screen, allowing time to apoapsis crawl towards zero at a tenth of normal pace. Three mainsails in the rear sent vibrations through the ship. The digits of the periapsis entry raced up, from deep negatives. As they reached the magical \u002275,000\u0022 she rapidly cut the engines. \u0022So, the point of no return girls. These things have no parachutes.\u0022\n\n\u0022Do it,\u0022 said Gima.\n\n\u0022We trust in you,\u0022 confirmed Leeliana.\n\nMichelle pressed the stage button. A clang, explosion of separation charges, a jerk forward, and the transfer stage with the two cars drifted forward, leaving the Cygnus class launch stage behind.\n\n---\n\n\u0022Are you sure you can do it?\u0022 Gima kept worrying, looking as right in front of their vehicle the sun was hiding behind the horizon of the Mun.\n\n\u0022Hush,\u0022 Leelana calmed her. \u0022Let Michelle concentrate.\u0022\n\n\u0022Look, Gima.\u0022 Michelle turned to her friend. \u0022I can\u0027t guarantee I\u0027ll land close to Trazy, but I promise we\u0027ll land in one piece.\u0022\n\nGima just sat down closing her eyes.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m not doing anything crazy. We have a plenty of fuel, we have well enough thrust, and two reaction wheels that can keep this baby upright at all times. I\u0027ll do it gently and carefully.\u0022\n\nThe last of the Sun vanished behind the horizon and only lights of screens and controls lit up the cockpit.\n\n---\n\nMichelle cursed. Other than the distant diamond of a marker of Tracy, the screens were black. Not a dot, not a shade of terrain. She checked the map once again. If she squinted, she could make out the shape of the canyon and the ship icon was overlapping it, with the middle somewhere in the middle of the canyon. She really wished for \u0022hot spots\u0022 on these icons.\n\nA steady descent of around ten meters per second, altitude above terrain around 1000m. Horizontal speed... 15m/s. Too high, but the ship was tilted lightly and the horizontal speed was bleeding off rapidly.\n\nIt was a third approach, one where Tracy was finally reasonably close, and Michelle was reasonably sure she was landing in the canyon. She watched the vertical speed and vertical acceleration markers, staying steadily at 10 and near 0 respectively. The absolute altimeter clicked its ten meters every second. The two friends sat in the passenger cabin, strapped on.\n\nMichelle glanced at the radio-altimeter again. 600. That\u0027s fairly fast for the time it took. Horizontal speed 12m/s. The vertical speed grew to 12m/s and Michelle took time to first bring it back to 10 and then make the acceleration return to 0. Horizontal speed 10m/s, nothing to worry about. Altitude... WHAT? Altitude 30 meters?! How?! When?!\n\nShe pushed the throttle to the bottom. Three seconds should be a plenty to reverse.\n\nThen there was an explosion, not even a second later. The constant hush of the Poodle died down and Michelle found herself in freefall. Then a bump, a rapid roll, then in the pitch darkness the rover hit the surface nose first, and pivoted sending the fuel tank forward. Another bump, another roll. Screams of Gima could be heard.\n\nThe vehicle dug its nose into the Munar dust once again, faster this time. They were falling down a very speed slope, rolling. For a moment Trazy considered decoupling, but then she\u0027d risk the tank crashing into them. Again, they were falling, away from the slope, the tank pivoting under them. Then a loud explosion shook the ship, the stressed tank exploded. Now the two cars just bundled together by two decouplers and a bar rolled down.\n\nThen several more bumps and everything came to a standstill. There was only darkness and sobs of Gima. Michelle realized the munar gravity pulled on her again - sideways this time. She breathed heavily in the dark."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T21:50:19Z","Content":"She took a minute to recover, then she reached for the \u0022decouple\u0022 button. The bar with the two decouplers fell away.\n\nThe crew/experimental car rolled onto its roof. She tried switching control to it to open the cargo bay doors. No such luck. Why? Oh, because it had no probe core or cockpit of any kind. \u0022Smart move, Bob.\u0022 Michelle cursed.\n\nShe tried the reaction wheel of the tourist/driver car. It swung a little, to and fro. Some more swinging, a small prayer about not rolling over, and the craft suddenly tipped onto its wheels. She grabbed the rudder and turned it around slowly.\n\nThe shape of the crew module loomed in the darkness, barely visible. She knocked into it, trying to push it over. Nope, no such luck. She backed off, then accelerated rapidly. The move lifted the nose of her car, and it slammed into upper part of the one tipped over. This time it worked, the vehicle rolled to a sideways position. One more bump and it landed on its wheels. She maneuvered around it and very carefully docked the claw to its docking surface.\n\n\u0022Michelle...\u0022 sounded Lee from the cabin behind. \u0022Would it inconvenience you much if we switched the lights off?\u0022\n\nMichelle took a swift breath and started clicking the switches one after another. Soon all windows of the two cars lit up brightly, pushing the oppressive darkness away. She exhaled.\n\n\u0022Train-one, do you read me?\u0022\n\n\u0022This is Train One. I read you. We have landed.\u0022\n\n\u0022Congratulations! Make your way to Train-three.\u0022\n\n\u0022Thanks for nothing,\u0022 Michelle muttered. \u0022Acknowledged. Heading towards Train-3 mark.\u0022\n\nShe activated the driver controls and started the vehicle. It took her only a moment to realize the trailer was... trailing, at an angle. She said a small prayer to Squad the Krakenslayer and pressed the \u0022release pivot\u0022 button.\n\nEverything was going alright until she corrected her course. The motors of the trailer wheels pushed, and the front car turned entirely to a side. She tried to straighten it up, but the vehicle refused to cooperate, sliding at an angle. Five minutes of fiddling with motors, steering control, and it was clear the two vehicles were firmly stuck.\n\n![screenshot148.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot148.jpg)\n\nA short prayer again, and she pressed the klaw release. It sat there, at a weird angle. She moved her car to the front of the other one, setting it centrally and began backing up. The rapid movement made her car make a stoppie, rising its back up, and... it stayed like there.\n\nShe tried the reaction wheel. She tried to turn the wheels.No effect whatsoever. Only now, with the back raised high \u0022up in the air\u0022 (except it was vacuum) she noticed one of the rear wheels was busted. But currently she was slowly descending into a panic attack. The legendary Kraken\u0027s \u0022Freeze Attack.\u0022\n\nMaybe, just maybe the car could be pushed? Maybe the wheel could be fixed?\n\nShe pressed the comms button. \u0022Train One to Train Three, do you read me?\u0022\n\n\u0022Michelle?! I thought I saw lights!\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, Trazy! We... um, could really use your skills. I really hate to ask you to come at night, but... we\u0027re kinda in a pinch.\u0022\n\n\u0022Coming right up!\u0022\n\nNot a minute passed when the hiss of monopropellant hitting the surface of the car broke the silence.\n\n\u0022There, the wheel is fixed\u0022 sounded from the comms.\n\n\u0022Can you give me a push?\u0022\n\n\u0022One push coming right up!\u0022\n\nThere was a bang on the shell of the rear. Then the comms came to life.\n\n\u0022Heeeeeeelp!!! I\u0027m falling!\u0022\n\n\u0022Tracy! What\u0027s going on? How are you falling? Is there some hole there?\u0022\n\n\u0022No! This stupid... Ouch. Ow. This stupid jetpack! Ouch! I hit the car, fell over, and it reset the vertical direction! It\u0027s keeping me on my side! Ow! Ow! I can\u0027t stand up! And there\u0027s the incline and I\u0027m falling!\u0022\n\n\u0022Try to... I don\u0027t know! Try the side thrusters?\u0022\n\n\u0022Ow, ow, no, I\u0027m still tumbling! Ow.\u0022\n\n\u0022Try to stop!\u0022\n\n\u0022The moment I stop, I\u0027m falling on my si... ow... my side, and start tumbling again!\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027ll ask KSC to reset your jetpack!\u0022\n\n...switching to KSC...\n\n\u0022Bill, do you know how to reset a jetpack?\u0022\n\n\u0022Not a clue!\u0022\n\n...switching back to the train.\n\n\u0022Oh Thank Squad it\u0027s back to normal! They are true miracle workers!\u0022\n\n\u0022Okay, Tracy. Don\u0027t risk anymore, just come to us, there\u0027s a plenty of room, and we\u0027ll go to your rig in the morning...\u0022 whispering, she added \u0022I hope.\u0022\n\nMoments later the airlock hissed, and Trazy jumped in. The four friends hugged, exchanging greetings.\n\nFinally, the two scientists sat back in the cabin, and Trazy joined Michelle in the cockpit.\n\n\u0022So, as you see, we have quite a situation Struck by Kraken, we may need a replacement vehicle from Kerbin.\u0022\n\n\u0022Pffffbwahaha! Old Michelle believes in Krakens!\u0022\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t joke, Trazy! This is serious!\u0022\n\n\u0022Michelle, tell me, what does this display stand for?\u0022\n\n\u0022uh...\u0022 the pilot wanted to wipe sweat off her head but the helmet stood in the way. \u0022I\u0027m feeling so stupid now.\u0022\n\n\u0022Let me guess, the main battery is in the other car. This one has only the cockpit to keep the wheels powered, right?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yep.\u0022\n\n\u0022And I\u0027m surprised you still have light in the cockpit considering how thoroughly you killed its batteries.\u0022\n\n\u0022But the position? The stoppie?\u0022\n\n\u0022Check again, how much does an MK2 cockpit weigh? And two passenger cabins? This thing is so front-heavy it can stay in this position indefinitely! It was just your bad luck your batteries ran out at a moment like this!\u0022\n\n\u0022Trazy, you know, I\u0027m so happy to have you with us. So what do we do now?\u0022\n\n\u0022We go to sleep and wait for the lab to arrive in the morning. Aot last something good will come out of that risen rear. The lab\u0027s klaw is too high to grab us normally, but in this position it can! Then it will just open the gigantors and recharge us.\u0022\n\n\u0022Trazy, you\u0027re a genius.\u0022\n\n\u0022No, just an engineer. A very sleepy engineer.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T22:20:00Z","Content":"eh...
