Before getting the game I watched a lot of Youtube videos to give me an idea of what to expect from the game. Anyway I started out in sandbox mode and couldn\u0027t get my head around all the different parts, it was all too much. I made a few ships but other than just building ship after ship I wasn\u0027t sure what direction to take and felt a little lost. So I restarted in career mode and it all began to make sense to me then. Having limitations on available parts in my opinion makes the game more enjoyable and gives you goals. It will be good when they flesh out career mode some more and we have to actually buy parts, you\u0027ll really have to think then about building and the costs. Hopefully they\u0027ll also add in G-Force effects on the Kerbins, and oxygen supplies, food , water etc. Planning a mission to another planet would be much more in depth if you had to take supplies with you to survive, and not taking enough could mean you lose Kerbins which might impact other parts of the game, like recruitment for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arran","CreatedById":64656,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T14:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are moments i play KSP for days, even weeks in a row, then times i hardly touch the game..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETBH i hardly played KSP on between the release of 0.22 and only picked it up again at 0.23 release, just because i needed to give it a rest or i would start to dislike the game..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllways amazed how \u0022dedicated\u0022 some people are playing one game constantly, i can bring this up myself, and have to play several games.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently i\u0027m playing again alot of Skyrim and Planet Explorers, and playing other games often give me bright idears again for KSP to try, and then i start to play the game again..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my language there is an old saying \u0022Verandering van spijs doet eten\u0022 litterly translated, \u0022Change of meals makes you eat\u0022 what really applies to me with games \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T15:11:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my language there is an old saying \u0022Verandering van spijs doet eten\u0022 litterly translated, \u0022Change of meals makes you eat\u0022 what really applies to me with games \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn English that\u0027s said: \u0022variety is the spice of life\u0022.
