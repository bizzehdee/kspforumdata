But none of that is working, so it seems. But I think if there is a mass of hand written letters to your government, there can be a change. So I propose is that we, as a community of well informed people, write letters to the governments. Tell them that their children won\u0027t have children at this rate, that when they die we have to clean up, and tell them how to change it. Tell them different ways to produce clean energy, such as solar, nuclear, hydro, or wind power. It\u0027s a large investment, but it will pay off by them living through history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was my rant, and personally I think we as a mass can change.
