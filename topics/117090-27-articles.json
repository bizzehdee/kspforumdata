Less detailed (though, that could be a good thing), smaller (e.g. not 64% scale), and less powerful. Also continues the stock inaccuracies regarding engine geometry, with its complete lack of upper-end/combustion chamber, and poor representation of the gimbal mechanics (it doesn\u0026#39;t pivot in the right place, or even close to it; the pivot should be at the top of the MCC, NOT halfway down the bell).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNothing stopping you from making your own engine clusters using the stock KS-25 though.

Likely will end up doing most/all of those eventually (really only lacking good info on the Merlin). They all end up with a scaled bell diameter of \u0026lt; 1m, so should be acceptable for 1.25m use.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n0.625m engines will likey be filled in by \u0026#39;thrusters\u0026#39; such as the AJ-10 series (apollo SM, Shuttle-OMS, Orion-SM-main engine). Perhaps some of the old \u0026#39;missile\u0026#39; motors as well; I\u0026#39;ll see when I get there :)\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T21:13:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 09:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T22:00:18Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Shadowmage\u0027]Sadly there is no -actual- information on the HG-3, as it was never produced or even progressed past the \u0026#39;idea\u0026#39; stage.
