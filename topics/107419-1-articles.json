If you have a scientist to reset the experiments, this means that you only need one of each experiment, and can just keep re-using said experiment by taking the data and resetting it.\n\n To send the data back to kerbin, send a recovery craft with a crew compartment (doesn\u0027t need to be manned, you just need the crew component), have the kerbal on your base do another EVA, take the data from the crew compartment, move the kerbal to the recovery craft, place the data in the recovery craft\u0027s crew compartment, then get the kerbal back to your mun base.\n\nThe data is now in your recovery craft, so you can lift off and return the craft to kerbin and get the data.\n\nEDIT: oh, you meant surface samples, not experiments like goo. never mind, then.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T20:38:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish**"}]}
