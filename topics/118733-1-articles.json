If that first sentence doesn\u0027t draw you in than this obviously isn\u0027t the book for you. This thread is designed for people who want to discuss the novel Seveneves in all of its glorious intricacies. From the destruction of the moon, the effort to preserve the human race in space, the ymir expedition, and so so so much more! This book is a treasure trove of nerdy goodness and I highly recommend it. This is a SPOILER thread! So please if you don\u0027t want the book to be ruined please stop reading. So please discuss........\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone built \u0022IZZY\u0022 circa the time the moon blew up? With a Torus and Amalthea attached to it?

Thanks\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveneves is on par with The Martian. I find it better only because it is so satisfyingly long. When I was done I was hugely satisfied and that almost everything I wanted to be covered was. However the world the Stephenson created can easily be expanded in multiple entries and become an incredible Sci Fi series of books. If he could do that HBO could and undoubtedly should make a series out of it. Not a bad idea considering GOT only has about 2 or 3 seasons left. Honestly the first book alone is capable of being three or even four seasons. But that is just me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T00:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI very much enjoyed the first two parts of this book.

However by itself it would have been a lovely novel onto itself. When it comes directly after parts one and two its tough. For me I made a mistake, I binge read for about 5 hours and reached part 3 at 2am after the awesome conclusion of part 2 and I just couldn\u0027t get into it. So stopped reading and it took me days to finally get back into part three because I knew what was coming and part two was so good and knowing that it was over it was tough to get back. However! You are correct but if you treat each part as a different book you have a very compelling and satisfying trilogy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T07:14:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing a binge reader if this was a 3 part series I would be so annoyed, even though the last part wasn\u0027t as good as the first two it was still an entire story which I am so happy about.

The first two parts were incredibly depressing.

Meaning that easily I would say no enhancements because we aren\u0027t on the verge of the entire loss of our species. So I would have to say that perseverance and or work ethic. Now because the first new generations would have no choice but persevere and have strong work ethics it might seem unnecessary. But I would want my progeny to never be complacent. Never be satisfied. Now down the road that might come into conflict with the other offspring, but in terms of propagating the species I think a strong and unwavering work ethic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
