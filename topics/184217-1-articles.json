And I wonder if that will be sufficient.

Duna\u0027s atmosphere is much thicker than Mars\u0027 and will slow you down a good deal. Landing with chutes will only require very little fuel for a soft touchdown, and possibly none at all. Assuming 300m/s for that purpose is positively generous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always, terminal velocity depends on how heavy and draggy your vessel is (a lump of iron falls faster than a sack of feathers). As a first approximation, expect to fall twice as fast as on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure to tweak your chutes to toggle at low pressure and fully deploy at higher altitudes than you would on Kerbin. Also make sure to bring a drogue chute -- there\u0027s a decent chance that your main chute won\u0027t deploy in time because you\u0027re still going too fast, that\u0027s more common on Duna than on Kerbin. A single drogue makes all the difference in that case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that chutes are heavy and have diminishing returns. It\u0027s certainly worthwhile to bring one or two, but if you find yourself tiling the lander with chutes, have a good sharp look and ask yourself if 500kg of extra fuel won\u0027t be more useful than 500kg of chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for Queastion2: I\u0027d need to look up the formula, but the inputs are available: The game tells you the effective diameter of your chutes (assume a circular disc), and you can look up the air pressure on Duna in the tracking station or (better) the Kerbal wiki. Finally your vessel weight in local gravity. From that you should be able to calculate the airspeed where drag equals weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-04T12:16:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2019 12:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Laie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FloppyRocket","CreatedById":173990,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-05T04:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy experience (which is small) is that Duna\u0027s atmosphere is weak and is only significant if you are landing at very low altitudes.
