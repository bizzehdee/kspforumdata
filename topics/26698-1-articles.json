Getting the RCS thrusters properly placed around, or at, the center of mass helps more than anything, I think. But it can be tough to figure out when you only have a partial fuel load, or you are moving several components around. My only other advice is to do everything with CAPS lock on, and always work in the chase view so that your movements are always consistant and predictable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mereman","CreatedById":58191,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T15:16:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the messages.
