This will be confusing as hell for new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they go with shape determining aerodynamics and where forces are applied, but then artificially stabilize it based on the vehicle\u0027s orientation to make things easier, they\u0027ll limit players to a set group of \u0022correct\u0022 designs, far more than FAR or NEAR currently do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen besides that, maybe I\u0027m alone in this, but leaving a rocket flying vertically to get out of the thick souposphere for a minute while I walk away to get a donut is not my idea of fun.
