The atmosphere is actually very gentle and forgiving -- it\u0027s just molecular hydrogen, really. The coldness of the atmosphere absorbs a lot of heat. The atmosphere has the consistency of honey. You decelerate to subsonic very quickly --\u00A0and continue to decelerate to below 200 m/s unless you light your engines and maintain a severe nose-down and very low drag attitude.
