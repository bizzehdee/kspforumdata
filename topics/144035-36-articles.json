Tropical Storm Ramon has formed in the EPac out of the Central American Gyre, and Invest 90L (also from the gyre) is likely to develop today. Most forecast models agree that 90L/Future Nate will pass by the Yucat\u00E1n Peninsula after bringing heavy rain to Honduras/Nicaragua, then striking Louisiana\u0027s Gulf Coast. Rapid intensification seems likely among the 29-30 degree Celsius waters of the western Caribbean. However, one of the GFS modes suggests something interesting: Future Nate may split into TWO tropical cyclones while in the Gulf.

The latter two don\u0027t predict much for Ophelia, which is in direct contrast with the NHC forecast and the other three models. HWRF predicts Ophelia reaching 100 knot (115 mph) winds with a minimum pressure around 970-965 mbar. HWRF-P predicts a maximum intensity of 110 knots (130 mph) and ~960 mbar, and the HMON model is the most extreme - 130 knot (150 mph) winds with a pressure around 950 mbar or less.
