Let\u0027s listen now (actually let\u0027s listen several minutes in the past, given the distance to Jool) to the conversation between our brave Kerbonauts...\n\n![Ko6GD2U.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ko6GD2U.png)\n\nTeddorf: *Course correction complete. Approaching Laythe aerobrake. Hey, Shepner, did you know we\u0027re coming in retrograde?*\n\nShepner: *Clockwise, counter-clockwise, what\u0027s it to me? You guys didn\u0027t even give me a window!*\n\nWalter: Joining me is Kris Kolumbus, chief navigator of the Redemption mission. Kris, what is the significance of a retrograde orbit?\n\nKris: Well, Walter, if one is *prograde*, one is going *with* the rotation of the central body, else one is going *against* it.\n\nWalter: Yes, that sounds perfectly boring Kris, thank you.\n\nKris: But the delta V between the two orbits amounts to twice the rotational velocity of the central body at the surface, which can be signifi...\n\nWalter: We now return to the audio feed from Laythe.\n\nTeddorf: *Over 8000 m/s, higher than planned. G forces building. You ok back there, Jerski?*\n\nJerski: *The lander\u0027s A-OK, Teddorf. Just get me into a reasonable orbit, and I\u0027ll get to Songel and Laythe IF (heh, One-Eff, IF, ironic, eh?).*\n\nShepner: *I\u0027m fine.*\n\nTeddorf: *Who cares, Mr. Retrograde?*\n\n![Pn3BxRq.png](http://i.imgur.com/Pn3BxRq.png)Teddorf: *Orbit achieved. Jerski, go ahead and top off your tanks and undock.*\n\n![i9IfzP2.png](http://i.imgur.com/i9IfzP2.png)Jerski: *Ascension is undocked, deorbit burn plotted. The retrograde orbit seems to have tumbled MechJeb\u0027s gyros. I\u0027m going in manually.*\n\n![t0U6704.png](http://i.imgur.com/t0U6704.png)Jerski: *Looks like this is going to be pretty good.*\n\n![lhfAJ75.png](http://i.imgur.com/lhfAJ75.png)\n\nJerski: *Good chutes. I see One-Eff!*\n\n![PscNSTL.png](http://i.imgur.com/PscNSTL.png)Songel: *I\u0027m seeing things!*\n\nJerski: *You\u0027re not seeing things, buddy, that\u0027s your ride home!*\n\n![bdZBmpg.png](http://i.imgur.com/bdZBmpg.png)\n\n![TrJDJQd.png](http://i.imgur.com/TrJDJQd.png)\n\n![DeC3CP7.png](http://i.imgur.com/DeC3CP7.png)\n\nJerski: *Songel\u0027s on board, and we\u0027re ready to lift!*\n\nKris: Stand by, Ascension. Control has a concern. Do NOT lift off!\n\nWalter: What\u0027s the matter, Kris? \n\nKris: It\u0027s as I feared, Walter. The retrograde approach cost over 100 m/s in required delta V, given *perfect* pilot technique. Since (Kris covers his microphone and whispers) MechJeb can\u0027t be relied on, retrograde, and Jerski is no MechJeb (uncovering microphone) the actual delta V loss was MUCH higher. No matter how many times I hit F9, I can\u0027t see a way to get Ascension into orbit, given its current fuel load.\n\nJerski: *Control, part of that was unreadable, but I understand that Ascension is stranded?*\n\nSongel: *You did bring snacks, didn\u0027t you?*\n\nKris: I\u0027m sorry, Ascension, but you are correct. I\u0027m afraid Redemption must make another round trip to Jool.\n\nJerski: *Shepner, does retrograde make a difference now? It sure as !@#% does to ME!*\n\nShepner: *Alright, alright, I screwed up. Can I get a window seat on the way back?*\n\nKris: Redemption, I\u0027m uploading your return trajectory. You\u0027re going to use Tylo to boost you out of Jool orbit. We had been counting on the leftover fuel from Ascension, but...\n\n![Qe8zdzS.png](http://i.imgur.com/Qe8zdzS.png)\n\nShepner: *I get it!*\n\nTeddorf: *Upload recieved, Redemption go for Laythe escape.*\n\n![wUQkZVm.png](http://i.imgur.com/wUQkZVm.png)\n\nTeddorf: Looks like your numbers are good, Kris. Approaching Tylo.\n\nKris: KSC tracking confirms, Teddorf. Looking Good.\n\n![BOyCWkE.png](http://i.imgur.com/BOyCWkE.png)\n\nShepner: *I\u0027m not getting a window seat, am I?*\n\nTeddorf: *No.*\n\nJerski: *Hell, no.*\n\nSongel: *Tell me you brought snacks.*\n\nWalter: (Ahem) well, these are Kerbonauts, not saints, and just Kerbals, after all. Thank you for joining us at the media center in KSC for continuing coverage of KSS Redemption\u0027s mission to recover all Kerbonauts before the end of the universe (v 0.25)."}]}
