Almost any rover will float, so you have to design it to hydrofoil or hydroplane properly. On water, you may achieve a speed of 100 m/s, but that takes a fair amount of thrust. There is no way in hell you are going to maintain a speed of 20 m/s underwater, if you can even make a design that stays underwater (it\u0027s quite hard, and takes a lot of mass).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will have to refuel multiple times, so keep that in mind. And to do it, you will have to stop and wait for your refueling mission to fly a third of the way around Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn land, a\u00A0speed over 30 m/s will probably get you airborne going over the tops of typical hills, and if you don\u0027t have wings and good stabilizers, you will die. Rolling your rover is fairly common too, and the best designs can flip themselves back upright when it happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"W.

You can blitz around on Eve at 50m/s\u002B no problem. On Kerbin, you need downforce beyond around 40m/s or you\u0027re gonna be a bird when you go over hills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
