KSP2 is the chance to do this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027ve said before, I would rather have reasons to do things in places, opportunities to achieve goals of my own, rather than being mostly just the delivery guy. I want to be directing the program myself, more than being a service provider.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way contracts worked, especially before they started adding things like Researching in the lab always seemed like a cop out to me, in place of fleshing out the game fully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearly, in the world of the game, the contract offering organizations are achieving something through the results of what they ask you to do. Why can\u0027t your own organization (your space program) also achieve those things? I want to play proactively, not reactively.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m hoping the colonization mechanics and the hinted at requirement for reasources achieves this. Progression should be about achieving stuff in space, not ticking of arbitrary lists the game imposes on you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer mode really breaks the \u0027you vs the laws of the universe\u0027 by reminding you that you are playing a video game. It\u0027s not immersive. I play the game to feel like I\u0027m doing space stuff, something no other game can offer, and feel career should be contributing to that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want a fluid system of goals which you can meet in many ways, in any order you like, without external pressure. Just you vs the universe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer mode and science mechanics should be there to bring to life sides of the game which are still underdeveloped. I care very little about arbitrary tech trees, but love the idea of expanding kerbal knowledge of their universe, so I still play science. But I wish it was more of an experience than just point scoring and my own imagination. Breaking ground to me, was a great step in the right direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want science to be an experience, part of playing, not just a click to score points.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think KSP doesn\u0027t need a way for you to \u0022win\u0022, or even entirely \u0022complete it\u0022. Irl, space exploration isn\u0027t truly going to be over, it\u0027s going to evolve, and eventually become space civilization. There needs not be a game over, because it would be possible to put yourself in a position where you cannot continue due to poor planing, too many failures, and bad management.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer mode should make it feel like you are running an organization, managing the funds, planing the next steps, and all this should be done to achieve your own spacey goals. Running an organization is like a whole other design challenge, where a rocket needs to have stages\u00A0 sequenced, fuel to weight\u00A0 optimizated and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would be wrong to bog the player down with lots of budgeting and spreadsheets. But the economic aspect should at least be presented in a way that feels authentic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I\u0027ve always felt career is lacking. It does not bring to life this side of running a space program. OK, it does sorta, but only a little.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simplified scanning, science which is just delivering parts to locations, stuff like paying for kerbals as a one of... (if it still works like that?) really put me of career because it didn\u0027t have the same verisimilitude as the rest of the game. While not entirety realistic, most of the time it sorta made sense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimplification of the flight sim are usually omissions, like reaction wheel saturation or life support, rather than something which seems quite different to what might happen in real life, which is what a lot of the career mode seems like.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeeding to find something more common in space, because it\u0027s unaffordable to get from Kerbin? That makes sense. Can\u0027t use a part because earlier versions haven\u0027t been tested in enough space environments? That could also make sense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI argue that a regular payment, based on achievements / time, would be a much better way to fund the program, rather than just individual contracts. That\u0027s something I\u0027d love to see added.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would need to be balanced by having ongoing costs, and a need for more money should you expand operations, be they on the ground, or in space. Kerbals deserve a salary.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tech tree, contracts, or building the space center, should not be the main reason for players to go to space. Give us reasons to explore things to discover, changeable environments to monitor, and reasons to develop places for ourselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal could be far more than a building and flight game. It could also be a science game. And a perhaps even a proper tycoon game, like in the original pitch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo sum up, I wish for KSP2 to feel like less of like a fairly average game tacked on on top of a fantastic contraption builder\u00A0 and spaceflight sim, and more like a full space program, space exploration experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

different ways of enjoying the game, one thing that comes to mind for me is the concept of time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am still surprised that so many players \u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E just time warp until the current mission reaches it\u0027s destination.\u00A0 I have played some careers filling the time with other missions, but for the most part I like to play one mission at a time and I don\u0027t even bat an eye at warping ahead several years if that is the next interesting point in the mission.\u00A0 It always seemed to me that the designers had that in mind when they put the game together.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom what I read, I am in the minority as far as the way I think about time and time warping.\u00A0 I am very pleased that the game allows for both play styles and is open enough that it accommodates players who enjoy approaching the game in very different ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always thought that if time was to become a more significant factor, the economics would be a way to do that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor instance if there were monthly operating costs for \u003Cabbr

I just mentioned this exact idea on the other thread. As in, for casual players, the \u0022other\u0022 space programs/Kerbals could help you progress when you hit a wall. You could sit in on their launches/stations/habs. See where/when they get there, and for cash/lower points buy their \u0022tech/science\u0022 for those who don\u0027t want to go to Moho/Jool/Eelo for the normal tech tree/science/progression... you could even just leave timewarp on and watch the AI complete all the missions (probably just auto complete them \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0) . You\u0027d \u0022skip\u0022 to the end of the tech tree. You\u0027d not get points, but it would allow you to start at any point in the game history. A bit like choosing 1950s/60s/70s etc, or 90s/00s/10s or even now. Choose early career, and you get small rockets, ICBMs etc... choose mid and you get shuttles. Choose late, you get SpaceX style re-use. Choose future, you get the high tech stuff. Not \u0022cheating\u0022 just choosing the starting states.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-06T10:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223667746\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221567762465\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002281780\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bartybum\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n29 minutes ago, Bartybum said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolute, holy crap.
