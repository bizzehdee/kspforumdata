Both XBone and PS4 were inferior to any modern gaming PC even before they launched. The situation was, IIRC, slightly different with X360 and PS3 when they first launched, but since then the PC has had more raw power than any console. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, every console is identical, which makes development easier. You don\u0027t need to worry about whether it has an Nvidia or AMD GPU, you don\u0027t need to worry about what features that GPU provides, you don\u0027t need to worry about how many cores it has or what instruction sets those cores have. The software load is more predictable as well, the console is running its OS and the game, nothing else. A PC will be running some version of windows or other OS, and potentially dozens of applications which will compete for the same resources the game needs. All that makes it easier to code a game that makes best use of the consoles capabilities. Of course, PC games can overcome all those problems, but if the publisher sees the PC as an easy bonus platform for a few more sales, rather than a valid platform in its own right, then they won\u0027t pay for the port to be done properly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T22:38:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Econsoles are pretty much optimized to run games. while their cpus are somewhat dated, their memory is top notch, better than what pcs have. then throw on top of that low latency design. there are no sockets to go through, and the memory is located as close to the cpu/gpu as the board layout allows. the other major difference is software, consoles act more like old dos computers, simple os which can run only one application at a time. a pc has a compex os that can do many things at once, and its really hard to talk directly to hardware, so you go through apis and that tends to slow things down a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epc memory doesnt seem to be evolving at all anymore. my last 3 builds used the same ddr3 1600, and my new one as well. the only way left to lower latency is to physically locate the ram closer to the cpu die. i figure its only a matter of time before start seeing memory moved onto the cpu package to get better latency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-22T22:43:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2014 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T23:54:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPC Memory not evolving?
