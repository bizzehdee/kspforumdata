Understand the config file format. If you have any programming experience, it will likely make a sort of innate sense to you, but if not, it might not be immediately apparent what you are looking at... In that case, think of it like a large bag that can store smaller bags, which themselves can store smaller bags and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a format of nested \u0022nodes\u0022. A node is an element that contains other elements, including other nodes. Nodes are usually written in CAPITAL letters and followed by curly brackets. The brackets denote where a node opens, and where it closes again. Each config file starts with a top level node, of which there are several different types in KSP. But if you want to make or edit a part, the top level node is simply called... you guessed it, PART { }.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately the node format is also a little inconsistent in places. Take the following example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EPART {\n    MODULE {\n        name = ModuleEnginesFX\n        PROPELLANT {\n\n        }\n        atmosphereCurve {\n\n        }\n    }\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, you see the top level node opening a PART. The top level node contains another node, called MODULE. However, in contrast to PART, which always does the same thing, MODULE is multipurpose. You need to tell KSP what kind of MODULE you want it to be. In this case, you tell it that it is an advanced engine MODULE by giving it the name \u0022ModuleEnginesFX\u0022. Why would you not simply open a node named MODULEENGINESFX { } instead? I don\u0027t know, ask Squad! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0 And to make matters worse, while one of the two subnodes of ModuleEnginesFX obeys the rule of the thumb that nodes are usually capitalized, the other does not! Ultimately, you\u0027ll just have to memorize and roll with these idiosyncracies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe important part is that you realize that a part is nothing more than a top-level PART node that contains one or more subnodes which help define what kind of part it actually is. In addition to other nodes, a node can also contain any number of \u0022fields\u0022. In the example above, \u0022name = \u0022 is a field. Most parts tend to have a lot of fields. Many more are also hidden away in Physics.cfg in your KSP root directory; they are applied globally to all parts, but individual parts can override them if necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome documentation about which nodes and which fields exist can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut honestly, you might as well just examine the config files of similar parts. Pretty much all the things have names that make it immediately clear what they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd at the end of the day, all nodes close their curly brackets again when they are done. The indentation in the example above is intentional, to illustrate that you must close everything in the proper order. Forgetting a bracket will mean your part will not even load. Get in the habit of immediately writing both brackets when opening a node, not just the opening bracket, and then hit enter a few times to move the closing bracket downwards and give yourself room to work. That way, you can never forget any brackets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) And the second point is, understand \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-105\u0022\u003EModuleManager\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s syntax. Because when you do edit existing parts, you should \u003Cem\u003Enever ever\u003C/em\u003E edit the original config file directly. Instead, you write a patch that targets that particular part and, \u0022at runtime\u0022 (while KSP is already running), dynamically replaces stuff in that part. ModuleManager documents all of its own syntax with examples in the first couple of posts in its thread, so that\u0027s where you should go to study it, but to give you a very rough idea:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s all the same nodes and fields from above again, just targeted!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay you want to edit an existing part called examplePart. That part, obviously, has its own config file that starts with a PART { } node, and that node includes a field called \u0022name = examplePart\u0022. So what you do is write (in a new file) the ModuleManager command for \u0022edit\u0022, which is the character \u0022@\u0022, and then you open the PART node... while at the same time, targeting it by mentioning its name in square brackets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would write: @PART[examplePart] { }\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd inside the curly brackets, you can then again do the same thing as you did before: you can write fields, or you can open additional subnodes. Everytime you prepend an @, it overwrites something that already exists with whatever you write down next; everytime you don\u0027t prepend an @, it adds whatever you write next to the part in addition to what\u0027s already there. You can also delete, you can say \u0022edit if existing, else create new\u0022, you can target nodes using search terms, you can define the load order of your patch, and so on and so forth. All this and more, you can learn in the ModuleManager thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you\u0027re there, worship the sarbian some! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T20:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Likasombodee","CreatedById":119111,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T19:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust tried that patch and now I got my hydrogen Vasimr!
