It would have acted as a mothership for the Tsybin RSR strategic reconnaissance fighter. It could be outfitted with skis but I used wheels that get jettisoned instead. Submarines would refuel it on the way.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is my first dedicated replica attempt but I did not follow the design exactly. I usually created inspired designs rather than actual replicas in the past. Unfortunately this design failed to achieve supersonic speed, topping out at around 230m/s (after unloading all its bombs and attached craft) at which point it started wobbling like a slinky.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/576820758907440824/EEE9AD02AC717F81FB65614876BBE83B8C0231F6/[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 missiles were used instead of a nuke. They can be guided if cycling craft and then piloting them using the stayputniks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/576820758907419644/F27D86F0FF8DE20CB278893CECE055EF9ED968EE/[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis craft had sort of lift engines (not quite VTOL) designed to unstick it from water during takeoff. I haven\u0026#39;t been able to find where the real ones were so I stuck 6 wheeslies which did the job.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/576820758907441959/3D64E62C39F082F61310E66EAB1118B5C5169BE4/[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\nRSR fighter armed with 2 smaller rockets.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/576820758907442295/44CA4DE53A03A4A0878B89D06DC15FAA2FCA8A79/[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n5 Jaguar engines.
