If the point of view was closer to the window, and there was a smaller, tighter instrument panel at the wery bottom of the sight, you could have a vision better than ever before, while seeing all instruments. Currently, you can only see a large panel full of large instruments, and the windows are just letting in some sunlight, so that you can see the instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
