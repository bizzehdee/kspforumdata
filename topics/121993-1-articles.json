I getting bored with regular Ksp, despite heavily using mods. I want to try RSS/RO (and all the recommended mods). The problem is, CKAN (what they recommend to use to install the complicated RSS/RO) doesn\u0027t work on Mac. Are there plans for a bespoke RSS/RO installer for any system (especially Mac). Or any other way, besides running around and installing RSS/RO one mod and dependency at a time. I don\u0027t want to use Mono, but I can use WineBottler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T22:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet mono.

Installing Mono and using CKAN is 100% worth it. Because of the various files which need to be copied, and because OSX sometimes has different copy behavior than Windows based systems, you really, really, really, want it to do it for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You will likely need to run at the lowest RSS texture settings (2048), depending on what version of OSX you are running. Even loading up RSS and NOTHING ELSE, will sometimes cause malloc errors with even 4096 textures, especially on OS 10.10. It\u0027s not a matter of the amount of RAM used, it\u0027s just a stability thing on certain systems. You can still crash with 2.0gb used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You will need to go through and manually delete a lot of unnecessary parts. Remember, OSX Unity has a higher base overhead than other OS\u0027s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T22:52:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually manually installed it and it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T23:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou type:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecd downloads\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emono ckan.exe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for future reference\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
