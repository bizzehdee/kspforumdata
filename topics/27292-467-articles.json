The other SRBs are pretty powerful compared to everything else you\u0027ve unlocked in the tech-tree, at the time that you get them, and they also have better TWRs (and thus shorter burn times). But the KD25k feels almost useless in normal play, unless you stack a lot of them on your rocket. They\u0027re meant to accompany the 2.5m and 3.75m parts, and yet the thrust is only equivalent to the Skipper (and I noticed in all of this, that the Skipper was nerfed at some point, since it used to have 800 thrust, but that\u0027s another topic).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI\u0027ve never really felt that way myself.
