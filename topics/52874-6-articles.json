E.G. The laplace resonance that exists between laythe, vall and tylo, along with tidal forces from jool, would be enough to heat the surface to just above freezing temperature. However this does mean quite a large amount of volcanic and tectonic activity. The oceans are most likely water containing salts (Which would decrease the freezing temperature), meaning that water would not be drinkable at first, but purifying it would be easy enough. The aforementioned tidal forces and tectonic activity would (most likely) create a suitable magnetosphere (When coupled with the atmosphere) to block out most radiation. This would make most of laythe\u0027s surface habitable, but probably not the uppermost regions of the land. This, coupled with a slightly high level of greenhouse gasses (Which I understand to be present, due to science reports and experiments on laythe\u0027s surface, along with the earlier discussion about jet engines) should be enough that a kerbal (Assuming that kerbals are in the least bit similar to humans)\u003Cem\u003E Should \u003C/em\u003Ebe able to survive with a decent gas-mask/respirator/air filter on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T23:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@ Brotoro: The devs have said that ksp is scaled down by approximately 1/11.

Or is the magnetic field generated by these much smaller planets supposed to be as strong as what is produced by a much larger planet like Jupiter (and if one contends that something the size of Venus is somehow making a magnetic field of such enormous strength, I want to know what unknown physics is being invoked to make it so).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow you are the one making assumptions just as you criticized others before for doing.

Penetrating radiation would be gone and thin lead would easily be enough to stop such particles.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, laythe, Jool, Kerbin, Duna and Eve all have strangely scaled atmospheres. If Laythe had a similar temperature to Earth, it should scale at about 10 km, much like Jool does. This means that the pretemperatureon the surface of any object other than Jool should cause the atmosphere to explosively expand. Laythe\u0027s new atmosphere would be only 0.32 atm at the surface and around 121 km high. Of course, if laythe had a temperature of around 115 Kelvins (-158 C) then its atmosphere would be as dense as it is now, but it would still only exert .32 atmospheres. Basically, we have a pressure, a scale height and a temperature that make no physical sense together. This means radiation must pass through somewhere between 3.2-8 tonnes of air per square meter on it way to the ground if it goes straight down.
