The chirps are shrill and aggressive. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E buzz sounds almost identical to a pulsating ground loop hum. This has been present for at least 6 or 7 years. I\u0027ve been trying to resolve this aggravating issue for that entire time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are not added by any mods; they appear in bone-stock base KSP. If you have never heard the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E sound before, drop \u0022Music\u0022 to 0% and listen. It\u0027s not a hardware issue -- it has happened on 8 different computers I\u0027ve used, without fail, on any install -- modded or otherwise. The hum ONLY appears in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/Hangar.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can mute them by dropping the Ambient volume slider to 0%, but this also mutes every single other ambient sound, like re-entry effects.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve edited the \u0022sound_ambience_nature.wav\u0022 with Audacity to mute the sound effect, but the game continues to blast this chirping noise as soon as I load any save. I\u0027ve deleted the file outright and it makes no difference. This audio is so loud, grating, obnoxious, and migraine-inducing that I open the Windows volume mixer panel before opening KSP, and I selectively mute KSP whenever I\u0027m at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or any building inside of it -- basically, unless I\u0027m actually flying a rocket at the time, the game is left muted. It\u0027s not an exaggeration when I say this is absolutely the worst thing in the game, specifically because I cannot find ANY method to resolve it -- in the UI, with a mod, or by deleting sound files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems that only a half dozen other people besides me have ever noticed this and been bothered by it. I can find only a handful of references in forums, and in every single one of them the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E is told it\u0027s a hardware issue. Googling the problem nets me only a few results outside of the forums, and all of them are either unresponded or the issue is blamed on hardware failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE help me find the source of this so I can \u003Cem\u003Efinally\u003C/em\u003E play this game without getting a headache from these aggressively terrible sound effects.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraktal","CreatedById":184990,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-12T08:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe [x] Science mod lets you mute these by right-clicking on the mod\u0027s button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"devikwolf","CreatedById":142118,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-12T16:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOH MY GOSH thank you!
