On Kerbin I have gotten fairly good at knowing about where in the stations orbit is best when to launch, but I\u0027d love it if there was a more calculated way to figure it out for better consistency. Any tips/mods/ that can help with this?

At the same altitude, my space planes launch as the target is about to leave the gulf to the West of the before mentioned sea. I favor a long low throttle gravity turn above 50 km, so I know an approximate intercept early enough that I can either stick around an atmospheric orbit longer to advance phase more, or insert to a higher orbit faster to fall back.
