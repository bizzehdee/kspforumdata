Most of the experiments just have an empty entry (to quiet warnings), although some have special flags to identify whether they are valid or not in certain custom situations (like requiring an atmosphere).\n\nUntil I get some documentation done, you can at least see the valid fields in the code [here](https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/blob/master/source/ContractConfigurator/Util/Science.cs#L77-L90).  The config serves a few purposes:\n\n1. To tie experiments to parts (to determine if the appropriate tech for performing an experiment has been unlocked).\n2. To tie experiments to building unlocks (again to see if it\u0027s unlocked)\n3. To support mods that make special situation/biome/body exclusions/inclusions in their own code so that Contract Configurator contracts don\u0027t show invalid ones (in your case that\u0027d be stuff like a Bio Drill experiment on the Mun).\n4. To completely exclude experiments that are just too specialized\n\nFor stuff like the SIGINT scan I\u0027d be inclined to just set ignored=true to prevent it from showing up (as supporting the special biomes would be more work, and you have your own contracts anyway).\n\nOh, and as far as the config files go, there\u0027s no special location or file names needed - just the config node names need to be correct."},{"CreatedByName":"Brucey","CreatedById":108628,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T04:14:37Z","Content":"I came across a mission for field research to do an experiment with a \u0022data camera\u0022.
