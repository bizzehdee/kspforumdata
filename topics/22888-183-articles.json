My guess is when 1.0.5 came out and everything switched over to a new model (I think that\u0026#39;s the word), the hatch portion was not figured into the mesh to be able to use it correctly. Though, the parts in them are still there, but is more or less eye candy until these hatches can be fixed to where you can have access to them and can remove and add equipment back into them. Another guess is that when the patch came out, this mod had to be fixed to be compatible, but wasn\u0026#39;t entirely fixed for functionality. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am sure this issue is being addressed and we will see it fixed when it gets fixed.
