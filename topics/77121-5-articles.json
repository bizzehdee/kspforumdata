Re-entry has no effect on them (unless you have DRE installed or similar). The only problem comes when, because they\u0027re decoupled high up, the separation between them gets over 2.5km in atmosphere which means you lose the other boosters. I suppose you could decouple them one at a time and ride each down individually while keeping your main vessel with a PE of over 25km (I think) so it\u0027s unaffeected by atmosphere while on rails (just be sure to get over 2.5km away before you hit atmo), but that PE for your boosters would be enough to deorbit them if they\u0027re your active vessel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, considering the time that would take, you might as well just install FMRS or something.
