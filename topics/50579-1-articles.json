That\u0027s actually what I tried first, but the incredible amount of disk space really turned me off. Bandicam is able to encode in real time no problem on my computer, so I was hopeful for it. The videos from it play fine on their own, and play fine in the Sony video editing software, until I try to overlap videos to do a crossfade. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I haven\u0027t tried any other editor software yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I liked about Bandicam was the ability to hide the mouse cursor.
