It seems like a fairing that would perhaps open like a flower or clamshell (pictured above), and could then close again would be useful. Does such a mod exist?

Then, the mod Old School Fairings so that in can shield the contents from the aerodynamic flow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T16:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems like the bones are already in stock, the shrouded docking port, for example.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T17:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can lock the shape of procedural fairing pieces and put them on Infernal robotics hinges.
