Orange suit means leadership responsibilities. Grey suits are minions. Wernher von Kerman will be assumed is in charge of mission control at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Junk in space is a big no-no. Lifters, stages, obsolete craft, derelicts and so on must at some point be de-orbited. Doesn\u0027t matter where, but can\u0027t be floating around in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pure refueling missions from Kerbin should be kept at an absolute minimum. Actually, entirely avoided if at all possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All craft must have a multi-mission capability. No one-off specialist craft. With two exceptions. Kethane probes and Kerbin to Station crew ascend and descend vehicles. Bases will be permanent though. Once set up, that\u0027s where they\u0027ll stay. Much like stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lifters will be standardized for a maximum of three models for getting low, medium and high mass objects into orbit. Lifters may evolve during the career, but a new iteration of a given model will make its predecessor obsolete and taken out of service for the remainder of the career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Medium and Heavy mass lifters will have launch restrictions. If a medium class lifter launches, the next medium/heavy launch must wait at least 10 days. If a heavy class lifter launches, next medium or heavy launch will have to wait at least 20 days. No restriction on light class lifters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If it\u0027s worth landing on or exploring, it is worth doing it manned. At least for the first time.

I got stuff to do, press conferences to hold, paperwork to fill out, new missions to plan, new vehicles to test...\u0022. \u0022Mhm, sure.\u0022 Bob and Gillo muttered, both knowing it was all just a bad excuse to as fast as possible slouch on the beach surrounded by his entourage of kerbalinas. \u0022So as soon as the tanks are full, we\u0027re off!\u0022. Bob and Gillo couldn\u0027t be more pleased. Melrod from from Ikeberg Kethane Rig however asked when they\u0027d come pick him up? \u0022Uhm, yeeees.

So long and thanks for all the Science! With full fuel load-out and nearly no cargo, she has 9100dV and change. Now due to Jebs eagerness to get back home to Kerbin, giving a green flying fart in fuel expenditure, the burn back to Kerbin uses roughly four times more fuel than if one had the patience to wait for the optimal transfer window. As it stands, there is about 4200dV to go on the Loki now that the burn is complete.

Mission got back to Kerbin after a long trek through what was mostly described as boring black stuff. Actually, nothing stuff. Getting close to Kerbin, it did get a slight bit intense though. The IPS Loki came screaming in at well over 7000 m/s. Due to the panic, no-one really remembers the exact speed, only that it was faster than any Kerbal ever traveled before. It took a couple of thousand Delta-V just to adjust the approach to a very hard aerobrake encounter with Kerbin. And that was not enough. Another thousand dV had to be blown to establish orbit. Then a lot to get into an equatorial orbit, and then get it all nice and circular. What was left was a bit under 400 dV, or about 5% of the capacity of the IPS Loki.

Then the Science Return Vehicle met up with the IPS Loki to pick up those all important science pods. Bob went down with the first load of three pods, and Jeb with the second load plus the surface samples from Duna and Ike. Combined it made for about 3000 science.

During a test-burn to heighten the orbit around Kerbin before going to Duna, a major weakness was shown in the mission design. The short of it being, the Duna Driller train is too long and the joints in it not all that stiff. During the test burn, it wobbled all over the place forcing a quick abort before something broke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than send up a service mission to truss and strut for more rigidity - potentially missing the launch window to Duna - it was decided to split the Duna Driller mission into two components. From the tail end, the KT Hrimfax will haul the Standard Fuel Cell (SFC) to Duna by itself and not be part of the train.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/ksp_0235/screenshot13_zps50a5ed4c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot13_zps50a5ed4c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis helped remedy the situation quite a bit. The Duna Driller train still wobbles like a drunk fish, but at least nothing looks like it is in danger of breaking off. After initial burn and first adjustment, the main train got some 70% fuel left with an ETA of about 185 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/ksp_0235/screenshot15_zps3f3ba05a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot15_zps3f3ba05a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe split off Kethane Truck and Standard Fuel Cell will arrive a bit earlier in 140 days and have maybe 80% fuel to go.

If his train is still wobbling when providing thrust from the locomotive (AS Hrym) at the front, he is pretty sure an aerobraking maneuver when at Duna, putting compression on the train rather than tension, is likely to break the entire thing apart. There should be enough fuel left over for a powered braking maneuver, though it does put a bit of a dent into the fuel budget. Good thing that budget is quite roomy - and at least the Duna Driller mission is not a return mission like Duna Discovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of his report, Bill noted a bit miffed \u0022Who forgot to put fuel lines between the main tank and the radial small tanks feeding the engines on the Assembler Ship Hrym?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate Year 2 Day 052\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout two weeks after Duna Discovery settled in around Duna, the Driller train came hurtling in as well. On a near polar orbit. So in addition to spending some 1200dV getting into orbit around Duna, another 300 and change had to be used to get an equatorial orbit. After that settled in for an orbit of about 180km to drop off the Base modules for later pick-up and then to a 130km orbit to park the Station module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/ksp_0235/screenshot41_zps1564bab6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot41_zps1564bab6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon after, KT Hrimfax dropped by to attach the Standard Fuel Cell, whilst the Assembler Ship Hrym met up with Duna Discovery to pick up the Science Lab and then later attach it to the Station.

Not seeing the surface before being some 10 meters above it is a bit more exciting than I prefer. They must have been low on coffee that day at KSC when assembling the Lander. All the rest of the design is pretty much spot on. Big wide spread on the landing-legs so that rough ground isn\u0027t really a problem. Set up in a triangular configuration for best stability with a really low center of mass - at least when the main tank is full.

A minor second adjustment burn is scheduled when about halfway to Duna in 70 days. ETA for arrival at Duna SOI is in about 160 days. A fair bit less than the initial 270 days our original course suggested. Decided the fuel situation was very good indeed, so used a bit more to get there earlier. Estimates show some 80% fuel remaining. Since all that is planned are minor adjustment burns from here on in, that should not change much as the main braking to get into Duna orbit will be done using aero-braking over several orbits to save fuel. So with a bit of luck, IPS Loki will have about 60% fuel left for the return trip even after refueling the Lander a couple of times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDuna Driller\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill is not a happy kerbal. During a test-burn to heighten the orbit around Kerbin before going to Duna, a major weakness was shown in the mission design. The short of it being, the Duna Driller train is too long and the joints in it not all that stiff. During the test burn, it wobbled all over the place forcing a quick abort before something broke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than send up a service mission to truss and strut for more rigidity - potentially missing the launch window to Duna - it was decided to split the Duna Driller mission into two components.

The Duna Driller train still wobbles like a drunk fish, but at least nothing looks like it is in danger of breaking off. After initial burn and first adjustment, the main train got some 70% fuel left with an ETA of about 185 days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/ksp_0235/screenshot15_zps3f3ba05a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot15_zps3f3ba05a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe split off Kethane Truck and Standard Fuel Cell will arrive a bit earlier in 140 days and have maybe 80% fuel to go.

If his train is still wobbling when providing thrust from the locomotive (AS Hrym) at the front, he is pretty sure an aerobraking maneuver when at Duna, putting compression on the train rather than tension, is likely to break the entire thing apart. There should be enough fuel left over for a powered braking maneuver, though it does put a bit of a dent into the fuel budget.

It suddenly dawned on Bob - he\u0027d forgotten to ask how much would be needed to get \u003Cstrong\u003Edown\u003C/strong\u003E there.

De-orbit burn complete, it was just a matter of being very sparse with the fuel, and use the parachutes to best effect. Still plummeting at a very scary speed, the lander-cans chutes was released first at about 5km up. At 4km the rest where released. At 1km Bob initiated the braking burn. Getting speed down to some 300 m/s. The cans chutes where then fully deployed, and when 500 meters from the surface, the rest of the chutes where fully deployed as well. So far so good. Descent stabilized at just above 8 m/s. Just a touch of thrust right before landing and contact was made at a rather violent 5 m/s. Well within the limits for the landing legs.

Must have excellent Atmospheric Delta-V and Thrust to Weight performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrototype:\u003C/strong\u003E An elaborate Asparagus design was chosen. An inner core with all the important stuff - Mk 1 Lander Can (most lightweight crew-pod), Ladders, Science gear, Solar Panels, Stabilizer, Battery, RCS thrusters, two small Monoprop tanks, a bit of fuel and a nuclear rocket. Surrounded by six stages, with four Aerospikes and two LV-T45 engines. The former for lift primarily, and the latter for some gimbal control. Dropped off in pairs. Next up is an outer layer of 12 tanks and Aerospikes, dropped off four at a time as they go empty. And finally Landing Legs and Landing Lights on a separate stage that is detached at lift-off from Eve. And of course, plenty of parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETest Results:\u003C/strong\u003E With Mitfry as the chosen test pilot, everything looked ok on the launch pad. Ladders extended and retracted fine. No problem climbing up or down. Well inside, lights worked ok, solar panels also. Some 5000 dV in atmosphere initially with an Eve Thrust to Weight of 1.27. But KSC is sure these readouts are wildly inaccurate, as it do not take into account the shedding of parts throughout the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test-flight should be a simple one just to test all the staging, and see what we are left with when in orbit. Then meet up with Odin Station, transfer over excess fuel, and perform an unmanned return of the lander for testing the parachute configuration of the remaining parts. Too dangerous letting Mitfry sit in the lander on the way back, so he\u0027ll take one of the pods already on Odin Station for the return trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/ksp_0235/screenshot47_zpsc6b9b34c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot47_zpsc6b9b34c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMade it to the Station without hiccups in the staging and having about 2500 dV in atmosphere to go - 5000 dV in vacuum. Wernher von Kerman is almost positively certain that will do. Assuming a landing really high up on Eve. Fuel transferred, with just a teeny bit left over for the de-orbit burn, Mitfry moved over to the one-man return capsule, which unlike the lander is tested and very safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing down, the landers chutes performed quite well, allthough three of the four attached to the Lander-Can had to be deployed manually. This slight flaw will be fixed. Final descent was at about 7 m/s. Not bad, but it was dry-weight. So an immediate decision to slap on more chutes in the next build was made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/ksp_0235/screenshot48_zps6daec92e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot48_zps6daec92e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving no landing-legs for this test, the touch-down was not entirely graceful.

Besides the Window for Eve not opening for a year and some 180 days. Meanwhile planning and building for both the M.I.S.S. (Mission Inner System Sojourner) and the Duna Colony is moving ahead at a comfortable pace. And in the efforts to secure fuel production in the Duna System, especially planetside as Kethane is pretty limited at the selected base site, some new technology had to be tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a new Station around Kerbin was born to test out producing fuel from vegetables. Those useless green things that some insist on decorating dinner with. It took three launches to get the thing up and running.

Two reasons for this. First, it requires a lot of power to run it. Three XL solar panels per greenhouse unit to be exact. High orbit means less downtime due to the home planet getting in the way. And second, it makes for a very nice place to top off the tanks of outbound interplanetary travels. It takes a ship about 800dV to get to the station. An expenditure of Delta-V it recoups when refueling there. So makes it possible to send off ships to other planets with a larger Delta-V reserve. Which is always a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel production is slow though. So the Station might be expanded by another greenhouse or two. Getting something similar up and running on the surface of Duna and the limitations daylight-hours pose, will be a challenge. For one thing, a new lander is needed that can handle both the weight and also position the things.

Especially since the engineers back at KSC was more concerned with getting stuff safely up into orbit and how it\u0027ll work once on Duna, and less about how they handle and maneuver. As with the Base Builder module that also got the extra fuel needed for the trip attached. Now, that fuel tank is full and weighs a ton. The Base Builder package on the other hand weighs practically nothing. Now guess which part of that cargo-module got the RCS thrusters?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1177.photobucket.com/albums/x347/zylark/ksp_0235/screenshot58_zpsd7c60464.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot58_zpsd7c60464.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually everything got properly docked on the rear of the Tyr. Now all that need be done, is for Wehfred Kerman who is on the IPS Tyr to secure the cargo by means of plenty of KAS struts. As for the other modules needed to be sent to Duna in order to build the first phase of the colony there, it is not quite yet decided if they will be on their separate train or if it makes sense to have it all attached to the IPS Tyr.

The IPS Loki came screaming in at well over 7000 m/s. Due to the panic, no-one really remembers the exact speed, only that it was faster than any Kerbal ever traveled before. It took a couple of thousand Delta-V just to adjust the approach to a very hard aerobrake encounter with Kerbin. And that was not enough. Another thousand dV had to be blown to establish orbit. Then a lot to get into an equatorial orbit, and then get it all nice and circular. What was left was a bit under 400 dV, or about 5% of the capacity of the IPS Loki.
