What I do mind is when they aren\u0027t internally consistent about it (Teleporting through shields for example) or when they use basic physics as a plot point and they get it wrong (Falling from the moon to earth in minutes in the latest movie springs to mind).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, I\u0027ll chuckle when the protagonist gets lost in space without fuel, only to land on a conveniently nearby planet with an oxygen atmosphere.
