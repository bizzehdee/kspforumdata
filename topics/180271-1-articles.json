I\u0027m on my second career playthrough and since i\u0027m really low on cash i\u0027m considering accepting the build mun base contract which will return 4x the investment cost\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever as i\u0027m fairly low tech and only play stock ,\u00A0i can\u0027t make it easily expandable for the later contracts \u0022expand x base\u0022 . I prefer to make real bases later when i unlock enough tech but i really really need that cash since i\u0027m going there anyways\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is : If i make a cheap \u0022single use\u0022 base just to satisfy the contract and destroy/recover it (to avoid future expand contracts)\u00A0what will happen? Will i still get the expand base contracts later even tho the base no longer exists? And if so will i be able to satisfy the contract by building a new base large enough to meet the requirements?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr the game will recognize the base as non-existant and just ask me to build a new one instead as if the 1st one never existed ?(i hope)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"overkill13","CreatedById":173506,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-03T01:57:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game should recognize that you no longer have a base and only generate create base contracts.\u00A0 Be careful as the game may generate an expansion contract while the base exists, and you will not be able to complete it after the base is destroyed, but you can just decline the contract or wait for it to expire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-03T11:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually solve this with a bit of role playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust make a super minimal base and call it an \u0022emergency shelter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a while, you\u0027ll have them all over the place, which is nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-04T03:05:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on the nature of the mission, sometimes you can land a ship on a body and so long as it has all the requirements of the base contract (usually a power generator, docking port, space for [X] Kerbals) it will count as\u00A0 \u0022base\u0022 for the purposes of the contract.\u00A0 All you need to do is let it sit there long enough to be considered stable (about ten seconds) and then you can take it back off again and return it to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if that is too much of a hassle (like if it requires more crew spaces than you can comfortably return) you can just land it once, then manually turn the vessel\u0027s ship type to \u0022Debris\u0022 when you go to rename it.\u00A0 The base will still stay there, but the simulation will treat it as a piece of debris and ignore it for contract purposes, even if it is still technically functional.\u00A0 It won\u0027t even show up in your tracking station unless you tell it to track debris.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-06T17:38:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2018 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Fearless Son\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Sheppard","CreatedById":193358,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-05T18:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever thought of turning a ship into debris that\u0027s actually a good idea\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinSalyer","CreatedById":192925,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-07T07:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on the mission types, I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-07T07:36:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2018 07:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by KevinSalyer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
