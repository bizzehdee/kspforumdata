That would be because KSPTOT doesn\u0027t actually know what time it is. However, it does know the location of the burn and the mean motion of the orbit, and from there it can figure out the time relative to periapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I don\u0027t understand your last question. In what way was the Moho burn off? In the program or in KSP? If it was in KSP, this was probably just the infinitesimal local gravity field assumption screwing up the burn a bit. You shouldn\u0027t be that far off, though. Try moving the maneuver node around with a maneuver node editor. I think I have a tutorial linked in the OP that explains how to do that a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arrowstar","CreatedById":2521,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T04:05:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi all,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to let you know that I\u0027ve restarted work on KSP TOT Mission Architect.
