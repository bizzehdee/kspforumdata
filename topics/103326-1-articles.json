Kipard: Thanks for the feedback. I think you\u0027re right that the rate of murder should be reduced pretty drastically, at the moment it\u0027s a pretty sure guarantee after they lose sanity that someone\u0027s going to get murdered after a little while, but I don\u0027t think I want to scrap that idea entirely. I think it can be entertaining, I mean, lots of books, tv, movies use murder as entertainment... Perhaps I could make it a setting so you can turn off murder, for someone looking for a less dramatic experience. I do plan some enhancements to that piece, I think it\u0027d potentially be fun one kerbal threw the other out of the air lock during a burn or something instead of just dying, and they could then be potentially rescued, though their sanity loss by being alone in space or on another planet until their rescue would make them a ticking time-bomb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re also right that the trial system needs to be modified, perhaps the only way someone could get away scott free would be if there were no comms devices on the ship and they were the only two on board. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I\u0027m off of mobile I\u0027ll take a look at the Kerbal Stats mod you mention, and yeah I think the connected living spaces and some of the other ideas code poet and others have put out sound like great additions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty new to this community but I\u0027m fully open to collaboration and connecting to things that people have already put out. I probably should have done more searching than I did before diving into this project to see what was already out there so I wasn\u0027t stepping on anyone\u0027s toes (I apologize to anyone out there if I did), but I kinda just had the idea in the middle of the night and cranked it out in a few days, as is often how I get started on things of this nature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that regard, I could definitely use some help on getting parts modeled if there\u0027s anyone out there interested in assisting me with that. I\u0027m not the most artistic person (more of a code monkey tbh \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E), and have very little experience with modeling and texturing, so it\u0027d probably be a pretty long time before I\u0027d have enough free time to really dive into that side of things instead of just reusing stock parts. My first plan is to implement the \u0022Brain-scan\u0022 part, which would give science data, control how much information you get as well as giving notifications about the kerbal\u0027s sanity. I had a kind of funny idea on what it could look like, but as I said, this may end up being a stock part until I get the time to focus on it for a while or find some other kind soul who could make it for me. Basically it could be a circular dome-shaped dark window looking thing and when you \u0022activate\u0022 it, you would see the top of a Kerbal\u0027s head in there and it would maybe glow or do some kind of scan-like thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may also incorporate other parts in the future for sanity and feeling management, but I kind of wanted the sanity management to be more based on how they felt towards the other kerbals than just adding more weight to the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn idea I just had for a mechanic you mention for reducing social tension was maybe allowing kerbals feelings to become less negative at some steady rate until they were indifferent when the kerbals spent more time apart from each other. This way, if things were getting volatile, the player could separate the two by doing EVAs or by putting them in separated parts of the ship (I think codepoet\u0027s connected living spaces mod may help with determining that). That could create an interesting game mechanic where you\u0027d have to manage who sits with who, but couldn\u0027t leave certain people alone for risk of losing their sanity and committing suicide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifying their stats somehow is an interesting idea, though I feel it may be outside the scope of this mod.
