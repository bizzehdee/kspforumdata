The coverage works by sampling 20 points on each celestial body. The points are distributed across the planet, but all within a -45 to 45 latitude (to be very generous and allow a tight network to be considered 100% coverage). The coverage system will place a fake satellite at each sample point, and ask RemoteTech if that satellite has a connection to back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this is pretty expensive. If I did a full coverage pass all at once (16 bodies * 20 points = 320 checks), it takes about 2-3 seconds on my machine. So it checks the coverage fairly slowly - it\u0027s rougly two checks every second, such that it takes a little more than two minutes to do a full pass. Oh and it can only do the checks in flight or in the tracking station - RemoteTech isn\u0027t active elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s why it can take some time before some contracts appear or before the contracts that rely on coverage get completed.

The stock system works by asking each contract class whether it can generate a new contract (it randomly selects which one to ask). Each class of contract has its own rules for when it can generate a contract, and how many are simultaneously allowed (although in 0.90 Arsonide was kind enough to expose the max count \u0022maxExistant\u0022 through GameData/Squad/Contracts/Contract.cfg).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract Configurator only has a single contract class, so I cheat this system a little bit by adding multiple copies of it to the stock selection list.

I was doing pretty high warp to get the contract to complete and it seems the RT couldn\u0027t update the connections to a new satellite fast enough. This would cause the timer to reset back to 2 days. Slowing warp down a notch fixed things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll see if I can change it to make it less sensitive to RemoteTech \u0022jitter\u0022 from satellite switching.... but it may be that on high time warp you\u0027re just going to get issues like this, sadly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood that it\u0027s working for you though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
