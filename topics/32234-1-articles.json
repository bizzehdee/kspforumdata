As they were late for a rendezvous with a lander, Lilly and Memer planted a flag and departed. Several days later, Bill Kerman returned to investigate. After using his RCS pack to approach and land near the structure, he was struck by some type of anomaly and slid down the mountain side, spinning like a ballerina on meth. Not one to be intimidated by the unknown, Bill used his RCS pack to attempt an airborne landing. On close approach, the structure appeared to be some sort of wormhole leading to an undetermined point in space (or, failing that, a clipping error):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/631908768472369304/DFEE56A0ED9ED4B34D24F3204A32A9F1C1113947//\u0022 alt=\u0022DFEE56A0ED9ED4B34D24F3204A32A9F1C1113947\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, on attempting to penetrate the structure, all telemetry with Bill was lost. Examination of downloaded long-range camera footage from his rover indicates that on entering the structure, Bill Kerman spontaneously exploded. The Kerbin Academy of the Sciences currently believes that he impacted with the exotic matter framework of the wormhole and was rotated out of our spacetime.
