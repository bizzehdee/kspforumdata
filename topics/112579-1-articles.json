If you have a huge base like that on another planet/moon, sometimes it gets eaten by kraken. In that case you have to load savefile. But if you progressed too far to go back, sometimes you decide to just copy VESSEL from an older savefile. But you don\u0027t know, that kerbal eaten by cracken is considered dead, and her name becomes available again. It\u0027s because kerbals are saved separately on the bottom of a savefile. Just find those Valentinas you don\u0027t need and delete from your savefile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
