I abandoned the large ones in favour of using the smaller ones, positioned as far out along the wing as possible. Use precision mode when flying (hit capslock). Mount your wings at an angle (hold shift and use WASD when building) such that the leading edge is higher than the trailing edge, if you are struggling to take off. Try to place the majority of the weight towards the rear of the aircraft, and the wings as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fp5zg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Fp5zg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grand Lander","CreatedById":31521,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T12:51:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELogically you have a little more on front then back in real planes but mostly balanced okay thanks didnt know WASD turn parts tHanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BillWiskins","CreatedById":12285,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T13:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI base none of my advice of real-world physics - just what seems to have worked for me.

I personally prefer planes that are balanced back to front (a little more weight at the front on takeoff may be helpful as fuel tanks drain from the top of the \u0027stack\u0027/most connections away from the engine). I would say build big and underpowered.
