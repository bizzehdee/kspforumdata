A stable orbit is not simply a circle around the planet, it is o.ly stable if no part of the orbit dips into the atmosphere, which ends at roughly 70km up. So a stable orbit is one which does not drop below 70km at any point. It sounds to me like the orbit was dipping into the atmosphere and eventually dropped below 25km, which is the point at which things disappear forever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T18:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHard to say without knowing exactly what the setup was.
