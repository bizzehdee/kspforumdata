MCE compatibility should be working fine in pre-release 4d of KCT. There is an issue when creating a new game and the first launch being a simulation. When reverted the backup isn\u0027t loaded because it doesn\u0027t exist yet, so you still get charged. I think you already know about this bug, but I\u0027m just letting you know. I think you can either go into the VAB, then go back to the Space Center, then back to the VAB once or you can just reset your MCE save after the revert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore to malkuth: I had a bit of trouble using the API as even when including the MissionLibrary.dll I was getting null references when calling the LoadBackup function without MCE installed (I realize that won\u0027t do anything, which was the point. The code needed to exist whether it was installed or not) And I also didn\u0027t see a function in the library to tell if MCE was installed or not (to only call the function if MCE was there). I ended up working around it in a way that also made it not required to include the MissionLibrary.dll with my mod. I\u0027ll provide my solution here for anyone wanting to use the MCE API without including the MissionLibrary.dll in their release (you still need to reference it in your dev environment though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KCT_Utilities I had these two functions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Epublic static bool MCEAvailable() //Check if MCE is available and return true if it is\u003Cbr\u003E        {\u003Cbr\u003E            Type MCE = AssemblyLoader.loadedAssemblies\u003Cbr\u003E            .Select(a =\u0026gt; a.assembly.GetExportedTypes())\u003Cbr\u003E            .SelectMany(t =\u0026gt; t)\u003Cbr\u003E            .FirstOrDefault(t =\u0026gt; t.FullName == \u0022MissionController.MissionController\u0022);\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E            if (MCE == null)\u003Cbr\u003E            {\u003Cbr\u003E                Debug.Log(\u0022[KCT] MCE Not Found.\u0022);\u003Cbr\u003E                return false;\u003Cbr\u003E            }\u003Cbr\u003E            else\u003Cbr\u003E            {\u003Cbr\u003E                Debug.Log(\u0022[KCT] MCE Found.\u0022);\u003Cbr\u003E                return true;\u003Cbr\u003E            }\u003Cbr\u003E        }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        public static void RevertMCE() //Call the Load Backup function in MCE.

It\u0027s not a bug in a sense it\u0027s just that mce uses the default values for parachutes. And I don\u0027t think it\u0027s an easy rewrite since the reason you would rewrite your own version is if you didn\u0027t like the drag values of the original. Which would mean I would have to write in special code to fix the problem.

KCT does have support for RealChute based parachute recovery. I personally have noticed that a drag to mass ratio of about 8 or higher will result in a landing of below 10m/s, which is the primary requirement for me to recover spent stages. Feel free to check out my source (included with the download). It\u0027s in the Kerbal_Construction_Time.vesselDestroyEvent() function. I had to use some reflection to get the drag coefficient and the total area, then calculate the drag from that. It shouldn\u0027t require much change to implement, if you haven\u0027t yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T18:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have idea for addition for this plugin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActions that bring money, but dont require any contract or mission.
