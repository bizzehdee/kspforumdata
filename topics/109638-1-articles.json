And it\u0027s not that I\u0027m trying to launch a 1000 part 5000 ton behemoth. It\u0027s a regular rocket with 3 stages or so. \n\nWhat\u0027s the point in having a game where you can build stuff to fly if 90% of it doesn\u0027t fly in a usable manner and you spend all your time trying to discover those 10% that will eventually work?\n\nIt\u0027s gotten to the point where all the game does to me is cause frustration."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T12:54:34Z","Content":"It isn\u0027t a game about throwing stuff together, at least for me. Since physics amd aerodynamics are important factors in ship design, one\u0027s craft may not work. Thrust misalignment, drag, misplaced center of mass and/or pressure... all these things make for an engineering challenge.\n\nWhich is why the game is fun for me.

I created a \u0022duplicate thread\u0022 that I think is a bit of a better explanation, which you can find [here.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119185-A-Simple-Guide-to-Rocket-Aerodynamics%21) It covers pretty much everything you need to know, and with more accuracy than the one shown above (though it is a bit of a long read).\n\n**Now, back on topic!**\n\nKSP is fun precisely because most designs *won\u0027t* work unless they\u0027re carefully planned, built, and flown. It\u0027s a game about learning what\u0027s wrong and then trying again... learning what went wrong there and then trying again... and again... and *again*. If you reach a stumbling block (and it seems you have), there\u0027s an enormous amount of Forum-goers who want to help! If one aspect of the game makes it impossible for you to have fun, you can use a mod to bypass it. If the game is still causing you grief, just play something else for a little while, and come back when you think it would be nice to give it another shot.\n\nAnd trust me, getting your rocket to work will be massively satisfying... a bit like an itch that you are finally able to scratch. You\u0027ll realize that there was a relatively easy fix for the problem, you\u0027ll kick yourself, and then you\u0027ll eagerly press onwards. It\u0027s happened to me *loads* of times, trust me.\n\nKSP is fun (to me, at least). It is, to quote Dean Kamen, the \u0022hardest fun you\u0027ll ever have.\u0022 But it\u0027s the most nerve-wracking, rewarding, and enjoyable game I\u0027ve ever come across.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n-Upsilon\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T13:29:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"foxkill2342","CreatedById":120834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T13:29:25Z","Content":"I have only experienced my rockets flipping around once, and that was when I mounted a plane on top of a rocket.
