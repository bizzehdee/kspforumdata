And coupled along with mods like Fine Print/MC2 and just the general contracts.. science collecting has never been easier. And that\u0027s fine as it. But I want more science parts. I want to download Dmagic along with a lot of other mods that add in their own science definitions. Now with even MORE science parts the rate at which you blow through the tech tree is WAY to fast. Science point accumulation with additional parts is just too much imo. So is there a simple way to reduce the science gain from experiments? This way I can keep a stock science accumulation, but with more parts..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-13T20:41:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can write a CFG to lower it some 1 did that not to long ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
