So, a couple days ago, I was shopping on Amazon for a present to my friend. He really likes gummy bears, so I came upon this beast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VYJi7w9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VYJi7w9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, ok, I think. So I buy the bags (Five of them), and they came yesterday. I gave them to my friend this afternoon. He really liked the taste, and I was really happy that he liked my present, and went home light-hearted and in a good mood. Then I get a phone call from him. Apparently, he was stuck in the bathroom, spewing out enough explosive force to match that of a nuclear device. So, I ask \u0022Please verify. I don\u0027t believe you\u0022. He replies by screaming \u0022ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I ATE THE WHOLE FIVE BAGS AND NOW I\u0027M STUCK HERE!\u0022, followed by the sound of the roof breaking and what...was it unintelligeble screaming?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, I knew he was a goner. Just two hours ago, he propelled himself past the Karman Line in a gigantic stack of solid waste, and is currently literally ****ting his way to the stars faster than Voyager One, and will probably keep going for three days, which at the current rate of accleration, will propel him to Alpha Centauri in 50 years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe iSP of this is awesome. I tested a single bear myself, and came out with the explosive energy force of ten kilotons of TNT. Such energy potiental is not to be wasted, and must be harnessed at all costs. In truth, the whole bag will produce enough accleartion to propel a habitat module to Jupiter and back, but for now, let\u0027s stick to Mars. However, I believe it may be a good enough subsitute to anti-matter, and is biological fuel, as it relies on the muscles of your body-and thus, has no need for massive amounts of fuel or oxidizer. In fact, all you need is a astronaut and a toliet hooked up to a engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GHhbURK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GHhbURK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EArtists impression of a spacecraft that would utilize these bears as fuel\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/iwywF9x\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iwywF9x.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iwywF9x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EArtist\u0027s impression of another spaceship\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a fuel would be cheaper than antimatter, easier than fusion, and more ready than technologies like VASMIR. Because of this, I am submitting a paper on the feasbility on such a design, of a ship that uses these bears as fuel. It has been estimated that one bag could propel 50 tons of equipment and matieral to Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, I highly recommend that NASA look into this as a viable fuel source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, and good day. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QToaDqr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QToaDqr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA diagram showing a capsule that could eventually utilize this propulsion method.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T16:41:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T22:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat spaceship.... is it doing what my childish mind thinks it\u0027s doing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T22:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Airbornem4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Airbornem4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat spaceship.... is it doing what my childish mind thinks it\u0027s doing?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn fact, all you need is a astronaut and a toliet hooked up to a engine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T01:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a direct conversion mechanism (converts matter directly into energy without the pesky need for antimatter), you can use the mass energy to boost the Isp, as humans have s****y mass ratios (get it? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T05:52:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the problem with sugar free candy.
