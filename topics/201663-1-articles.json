From what I\u0027ve gleaned different events like new discoveries and research will cause \u0022booms\u0022 in Kerbal populations, which is fun, but it seems like thats only a goal to strive for if Kerbals themselves are a resource and having more of them means you can do more things. I thought it might be fun to speculate on how that might work, and how it might tie into filling crews, gathering science, running colonies, etc. I\u0027ve heard very little about whether Kerbal careers will be relevant or how (or if) science will be collected or generated, but since these systems felt the most unfinished in KSP1 I\u0027m curious how they\u0027ll be handled in KSP2. I can think of 3 ways one could go about this, from more manage-y to less manage-y:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKeeping Pilots, Scientists, and Engineers:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt could be that much like in KSP 1 Kerbals could have different specializations limiting the number of things they could do--Pilots can fly ships and control probes, Engineers can repair things, Scientists can run labs, etc. In KSP 2 there will be more things that they could do at colonies like running reactors, greenhouses, nurseries, etc. Does it make sense that these kinds of facilities would require minimum crews to operate? If so it might be nice to have a training facility where civilian recruits could be certified into those fields and give the player a little control over how many of each they have at each colony to keep things running smoothly. Maybe running additional milk-runs would require allocating more pilots or filling a colony-command module to run them remotely. Maybe upgrades require filling research facilities with scientists and engineers. It could also be that different modules auto-fill with available crew to reduce micro-management and you could just draw from this pool to populate newly built vessels and send them to make new colonies. I\u0027d personally be okay with dropping\u00A0 the experience system\u00A0\u00A0entirely as managing the individual careers of a few dozen staff is fiddly enough in KSP1.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneric Crews:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr you could just drop kerbal careers entirely and have generic kerbals that are assumed to be well trained enough to handle any job. You\u0027d still need enough total kerbals to staff up your various labs, reactors, mining rigs, maybe even some engines require dedicated staff to maintain, but you wouldn\u0027t be limited by who could do what. It would though allow you to overbuild a bit, run short-staffed, allocating more kerbals to mining and fuel production\u00A0for instance if you needed more resources or to nurseries and life support if you were focusing on increased population.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPopulation thresholds:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis seems like the simplest and least management heavy way of doing things, that in order to add or run certain modules like a big reactor or fancy new fuel factory a colony would need at least X population. It could be nice because you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about crews at all and could focus on other aspects of the game, but\u00A0it might be harder to balance and offer less flexibility. So for instance if having 100 kerbals means you can build a big fancy fusion reactor, do you need 120 to build 2? Does this limit the number of other facilities you can add? And if so is this just as if not more confusing and manage-y than using generic crews? This idea could though potentially be mixed with having careers but they would only be operative in running exploration vessels.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are a lot of other questions about how involved colony management will be, balancing resources and optimizing growth, etc. I think there needs to be SOME management involved here otherwise whats the point, but whats the right balance? How important will life support be for instance? I agree there should be no frustrating fail-state where your kerbals run out of air and die, but maybe accumulating a certain quantity of single-resource LS allows you to build more habitation modules or raises the cap on how many total kerbals a colony can support? I was also thinking it might be nice instead of having booms produce new recruits they could produce more like kerblings--baby kerbals that require some negligible amount of LS. That way you wouldn\u0027t need to raise population caps BEFORE a boom occurs, you could add it on after and move kerbals into careers as you added more habitation .\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust some thoughts.

In my longer saves I\u0027d often have 50-80 kerbals on the roster, 1/3 or so doing\u00A0missions around kerbin training and mining fuel and the rest on long-term interplanetary missions. Even trying to level up that many kerbals by ferrying them around strategically becomes pretty tedious. I just cant see taking the time to level up hundreds of potential colonists, and even having more than 3 careers is likely to add to annoying personnel shortages and imbalances. The most management I could see is a banished/frostpunk type model where large numbers of Kerbals can be assigned to different modules at a colony to keep things humming along, ideally only after making a bunch of build changes, and letting things coast from there if you\u0027ve got your outputs well balanced. It might be nice too if giving kerbals jobs in this way resulted in visible activity as they went on shifts, gathered resources and science around the colony, etc. The whole thing would look more alive because it IS more alive. Or maybe it\u0027s even simpler than that. It could be there\u0027s no personnel management at colonies at all and\u00A0if a module is active and has the input resources it needs and you have enough total colonists it just hums silently along. With this latter model I only worry that kerbals themselves become ancillary, and it might be difficult to produce tight game balance and intuitive strategy for the player by using only population caps and tech unlocks. Its almost easier if they can say \u0022Okay I want 3 more fuel factories that need 6 kerbals each to run efficiently but I\u0027ve only got 20 idle colonists.... what should I do?\u0022 than to be thinking\u00A0\u0022Okay so at 80 kerbals I can build 1 metallic hydrogen plant, and every 10 kerbals after that I can build one more.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEither way you probably don\u0027t want to spend endless time fiddling with colonies when the real game is about building and flying your expeditions.

It depends a lot on what kerbals can or need to do. Right now in KSP1 you really only ever need a couple of kerbals on any mission, and usually not even a pilot because probe cores do their jobs just as well. Id love it in KSP2 if there were a real reason to bring 6-10 kerbals on big exploration missions. Maybe its just that they stay happier in larger groups, but that might be difficult to balance and predict as a player. Or maybe its that some engines require bigger command modules, and those command modules require more kerbals to operate? Maybe there are gameplay reasons why bringing larger labs that need more scientists makes sense on big exploration missions? Or other systems work more efficiently?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-18T15:43:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2021 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlutoISaPlanet","CreatedById":206057,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-18T16:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine that kerbal classs/specialist return, just that they have more uses in colonies.

Its kind of the reason I like the idea of booms producing kerblings rather than full-on colonists, because it would give players a buffer period after the boom to build new habitation and LS capacity rather than needing to guess at the size of the boom and overbuild capacity ahead of time. It could also be cute\u00A0if the nursury was like a pond that they all lived in like little mudskippers\u00A0and as you added capacity they would grow up and into the main population. Maybe the next step is slowly training up new astronauts over time that can do more than tend greenhouses and watch after fuel factories?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich leads me to the deeper question: what is the leanest and cleanest way to manage your population?\u00A0Since the core experience is building rockets and exploring how does colonization feed into that without demanding huge amounts of player micromanagement? How do kerbals remain relevant without being cumbersome? Lets talk about vessels first since thats something we\u0027re more familiar with in KSP1. Like I said before there\u0027s no real reason to bring more than one engineer and a couple of scientists on any mission. So maybe instead of needing 1 kerbal to operate certain command modules you need 2 or 4 or 6? Like the way you need to fill science labs to operate them? Likewise\u00A0maybe some parts like ore drills or\u00A0fancy engines would require staffing an engineering control module. That way early on missions would only require one pilot, but as missions become more complex they would need bigger crews to be operated and create more interesting design challenges in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. To cut down on micro-management you could lose the 3 classes and just have those seats fill automatically if astronauts were available. You could still have passenger seats to move colonists from place to place, but only labs and command modules would fill automatically.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich leads me to think if filling mission critical seats works for vessels, could it work for colonies too? Is it just as easy if greenhouses and fuel factories and milk-run control modules require a certain number of kerbals to function efficiently? They could fill automatically, but you could manually shuffle them around if you were short on staff or wanted to prioritize different outputs. It amounts to the same thing as having population thresholds, but somehow to me it seems more intuitive and flexible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-19T01:38:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2021 01:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
