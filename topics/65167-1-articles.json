This is not a complaint, more of something to maybe consider when breaking out the parts for your next model. Looking forward to your next update. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"junkie_business","CreatedById":100299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T01:38:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know what you mean klick, but I imagine for most people, the rocket is the means, rather than the end.

Ill even add to that, the reduced part count is great for launching custom complex objects as the launcher part overhead can be reduced a bit. I stick by my initial thought however as \u0022welds\u0022 (part reduction), the new part formatting that makes shared assets a thing (options with less memory overhead), and subassemblies (create your own standardized launch systems) address your points \u0022against\u0022 this being a bit more modular.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thourion","CreatedById":47430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T10:53:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirklick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sirklick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E ...After a couple of launches I feel that these parts remove a critical and fun part of KSP -the Lego like glee of customization and building. The top stage of the Zenit for instance could be split into a couple different parts that allow for look alike builds and customization. That toroid tank and engine look amazing but I can\u0027t really combine this with other parts which I love like procedural fairings or KW etc... \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne problem that i see with this is, how on earth you take a part of this pure awsomness textured mod, and stick it with another part of a different mod, and yeah i know theres other mods that also look good out there, but really for me this baby is a one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, i respect the need of anyone to mix and match parts, myself included, but even if we clear the Part list clutter and even the resources usage problems, then we should still have the Moders work in mind. It takes time to cut the parts, more time to properly UV them, and even if those are ok, you got more time to make the cfg\u0027s, node placements, \u0022Unity brainjuice drain\u0022 etc shenanigans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah i totally agree with junkie here, its a launcher. You want it to look sexy, you want it to look sexy, and you want it to not fall apart even while looking sexy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E, but thats it. All the rest of the time is spent on the actual payload, where to put the panels, what legs on there if any, an AIES probe or a stock one, an Orion pod from bobcat or a SDHI, etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
