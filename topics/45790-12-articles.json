I also suspect that the wings on the skylon have a high camber, meaning that they are designed to provide a lot of lift, more so than the wings that Space-plane Plus values would allow. I would also suspect that the angle of attack on those wings is quite high as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, I think that the flight profile in mind for the Skylon is more like rocket ascent than the normal SSTO ascents we use in KSP.

The engines would have to have a fair amount of gimbal in order to counteract the rotation they would cause in rocket mode once in the upper atmosphere. As it burns fuel I would suspect the CoM would then move farther forward bringing it inline with or just in front of the CoL as it would need to be the most aerodynamically stable during reentry. Is it intended to make a powered landing or glide in? If it is intended to make a powered landing then this CoM shift could cause problems due to the angled center of thrust, of course this could be solved with engine gimbaling or one technique they may employ in the real world is fuel transfer, pumping fuel around to make the desired changes in the CoM, if that is the case that can\u0027t really be solved through part cfgs. If it is intended to glide in then the forward shift in CoM would be desirable because of increased aerodynamic stability, although I kind of doubt this is the case as the shape doesn\u0027t look like a very effective glider plus given my earlier postulations of getting a significant amount of lift from the body and using a high AoA this would not be good for a glider as a high AoA would also mean a high coefficient of drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I am pulling 90% of this out of my rear, I really haven\u0027t done any reading on the actual specifics and flight characteristics of the actual Skylon, and while I study aerodynamics and aerospace engineering in my spare time I am by no means super knowledgeable in these things, I simply have a basic working knowledge of these and am pretty confident in my grasp of physics, but given the specific design choices I highlighted (curved engine nacelles, upward slope of tail section, canards on the nose and lack of horizontal stabilizers in the rear) and the assumption those design choices were made for a specific reason, I feel as though I\u0027m not too far off base.
