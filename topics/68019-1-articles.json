You can take an asteroid to different locations around Kerbin (or any other planet) and collect different science reports and gain more science points. So you can collect a sample high in orbit around Kerbin, then another in low orbit, one while in flight, and another on the surface of Kerbin (I think the surface also has biome support) and so on. Each location will give you more science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T04:50:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eclick the kerbal to take a sample\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried this a lot of times, didn\u0027t work.
