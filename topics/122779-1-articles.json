However, it DOES change which direction normal/anti-normal is in. If you don\u0027t rotate your vessel as you burn you will no longer be burning in a purely normal/anti-normal direction and so will be burning a little bit pro/retrograde, which will change your orbital velocity and therefore altitude of periapsis/apoapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChoose one of three solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Accept the change in orbital velocity and compensate with a later burn to adjust apoapsis/periapsis. (Easy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rotate your vessel as you burn to stay pointing normal/antinormal. You can dynamically compensate for any small error by deliberately burning off-normal yourself. (Moderate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Guess which angle will be normal at the midpoint of the burn and burn in that direction. Any pro/retrograde vector added in the first part of the burn will be compensated by the second half.

As a result, you are indeed increasing your spacecraft\u0027s speed, which results in a larger semimajor axis, and eventually, an escape trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of this can be mitigated by making your plane-change burn ,bu pulling the normal handle a bit, then the retrograde handle a bit, and alternating between the two to keep your apoapsis where you want it to be. That seems to work up until about 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 plane changes. For plane changes of more than that, you\u0027re going to have to fiddle with four handles (Prograde.

It\u0027s because by playing with maneuver nodes, you\u0027re burning at the normal vector of your \u003Cstrong\u003Eoriginal velocity\u003C/strong\u003E. Your original velocity, your burn, and your final velocity form a right triangle.

Think of a circle with your original velocity as radius. Always burning normal means your velocity changes along the arc of the circle. This way it is not increasing velocity while changing direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course, this is not the most efficient way of changing direction in-place. As we can see from the circle-analogy. We can just burn a straight line from your original velocity to desired one.

As Sal alluded to, the normal and anti-normal markers om the navball will move as the orbit inclination changes. But, if the TWR of the ship in question can out perform the ships control authority, then the ship can\u0027t keep up with the change in direction, resulting in a thrust vector that does not actually burn in the normal or anti-normal direction but instead lags behind a certain amount depending on the severity of the TWR/contorl authority strength ratio, resulting in a changing AP/Pe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit : clarification. A manuever node created in the anti-normal/normal direction will not change vector with the normal or anti-normal markers on the navball. The manuever node will display changes in an orbit for a constant direction only. Locking into the normal direction on the navbal with the auto-pilot will result in a burn that cannot be predicted by a manuever node. This is not necessarily a bug, but rather a feature that just hasn\u0027t been added yet. And, I still don\u0027t know if my answers are making any sense.
