After reaching Mun Orbit I EVA\u0027ed two crew to the Lander and seperated from the Main Vessel. After performing a deorbit burn and Landing I planted a flag and than tookoff again. The first weird thing I noticed was, that the trajectory line in the map view of the Vessel was missing, after I set the Main Vessel as Target, the Indicator symbols started flickering in and out at times, the Trajecory line never showed up. As I tried to fix the Line not showing, by switching to the Main Craft and back, I noticed that I had lost all the Velocity I had and I started to fall straight back to the Surface.\u00A0As I had enough Delta-V left, I fired the engine and accelerated back into a stable orbit. As I than saw, that the Trajectory line still was not showing I tried switching to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and than the Tracking Station, when I had selected the Lander I saw, as can be seen in the Screenshot, the speed of the Vessel was 0 again, as I spawned into the Lander it again started to fall back to the surface. Quicksave_24 is the save, before it started with the losing of the velocity, the Trajectory line was at that point already missing. Quicksave_26 is the save which I made after the whole story. The save Day 26 is the save I made when I was still landed on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230814190133_1.jpg.9c97aa4fb6c11260f54f1ffa0f699fdb.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/uploads/monthly_2023_08/20230814190133_1.jpg.9c97aa4fb6c11260f54f1ffa0f699fdb.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/applications/core/interface/file/cfield.php?storage=form_Fields\u0026amp;path=Day26.json\u0026amp;fileKey=%5B!AES128GCM%5BK7MrA9uI7RvKXN99KGQCbbSCpFlpASAjeFX6t66pDnJLxWcU7RomftPpC%2BQQA3G23NrLZW5UPg/IrKk=%5D%5Ba47fec39e91c3194dd86d431%5D%5B8034d0cb3779216b8b4f945765255291%5D%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EDay26.json\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-14T22:32:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2023 10:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 14\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
