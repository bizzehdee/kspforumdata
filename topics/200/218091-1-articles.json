Upon its first test flight, I landed on Duna and things immediately went wrong, because my landings legs were too short. The craft sat on its engine bell and kept tilting/rolling uncontrollably. I was pretty sure I had aligned the landing legs correctly in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, but apparently I must have made a mistake, and so I earmarked this craft for revisiting. But then I left the game be for a while, waiting for updates, and never got back to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow in v0.1.3.1, I finally went to look for my mistake. Lo and behold: in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, the LT-5 \u0022Bandicoot\u0022 landing legs were correctly mounted after all, and extend well beyond the engine bell (see screenshot 1). I even took them off and reattached them to make sure there was no weird holdover bug from a previous version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then launched the thing into space, and extended the legs. At first, they faithfully extended to their full length (see screenshot 2). But just after reaching full extension, they suddenly jerked back into a much shorter state (see screenshot 3). At the same time, the whole craft got jolted out of alignment, until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E brought it back. The craft file is attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I built a simple test rocket (also attached) and yeeted it into space - the same problem maifests there. It happens reliably every time I extend these landing legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I did not test with other kinds of landing legs.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPotentially related to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/217969-large-landing-legs-randomly-reverse-when-fully-extended/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis bug report\u003C/a\u003E, but I\u0027m intentionally creating a separate one because I am not sure.
