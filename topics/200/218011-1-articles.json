One pair in a previous saved game, and one similar pair in a brand new campaign and save. The main difference between the new save and the old one was that in the new save, both vessels had coronet engines, but were otherwise similar to the earlier pair. Mk1 capsule, Clamp-o-tron Jr., 4 solar panels, 5 lights, two radial chutes (fat lot of good that did them!), heat shield and decoupler between the tank and the capsule, and a small reaction wheel control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImmediately upon successful docking, I get a PAIGE popup telling me I\u0027ve launched a vessel. The docked vessel disappears, and not too long after that it crashes into the ground on Kerbin. Unable to find the vessels in map view or flight view between when they dock and when they are reported destroyed. Poor, poor Valentina and Jeb! What a horrible way to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022anrbCNy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022102.47\u0022 height=\u0022955\u0022 width=\u0022932\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/anrbCNy.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpected behavior, a new combined vessel should be created from the two docked vessels and it should be in pretty much the same place moving at the same speed as the two vessels prior to docking. No crew should be harmed in the process, and no parts destroyed. Under no circumstances should Valentin\u0027s portrait be replaced with a white square. As the combined vessel is composed of two vessels that have both previously launched, PAIGE should sit down and shut up about the launch. If she wants to pipe up congratulating our two fine pilots on their immaculate docking maneuver, that would be OK, but otherwise, she should pipe down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m able to partially replicate this in an unmodded game. In the modded game the behavior is catastrophically bad. In an unmodded game, you still get PAIGe telling you you\u0027ve launched and one of the portraits will be white, but the combined vessel didn\u0027t disappear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-08T23:21:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2023 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
