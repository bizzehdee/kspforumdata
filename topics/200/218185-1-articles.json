Curious now, I looked at other categories and the corresponding group was closed (the first group). This happens for all part groups, and it\u0027s always the part groups in the same place. For example, if I close monopropellant tanks, then engine mounts, radial decouplers, cockpits, etc will all be closed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-08T21:45:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2023 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
