A couple days ago I just decided to challenge myself and send a single launch space station to Moho (Sorry for the backstory). After I got Moho in a good transfer window, I created the maneuver for the Moho injection orbit and I managed to get it to about 50,000 meters. Though the encounter symbol did not show up. Now, I\u0027ve been playing the KSP franchise for a little over 6 or 7 years now and I try to understand orbital mechanics as a hobby so I knew that it was (Unless the planet had the density of Aerogel... swiss cheese) close enough to enter the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E but I could see how this could confuse and concern new players. I\u0027m personally fine and I love the game but I just am concerned that this may deter new players from the game. So if this bug could be looked at that would be perfect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-09-05T23:57:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2023 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Sep 5\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
