I seriously need help with this to find a long lasting solution or for the devs to add more optimisations for devices more like mine. I try to load a save and it always manages to get to \u0022setting universe state\u0022 before the game just closes, the unity crash handler doesn\u0027t even pop up and show an error the app just closes. This doesn\u0027t generate crash reports for some reason so i can never see the root of the problem, once again any help from the community would be appreciated, there are lots of others other than myself that experience this that would benefit from any help with getting the game running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-14T18:15:39Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2023 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 14\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anth","CreatedById":161238,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-14T18:18:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour video card is under minimum specs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI recommend trying the following:\u003Cbr\u003E\nChange your resolution to minimum\u003Cbr\u003E\nAvoid loading saves that are in Low Kerbin Orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"doug jeffington","CreatedById":229849,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-14T20:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe thing is those solutions just don\u0027t work i cant even get something into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E because no matter what i do i cant even create a save and setting the resolution to the absolute minimum does absolutely nothing. is there any way at all to alert the developers of this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anth","CreatedById":161238,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-16T15:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224330246\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219894\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221697315833\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022229849\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022doug jeffington\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/15/2023 at 9:37 AM, doug jeffington said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe thing is those solutions just don\u0027t work i cant even get something into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E because no matter what i do i cant even create a save and setting the resolution to the absolute minimum does absolutely nothing. is there any way at all to alert the developers of this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe developers already know about some of the issues relating to computers that are below minimum spec, but unfortunately that probably means that its going to be a low priority for a while.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHopefully as the performance of the game is improved over the long term, it will end up more playable on your computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
