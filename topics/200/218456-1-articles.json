This especially noticable in the afterburner mode since the nozzle is very thin in it\u0027s stuck state. The afterburner used to work in v0.1.1.0 (and maybe even in v0.1.0.0) but has since then been broken. In the image you can see an example of a plane were one of the engines have a correct afterburner animation (the right one) and the other one is stuck in it\u0027s first state (the left one).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: This image was taken in v0.1.1.0 were the animation did work to some extend but the reason for one of them not working in the image was because of the fact that the engines were mirrored. Once I placed them individually both of their animations worked. In recent updates, no matter what I do, the animation will still not work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022afterburner.png.2e8e6f58b96b9591fb1315ca185eccc4.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/uploads/monthly_2023_07/afterburner.png.2e8e6f58b96b9591fb1315ca185eccc4.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-16T16:35:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2023 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 16\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
