I activated the parachute stage with \u0022safe release\u0022 enabled (has worked previously in KSP 2 and of course in KSP 1). The craft was high up in the atmosphere at around 2100 m/s (and with the new bug that there is no drag it did not slow down much at all) when suddenly the parachute was released (at still \u0026gt; 2000 m/s). Strangely it stayed there for some good 10 seconds (not doing anything to slow the craft) and then ripped off as the speed was of course way too high for deployment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRepeatable: Yes, I tried several times, always the same result. Parachute deployed at ridiculously high speed and was ripped off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-16T07:35:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2023 07:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 16\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Anth12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
