My beset guess is that when objects are being copied radially around another object, its messing up something in the UI. Part of the error also shows that the radial placement gets messed up as well. With one of the radially placed objects not attaching while the others do.\u00A0No matter what\u0027s being done to correct the misplacement, the UI errors compound, later resulting in the craft being unable to launch. Alternatively, the game will start the loading process for the launch and get stuck / froze, requiring that the game be restarted. Most often the build is corrupted and thus auto-saved during the freeze.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: Placing an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E radially x4 around a tank, only 3 are shown to attach, with one still being attached to the mouse curser or stuck to some strange position on the tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note, I\u0027ve also encountered this error when placing support struts between objects that are connected radially.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Redacted\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
