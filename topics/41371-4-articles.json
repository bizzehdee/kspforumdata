Now, I don\u0027t expect it now because if they take this route, there would be less of a need to develop more parts (specifically engines). Say the mainsail started worse than the current stats (no gimbal, more weight, less thrust and isp). Then you upgrade to make it have gimbal and more weight/thrust. Then you upgrade to more isp and thrust (at this point the mainsail is at its current stats), then you upgrade the thrust further and reduce the weight. Now you could do this perhaps 5 levels. 1= terrible, 2=better, 3=same as current states, 4=even better, 5=best. Now take it even further, you could do an upgrade path sort of deal. Once you get to the current stats (level 3), you can \u003Cem\u003Echoose\u003C/em\u003E to upgrade the thrust, isp, reduce the weight, or further gimbal.

For instance, most real rocket engines cannot be run at 5% or 10% throttle like you can in KSP. Actually most engines are not variably throttleable at all and if they can be throttled, they have specific set points (often only 1 set point). For instance, the newest American engine is the J-2X which is wrapping up testing currently. This hydrogen-oxygen (\u0022hydrolox\u0022) engine has only 2 throttle points - 100% and 80%. The RS-25 (a/k/a \u0022Space Shuttle Main Engine\u0022) is variably throttleable in 1% increments, but only between about 60% and 109% of rated thrust.

A big reason Challenger happened in the first place was the \u0022Go Fever\u0022 that accompanied a rushed flight rate and pad/ground ops pacing, which led to decisions being made based on data points being ignored or downplayed. Challenger STS-51L was hardly the first mission to have SRB field joint damage; it was just the one that actually led to catastrophe. Similarly, Columbia was lost because managers again felt that the understood and could deal with the system behaving in ways it wasn\u0027t designed to (e.g., shedding foam debris at very high velocity, causing impact damage to thermal protection systems).
