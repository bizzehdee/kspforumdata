Unless you\u0027re going to go the whole FAR route and model heat dissipation within the VAB, then the parts need to be predictable in how they\u0027ll behave just based on the usual description. That could be as simple as requiring 4 R10 radiators or 2 R20 radiators or 1 R40 radiator on an N40 reactor, but if we\u0027re trying to stand on a knife-edge on reactor temp between efficiency and self-destruction, and our only mechanism to work that is to repeatedly launch ships and test in space, that\u0027s going to become unfun fairly quick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey can be realistic, but tuned in such a way that they can snap together pretty straightforwardly heat-wise.

Because the reactor is clearly not getting any heat input aside from the conductive backflow from the radiators, as you can see in the image. But no, the radiators keep heating up at full speed. They\u0027re at about 600 K now, even though they were barely over 400 K when the reactor reached 4 K! It seems like there\u0027s an infinite reservoir of heat to draw from a part that sits at minimum temperature. Inside the atmosphere, when the radiators keep the reactor at ambient, this does not happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI watched for a while and the radiators went all the way to 1048 K, at which point the rad flux \u002B cond flux outgoing was equal the internal flux incoming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the reactor running at 100%, the radiators went up to 1065 K, a mere 17 K more.
