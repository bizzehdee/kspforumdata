So far, I\u0027ve landed in Duna, Dres, Eeloo, have ships going for Jool and missed Moho (not enough deltaV). And I want to tackle an Eve landing with return in the same ship. AFAIK, I should design a lander with a DeltaV 12 Km/s (is that vacuum deltaV?) , so I based it on my heavy lifters. And the second/interplanetary/lander stage thus includes 16 Mainsails in a two ring asparagus configuration (is that onion staging?) with a Skipper in the middle, which weights almost 1,700 tons. Here\u0027s my first version of it in Kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/4c20.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224c20.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve deorbited it after checking the ksp parachute calculator, which indicated I needed 600 parachutes to land the monstrosity without firing the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went back to the drawing board and to plan the mission again. Here are some screenshots of the... thing, on the VAP, so you can get an idea on what I\u0027m building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/30kgef4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002230kgef4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/161x8q8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022161x8q8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/b8sthf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b8sthf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I have some issues with the design and the way to carry out the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve read it\u0027s a good idea to detach the chutes and even the landing gear while taking off Eve, to save on weight. However, I\u0027ve tested separating the chutes (they have separatrons on the decouplers) on the launching pad and it doesn\u0027t work. The small rockets fire but the gravity still keeps the quad adapters with the chutes in place, so I guess that would only work for radial mounted parachutes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I thought of putting the landing gear so they extend beyond the Mainsails is to put them in the end of the beams. They do hold the lander on the pad, so I guess I\u0027ll have to land very softly to avoid damaging the engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe manned capsule is at the bottom, just above the center Skipper. I should try it, but I guess a Telus mobility enhancer is enough to put my Kerbal on the ground and allow him back inside\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn mission planning, I\u0027m thinking several approaches:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reach LKO, I\u0027m not jettisoning the emptied tanks and engines, as I want to use them again at Eve. With all the rockets I\u0027ve put as a first stage, it manages orbit with three engines running. Which is good, because the Skipper can\u0027t lift the thing on its own (and that\u0027s also a reason to launch it with the center line tanks with only 1/4 of the fuel to save weight). So I\u0027ll have to refuel it in orbit to fill all tanks and use the 16 inefficient Mainsails for the interplanetary burn. I don\u0027t think a tug with nuclear rockets will be practical to push such a beast into Eve, but I might be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means I\u0027ll have to refuel on Eve\u0027s orbit. I\u0027m thinking to send a tanker and/or using the Kethane mod to refuel through a mining base on Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding, that\u0027s the tricky part, I guess, since this \u0022lander\u0022 is huge. My last version has 32 drogues parachutes and 32 mk16 chutes. Is there an ideal proportion between them? If the only parachute calculator is right and my landing gear isn\u0027t sturdy enough (which I don\u0027t think it is), I could go down with parachutes and use the engine below 100m AGL to soften the landing. Since I\u0027m apparently unable to detach them, I guess I\u0027ll have to make an action group to cut them and carry on with the weight during Eve\u0027s take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also thinking in attaching a \u0022parachute tug\u0022 on top for landing: a small probe with an insane amount of radial parachutes which I can detach before take off. Maybe I could even replace all the onboard parachutes for that madness? The issue is, I guess, that so many parachutes on top of a docking port could cause the ship to break apart. Maybe not at the dock, but below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other, more complicated option, is to land on dry tanks. I don\u0027t refuel on Eve\u0027s orbit. Even more, I use the fuel to refuel a twin-like tanker with wheels. The dry weight is 280 tons, which shouldn\u0027t pose a problem for the parachutes. The twin-tanker-rover won\u0027t be taking off, so I could fill it with as many radial chutes as I can fit - the additional weight to an already heavy ship would be only a problem while taking off from Kerbin. And then I use the parts of the KAS mod to transfer fuel and fill the tanks. I would also probably need 2 or 3 tankers to be sure to fill them, so it seems rather complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also seen posts of people showing far lighter, and more reasonable landers. I don\u0027t know how the fit enough deltaV for take off, though. And I\u0027m now also curious about trying to land and take off in this monstrosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts, opinions?

The first and easiest one is to remove the command seat and mount the thing upside-down on top of a conventional lifter, bringing the seat along in a KAS container and attaching it on top just before de-orbit. The second way is to attach a small L-shaped structure to the bottom of the core stage that curves underneath the Aerospike to give it a node, and then strap the whole thing on top of a lifter with space tape.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-10T11:56:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2014 11:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MockKnizzle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T14:17:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing about 1.5 m is that they don\u0027t give me enough deltaV, maybe because of the heavier payload.
