More normal spin is caused by fuel not draining from fuel tanks evenly. Usually it causes spin during liftoff as the heavier tanks are pulled \u0022down\u0022. Asparagus staged rockets suffer from spin sometimes for this reason though they are symmetrical as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWays to combat spin are adding more SAS modules (not ASAS, you only need one), using a command pod with more torque, adding stabiliser fins or winglets and making sure the rocket is symmetrical when loaded with fuel and dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little bit of spin is ok and toggleing SAS on should stabilise it, but if the spin is greater that SAS can handle, either you increase torque available or get rid of whatever is causing spin in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost some screens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T02:25:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a joystick installed, make sure it is centered, even if you\u0027re not using it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T04:29:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also accidentally be setting the trim on your ships, particularly if you tend to use physics warp.
