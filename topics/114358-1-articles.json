Using the 215km maximum safe altitude of 1.0.4 as a baseline drop height I ran comparisons between 0.90, 1.0.4 and 1.0.0 (demo) models. Upper atmosphere is pretty much the same as there\u0027s not enough drag to have much effect above 40km so I\u0027ve recorded the results from 40km downwards as follows,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.90 216.7km starting height. 1.0.0 216km starting height 1.0.4 216km starting height\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E40km 1552m/s__ 1550m/s__ 1546m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30km 1578m/s__ 1594m/s__ 1581m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25km 1568m/s__ 1617m/s__ 1582m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20km 1495m/s__ 1626m/s__ 1543m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15km 1286m/s__ 1597m/s__ 1401m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10km 830m/s ___1458m/s__ 1050m/s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5km _299m/s___ 1085m/s___ 558m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3km _172m/s____ 802m/s___ 285m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1km _116m/s______________ 226m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0km _113m/s____ 534m/s____ 204m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImpact is a respectable 407km/h in 0.90, 734km/h in 1.0.4 and a blistering 1922km/h in 1.0.0 aero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone still has 1.0.2 I\u0027d be interested in seeing how much difference there between that and 1.0.4\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T06:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI realised I still had an installer for 1.0.2 on my computer so I was able to load that up and do the test.
