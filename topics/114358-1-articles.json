Using the 215km maximum safe altitude of 1.0.4 as a baseline drop height I ran comparisons between 0.90, 1.0.4 and 1.0.0 (demo) models. Upper atmosphere is pretty much the same as there\u0027s not enough drag to have much effect above 40km so I\u0027ve recorded the results from 40km downwards as follows,\n\n0.90 216.7km starting height. 1.0.0 216km starting height 1.0.4 216km starting height\n\n40km 1552m/s\\_\\_ 1550m/s\\_\\_ 1546m/s\n\n30km 1578m/s\\_\\_ 1594m/s\\_\\_ 1581m/s\n\n25km 1568m/s\\_\\_ 1617m/s\\_\\_ 1582m/s\n\n20km 1495m/s\\_\\_ 1626m/s\\_\\_ 1543m/s\n\n15km 1286m/s\\_\\_ 1597m/s\\_\\_ 1401m/s\n\n10km 830m/s \\_\\_\\_1458m/s\\_\\_ 1050m/s \n\n5km \\_299m/s\\_\\_\\_ 1085m/s\\_\\_\\_ 558m/s\n\n3km \\_172m/s\\_\\_\\_\\_ 802m/s\\_\\_\\_ 285m/s\n\n1km \\_116m/s\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ 226m/s\n\n0km \\_113m/s\\_\\_\\_\\_ 534m/s\\_\\_\\_\\_ 204m/s\n\nImpact is a respectable 407km/h in 0.90, 734km/h in 1.0.4 and a blistering 1922km/h in 1.0.0 aero.\n\nIf anyone still has 1.0.2 I\u0027d be interested in seeing how much difference there between that and 1.0.4"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T06:57:23Z","Content":"I realised I still had an installer for 1.0.2 on my computer so I was able to load that up and do the test.

It\u0027s surprisingly draggy especially in the upper atmosphere. I guess part occlusion is where FAR gets most of its drag benefit and since there\u0027s nothing to be occluded in a basic pod drop the drag is a little high. -(just to make sure the installation was correct I flew the test ship into orbit which took 3239m/s vacuum delta v so that looks fine).\n\n![drop%20curves%20with%20far_zpsgpqjxmlg.jpg](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/swampmonster/Kerbal%20space%20program/drop%20curves%20with%20far_zpsgpqjxmlg.jpg)"}]}
