Tormund grabs the Mun rocks, bails out of the capsule, and starts firing his suit thrusters to slow down. Eventually crashes into a crater wall going probably 40 m/s ... and lives to tell the tale! What now? Well, first order of business, Tormund\u0027s gotta plant a flag and grab some Mun rocks, because that\u0027s what they pay him for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for rescue.

Sitting on the launch pad the rocket stands at 111m tall. She flies like a dream too. You have to be really aggressive with the gravity turn at the start, and dial the throttle back to at least 66% (lest you end up in a cartoonishly high orbit), but it handles quite well. Might have something to do with using 8 full delta wings (with matching ailerons) as the tail fins.
