With very little time planning Jeb went and it took just over 600 days for the round trip.\n\nThe food supply alarms were going off some time prior to earth orbit, which had me worried.\n\nTo make matters worse Jeb had to do 8 aerobraking maneuvers around Earth to achieve an acceptable re-entry speed.\n\nThe final aerobraking move was perfect, achieving a Delta-V = -500, all the way from the south tip of Chile/Agentina to the eastern tip of Brasil.\n\nAs we were running out of supplies fast, a very tired Jeb put landed off the coast of Chile...\n\nI actually went the wrong way on this trip and future trips we\u0027ll go via Venus first - this will help reduce flight time.\n\nAlbum [http://imgur.com/a/1mPyr#9](http://imgur.com/a/1mPyr#9)"}]}
