Although various interpretations of the metaphor of the Monolith may be vast, there\u0027s no denying that it gives the being that comes in contact with it knowledge (or as Kubrick described it as an \u0022advanced intelligence teaching machine\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmong the ideas I have for it, they are fairly limited and I\u0027d love some input, but I\u0027ve narrowed it down to two ideas. Either:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Touching a monolith gives a certain value of science to the kerbal (if something like this couldn\u0027t be implemented, I suppose an EVA report in close proximity to one could suffice), a fairly large boost in fact considering the source material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Touch a monolith grants a free science tech point, that can be used to unlock a node in the tech tree without reducing science (rather randomly or manually). This is tricky as it could mean that the monolith could essentially be worth a ton of science, but I like the idea of a tech node unlock again because it can fit the source material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer the second idea more, however I\u0027m not sure how it could be implemented without cause unbalance within the game. Ideas that could fix this include visiting all of the monoliths on Kerbin in order to unlock a single free tech node (five free tech nodes seems like a lot, especially if the user waits until later on in the game to accomplish this, not to mention there is one within walking distance of the KSC itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?
