But hey, you\u0027re moving things with HyperEdit so just move those yourself.\u003Cp\u003EAnd now for something completely different. What I\u0027d like to see from Kerbaltek (or anyone doing plugins and mods) is a plugin that in the VAB and SPH can align parts to the same plane and or rotation. It would be especially useful for getting landing legs all set to the same level and for making sure all the wheels on a rover are straight and on the same plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch is made a bit difficult by the game using something other than degrees for rotation and in VAB the vertical positions of parts are measured from the VAB floor so if you move the whole ship up and down, the values for the vertical positions of all the parts changes. I dunno how the position is measured in the other axes. It\u0027s possible to edit this in a text editor, even in the persistent file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52288-Rover-wheel-alignment\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52288-Rover-wheel-alignment\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill would be easier to be able to control\u002Bclick a bunch of parts then click a button to align them, either to the average of selected, highest of selected or lowest of selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have no idea how it works is where the vertical (or other axis) position of parts is measured from in space. What are the rotations in space measured relative to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother program I\u0027d love to see is a separate one that can pull things out of the persistent or quicksave files and save them as craft files which can be loaded in SPH or VAB. That would be just the thing for when you discover at the end of a long trip that you forgot something or brought extra items/weight you didn\u0027t need. Copy it out, open it in VAB, make the changes then go back to the external program to swap out the modified craft in the save. Might get a bit tricky for several things docked together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be able to do that with landed crafts it would have to be able to save the position/rotation values of what it\u0027s overwriting, and doing anything which alters the distance of the COM from the lowest parts would very likely result in an intersection with the ground or having the craft dropping a ways. Neither would likely have a good outcome, unless there would be a way for the program to adjust for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose ideas are on my \u0022pie in the sky\u0022 wish list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the position of parts in space rather than the VAB/SPH...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that in Unity all objects are sub-objects of a parent object, in a continuous tree. Therefore, all the parts of a ship would have their positions referenced as relative to the root part of the vessel. How exactly this translates to the .craft files and those within persistent saves, isn\u0027t completely clear to me yet, but I think others have a good handle on it. For instance the \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61075-WEB-APP-webVAB-Show-off-your-crafts-not-your-craft-files\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWebVAB\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 project that displays .craft files as accurate visual models - very cool thing, that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that what we\u0027re after, you and I, is a vast improvement to the editors in KSP - things that would make excellent additions to the core game. The thing is, I\u0027d be willing to bet that the rock stars at Squad have similar designs and will hopefully make them happen in time. Not that we shouldn\u0027t or can\u0027t do so before then, but I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ll have the time/energy/ability to construct the code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve finally achieved what I\u0027d call minimum proficiency in C#, but whenever I begin the process of coding for KSP - either for HyperEdit or other projects I have on slow boil - my addiction kicks in and I have to go build a ship or fly to the Mun or something. I freely admit that laziness is also a major factor in why I haven\u0027t really contributed anything to HyperEdit. When the muse hits me, I may be able to put some hours into it, and I look forward to that especially now that I can actually read the code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T17:21:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jrandom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jrandom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy feature request would be the ability to specify a target orbit for a vessel by apoapsis and periapsis with the option of starting the ship out at either point.
