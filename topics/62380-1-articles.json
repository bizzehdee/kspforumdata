Namely the barometer and the sensor array nosecone. The thermometer also works, in contrast to space (where it only works when being landed on a celestial body). So you can get a number of science points by exploring Kerbin\u0027s biomes with your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T21:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStreetwind is correct, there is no extra science to gain by going faster. But 2225 m/s at 25km is a worthy achievement. This kind of speed and altitude is what you should aim for before you switch over to rocket power when launching an SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T23:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget the atmosphere analyzing nosecone science part, which does something in addition to the regular instruments. So a bit of extra science there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, going fast in an atmosphere can actually be counterproductive. If you have orbital velocity, it counts you as being in low orbit even if you\u0027re in the atmosphere, so you can\u0027t sneak in atmospheric science during aerocapture/braking passes, unfortunately. So to get the \u0022flying over\u0022 science, you have to be below ortibal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut note that you don\u0027t have to be actually flying to get \u0022flying over\u0022 science. Hovering, dangling on a parachute, or doing a short hop off the ground counts as well. Even an EVA\u0027d Kerbal still hanging onto the pods hatch counts as doing an EVA report while \u0022flying over\u0022 whatever terrain you\u0027re landed in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
