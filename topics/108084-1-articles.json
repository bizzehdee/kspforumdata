I am in the corect orbit within about 1k. Degree angle is correct , though it says 180. Strange thing is, my probe is able to alter its orbit by itself, with the engine off, SAS off, me not touching anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven thoguh on occasion it settles, the it still shows its not in the correct orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else having this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHe probe is just a okto, antenna okto fuel tank and a ant engine, nothing special.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you sure you\u0027re going around in the correct direction? 180^ sounds like you\u0027re supposed to be in a retrograde, not a prograde orbit.
