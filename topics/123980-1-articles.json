At one point, I split the space station into two halves, moved them ~70 meters away from each other, then tried redocking. I think I went to Kerbal Space Center inbetween, then used the KSC tracking station to switch control back to my space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite a perfect alignment, the docking ports refused to attract each other (Clamp-O-Tron Sr. on both sides). Repeated docking attempts didn\u0027t help. Moving spacecraft ~100m apart and redocking didn\u0027t help either. Spacecraft touched each other for several seconds, then slowly drifted apart. I searched the Internet and found lots of bug reports about this very issue, beginning in 2013. The workaround suggested was to edit \u003Cstrong\u003Epersistent.sfs\u003C/strong\u003E and change \u003Cstrong\u003EState=Acquired\u003C/strong\u003E into \u003Cstrong\u003EState=Ready \u003C/strong\u003Efor the docking port affected. This fixed my issue too - after changing persistent.sfs and reloading the game, the docking was successful on the very first attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s beyond belief that the bug still exists after first having been reported back in 2013 (together with a known workaround). I would think if the developer cannot find the root cause of the bug, they would at least implement a workaround so that the bug wouldn\u0027t bother users (e.g. a docking port automatically switching back into \u0022ready\u0022 mode after 30 seconds, so that this bug would not have any persistent effects).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any mod that would automatically solve this issue by automatically changing docking ports to \u0022State=Ready\u0022? It is kind of uncool to manually check \u003Cstrong\u003Epersistent.sfs\u003C/strong\u003E before every docking attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kujuman","CreatedById":28299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T03:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I don\u0027t think there are mods that fix that bug, it\u0027s an (relatively) avoidable one. The state=acquired gets stuck in that state when the game saves when the docking ports are magnetized and the game is then resumed from that save state. So as long as you don\u0027t save mid-docking or switch scenes mid-docking you should be pretty safe. And just in case you don\u0027t know, you can switch between nearby craft using the \u0022[\u0022 and \u0022]\u0022 keys by default, so you don\u0027t need to go to the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, it\u0027s one of those annoyances that should get fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T03:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s because we have yet to see someone post a consistent way to replicate this in stock.
