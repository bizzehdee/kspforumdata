A second number for the safe passage of biological lifeforms would also be appreciated. A total beam power somewhere between 1Gw and 10Gw sounds about right. For reference, the solar constant for Earth is about 1.5Kw/m2 - which is safe - and up to 15Kw/m2 for Mercury - which certainly doesn\u0027t sound healthy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m 40-odd pages behind the thread so you\u0027ve probably already covered this, but at that power level the beam would have to be huge to avoid killing a bird.
