Mostly rear becaue it give You proper angle of attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there is no much use for bigger gear - this game is not much about aerodynamics. Bigger planes are just for fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if You would have steering on bigger plane medium gear somwhere could help for taxi. But since You run heavy plane should not be suported (in theory) by them (they went up on nose). So rear is evil solution, but it works in KSP delivering angle of attack, and tweakable spring and dumper allow to abuse it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-21T11:08:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2021 11:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by vv3k70r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
