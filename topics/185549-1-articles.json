Modded or stock. Add a scanning arm to a part and you will not be able to select the part as a destination for a crew transfer. Transfers out of the part are fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: It appears that the Scanning Arm collider interferes with selecting a destination for crew transfers. If the arm is mounted too close to a crewable part that part cannot be selected as a destination for crew transfers. If the arm is moved far enough away then the part outside of the collider can be selected as a destination for crew transfers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can be a problem when there craft is relatively small relative to the arm\u0027s collider sphere. There may be no spot on a part clear of the collider that can be used to select the part as a destination for crew transfers and there\u0027s no indication either through error messages or on screen that there is a problem. The Scanner Preview can give you an idea of the effective radius of the collider, but it fades out due to obstructions\u00A0while the interferance does not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the sample craft below transfers from the Hitchhiker to the Lander Can work always. Crew transfers from the Lander Can to the Hitchhiker only work if I select an spot towards the top of the Hitchiker clear of the arm\u0027s collider. I cannot select the Hitchhiker towards its bottom within the collider of the arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve submitted this to the bug tracker as: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/22908\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E22908\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Please upvote.
