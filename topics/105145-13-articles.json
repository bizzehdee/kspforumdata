Spike has only a tiny bit more TWR, while 909 is lighter by 0.5t, and provides better ISP. And considering the last \u0022rocket only\u0022 push is so short deltaV wise, only 909 was mass effective, in my calculations, when compared to just bringing more fuel for RAPIERs.

Full throttle, Stage, turn immediately to 25 degrees above horizon.\n2. Stage 2 times when first stage runs out. (Seperation and engine ignition is staggered or the whole rocket may explode)\n3. Keep at 25 degrees.\n4. When AP \u003E60 km turn prograde.\n5. When AP \u003E70 km Throttle down.\n6. Stage when above 50 km to shed fairing.\n7.

Which is usually where most of the fuel mass is spent, boosters and all considered. If that had worked as I thought it would, it should have meant a massive improvement in payload fraction.\n\nBut instead it, mostly, just reduced the total dV expenditure.

First time posting, just got the game a few weeks ago.

While I don\u0027t think I could have lifted more (I barely made it up as it is), I think that if I optimized the rocket a bit more (reducing the size of my ejection engines would help a bit), I think I could get away with up to 25% efficiency.\n\nBy the way - I\u0027ve never seen anyone use the ejection engines that I am before. The reason I am using real engines instead of only sepratrons (I am using sepratrons, but not only those) is because I need a big enough kick-back from the main stack due to the length. If I just used sepratrons, the thrust on those isn\u0027t enough to move then quickly enough, especially when I am accelerating or turning (see image 6).\n\nHope you guys like it!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T02:29:24Z","Content":"Welcome aboard, wolfman29!

I never tested this specific rocket without the fairings (I\u0027ve been using those for big rockets for a while now), but I seem to get better results with than without. And I think someone did a pretty comprehensive review of the aerodynamics in 1.0.4 and found that just about anything significantly beats a rocket whose top is naked, including a pointy fairing.\n\nHowever! I actually made a small change to it and managed to bump up it\u0027s payload fraction by a few percentage points. That extra fuel I had just lying around?
