The reason I am using real engines instead of only sepratrons (I am using sepratrons, but not only those) is because I need a big enough kick-back from the main stack due to the length. If I just used sepratrons, the thrust on those isn\u0027t enough to move then quickly enough, especially when I am accelerating or turning (see image 6).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you guys like it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T02:29:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard, wolfman29!
