You can easily add those resource by module manager, Ill put together one and attach it to this post, shortly (ill include it in the next patch for those that are interested) Also regarding MKS, I should also be including some configs to add logistics support Civpop parts, to ease transfers of resources. \n\nRegarding Life support: Your using USI-LS per your post, i assume. Ill double check the numbers on life support production. (I havent in a while since Rovers last USI-LS patch and i need to make sure everything is good) I couldn\u0027t tell via your post if you station was orbital or ground based. But Orbital stations are gonna be slightly lossy, they will not be closed loop, you need some input of water and substrate occasionally. (though they recycling rate is fairly high) Ground based stations obviously you can solve this problem with the drills. I also want to, in the near future include some sort of Capstone module (say a recycling plant?) that would make you closed loop. \n\nLastly regarding civilian transportation. I am finalizing the model and textures on a civilian transportation part ( i talked about this a few pages back) That will transport 50 civilians at time, but its significantly smaller than the 50 civ Apartment, and are stackabled for ease of movment. Think of it as putting the civilians in cold storage, they wont require food, but the modules will require large amounts of electricity and will be somewhat expensive, they cant be recruited from either. Once connected to a base, the civilians will be woken, and start consuming supplies. \n\nHopefully this answers all your questions\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-19T21:53:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rabidninjawombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Admac","CreatedById":126280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T22:18:50Z","Content":"Brilliant! \n\nThanks for the drill part!\n\nI read that older post about the crew transfer, so that\u0027s exciting! once in space it\u0027s kind of a non issue, but it\u0027s a bit of an aerodynamic pain to boost Apartment blocks up.\n\nThe Logistics hub works a treat, and I was happy to see I could shuffle civvies that way, which is a lot easier than my fears of docking a 350 ton ship with a 2000 ton station.\n\nIt is orbital, mainly to show up those jerks that think 120 tons in LKO is a huge station over in that grand orbital station challenge. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nThe other thing I noticed is that it isn\u0027t consuming my fertilizer.

It lands and collects ore from minmus and takes back off into space. Fully loaded it has a Kerbin TWR of 2 with all the engines and reactors on, but usually I just stick with the MHD because it is more efficient and has enough TWR to lift off of minmus. This sucker is brutal and can create 10 very large stations in orbit before it needs to land again to resupply with metal. It has a 32 Kerbal work crew, 30 in workshops 2 in that EPL on the nose. It has a cost of 140 million monetary units (if I would not have built it with my EPL lander on minmus) and produces nearly 9 terawatts of power from it\u0027s reactors. Using welding I kept the part numbers down 107.

I didn\u0027t quite expect there to be a full 100% perfect reuse of water from liquidwaste, but the amount you need to mine or resupply is quite cumbersome and doesn\u0027t improve much by adding more water recycling per civilian. Ideally, technology of this scale should be engineered for near-perfect sustainability from launch. Alternative - have civilians generate fuel (methane gas?) from the lost mass and make it a closed-cycle w/ additional benefits. Pie in the sky.\n\nTransport module looks amazing. I hope there\u0027s also a smaller versions cause I\u0027d rather not use tweakscale for a heatshield. If I have to keep this in orbit, maybe a non-cryogenic civilian passenger part (even if identical to existing passegner parts for mk2/mk3 fuselage - re-use the exteriors and IVA) to shuttle from orbit to surface while kolonizing. Would probably need some life support resource storage of it\u0027s own (3 days??) since there are no existing small tanks which would be aerodynamic."},{"CreatedByName":"namAehT","CreatedById":99787,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T02:14:32Z","Content":"would it be possible to get a notification in KSP when you get paid rent?

The big drawback is the current USILS config for Civpop needs a lot of water, but that\u0027s a non issue if you have a surface base on a patch of water.\n\nOption 2) Install TAC Lifesupport\n\n There are baked in Configs for MKS to switch over to TACLS, and then all the Civpop production will tie in. The drawback to this way is there are no Kontainers for TACLS stuff, so you\u0027ll have to use the ones bundled in TACLS, which look different.\n\nTotally not an Option) Install both. This will cause a hilariously huge number of problems, and be brutally buggy. DO NOT DO.\n\nIv\u0027e done it both ways, either work fine, and I preferred USI LS since it was a bit less to keep track of in the resource panel. TAC would really shine if there were a way to easily suck in the thin Duna atmosphere of C02, and make fuel and breathable air but I haven\u0027t seen any part packs with that yet, but I haven\u0027t really looked.\n\nA super realistic IRSU pack would be pretty fun for people that like more constraints on colonies!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-04T18:18:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2015 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Admac**"},{"CreatedByName":"entropy--","CreatedById":139306,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T00:19:52Z","Content":"I had USI LS before (no TAC LS), and was not seeing the tie in.

Are the numbers for supplies / second correct when using USI LS? It looked like all sizes of houses / agriculture modules consumed / produced the same 3 / 3.55 supplies per second (including the really huge ones). Let me know if you want to see any screenshots.\n\nAlso, are the masses of the dome bases correct? The ones with grass seem to have lower mass than similarly sized empty ones.\n\nSorry for all the detailed questions, I just want to built a very big city on Duna, and whatever initial domed base I start with will serve as a template for all the rest, so making a mistake will mean I need to undo everything.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-05T14:08:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2015 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by entropy--**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T20:19:30Z","Content":"A little question.
