You can easily add those resource by module manager, Ill put together one and attach it to this post, shortly (ill include it in the next patch for those that are interested) Also regarding MKS, I should also be including some configs to add logistics support Civpop parts, to ease transfers of resources. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding Life support: Your using USI-LS per your post, i assume. Ill double check the numbers on life support production. (I havent in a while since Rovers last USI-LS patch and i need to make sure everything is good) I couldn\u0027t tell via your post if you station was orbital or ground based. But Orbital stations are gonna be slightly lossy, they will not be closed loop, you need some input of water and substrate occasionally. (though they recycling rate is fairly high) Ground based stations obviously you can solve this problem with the drills. I also want to, in the near future include some sort of Capstone module (say a recycling plant?) that would make you closed loop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly regarding civilian transportation. I am finalizing the model and textures on a civilian transportation part ( i talked about this a few pages back) That will transport 50 civilians at time, but its significantly smaller than the 50 civ Apartment, and are stackabled for ease of movment. Think of it as putting the civilians in cold storage, they wont require food, but the modules will require large amounts of electricity and will be somewhat expensive, they cant be recruited from either. Once connected to a base, the civilians will be woken, and start consuming supplies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this answers all your questions\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-19T21:53:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rabidninjawombat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Admac","CreatedById":126280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T22:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the drill part!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read that older post about the crew transfer, so that\u0027s exciting! once in space it\u0027s kind of a non issue, but it\u0027s a bit of an aerodynamic pain to boost Apartment blocks up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Logistics hub works a treat, and I was happy to see I could shuffle civvies that way, which is a lot easier than my fears of docking a 350 ton ship with a 2000 ton station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is orbital, mainly to show up those jerks that think 120 tons in LKO is a huge station over in that grand orbital station challenge. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I noticed is that it isn\u0027t consuming my fertilizer.

I didn\u0027t quite expect there to be a full 100% perfect reuse of water from liquidwaste, but the amount you need to mine or resupply is quite cumbersome and doesn\u0027t improve much by adding more water recycling per civilian. Ideally, technology of this scale should be engineered for near-perfect sustainability from launch.
