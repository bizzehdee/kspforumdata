Unpause, then immediately pause once physics load. Unpause after one second, immediately launch, correct wobble in time to avoid the tower, engage ASAS. Sometimes it worked.).

Somehow, I lucked into an encounter and after using the Mk.50A to get there (Mk.42-MK.50 were not very successful), I eventually reworked it into something that could carry a full lander.

Well past the point of no return I realized they were gonna run out of life support just over halfway home. As the ground crew hurried overnight to prep a snack pack to do a high-speed rendezvous, Gregden dreamed up a solution. He did some calc\u0027s and figured he had enough dV to put the craft on a hyperbolic return course, drastically cutting the return time. Mission control was spared the difficulty of a high-speed intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the only concern was whether the heat shield could handle the 3500m/s re-entry, so Kelden decided not to jettison the service module and burned it off instead. Gasping for breath, they popped the hatch as soon as the chutes were fully open, then jumped out and kissed the ground when the capsule landed. They fainted when they saw the sliver of heat shield remaining.
