It can be seen as an inversion of indication of progress - instead of scientists creating new engines and systems in the background while the space program putters along and expands, you have the act of the space program boldly going where it hasn\u0027t gone before, expressed in accumulated research points, serving as the indication of the scientists\u0027 progress on the new engines and systems.

From everything the devs have said so far we\u0027ll eventually get something like what you want, where you exchange one type of \u0022point\u0022 (time/money in a 4X, in KSP\u0027s case money and reputation) for another (science in both cases). KSP isn\u0027t a 4X game, and I doubt it ever will be, so we don\u0027t need a traditional 4X research system. Since KSP gameplay is more personal goal-oriented (rather than story or mission driven) there needs to be a mechanic that fits that gameplay. The current science works just fine. Just wait until you can exchange \u0022points\u0022 in KSP for other \u0022points\u0022, that will probably open up the perceived grind a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, if you think science now is grindy, I wonder how you think contracts and reputation will pan out...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MC.STEEL","CreatedById":89456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T18:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epoint taken, i will stop nagging about it now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vetrox","CreatedById":69796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T19:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love me that sandbox mode \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECannot wait for the economy to see what challenges it adds to career mode.

What are you talking about anyway? It\u0027s not at all grindy unless you decide to exhaust a body for science before moving on to the next. If you decide to launch a brand new craft for each tidbit of science you want, yeah, that could make the game a little grindy, but you don\u0027t need to. As for how collecting temperature data on the mun helps you unlock a mainsail, Research Grants. As for your first suggestion, do you really want to play a game that makes you pointlessly wait or a game where you unlock stuff for actually accomplishing something in your own creative way (and even if you did have to wait, science doesn\u0027t work like \u0022it\u0027ll take this long exactly\u0022, it\u0027s \u0022we have no idea how long this will take, hey, go see how this works, we might be onto something\u0022).
