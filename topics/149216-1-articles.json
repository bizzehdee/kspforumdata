It appears that as of 1.1.3 drag is still getting applied to things inside cargo bays. Is there something I can mod myself to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-04T01:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, it\u0027s tricky searching on it because things changed so much between versions. \u00A0I was banging on this problem a lot in 1.1.3. \u00A0You can definitely make it work in stock though, with some restrictions. \u00A0First of all, are you using AeroGUI in the Alt-F12 menu to look at per-part drag?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond - anything node-attached to the front or rear of the cargo bay, and things surface-attached to that central \u0027parent\u0027 part, should be shielded from drag. \u00A0Anything surface-attached to the front, rear, or interior\u00A0sides of the bay won\u0027t. \u00A0Anything that gets moved too far from the interior of the bay with the offset gizmo will get drag. \u00A0Anything that gets clipped ever so slightly past the front or rear of the bay will get drag. \u00A0With Mk2 bays you often have parts visually clipping through the top and bottom - these may or may not get drag depending on their\u00A0exact drag cubes, but generally you can have it adjusted just a fraction of a pixel behind the visual surface of the bay and you\u0027ll be OK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything that gets hot and blows up inside the bay - it\u0027s getting drag. \u00A0I see people sometimes using radiators in the bay, they\u0027d be better off investigating with AeroGUI. \u00A0Usually a tiny offset adjustment is all that\u0027s needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sresk","CreatedById":167879,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-04T17:08:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo After a LOT of messing around I figures out half my problem was what you described and half my problem was \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E :/ As soon as I got rid of it I could move stuff around and adjust what it was attached to and fix the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
