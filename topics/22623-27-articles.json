I wish there was a way to query the mechjeb mode... or at least keep track of the last command that Telemachus sent to it... that way you could use lighted buttons that would show you what autopilot mode you currently had selected. This would be especially handy since the on-screen A.S.S. window just says \u0022Auto\u0022 when it\u0027s responding to a Telemachus command. If that\u0027s overly tough... would it be substantially easier to query mechjeb to find out if ANY autopilot control is currently active, so you could activate a light that told you that mechjeb was controlling the ship, so you knew to press the \u0027off\u0027 button if you wanted it to let go?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help anyone can provide! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dishycourier","CreatedById":35171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T00:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have this working perfectly with .24 x64. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas there any word on camera feeds, or did that feature just not work out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T07:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dishycourier\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dishycourier\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have this working perfectly with .24 x64. \u003Cp\u003EWas there any word on camera feeds, or did that feature just not work out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was implemented as another project \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79605-0-23-5-Go-At-Throttle-Up-May-11-2014\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dishycourier","CreatedById":35171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T08:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rich\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rich\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt was implemented as another project \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79605-0-23-5-Go-At-Throttle-Up-May-11-2014\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh wow.
