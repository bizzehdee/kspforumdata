For example, our sun is much more diverse in its \u0022biomes\u0022 than KSP would suggest, as seen here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/Transitional_regions.jpg/799px-Transitional_regions.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022799px-Transitional_regions.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s just the edge. There\u0027s just as much variety when you get closer to the sun, though as we all know almost none of it is captured in KSP\u0027s science mechanics. Someone should really fix this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KNSA Scientist","CreatedById":74995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T23:11:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with more biomes is that means more science, and you can already max out the tech tree in the Kerbin system anyways. There would be absolutely no point in going anywhere else if not for roleplay reasons. What we really need is a science overhaul, something that can take the grind out of science.
