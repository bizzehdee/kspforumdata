But today, he found the door of his office blocked by more than a dozen planetary scientists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Morning gentlekerbs. What are you doing here on this fine day?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We need a mission to Eeloo\u0022, said the obvious leader of the group, the most well-known planetary scientist ever lived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We need to send a robotic exploration mission to Eeloo during the upcoming Kerbin - Eeloo launch window, 51 days from now. We have made the request at the KASEA Annual Mission Planning Conference earlier this year, AND last year, and have written you about this many times before.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But they were all rejected! You know as well as I do that all R100[2] class launchers are being used for our Duna Outpost missions, and we have no excess capacity to build any extra R100 core, or for that matter any open slot on Pad B[3] until next year.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There IS an extra R140, ready for launch 50 days from now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But that\u0027s reserved for the contingency launch in case the upcoming Duna Outpost SSP[4] launch failed! You people don\u0027t want our guys on Duna to miss that Advanced Mobile Lab, or the Deep Core Drill, or all the other experiment equipment, designed by you and your colleagues, do you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But let\u0027s say the upcoming launch did not fail - R140 hasn\u0027t failed once in the last 17 launches - that particular R140 and that pad slot could then open for other uses, such as an Eeloo mission.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Err...but even if you have that R140 launch, how could you build your spacecraft for Eeloo in 50 days? And without funding?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s already built. We\u0027re going to use Trinity-9.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But Trinity missions are for the Mun!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They are. But from our observations we believe Eeloo is quite similar to the Mun in many key properties, like the surface gravity and deltaV needed during landing. So Trinity spacecrafts would be quite suitable for Eeloo. The design also provides very comprehensive coverage of a planet with an orbiter, an impactor, and a lander - rover, all launched as a single craft. It\u0027s got almost every capability we need and is perfect for the first Eeloo mission. So all that\u0027s left to do, once you give the permission, is to replace a few Trinity-9 instruments with Eeloo-specific instruments, which we have already built.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay. You gentlekerbs clearly came prepared today. I assume you have also convinced the owner of Trinity missions to give up Trinity-9?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, they have. We already had 8 very successful Trinity missions, and dozens of other robotic and crewed missions to the Mun, so delaying or even canceling one Trinity mission isn\u0027t going to change very much, compared to what we might learn on a first Eeloo mission. Plus, my colleagues and I in the Trinity Team will be involved in designing this Eeloo mission and controlling the spacecraft, and we are all very excited about that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Doesn\u0027t Eeloo missions take a huge amount of deltaV? Is R140 capable enough for that? I must remind you that you\u0027ll absolutely not be permitted to use the NERVA Interplanetary Tugs. They are all dedicated to Duna Outpost construction until at least end of next year.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It does take a quite a bit of deltaV - around 3600m/s from LKO to a low orbit around Eeloo for the upcoming transfer window. But Trinity is light - less than 2 tons even after our modifications. Put it on a MCU/S and it will have more than 4500m/s left in the MCU after achieving LKO and another 500m/s in Trinity itself - quite enough even if we made some mistakes with the burns. Oh and these calculations assume Trinity and the MCU sits on just the R100 core - we save you four boosters\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You do need the extra MCU/S ... but we do have a few of those in the warehouse.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Because they aren\u0027t getting any use since the beginning of the Duna Outpost program.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How long till it arrives at Eeloo?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A year and 8 days after launch, give or take a few days. If things goes well, the rover should run at least 3 months, the lander a year, and the orbiter 2 years. And those are pretty conservative estimates from our experience with Trinity missions on the Mun, as you know.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Trinity is indeed a pretty good design. Why can\u0027t you wait until next year, when Duna Outpost launches start to wind down? Repurposing a launch 50 days from now, from a R140 launch to a R101 launch is going to cause lots of disruptions. And you know very well our Duna Outpost launch schedule is very tight at the moment with little room for delays.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ve been waiting for years - there won\u0027t be another window with such a low deltaV requirement in almost 3 years. This I have mentioned several times before. What I haven\u0027t mentioned is that even when that window comes, there\u0027s very likely another big manned [was: kerbaled] program going on that makes Pad B unavailable for robotic missions. I heard Duna Outpost Phase 3 is getting popular with the politicians, and even the Laythe Outpost Concept is getting lots of attention after the water sample return mission. So I...we are all worried that we\u0027ll never get an Eeloo mission, until they are bored with the soup opera on Duna.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey just be glad we didn\u0027t send Jeb \u0026amp; his friends to Duna, or the public may never be bored with Duna Outpost missions. And you really don\u0027t want them to be bored, because when they do, \u0027those boring uncrewed missions\u0027 as some Kerbals higher up call them will be first programs they ask KASEA to cut.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But you know what, you gentlekerbs made a pretty convincing case today so you have my support. Afterall, the \u0027S\u0027 in KASEA meant \u0027science\u0027, and I can\u0027t make our best scientists unhappy for the next few years. We need to move really quickly for this to work out so let me call a few guys now and let\u0027s a have a meeting in ... 2 hours. Okay?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wow. Yes! Sure!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, I forgot to ask, what exactly do you expect to find on Eeloo?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We don\u0027t know.
