(MTV)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECopernicus was part of a proposal that involved the launch of multiple components into LEO where they would be assembled into complete vehicles. First would be four launches to assemble two vehicles (1 propulsion unit / 1 aeroshell re-entry vehicle) which would fly to Mars in advance of the manned mission. One would land on arrival where it would begin producing fuel from Martian resources (\u003Cem\u003Ein situ\u003C/em\u003E). The other would be a habitat lander which would remain in martian orbit awaiting the arrival of the crewed mission later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pack will contain the necessary parts to build a similar rocket using either stock components or parts from other mods.

Other useful mods (required for RSS compatible vehicles) will be Stretchy Tanks and Modular Fuel Tanks. (list not complete)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Copernicus will require three launches. A propulsion stage using three 111.2kN nuclear thermal rockets (NTR), a saddle truss containing a liquid hydrogen drop tank and an inflatable habitat section. Depicted below is the saddle truss, which is open at the bottom to allow the jettisoning of spent components (such as the drop tank or empty crew consumables module) Attached to the ends of the saddle truss are the docking rings. The propulsion unit and habitat units will be equipped with similar rings allowing them to be docked together. The model is not as yet properly textured. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently there are three parts. The saddle truss, a truss adapter ring and the docking rings. The adapter rings will contain control modules to allow adapter equipped stages to be oriented for docking. Another adapter is planned for inflatable module attachment.

I stuck it on the end of a 10m x 30m StretchyTank with the shiny gold foil texture applied, looked at it some more, then grabbed the big single piece Balka wings from Kosmo and slapped four of those behind the hab and that was all I needed to make my decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll actually use the Balka in the final craft files as it\u0027s a little too long...
