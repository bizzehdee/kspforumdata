As it looks like one of the more interesting eggs in the game, I thought I\u0027d set up a mission to go there and take a few snaps for posterity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pressed an old Duna ship in to service, as it had bags of delta V and would easily make the trip, though the parachutes on the lander would be a bit redundant for a landing on Vall. Launch from Kerbin was in two parts - Command module and insertion stage, and lander and habitation stage - which were docked together whilst in Orbit around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer to the Jool system went swimmingly, and an elliptical orbit established around Vall. This was when the problem occurred. At this point, a staging event should have fired a decoupler to release the insertion stage, which basically consists of a jumbo fuel tank and two nuclear engines. Unfortunately, it fired but didn\u0027t separate. The Command module engine should have then been used to circularise the orbit around Vall, and when the mission was completed, used to bring everyone home. With a jumbo fuel tank still hanging off the back end of the craft, this is no longer an option, so the bods back at the space centre have got their thinking caps on to try and come up with a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add more as the situation develops.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T18:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t add more yet.
