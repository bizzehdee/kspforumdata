Rockets with tailfins for control would end up doing flips at random. I\u0027ve seen it happen a few times in Scott Manley\u0027s videos as well, so I know its not just me having this problem. With or without tailfins I was unable to get rockets with significant payloads into orbit with FAR enabled because the rocket would just flip end over end as soon as I went off of total vertical, and this occured no matter how much aerodynamic control I attempted to add or remove, with or without fairings around the payload. The same rocket flies flawlessly without FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T15:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly that plucking the tailfins/winglets from my design made it quite stable again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T15:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnly that plucking the tailfins/winglets from my design made it quite stable again.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish that had worked for me, but its a bit nonsensical.
