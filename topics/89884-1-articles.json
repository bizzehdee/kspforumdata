I was testing it around Jool - land and re-orbit Bop. On the placing circularization maneuver node I observed the dv required \u0027drifting\u0027 slowly (1 m/s /s maybe), but I could work around that ok. Next I did an escape burn and then set up a Pol encounter, again the node dv \u0026amp; marker drifted, so I stuck with the original marker and eye balled and tweaked the burn till I had an encounter \u0026amp; shut down the engine. After only a few real minutes (sorry cannot recall game time) the encounter disappeared. I established an new one, shut down the engine, and watched the encounter from within the Pol SOI I could see it drift off and out and be lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was like the ship was under some small constant acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas this kind of thing been see before? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve using Engineer, MechJeb, Alarm Clock, RCS planner, \u0026amp; Hyper Edit.
