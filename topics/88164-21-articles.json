Does this not make sense, logically or physically? Also, I\u0027d actually prefer this over wobbly craft because of a shaky joystick of a newbie pilot. Secondly, since when has KSP been in the realm of \u0022realistic physics?\u0022 Small planetary bodies, soupospheres, OP Ion engines, all that \u0022law-bending\u0022 stuff has been in the game for a while now.

People would rather have constant ship statuses, and do whatever they wish with their kerbals, than to give the kerbals a little control over the ship that they\u0027re piloting. Giving Kerbal XP perks to the ship, they\u0027re on, and the rest of kerbel XP, helps give kerbals a little bit of character, rather than be a blank clone with a name. Now you could give you kerbals some character yourself, but sometimes is funner to let the game play out and see them make a character for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, Kerbal XP isn\u0027t really meant to be such a big gameplay mechanic, rather to be something to further characterize your roster of eager green kerbonauts. Sure, some XP perks don\u0027t really follow laws of physics, but we still don\u0027t know all the details about kerbal XP yet. Like, oh, exactly how they get it? Sure, they said that they get it from flying lots of missions, but that explanation is vague at best.

I think for that to work in a game, you need systems that are essentially abstracted beyond the point where the player can control them directly (e.g. the details of combat in a turn based RPG). Sim-style games are usually fairly devoid of these kinds of abstracted systems. You might have the odd example like the speed at which someone can unjam a gun in a WWI flight sim or what have you, which really isn\u0027t something the player would be able to control to a sufficient degree to make it entirely dependent on the player\u0027s own actions, or situations in which the player can\u0027t effectively control everything going on and thus an XP system can serve to determine the efficiency of AI at various posts (say like in a submarine or WWII bomber simulator) but usually these details aren\u0027t enough to warrant an entire XP system for your crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s basically what\u0027s happening here in KSP.

I think the question they should really be asking is why the game needs an XP system in the first place, much as I\u0027ve previously said about the admin building and the strategies I feel were included largely just to justify its existence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Actually, a good example of an XP system in an appropriate context is KSP\u0027s own science system. The details of conducting scientific research are obviously beyond the player\u0027s direct control and thus must be abstracted to be a reasonable part of the game. At this point, inserting XP in the form of \u0022science points\u0022 is so natural a gameplay mechanism that we tend to not even think about it for what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Kerbal XP on the other hand, an attempt seems to be being made to abstract systems which we already have direct control over and thus an XP system winds up feeling distinctly unnatural. It\u0027s basically a case where control is being *removed* from the player in order to justify an XP system rather than an XP system being created to fill in the blanks the player has no ability to control. IMO, it\u0027s moving the game away from interactivity as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I don\u0027t think the issue with the XP system is the particular variables you have it affecting (engine performance, etc.), I think that it\u0027s more an issue that the game is ill-suited for such a system in the first place, and it may be entirely reasonable to consider scrapping it entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is coming from a guy that is ONLY interested in playing career mode, so career/sandbox bias isn\u0027t a factor here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T22:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter reading over what Maxmaps said; I have this to say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust PLEASE don\u0027t make it a passive effect that increases the thrust of all throttleable engines.

Is it because of miss information? A want for completely real physics? \u003Cp\u003EIf you didn\u0027t know, kerbals don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Emagically\u003C/em\u003E make an engine ISP greater, or thrust larger. They\u0027ve been astronauts for longer, flown more missions, and they would know how to make a rocket work better and preform more efficiently than newer kerbals. Does this not make sense, logically or physically? Also, I\u0027d actually prefer this over wobbly craft because of a shaky joystick of a newbie pilot. Secondly, since when has KSP been in the realm of \u0022realistic physics?\u0022 Small planetary bodies, soupospheres, OP Ion engines, all that \u0022law-bending\u0022 stuff has been in the game for a while now. All of it (besides the souposphere stuff) is there to make this not just fun to use as a space simulator, but fun as a space game as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty obvious that the major bias here is simulator before game (yes, they are two different things). People would rather have constant ship statuses, and do whatever they wish with their kerbals, than to give the kerbals a little control over the ship that they\u0027re piloting. Giving Kerbal XP perks to the ship, they\u0027re on, and the rest of kerbel XP, helps give kerbals a little bit of character, rather than be a blank clone with a name. Now you could give you kerbals some character yourself, but sometimes is funner to let the game play out and see them make a character for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, Kerbal XP isn\u0027t really meant to be such a big gameplay mechanic, rather to be something to further characterize your roster of eager green kerbonauts. Sure, some XP perks don\u0027t really follow laws of physics, but we still don\u0027t know all the details about kerbal XP yet. Like, oh, exactly how they get it? Sure, they said that they get it from flying lots of missions, but that explanation is vague at best. They never really said specifically how your kerbals get certain XP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I see Maxmaps has already gone over this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot logical -at all-. Tell me how do you change the combustion chamber size, the plumbing, the turbo-pump capacity, etc in flight and then we may talk about it. If those physical changes were to exist (they do, actually, SSMEs were fined tuned multiple times for example to thrust more) why would they require a magical Kerbal instead of a technological advancement (like what most people wanted the tech tree to be about)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything else you mentioned here has been complained about multiple times, statements have been made about all of that: Atmosphere is getting overhauled, for example, and until now that\u0027s as certain as it can possibly be), the planetary body size problem will arise again and again, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eeven stronger once they change the aerodynamics\u003C/strong\u003E. The OP ion engine has been discussed to hell and back, and the final word from squad was \u0022it\u0027s more fun to have them be OP\u0022, yet the topic is mentioned really often.
