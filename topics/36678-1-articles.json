In the comments people were talking about a guy named Nerd^3. I went to his channel to find a plethora of video\u0027s about games I have never heard about. I went to his first free games extravaganza. The one thing I saw that made me want the game was the mission report after the accidents. It took a while but then I landed on a youtuber by the name of Kurtjmac. He introduced me to many fandoms including hooking me in on Kerbal Space Program.He taught me everything about basic orbital mechanics. After watching his video\u0027s I got the first Demo 13.3. Then I was watching some person complaining about the gilly collision mesh problem. In th comments someone said something about a guy named Scott Manly. He taught me about the math involved in being a space program. Finally I discovered Danny2462 who finally made me want the game more then anything. I watched Kerbalkon II wanting to be able to play .18 when it was released. I watched all the Dev live-streams wanting to be a part of the community. I finally bought the game after Christmas.

Three months later I have clocked up 338 hours (all stock) and have only just started to explore Duna. I love the natural progression of this game at first getting to orbit is tricky but after a while it becomes second nature, same with docking and landing on the Mun / Minmus. Now I am trying to make a rocket that will get me to Duna and back without having to send a rescue party or tanker hopefully I will crack that this evening. I must say a big thank you to all the youtubers that have helped me so much with KSP and of course all the guys at Squad for making such a fun geeky game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T15:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThree people.
