Thinking about it, with such a long body you could easily position the engines above and under the center wing to maintain \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E stability without stacking. But the reason I share that particular video is because it shows the ion stack issue in a overdone kind of way.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat just looks absolutely ridiculous, having that one rear facing single unobstructed engine producing the same thrust as 2kn times the amount of engines he has stacked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat is not the kind of game exploit that I think should exist in KSP.
