That\u0027s because the Double-C displays the forces as if it was placed perfectly on the center of mass, regardless of its actual position (and being an accelerometer, it\u0027s only able to measure directional forces - you\u0027d need a gyroscope to measure rotational forces).\n\nPutting the seismometer on a vessel that is inside a second vessel, which is rotating (inducing centrifugal force on the first vessel) does measure acceleration correctly, nothing broken there (and I think this is what you remember).\n\nI put up a quick test rig to demonstrate:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I remember it working on one centrifuge station I\u0027ve built. I was getting a bit over 1 G with moderate rotation. However in the last two, possibly three versions of KSP, such feature is gone.

This would allow for things like what the OP is suggesting (centrigual force readings) as well as letting kerbals on EVA walk inside spinning rings. That\u0027d be cool!"}]}
