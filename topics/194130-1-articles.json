The only building that works is the Astronaut complex. The water is also missing from around the Space Center and I can not pan the camera (though I can zoom it?). I had an issue installing Kerbalism where I forgot KerbalismConfig and it threw a super nasty error, but I installed that and now it gets past that error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any idea what is going on? Really would appreciate some help, I\u0027ve been wanting to play some KSP and have been trying to get this game to work to no avail. Modding is getting really tricky these days it seems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
