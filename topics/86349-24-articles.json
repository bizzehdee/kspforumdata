I have a MSI GT70, with full ram, 4xcore etc) and it just DO\u0027NT WORK. It takes minutes (real minutes) to move a Kerbal from a place A to a place B, distance ? Yep, 5 meters, let\u0027s say. Same for vehicules, ships, etc. Do you think poeple love that ? I do not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of trying to improve the performance of this game you did the wrong, so point 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 seriousely who cares about contracts and money ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I do not pretend to be right but for me and if you follow a LOT of KSP vids on YT, you will see that the principle is to have fun, to builds rockets, to explore muns and planets, to have orbital stations, docking stations, bases, and test and try different concepts within the game physic (such as some stange copters and so on)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You just broke all of that when including contract (what contracts ? there is NOBODY on Kerbin except the space center ? did you see \u0022towns\u0022 or \u0022factories\u0022 elsewhere ? Nope, I don\u0027t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Who cares about money ? Are you an american biznessman or what ? What a lot of us was A DREAM, can you understand ? A lot of us dream about visiting planets, the galaxy, or why not other galaxies (see the Scott Mandley videos for example on YT) ... Do you really think that \u0022money\u0022 is in count of that ? Poor guys :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play KSP in (old) career mode. That means I have to collect science. It is fun, a challenge, and so I do not have \u0022all my cards in my hand\u0022 at the begining. But your contracts and your money ? Sorry, I don\u0027t want that, I just want to experiment and explore, and make my own ships, and base, and pilot skills, hoping that one day I will be able to share that with others (waiting for multiplayer)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 the community\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- did you realize that without all the community and their work and mods your \u0022game\u0022 is just \u0022unplayable\u0022 ? Without for example MechJeb ? Or any navball improvements, any addons to build your craft in VAB ? Any plugin that allows you to save games, select a target (targetron for example), ways to display and transfer resources and/or crew etc ? Not spoking about multiple usefull parts, and of the resources mechanism (such as KAS, Kethane, Launchpad, etc) so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- what did you did for them ? NOTHING. At the worse you did nothing. At the best you did the worse. You moved to \u0022curse\u0022, I do not know if it\u0027s a financial impact for you, but, if it\u0027s the case, it\u0027s a shame. I tell you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Why ? Because you are loosing a lot of poeple beleaving in you. Let me explain this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is the BEST space game ever known (and I think it, I\u0027ve been trying a lot of, no success, and I will NOT give their names)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is the best because you can really make your very own ship, customize, travel, make plans and bases, forget something,get crashed, or, at least do what you wanted to do) ... I do not like space games where you have a limited number of \u0022pre-designed\u0022 ships and all you have to do is changing their weaponry, shields, etc ... no way\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, if I have advices:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 improve the global game performances (is is normal to slow down to 1 FPS ?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 forget the money and contracts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 say thanks to the modders, and please, offer a tool such as Nexus Mod Manager (why to not call them ?) which is really a GREAT tool to manage mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 say double thanks to the modders, because without them (and also the youtubers) your game is ... lost (that will be a pitty)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESY\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELKS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T02:50:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LukeStrike\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LukeStrike\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- did you realize that without all the community and their work and mods your \u0022game\u0022 is just \u0022unplayable\u0022 ?

That said, the interface should really have several improvements and include stuff like KAC and some Targetron/Haystack analogue. As for performance, some people would say it\u0027s a Unity problem due the lack of multithreading, but I wonder why the game needs to calculate physics on static ships. If you are approaching a base or a space station in a stable position with hundreds of parts and your ship\u0027s exhaust isn\u0027t hitting the base/station, why bother calculating physics at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You don\u0027t, some people do. If you don\u0027t like it, you have sandbox or science sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Yes, there are mods that are essential and should be included in the game. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the issue with Curse. I like the idea of Nexus Mod Manager. However, I think mods are often simple to install and uninstall - the problem comes with mods that relay on other mods as dependencies, as those have several separate folders. If I\u0027m installing Karbonite, I may not need the ORS folder either. But if I want to keep Karbonite but remove another mod that uses ORS, I would need to remove parts of the ORS folder. B9 installs four or five folders. It can be done: check the mod\u0027s zip file, check the files included, remove them. But some sort of uninstall feature should be included. Some modders install their mods in a folder with their name first, so you don\u0027t see at a glance which is the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
