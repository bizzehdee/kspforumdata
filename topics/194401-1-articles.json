I think it would be a good a addition to\u00A0 carer mode/science mode\u00A0 if you needed resources to build your rockets. not just funds but also exp.. metal. some parts need resources from specific planets.\u00A0 you need to mine for some of the rarer resources\u00A0 to build with certain parts. simple idea for Prof of concept. you need Duna metal to build robotic parts and some of the more expensive engines\u00A0 you need a resource from Tylo to build RTGs you get the idea. each planet will have its own resource that you need to build with some parts. i would say i haven\u0027t given much thought to balance yet but i think it is possible. it should work like the funding system\u00A0\u00A0 you need so many units of this resource to build this part. i think there should be 3 modes first \u0027easy \u0027 where you can buy the resources for a high price in credits or if you do get the the resource\u00A0 it will cheapen the over all price to just the resource\u00A0 or\u00A0 a discounted price per part. \u0027normal\u0027 you cannot buy the resource\u00A0 but have to mine it and return it to Kerbin or with other mods like ground construction\u00A0 use it to build off world. lastly \u0027science mode\u0027 each part needing the resource would instead be lock to science entry exp- you get a surface sample off duna you unlock those parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthings that would need to be added:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncost per part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and space plane hanger\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nresources in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVab\u003C/abbr\u003E display\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe resources, weight of each resource, each world\u0027s richness ect..

Progression can easily be restricted to having EL workshops with varying capacities spread throughout the tech tree. The better you unlock, the faster you can build with the same number of kerbals. As for resource placement that\u0027s easy enough (but can be very tedious) to do without writing a plugin.
