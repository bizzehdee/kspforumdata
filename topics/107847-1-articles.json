Instead of having to use something like 34-ish rapiers and perhaps even more intakes, it would be great to have bigger and more powerful engines so that a spaceplane launch can be done at more than 2-4 FPS. And of course, the intakes to put on the other end of the engine nancelles. \n\nAlso there\u0027s a bug with the action group when working with many engines in the SPH. If the engines are moved, only the engines on one side actually react to the action group, the others don\u0027t.\n\nPS. I really like the new large wings though!"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T09:48:26Z","Content":"Well I was able to get a mk3 plane to circumnavigate fly with three basic jets so you just need to be tricky with your placment."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T10:54:10Z","Content":"I think we should make the current RAPIER a 2.5m engine, with a 2.5m set of shock cone intakes, ram intakes, and circular intakes, Turbojets and Basic Jets; and make a new, one-nozzled RAPIER engine for 1.25m."}]}
