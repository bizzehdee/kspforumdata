Instead of having to use something like 34-ish rapiers and perhaps even more intakes, it would be great to have bigger and more powerful engines so that a spaceplane launch can be done at more than 2-4 FPS. And of course, the intakes to put on the other end of the engine nancelles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso there\u0027s a bug with the action group when working with many engines in the SPH. If the engines are moved, only the engines on one side actually react to the action group, the others don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS.
