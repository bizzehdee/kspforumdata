The standard KSP shaders are absolutely horrid and no serious 3D artist would ever use them to display their work, even if it is to showcase the models as a mod for the game. Unless the images of the parts you see on this forum are screenshotted directly from the game, or from Unity with the KSP shaders applied, all the parts are being showcased with\u00A0peoples own custom material shaders applied to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a given and obvious that the parts you see in the images plastered in most mod threads on here are not going to look exactly like that in the game.
