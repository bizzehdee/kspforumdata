If you\u0027re using KAS as a dependency for a part, that doesn\u0027t mean you are redistributing any parts of KAS as your own, and that usage should fall under fair use as a derivative work (at most). The part config is (presumably) your creation, and in effect, would be equivalent to using an MM config to do the same thing. It may require KAS\u0027 modules to be present, but that doesn\u0027t mean KAS\u0027 creator can dictate which parts you may use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously doubt the legitimacy of this part of the license:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure the license is overstepping its bounds at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, that\u0027s an excessively draconian license, to presume to restrict what other authors may or may not do with their own works.
