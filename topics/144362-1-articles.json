There\u0027s no sudden loss of partial pressure to suck the gasses out and you can last a lot longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then you have Pandora. That\u0027s not a lack of oxygen or a lack of atmosphere. That\u0027s toxic gasses.

If 19.3 kPa is the limit, then... well, that only gets one from .23 atmospheres to having .42 atmospheres in the lungs... but... at .42 atmospheres, thats 0.084 atmospheres of O2 in there... we only need 0.053 atmospheres of O2 more to stop O2 from leaving our alveolous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.053 atmospheres in 5.8 liters is 0.307 liters of O2 at STP... 0.0137 mols of O2... ok... thats 33.% of our total O2 stores... thats better than the 64% for full lungs at equalized pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems we\u0027d need at least 0.685 ATM in our lungs at 20% O2 to prevent O2 from actively leaving our blood - at least when our blood is full saturated with O2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is clearly not a hard limit, as that occurs below 12,000 feet, and I can hike that high (although I did experience altitude sickness, going from nearly sea level to that high in 2 days was a big change... my uncle who lived in colorado was fine) - and for short durations I\u0027ve taken my hnagglider up to 11km without any O2 (one should probably use O2 above 10km, definitely above 12km as reactions and reasoning are impaired, which are more important when flying than when hiking).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed, people have climbed everest with no O2 - 29,000\u0027 or a mere 0.3 atmospheres. Of course, studies show they suffered brain damage... :/ and they spent a long time acclimating... and the measured blood O2 saturation levels were very low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway... asuming the maximum lung pressure differential (.19 atmospheres) then at 35,000\u0027, the air in your lungs can be like at 21,750\u0027 ... and in that air one doesn\u0027t pass out in seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on all the numbers I see, holding your breath should be able to significantly extend your time of consciousness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-27T16:09:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2016 04:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
