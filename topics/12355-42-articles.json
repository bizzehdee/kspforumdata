The visible marker on the map is great for rough positioning of your touchdown point, but it\u0027s not precise enough for setting down on a specific point. If we\u0027re going to stick with a single distance value, can we add a radial direction to the information displayed? So, instead of saying \u002212.3km\u0022 it would say \u002212.3km NE\u0022 or maybe even \u002212.3km @ 041\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would go a long way to eliminating the trial and error I\u0027m having to do on the descents now, as I figure out exactly what direction I need to steer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-23T02:17:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2013 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luvsan","CreatedById":60075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T02:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022daver4470\u0022 data-cite=\u0022daver4470\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been having a weird issue with the game that may be MechJeb related. I\u0027ve got a gaming laptop with a dual-graphics setup. There\u0027s an Nvidia GeForce 670M as the main graphics option, and the Intel on-die HD Graphics that are part of the Ivy Bridge processor in the system as a secondary option. The system basically uses the Ivy Bridge graphics for 2D applications, and switches to the 670M for games/etc.\u003Cp\u003EObviously I run KSP on the 670M. However, I\u0027ve been running into an issue where, as near as I can tell, something is actually stopping the 670M from being used as the graphics renderer. In practice, what happens is that KSP turns into a slideshow, and my GPU usage goes from a constant 75-80% to 0%. The common factor I\u0027ve run into is that this seems to happen while the rendezvous autopilot in MJ2.0 is doing its thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry changing it in the nvidia control panel to force it to always use the 670.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually have the same setup but haven\u0027t seen this problem as far as I know, I only lag with huge ships with lots of parts. Manage 3d settings-\u0026gt; global settings -\u0026gt; preferred graphics processor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to manually add it in the program settings tab I am guessing you have done this hence the gpu switching. Just curious if it\u0027s forced if it would work then, a pain yes but then you would be able to play at least. Just make sure to turn it off or you will get crap battery life.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jawzy","CreatedById":60088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T03:38:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off I apologize if these questions have been answered before, I did try and search with no luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been trying to get mechjeb to operate properly all day with little luck. First, I tried the 2.0.7 version, but every time I tried to use the ascent assist, it never put me in a parking orbit, just kept going, long past the orbit of the next few plants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I then uninstalled KSP completely and installed the 1.9.8 version. I had varying luck with it. I was able to get mechjeb to put in a 100k parking orbit a few times with no problem. But ran into an issue where after I was in parking orbit, none of my (non-mechjeb) commands would work. I could not increase thrust, rotate, or anything, map commands did work though. If I messed with the ascent assist again, it would adjust the throttle, but the engines would not fire. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis issue with my commands not being able to operate by hand I think leads to the next issue, after in parking orbit, I tried to have mechjeb land my craft. It would warp to the proper location, tell me it was thursting, but there was clearly nothing happening. I also tried to have mechjeb put me in a transfer orbit to the mun, it would warp to the right spot, tell me its firing my engines yet nothing was happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy last attempt with mechjeb before writing this post, I had my original issue with the ascent assist not putting me in orbit, but continuing to send me out to some far out galaxy.
