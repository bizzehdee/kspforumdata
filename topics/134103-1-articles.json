space\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA lone relay in high circular polar orbit around Kerbin, about 35,000 km or so.\u00A0 This has a DTS-M1 in cone mode pointed at Kerbin, to keep it in touch with the low-orbit ring.\u00A0 It then has a bunch of 88-88 dishes for handling communication in the inner system (everything out to and including Duna), and three or four of the big Reflectrons dishes for talking to Dres / Jool / Eeloo with one left over for ship communications.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEach target planet gets a single relay satellite in high polar orbit, with either an 88-88 or a big Reflectron on it to keep touch with Kerbin, then a set of\u00A0 DTS-M1s in cone mode pointed at the planet and its moons.\u00A0 (Or, in the case of Jool, 88-88s.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interplanetary network thus consists of a single link from Kerbin to each of the target planets, with each relay handling the downlink to

This means that ships orbiting other planets can only communicate for part of their orbits, and if they land on the far side they\u0027ll be out of touch until the other planet rotates so the LZ faces Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, you only have this degree of communications provided the sun, other planets, and/or moons aren\u0027t blocking the LOS. \u00A0You can deal with the other planets and moons by putting your Kerbin relays in highly elliptical polar orbits going up or down so that they can shoot over or under the intervening bodies, but this doesn\u0027t work for the sun, and eventually your target planet will be on the opposite side of the sun from Kerbin. \u00A0Thus, there\u0027s really no escaping having to create at least a few extra-Kerbin relays, either in solar orbits or in elliptical polar orbits at some of the other planets, to be able to talk around the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s where a fundamental limitation of RT rears its ugly head. \u00A0That is the lack of dynamic linking between relays. \u00A0The only dynamic linking is for \u0022active vessel\u0022---everything else has to be manually aimed at a specific target, and these targets can only be changed manually. \u00A0RT isn\u0027t smart enough to have relays choose their own alternate paths in the event of blockage. \u00A0This means that you must do the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPlan your whole network\u00A0in advance, including everything that will be in solar orbit and/or at other planets, before launching any of it. \u00A0By planning it out, you know how many of which types of antennae you need on each satellite.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuild every satellite with enough antennae to have at least 2 possible paths through other relays back to Kerbin, This includes antennae for relays that you haven\u0027t launched yet. \u00A0This is why you have to plan the whole network in advance.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen choosing antennae to talk from 1 planet to another, realize that the maximum range required is equal to the sum of Kerbin\u0027s orbital radius \u002B the target\u0027s orbital radius. \u00A0This is for when they\u0027re on opposite sides of the sun. \u00A0They can\u0027t talk through the sun, of course, so you don\u0027t need quite this much range, but there will be times when they\u0027re close to being on opposite sides and you can just barely talk past the sun.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll your major relays also need an extra antenna with adequate range\u00A0left on \u0022active vessel\u0022. \u00A0This is not only for your actual missions going places, but also for when building your network, so that new satellites\u00A0will always be in communications even before you get their antennae aimed at their targets.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you want to fully explore another planetary system without major communications blockages, you\u0027ll need to build a whole in-system network there similar to what you have for the Kerbin-Mun system. \u00A0This local network must tie into the main interplanetary relay system, and that means the relays need antennae to make that happen. \u00A0And all this must be part of the advanced planning of the whole network. \u00A0Otherwise, you\u0027ll find you have to replace some or all of your interplanetary relays to tie\u00A0in the local planetary network.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to answer your question, no, having massive relays at Kerbin with dishes aimed at every planet will not give you anything like full coverage for all future missions. \u00A0You will need lots of other stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T20:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222456283\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134103\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457954028\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022131939\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022seaces\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, seaces said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAha.
