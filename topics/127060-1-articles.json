Or if you want to remake the map in the PC version, again let me know. Yes yes I know porting from Xbox 360 to PC isn\u0027t *exactly* possible since the PC has infinite worlds and the Xbox 360 doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m aware, but maybe someone made a port which can, idk, just an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you want to help, let me know. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0If you want to friend me on Xbox Live, I\u0027m ZooNamed.
