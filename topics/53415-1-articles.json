The easiest way to make docking ports the same height is to make a standard platform for all your modules. Make each module starting from a copy of that same platform, and it\u0027ll always match. It helps to have two docking ports on the platform; one at a slightly different height than the other, to compensate for uneven terrain, craft variations, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T12:33:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you build a common base part that has wheels or tracks and docking ports at the same height, then that will eliminate the problem of having docking ports at different heights.

As its weight changes, the suspension of a unit\u0027s rover wheels and lander legs flexes, changing the height of any docking ports on that unit. Thus, ports that alligned perfectly on Kerbin with the units\u0027 starting weights might not align during operation in the field. You might therefore find it necessary to build in some sort of suspension adjustment system that allows you to tweak the height of units independent of their weights, so you can keep the ports at the same height.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T20:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr, pump fuel around like ballast, to make the ports align.
