I love it but there are few issues with mods making the game a bit uncomfortable to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI install the reccomended mods via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E, because I do want real engines, even because the look of them. But it is too messy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very start, I get a lot of unmanned capsules (which is good to me) but they all provide too many features for a start. Make it solar panels, huge amount of electricity, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E... It would be good to get them when you progress you carrer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd unlocking next nodes provide you some engines and a lot, a lot of more (or less) items most of them I have no absolutely idea what they are for. An insane amount of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to install \u0022engineer tech tree\u0022 (as well as community tech tree) and it appears to be a wise move as it looks more realistic, giving you the possibility to make more nodes choices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet there\u0027s something -apparently- broken, in one of the very first node I do buy researched items (it is a scansat map or something like that),\u00A0but they are not avalaible when it comes to build your ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very end, what do you suggest me to do, or what mod to install for a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E career?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-31T00:02:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRP-0 is the official career mod for realism overhauoverhaul.
