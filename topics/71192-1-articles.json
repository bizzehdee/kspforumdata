A stage (engines and fuel tanks), the science bits (except for the SACNC, they all fit together), etc. But it always annoys me when I decide to add RCS, and I have to flip back and forth between the Propulsion tab and the Control tab to add/remove tanks and add/remove thrusters. Additionally, the Propulsion tab is crowded with all the solid- and liquid-fuel gear, while the Control tab is almost empty - shifting the RCS tanks from the former to the latter would (partly) balance out the number of parts in these two tabs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T03:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emakes sense to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amaroq","CreatedById":57607,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T03:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wholeheartedly agree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigyihsuan","CreatedById":29291,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T04:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a pain to have to wade through several pages of engines and fuel tanks just to get RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yoha","CreatedById":108392,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T07:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, it is a little a annoying to have to go through several pages of \u0022Propulsion\u0022 parts while the \u0022Control\u0022 parts does not even fill one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T07:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this will make the game more organized.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MelancholyFlapper","CreatedById":110044,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T08:22:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree.
