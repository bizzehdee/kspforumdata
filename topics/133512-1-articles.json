I am not talking a little bit ... makes it\u00A0impossible to control. \u00A0 However, \u00A0If I click on any other of the SAS buttons .. it is 100% fine. \u00A0 \u00A0This is only A issue in space as far as I can tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have A crap ton of mods ...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhmm .. Now that I think about it ... it might only be on probes. \u00A0 \u00A0Tested A few of my sats (remote tech installed ) .. eh have 1 prob and one ASAS .. I would turn the torque on / off of ea of them and test .. if one or both of the\u00A0torque(s) are on .. it starts too slowly go crazy. \u00A0 If both of it just floats. \u00A0 \u00A0This is only with\u00A0to\u00A0stability assist on ... If I were to make SAS point prograde its fine ( or any of the others )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny Idea ? ... I want to post video ... but I play in 5760 x 1080p and it took me forever to get it in that .. dont want too take it out of that .. and not sure where i could post A video with 5760 x 1080p.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave A wicked crap ton of mods that are all installed 100% right and updated. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing to check if manned ships do it also\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks neko\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-05T14:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse RT flight computer holds instead of stock SAS holds. Or you can try to eliminate signal delay and see if it works. I\u0027m seeing similar thing for unmanned probe outside Kerbin SoI, and my theory is that RT adds the signal delay that affects\u00A0stock SAS as well, and it screws stock SAS. I haven\u0027t verified my theory, though - but using RT flight computer instead does help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
