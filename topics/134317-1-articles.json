To launch the game I created a short-cut of the KSP.exe file and placed this on my desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter playing for some time I decided to install some mods including Kerbal Engineer and MechJeb however I couldn\u0027t get them to run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve recently discovered that by using the Launcher instead of KSP.exe the mods are activated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when using the launcher, my save file from using KSP.exe does not show up on the list of saved games. Is there any way I can move the save into a place where it will show on the list so I can use my existing game but with the mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHarry\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T13:29:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds to me like there is more than one copy of KSP on your pc and the shortcut you created is running a different copy than the launcher. I haven\u0027t ever used the launcher, but if you can find which copy the launcher is using, copying the game save shouldn\u0027t be a problem. Just copy and paste from one install to the other. I guess my first question would be, which operating system do you have?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HarryB","CreatedById":160443,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T13:34:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running windows 10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done a search of my C drive and I definitely only have one instance of KSP on my computer.

Are you sure another copy doesn\u0027t exist on a different drive letter? As far as finding all the saves on a particular drive letter, try using a wildcard in the search and look for something like *.sfs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T13:59:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Otis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
