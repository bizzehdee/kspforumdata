Just imagine launching a submarine down into the depths of a distant planet\u0027s ocean, facing new challenges such as pressure, limited visibility, and underwater currents. (it may not become that in-depth)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe addition of submarine parts would offer players even more creative freedom in their designs. You could build fast and sleek submarines, or sturdy and able to withstand extreme pressures, instead of struggling with buoyancy physics using cargo bays and engines making your design ugly. the U-dunk-it part already has this kind of stuff in mind, like the spherical shape and small windows. Besides, it\u0027s already designed to be used in water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inclusion of submarine parts would add a whole new dimension to the game, making it even more exciting and engaging for players. If it may seem too late or too awkward to just throw in submarine parts out of nowhere in future updates, I think the exploration update would be a great fit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI truly hope that the developers consider this idea and look forward to hearing your thoughts on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-25T21:28:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2023 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 25\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pluspython68\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
