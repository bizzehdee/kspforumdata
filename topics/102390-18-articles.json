If it saves me a little time, I\u0027ll take it.\n\nWell, as Timmers has let the cat out of the bag:\n\nA bit of news on the next version of KSS.\n\nAs alluded to above, the next version will include contracts to place space stations around EVERY stock body in the game. Now, I didn\u0027t much feel like typing \n\n     LKOStationNEW, MunStationNEW, MinmusStationNEW, DunaStationNEW, EveStationNEW\n\n and so on.\n\nSo, instead, I am going to merge Useful Space Stations into Kerbin Space Station. This has the happy effect of making maintenence missions generate for all stations, rather than just the defined \u0022official\u0022 KSS Stations. However, you will still only get one \u0022launch a station\u0022 mission for each body. \n\nSo if you want more stations, you are launching them for free (but you\u0027ll get maintenance contracts for them).\n\nOf course this flexibility comes at a price. Firstly, it\u0027s quite likely it will break any existing contracts. (So make sure that you finish up any actives before upgrading when the release comes out).\n\nSecondly, Useful Space Stations is going to be unsupported once KSS 3.0 comes out. Instead, if you would rather have the stock contracts, you can simply remove the core missions, and KSS will function exactly as USS used to. \n\nPersonally, I think this change will be the best of both worlds. In hindsight (isn\u0027t it always the way), this is what I wish I had done with KSS in the first place.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-25T15:39:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2015 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by severedsolo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thegamer211","CreatedById":149354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T08:02:18Z","Content":"Oh yeah!

Hohmann transfers around Kerbol aren\u0027t too difficult, you just have to think bigger. I.e. in a LKO transfer, you are aiming for within a couple of kilometers on your first transfer, before you get closer. Around Kerbol, you aim for more like a couple of thousand km before getting closer. It\u0027s a case of buyer beware really, if you don\u0027t want to do it, just reject them.\n\nHaving said that, you would struggle with the contracts as they are, as they require low orbit. Around Kerbol, that is 10Mm (and takes alot of Dv to get there). I always forget that a generic Celestial Body check will return Kerbol as a valid target.\n\n**Kerbin Space Station 3.0.1 Released!**\n\n Fixed multiple core contracts for each body.\n\n Kerbol Station will no longer require low orbit. (Anything below Eeloos Ap will do)\n\n Fixed minor textual bug in Core Mission\n\n Fixed folder structure (please delete the Kerbin Space Station folder and reinstall if installing manually.
