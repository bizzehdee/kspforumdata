Probably not impossible to put a 20t craft into orbit on a single Turboramjet, but you are making it too hard on yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The thrust of the turboramjet increases a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E after mach 1. After reaching 12 km, pitch down to pick up speed. After you bust through mach 1, your engine will start producing \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E more thrust. If you cannot break ~350 m/s even in descent, then you have too much drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, you mention that you have plenty of intake air. Careful there, too many intakes will add a lot of drag, making it a lot harder to break mach 1. So will radially attached parts and excessive use of wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T09:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess I was building a 0.90 design and I need to adapt more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there guildelines for building an SSTO along the lines of the ones the GoSlash produced for old aero?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee.g. 1 turbojet for every n tones of plane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex lift for every tonne\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eetc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T10:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1 ram intake is actually enough for a turbojet engine. 2 would make it go up to maybe 24k without flaming out if you have the speed at that point.
