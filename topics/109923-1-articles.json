Probably not impossible to put a 20t craft into orbit on a single Turboramjet, but you are making it too hard on yourself.\n\n2) The thrust of the turboramjet increases a *lot* after mach 1. After reaching 12 km, pitch down to pick up speed. After you bust through mach 1, your engine will start producing *way* more thrust. If you cannot break ~350 m/s even in descent, then you have too much drag.\n\nOther than that, you mention that you have plenty of intake air. Careful there, too many intakes will add a lot of drag, making it a lot harder to break mach 1. So will radially attached parts and excessive use of wings."},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T09:51:21Z","Content":"I guess I was building a 0.90 design and I need to adapt more.\n\nAre there guildelines for building an SSTO along the lines of the ones the GoSlash produced for old aero?\n\ne.g. 1 turbojet for every n tones of plane\n\nx lift for every tonne\n\netc."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T10:28:14Z","Content":"1 ram intake is actually enough for a turbojet engine. 2 would make it go up to maybe 24k without flaming out if you have the speed at that point. More than that will add alot of unnecessary drag. Seems like the old intake abusing days are over like we did in that soup atmosphere.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T10:30:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 10:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"}]}
