It seems that when you attach an OKTO probe to the top node of a Mk1 pod, it amplifies the heating so much that the pod will explode at relatively minor speeds (800 m/s). I\u0027ve tested this with ever other 0.625m parts including all other probe cores and fuel tanks and only the OKTO probe causes this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested this with a simple rocket but it seems to show up in all rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy test rocket was a Mk1 pod with an OKTO core and then a mk16 parachute on top. Underneath was a RT-10 set at 50% thrust and launched straight up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pjj56","CreatedById":60970,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion:\u003C/strong\u003E KSP 1.0.0.830 Windows 64-bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIssue:\u003C/strong\u003E Stayputnik probe experiences extreme heating on reentry - up to 4000K!
