They WASD keys seem very jerky. I also use a joystick and set the sensitivity down but that\u0027s still not very precise. I was wondering if there\u0027s a way to use a mouse. I remember I tried to add the mouse in settings but it didn\u0027t work. I\u0027d like to try again once I\u0027m home but thought I\u0027d ask here to see if it\u0027s even possible and how to do it.\n\nOr if there are any other solutions to make sensitive movements in orbit, that would be great as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T20:28:39Z","Content":"Pressing caps lock toggles \u0022fine control\u0022 mode.
