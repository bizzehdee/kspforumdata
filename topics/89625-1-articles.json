According to the Grand Tack model, Jupiter migrated inwards from about 3-4 AU to about 1.5-2 AU, until Saturn pulled it back out to about 5 AU with Saturn at about 7 AU (originally around 5 AU). This all happened in the first 500,000 years after the solar system formed though. The article doesn\u0027t specify exactly how old the disk is, so it might be before or after an equivalent migration (although it looks like before, so maybe less than 100,000 years after formation).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
