It hasn\u0027t cleared everything up for me, but it\u0027s good to know things like families prefer low density residential, so I probably want to keep significant amounts of that around. Also, I think offices are sort of like a high density version of industrial (higher education demand, but very little goods production, so a bigger difference than you see with the others). I had been assuming offices were commercial (because they\u0027re blue). I think this makes more sense though, since commercial sells goods produced by industry and offers public services (like hotels), which offices obviously don\u0027t fit into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also figured out some stuff with roads and not creating intersections that I don\u0027t need to, but I think I can fit that into my current city. I\u0027m basically developing a bunch of fairly isolated districts (they all connect, but I\u0027m trying to build them such that people don\u0027t need to move between them too much), so my traffic systems should continue to work anyway. I\u0027m trying to build the suburbs first and then develop a downtown later, so that I don\u0027t have to deal with upgrading early infrastructure (I learned from other games).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to be doing pretty well. Some residential re-zoning aside, I\u0027ve been pulling a steady profit since like day 10 (lost it for a few days re-zoning). Some ups and downs, including a massive labour crisis in the industrial sector (no uneducated workers cause a lot of abandonment), but things are back to a nice balance and demand for residential and commercial is high, and I\u0027m about to tap into the rail network to further relive the strain of industrial on my roads (right now I use districts and separate highway connections). I am however failing at property value and public transit, and it\u0027s keeping my property values pretty much at medium in most places, and my industry seems to be starting to freak out over services. Apparently commercial and industrial upgrade based on services, which seems to include transit, so its worthwhile. I think I have enough money to put in a metro instead of clogging up my entire city with busses, which also saves me from mapping out too many routes. Probably helps tourists too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also feel like I might have gone a bit to far from \u0022everything is grids\u0022 towards \u0022everything is all curvey\u0022. I was trying circular designs to see if that would help traffic, and I might have taken it too far. I think I\u0027m going to try and keep things more on the regular grid for high density, especially since they need large zoned areas to build in, and leave more of my freeform for low density stuff. Still, everything does look pretty nice, though what I have built may never look like a city. theres no large whole sections yet, everything is split up by highways, a river, and some train tracks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T13:01:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei think traffic always only uses one lane instead of all of them on large roads, or mostly try to stay in the lane where they can get to where their going from where they are, even when their nowhere near it, hopefully this is fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T15:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cirocco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cirocco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight, had the game for two days now, here\u0027s my two cents:\u003Cp\u003Ethe amount of fun I\u0027m having with this game is obscene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat citybuilder, intuitive and easy to get into, yet offers a lot of more in-depth gameplay with policies and the like.

I cannot get over how much EA messed that one up, and how this small team created an absolutely gorgeous game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point you make about things not being explained all too much is true, though I feel a bit that is part of what makes a city builder. If you want to be told what to do, go play a modern triple A title that takes you by the hand. If you want to create, explore, fail and build, go play this game. No fan of the genre can be disappointed by how this turned out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ealso unlocked hydro dams shortly before i went to bed, but didnt get to build one :/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe sure to save first.
