If I keep the glow relative to the incoming light, you end up with something much closer to the glow from the old setup -- more orange and subdued.  The other bit(s) that are missing are the obvious bloom and HDR lighting (which I\u0027m really not sure that I can solve).\n\nAlso looks like I might need to turn the polarization stuff into a texture input, as there is obviously two different effects going on between the bright-yellow stripes on the end and edges (which catches more light regardless of angle) and the rest of the paneling (which is darker when not directly back-lit).\n\nProbably do a bit more playing around with the settings this evening.  Need to find a way to duplicate and test the setup right in the Unity Editor, as having to launch KSP between tests is very time consuming.\n\nIn the end it will all be configurable... so if what I set up as the defaults are not desirable, it can be adjusted with some config edits and/or patches.\n\nEdit:  While reading up on Sub-surface scattering rendering techniques, it has come to light that I\u0027ve implemented a nearly identical solution to that used in Crysis for back-lighting of foliage.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, Kaa253 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E These glossy metallic textures look great.

You can\u0027t save presets in the game, you have to change the .cfg file in order to use a color you like later on. But if you want to make a color here are some tips:\n\n- First make the base color you want in a metal version using the three RGB sliders  \n\n- Use the Specular slider to set the matte/gloss effect to your chosing. Abover 200 you will get a mirror surface with reflections  \n\n- Use the Metallic slider to change the contrast between the lightest and darkest reflection. Darker means it looks more like a mirror/metal but will also be a lot darker in space.  \n\n- What you see in the HAB is not what it will look like in space, as the HAB is lit from all directions, and there is nothing in space to reflect.\n\nI found the optimum to be 200 specular and 100 metallic, start from there and play around. You can always download my color file to get a start and see where the file is located so you can change your own file. Just be carefull not to remove any of the original colors, as a lot of parts refer to there colors and you bork the game if you remove them.

You can\u0027t save presets in the game, you have to change the .cfg file in order to use a color you like later on. But if you want to make a color here are some tips:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - First make the base color you want in a metal version using the three RGB sliders  \n\u003E \n\u003E - Use the Specular slider to set the matte/gloss effect to your chosing. Abover 200 you will get a mirror surface with reflections  \n\u003E \n\u003E - Use the Metallic slider to change the contrast between the lightest and darkest reflection. Darker means it looks more like a mirror/metal but will also be a lot darker in space.  \n\u003E \n\u003E - What you see in the HAB is not what it will look like in space, as the HAB is lit from all directions, and there is nothing in space to reflect.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I found the optimum to be 200 specular and 100 metallic, start from there and play around. You can always download my color file to get a start and see where the file is located so you can change your own file. Just be carefull not to remove any of the original colors, as a lot of parts refer to there colors and you bork the game if you remove them. (been there, done that, reinstalled SSTU).\n\u003E \n\nAbsolutely amazing work, If I could only have I part pack it would be SSTU. When you save as a sub-assembly it keeps all the color and metal settings witch is awesome too.

It is certainly novel, and interesting at first view (and even second view).  But I also feel it looks a bit tacky -- like its missing something (probably bloom/hdr/actual light-emission from the emissives).  Tempted to make it an optional patch (regular = subdued or no glow, enabled = as in screenshot above).\n\nThat image also shows the back-lit effect on the DOS panels -- which with their non overly-boosted emissive, look a bit more natural and believable.  Might still tone those down slightly as well; at least make their textures a bit less lower contrast.\n\n(Hmm... wonder how all of this would work and look if I turned on HDR lighting everywhere...if its even doable)"}]}
