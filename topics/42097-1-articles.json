It could be under the recover button you could press recover for the museum and it be in the museum where you could put information about it like your first moon lander, decommissioned space station modules etc... Also in career mode that could be one way of making money, the more successful your program the more people want to see your museum the less successful the less people.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T23:21:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that the persistence file-based progress tracking stats (first introduced in 0.21) is the first step to such a feature, followed by a museum that actually displays this data in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T03:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been suggested a few times before and people always respond rather positively to it. I think the devs even commented on it being a real possibility for KSP as a means to show some of your achievements. They didn\u0027t really go into any specifics, really, but they probably don\u0027t have it all figured out for themselves yet either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I\u0027d seen anyone suggesting a museum, someone suggested that there be a kerbal encyclopedia Basically a UI element that you bring up somehow and it keeps track of things you\u0027ve discovered via the observatory. For example, it starts out with some maps and things of Kerbin and some fuzzy pictures of Mun and Kerbol but when you start sending probes and things to mun, the picture gets more clear and the details beneath the picture start filling out. I really liked that suggestion as well as the museum one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike, the museum can be a 3D representation of things your space program has done, you walk around and look at miniatures of some of your craft, maybe or pictures you\u0027d taken or something like that while the encyclopedia would be...kind of like the backbone of scientific and exploratory missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisWill","CreatedById":77045,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T04:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like that encyclopedia idea that would be rather cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T13:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beeman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Beeman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...
