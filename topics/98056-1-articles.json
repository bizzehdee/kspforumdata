I had no idea about transfer windows and how much difference it can make. I finally came here to the forums and did a bit of googling and learned. After a couple thousand hours playing this game, I still consult a phase angle calculator when planning missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO it\u0027s part of that \u0022Not too realistic/easy to keep the game fun\u0022 idea that Squad keeps mentioning. Figuring out transfer windows in game with no help right now is likely to frustrate players to the point of rage quitting. \u0022Why did they put other planets in the game, they are impossible to get to!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-28T23:44:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2015 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beachernaut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T23:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is that since you see the position on the map, you learn the relationship that works.

The mod Transfer Window Planner, which I had installed long ago, provides detailed information about the transfer, suits all kind of need: lowest \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv? Fastest trajectory? Launch ASAP? TWP have all you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus I don\u0027t think ksp itself need something like a single-purposed indication, waste of time of devs, worse than just make TWP stock. Further, if Squad really implemented some indication, then they must inform players detailed data like ejection angle and departure date, or that indication will result useless.
