I know that in the current version, without any life support or damage over time, it is pretty easy to keep a bunch of kerbonauts in orbit for an infinite amout of time, but it could make some interest in the future, and will make worthy to buid and orbit at least one station in the career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aeTIos","CreatedById":17032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T11:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right, until biome scanning-ish things (like IR cameras, or the like) are implemented, there\u0027s no point making a satellite only for orbiting Kerbin, as the small amount of science you can get (300 to 500 points from experiments maybe?
