I have transferred a science save from 1.0 to 1.0.2. All my mods are there, and I\u0027m not getting any errors on start or load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything seems OK except that when I select the science tree, there is nothing there at all. The tree is completely missing. Everything else from the save is there but that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody else have this issue, and hopefully a fix?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: I fixed this by loading a quicksave. It set me back a little bit, but the science tree now displays like it should, so I\u0027m happy. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T03:46:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JerryT87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
