To me most obvious would be one based on the MR-510 that acts as an RCS thruster and runs on monopropellant - double the efficiency of regular RCS, but you need to keep it powered. A comparison with existing engines is also warranted now RCS thrusters have a \u0022respond to throttle\u0022 option; compared to the Dawn ion engine the arcjet would require significantly less power, maybe one or two RTGs would suffice, and be a lot lighter and more compact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not such an obvious technology for a larger engine, though I suppose it could be done, if only for completeness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T06:21:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUh... they don\u0027t have to be powered.
