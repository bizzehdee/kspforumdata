It\u0027s the ability to SHARE your creations and your world with others. This is as valid for your ingame creations as it is for mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA platform to do it on would help and I believe Steam excels at being a platform where you can share your creations and accomplishments with others. It also allows for any user that\u0027s logged into Steam to pretty much comment on your screenshots or mods, thus getting easily in touch with the author. This is important in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the ability to share our designs through Steam Workshop would be a stellar addition as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteam workshop support could work alongside Spaceport. It does allow for easy installation, update and removal of mods quick and easily though your game naturally needs to be restarted. Other games have implemented this alongside their own mod system, I don\u0027t see why Steam Workshop should be shunned just because spaceport is being worked on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy can\u0027t they co-exist?
