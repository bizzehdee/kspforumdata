I\u0027m playing KSP with Real Solar System, KW Rocketry, FAR and Deadly Reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am finding myself in a situation where science is extremely hard to get. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have unlocked most 1.25m parts, but I don\u0027t have the nuclear engine yet. No docking ports either. I have the Goo, the ScienceJr and the 2HOT thermometer.

The module that gets in orbit has some 4000m/s of delta-v left. This is just enough to get in a low munar orbit, which I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main question is: how can I get more science?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the EVA reports from Kerbin and Mun biomes are done. Ground science on Kerbin does not give much, and I don\u0027t have the delta-v to land and return from the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally, Minmus gives a motherload of science... except Minmus represents Neptune, and I need 11km/s of delta-v to get there once I\u0027ve escaped Kerbin. Not counting the delta-v required for orbital insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought of a Duna (Mars) flyby, as it requires only 3.5km/s of delta-v.

It\u0027s one out of two possible variants you can install RSS as, and it changes the progression a lot. In RftS, if you can get an early unmanned Duna or Eve flyby with the correct probe body, that is one of the best possible things you can do in terms of science (but hard to pull off because the game starts you off years out of the transfer window, so you need a lot of extra dV to force an out-of-window transfer).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpheratz","CreatedById":99633,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T21:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood!
