I tried TAC plus Umbra Space Industries Modular Colonization System, but I didn\u0027t like the lack of new models. I remember someone made a really cool 5 meter base part that has adapters to got to 2.5 meter, so it looks like a black pill. Does anyone know what that mod is? But it\u0027s not limited to that, any base building mod is good, but I would prefer a working Curse or forum download, not the defunct spaceport links.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weeble","CreatedById":117348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T10:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s called Konquest by ASET, link below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79880-WIP-KONQUEST-Modular-components-for-permanent-bases-by-ASET-%2814-05-2014%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79880-WIP-KONQUEST-Modular-components-for-permanent-bases-by-ASET-%2814-05-2014%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFustek\u0027s station kit and home 3.
