(even as late as 1.0.3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of big underappreciated changes of 1.0.4 was fixing the connection strength between MK3 parts. While back then it was very flimsy, currently it\u0027s rock solid and you need to hit the ground really hard to break it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, to the topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of old designs don\u0027t work due to part count or non-node attachments vastly increasing the drag. Instead of rebuilding old designs, try new ones, and very simple too. I\u0027ve managed a tiny SSTO plane in 14 parts, that *just* made it to the orbit, and a bit bigger in 15 parts that got to the orbit with 1500m/s left and a pilot. There\u0027s a different flight profile - the jets produce next to no thrust above 20km, but you can use them to get a pretty 1000-1100m/s in horizontal flight between 10-15km, and the air is thin enough there that you won\u0027t burn up before you start the final climb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, at higher altitudes the aero is so forgiving that you are able to circularize at 40km - and it\u0027s a valid method of flying SSTOs! (if rather troublesome). Drag \u0022by default\u0022 is much more forgiving than in the past, but if you\u0027re careless, it can come and bite you in the back - badly angled parts do have potential for more drag than they did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, first things first: No more intake spam. You can add intakes to keep the engine running above 30km, so what if from some 23km it produces no thrust. One intake per engine is enough currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShock cone has ridiculously low drag, lower than nose cones. Use it to tip all \u0022hulls\u0022 and \u0022nacelles\u0022 of your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOcclusion from drag occurs through node connections. Things attached radially aren\u0027t occluded (with some obscure exceptions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t overdo it with wing area. In the past people loved to build bricks of wing elements and call them fancy fighters. You can still build bricks of wing elements but they won\u0027t fly faster than 100m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd really the best advice I can think of: Start light. Build something that can reach orbit with zero payload first, and then increase its payload ratio gradually. If you start with given payload in mind, and start adding things to increase the carrying capacity of the plane around the payload, you won\u0027t get far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"plotz","CreatedById":140852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T08:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep.

Do so until 10,000ms, level off. Gain speed until \u0026gt;800m/s, pull up to around 10 degrees. If parts start to overheat, pull up a bit and try to climb more quickly. Stay in air breathing mode as long as you gain speed, only switch to closed cycle when you cannot accelerate anymore (target terminal air breathing speed: \u0026gt;1400 m/s). Use action group #1 to switch mode by closing the intake. Pull up to ~30 degrees until apoapsis hits 72kms (for safety margin). Set SAS to \u0022prograde\u0022 to minimize drag. Circularize as usual (prograde burn via SAS can be helpful).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echecklist prior to deorbiting:open intake, manually switch mode for rapier to air breathing.
