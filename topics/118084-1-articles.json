When I have a failure, which is uh... alot, it forces to me to find the part that I am \u0022forcing\u0022. That is, I am being lazy and not putting thought into the design.

Best I can offer is *get instruments!* Whether it is KER or MechJeb or any similar mod out there, you need to keep an eye on what is going on out there. The stock GUI actually does provide the info needed, however it is not well presented. The analog dials are suitable for landing, but it is difficult to tune your descent. I shoot for around 200-250 m rate of descent and flatten it out before things get too hot. If it gets far beyond 300m, things get a bit toasty and may not make it out of the oven."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T06:49:50Z","Content":"\u003E For instance, I just started playing around with Mark III parts and had a design that seemed to have too much nose and butt, without much in the middle.

(even as late as 1.0.3)\n\nOne of big underappreciated changes of 1.0.4 was fixing the connection strength between MK3 parts. While back then it was very flimsy, currently it\u0027s rock solid and you need to hit the ground really hard to break it. \n\nOkay, to the topic.\n\nLots of old designs don\u0027t work due to part count or non-node attachments vastly increasing the drag. Instead of rebuilding old designs, try new ones, and very simple too. I\u0027ve managed a tiny SSTO plane in 14 parts, that \\*just\\* made it to the orbit, and a bit bigger in 15 parts that got to the orbit with 1500m/s left and a pilot. There\u0027s a different flight profile - the jets produce next to no thrust above 20km, but you can use them to get a pretty 1000-1100m/s in horizontal flight between 10-15km, and the air is thin enough there that you won\u0027t burn up before you start the final climb.\n\nSeriously, at higher altitudes the aero is so forgiving that you are able to circularize at 40km - and it\u0027s a valid method of flying SSTOs! (if rather troublesome). Drag \u0022by default\u0022 is much more forgiving than in the past, but if you\u0027re careless, it can come and bite you in the back - badly angled parts do have potential for more drag than they did.\n\nWell, first things first: No more intake spam. You can add intakes to keep the engine running above 30km, so what if from some 23km it produces no thrust. One intake per engine is enough currently.\n\nShock cone has ridiculously low drag, lower than nose cones. Use it to tip all \u0022hulls\u0022 and \u0022nacelles\u0022 of your plane.\n\nOcclusion from drag occurs through node connections. Things attached radially aren\u0027t occluded (with some obscure exceptions).\n\nDon\u0027t overdo it with wing area. In the past people loved to build bricks of wing elements and call them fancy fighters. You can still build bricks of wing elements but they won\u0027t fly faster than 100m/s.\n\nAnd really the best advice I can think of: Start light. Build something that can reach orbit with zero payload first, and then increase its payload ratio gradually. If you start with given payload in mind, and start adding things to increase the carrying capacity of the plane around the payload, you won\u0027t get far."},{"CreatedByName":"plotz","CreatedById":140852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T08:20:33Z","Content":"Yep. Also, the K-Prize challenge thread shows many, many working examples. \n\nSmall tutorial (deliberately without pictures):\n\nA simple blueprint (no payload) from back to front, in order of construction sections: \n\n- Hull: 1 Rapier, 1 1k battery, 2 \u0022long\u0022 adapters Mk2-1.25m, 1 short mk2 liquid fuel tank in between these two, 1 mk1 inline cockpit, 1 shock cone intake.\n\n- Sides: 2 delta wings, 4 elevon #1 control surfaces attached to the trailing edge, 2 airbrakes mounted to the top, 2 moving winglets.\n\n- undercarriage: three small landing gears, two below the wings, 1 slightly clipped into the hull (aim for a few degrees of nose-up pitch).

Do so until 10,000ms, level off. Gain speed until \u003E800m/s, pull up to around 10 degrees. If parts start to overheat, pull up a bit and try to climb more quickly. Stay in air breathing mode as long as you gain speed, only switch to closed cycle when you cannot accelerate anymore (target terminal air breathing speed: \u003E1400 m/s). Use action group #1 to switch mode by closing the intake. Pull up to ~30 degrees until apoapsis hits 72kms (for safety margin). Set SAS to \u0022prograde\u0022 to minimize drag. Circularize as usual (prograde burn via SAS can be helpful).\n\nchecklist prior to deorbiting:open intake, manually switch mode for rapier to air breathing. Transfer any fuel and oxidiser to the tank in the front. You can already click the brake button to deploy the airbrakes. retract solar panels, if extended. de-orbit by aiming for a periapsis of ~10,000m around 30 degrees **behind**KSC.\n\nLand safely ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ."},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T16:22:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Did you do it pre-1.0.4?
