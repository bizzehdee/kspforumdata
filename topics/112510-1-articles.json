After the talk I\u0027ve had with Mesklin on the other thread, I\u0027m fairly certain 3.7km/s would be the real bare minimum, and there\u0027s the empty ore container that I don\u0027t use in my calculations, or the RCS propellant (that I would of course use first, as Scott has told us a gazillion times to do when we are strapped for dV... that buys me a couple hundred m/s *out of the liquid fuel* just on account of a lighter ship).\n\nI was surprised at first, but then again, if you think about it, the kerbin system is not that big, so if you know your stuff and do the burns when (and how!) you have to, you can get very far, with very little. And that\u0027s without using gravity assists, because I don\u0027t really know how to predict those (even if I use them to change inclination every now and then). With those you could really cut into the circularization burn at Moho... but that\u0027s probably not necessary because he showed me that from Eve\u0027s orbit, that\u0027s a mere ~600m/s. Anyhow, hope that also helps you in planning future missions!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you ever need someone moderately bad at flying...\n\nSure! I\u0027m always on the lookout for pilots to test the stuff I won\u0027t have time to because of my little manias when playing KSP (no hyperedit, barely any timewarp if there\u0027s something else to do). Shall I sign you up for one of these, so I can see how a pilot that is struggling with the new SSTOs handles the (admittedly difficult) ascent? DOn\u0027t take it the wrong way, but after seeing you comment on a couple of SSTO threads, I get the feeling you are still not fully comfortable with the 1.0 aerodynamics. And there\u0027s the Base Pack I left to DMSP to test a couple weeks ago, I never asked him how that was going...\n\nRune.
