To explain what happens: I was using the telescope in the Hullcam mod to try to get a good look at the more distant OPM planets (to be specific, Neidon) from LKO with the DOE mod. As I zoomed in close enough to where the DOE flare disappears, the planets themselves didn\u0027t show up at all, despite the disappearance of the lens flare.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESteps to reproduce:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstall the latest versions of OPM, Distant Objects, and Hullcam. Get the large telescope into orbit. Point at Neidon. Notice how it disappears if you zoom into it. Closer bodies are not affected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow before you point me to the OPM thread, I\u0027ve tested this with the K2 rescale mod, and the entirety of the OPM planets disappear. Not entirely sure if this is a stock limitation on how far away planetary bodies are rendered, or if there\u0027s a workaround, but I just thought I\u0027d report this here just in case. I don\u0027t use any other Kopernicus mods so I can\u0027t say for sure, but I\u0027d think this would also occur on any submod which rescales the solar system or adds bodies at exceedingly far distances eg: Outer Dwarf Planets. Either way, if there\u0027s a workaround, it\u0027d be nice to be able to use Tarsier Telescopes or the ones in Cacteye with larger rescales and far away bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehave you tried moving jool to a higher orbit? put it at the same distance as neidon and try to look at the two planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaybe that can help\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EHmmm.... Jool disappears when moved out to Neidons orbit as well. Seems Like it\u0027s a stock issue. Is it possible that there could be a workaround?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno idea, you can try asking also to the telescope mod devs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, this appears to be a stock issue. I\u0027d like to know if there is a workaround to this, or if the planet rendering distance in stock is hardcoded. Thanks in advance for any help here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
