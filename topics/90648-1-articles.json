An excavator must press its digging shovel into the ground, and it does so by means of leveraging its own mass as a counterweight.

Now combine that with the fact that an excavator launched into space would have to be small and leightweight by default, and you could possibly get to the point where the excavator would push itself off the ground before it can overcome the hardness of said ground.

There have been experiments done in 3D printing houses using a combination of concrete for walls/floors and metal supports for overhangs. The projections from the half scale prototypes state that you could have a two story house meant for a family of four printed out in roughly 20 hours and a full neighborhood inside of a week if you have a good alignment between your gantry rails and the road in question. The best thing about the system is that generally speaking houses of wildly different designs, but of the same volume, take almost about the same time to print. No specialized materials are needed for any given home printed by the system. The concrete used is one of the super fast curing (sp?) types which contrary to popular opinion really isn\u0027t all that much more expensive then standard foundation concrete. You go to the same plant, you just request a different mix.

Frankly not a whole lot. Most of its existence is just the metal truss structure, very cheap. Sure you have the gantry motors, industry grade with precision position systems, expensive but not obsurdly so. The horizontal traverse, again industrial grade with precision positioning systems. The Z-height can be done through many ways, none terribly expensive. The extruder will be a little different if only because its a somewhat non-standard system. But in general there isn\u0027t anything super expensive in there either. I build 3D printers as a hobby and have been looking into the possibility of building one of these mega printers for a while. They are costly for a single person, but for a business they really are nothing special. Think of a mobile truck mounted crane, that is roughly how expensive one of these costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInsulation? Not at all. Your walls are a foot thick cement box filled with sand. Perfect insulation, super cheap, AND it helps protect your home from things like tornadoes and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the flooring, sure you need to add some tilework, woodwork, etc. This is a trivial aspect of home construction, literally a part that the owner can do themselves if they want.

I somewhat presume you are speaking of the outdoor roof as any indoor ceiling is basically covered by the same description of flooring. This part gets into quite an interesting debate honestly. Considering that your standard slant-roof is somewhat unnecessary given these construction methods, the effort is minimized. Still want a slant roof? More costly because more material, but at the end of the day you can save money because the roofing will not need to be replaced as often. Effectively ever really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlumbing and electrical in some ways is easier, in most other respects is unchanged. The walls would be designed for ease of adding in the pipes and wires. About the only real drawback to this system is that it ends up being inflexible. IE: You cannot easily add a new power box to a wall unless you designed all the walls to have the requisite pipe/wire channels. Which there is no additional cost to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vast majority of the cost in building a home is NOT materials, it is the fact that you need to pay dozens of laborers for 6 months to construct it. There is a company that every year constructs a house in under like 3 hours as a promo-gimic. The cost comes out roughly the same because they hire 20 times as many workers, but they only hire them for half a day. Their models state that it really only ends up being the same because they don\u0027t do it all the time. If they did, then the workers would adjust their costs upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbiloid: My comment about the morlocks is not people growing \u0027cave adapted\u0027 as Dwarf Fortress would call it.
