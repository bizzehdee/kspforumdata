That was when i resorted to doing a search for the number 0.3 across all RC files. As you can guess, this is how i found out, that the case-mass is actually defined multiple times per partfile: First there seems to be a generic setting which however doesn\u0027t do anything. Then later down in the partfile, there are case mass definitions per chute diameter, and it is those that actually matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s summarize: An RC-compatible chute partfile now has:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mass: doesn\u0027t do anything\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- case mass: doesn\u0027t do anything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- per diametre case mass: overrides all of the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat could be easier/less confusing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Avalon304","CreatedById":68304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T03:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, you wouldn\u0027t believe how many times I botched things trying to figure out how to \u0027properly\u0027 deploy it.

Right now, the info window basically is just like a read-only settings window - it simply line-by-line restates the chute\u0027s settings. Maybe a more english sentence like summary would be better? Like, instead of \u0022Deploys on ground contact: true\u0022, that line would read \u0022Auto-deploys on ground contact.\u0022\u003Cp\u003EThen again, thinking about it, maybe this setting should in general be renamed to that - less chance of misunderstanding imo. Until starwaster explained it, i too thought that \u0022deploys on ground contact\u0022 simply defined if a chute CAN deploy while on the ground - NOT that it will auto-deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think, for deployment on ground contact, there just needs to some documentation for it. I made the (logical) assumption that the chute still had to be armed inorder to deploy when the craft touched down. Additionally deployment on ground contact only makes sense for drag chutes anyway and drag chutes shouldn\u0027t really deploy while in the air anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T03:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rynak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rynak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s summarize: An RC-compatible chute partfile now has:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mass: doesn\u0027t do anything\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- case mass: doesn\u0027t do anything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- per diametre case mass: overrides all of the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat could be easier/less confusing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re overthinking the mass issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy are you even worrying yourself about it?
