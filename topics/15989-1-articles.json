Now depending on what point of orbit you\u0027re on (descending node, or down to periapsis; ascending node, or up to apoapsis), you would fire your rocket North (0*) or South (180*). It would decrease or increase your inclination depending on how long you burn for, and what part of the AN or DN of orbit you\u0027re on. So, I basically said that you would fire your rocket North or South to increase or decrease your orbit \u0022angle\u0022, which is what you\u0027re \u0022flat\u0022 is.
