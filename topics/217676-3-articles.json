Constructive criticism is vital to the development of an early access game.

However, the thing I really want to emphasize, is there is a balance where constructive criticism about the dissatisfying state of the game can be delivered without the whole insulting people or being generally less than nice deal. That kind of shortness, rudeness and accusatoriness (is that a word? I hope it\u0027s a word) with the development team, and even with the community members on the other side of the debate (both sides of the debate have been mean to eachother, this isn\u0027t just a \u0022this side unequivocally bad, this side irrefutably good\u0022 thing) that I see so often is the main thing I disagree with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s at least my point of view though, and I\u0027m sure other people have other ways of putting things\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(also ignore any formatting or grammar issues, I\u0027m both on mobile and multitasking)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alexoff","CreatedById":145774,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-16T21:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224293751\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686947265\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201924\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LittleBitMore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n39 minutes ago, LittleBitMore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main bad outcome of the dissatisfaction is, when people take it to an extreme, it eventually turns any discussion of KSP2 into endless flame warring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not just about the current situation, but also about the backstory and what happened after the release. We were first promised a dream game back in the spring of 2020, then the game was constantly delayed. Here we were told that this is for polishing the game. Then all the new features fell off the game, the day before the release it turned out that there would be no part of the old features, with the release we found out that in fact the game was even less. For a week, the developers disappeared from social networks, then Nate said in an interview that he thinks that the game is ok and worth the money, that the team is proud of the result, his colleagues spoke at the unity conference, then Nate decided to notify us that he was going on vacation. None of the developers apologized to us, did not try to justify themselves. Personally, I think ST management has done a lot of outrageous things. And other players protect them, but I don\u2019t understand - are the developers worthy of such care? How can you start over with a clean slate if someone took advantage of your trust and then didn\u0027t even explain or apologize? It turns out that part of the community is to blame, which does not help them with solving bug problems. And the other part of the community should come up with explanations for developers.

Was it the devs that decided to launch now? was it the men in suits? - was it launched now because otherwise it would not get out? In my experience the people actually building the game are very passionate about their projects and want to release them in as good a state as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont know.. I\u0027ve read quite a few posts from veteran KSP1 players who say that KSP1 also had a rocky start when it was in beta - sure you can talk about the price.. I guess its high - but its you who decide to buy or not.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I bought the game. I knew that it was buggy, had little to no features and was gonna be like beta testing the game - meaning its more about finding and reporting bugs and investigating bugs than playing. I knew the roadmap was without dates - I accepted that they didn\u0027t want to put dates because dates are seldom met any way (which is also my experience with previous early access games) and that was the foundation that I decided to do my purchase on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-18T13:57:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2023 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by BechMeister\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
