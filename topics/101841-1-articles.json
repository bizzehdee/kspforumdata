I was able to replicate your explosions and I think I know your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll get this kind of behaviour often when you have a ship directly in contact with the surface of a planet, not using wheels or landing gears or legs. You\u0027ll observe you do not get the explosions when you leave the ramp\u0027s gears down and switch to the craft back and forth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look closely, when deployed the back corner of the ramp\u0027s frame (the corner pointing to the camera in the above pictures) settles below the surface, which is why it pops out when the craft loads, which destroys the SAS module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in effect, the problem is both with the game physics and your design which doesnt take into account the wonky physics. You\u0027ll need to redesign the ramp such that you can leave it in a deployed state with only the landing gears touching the ground, or better yet use landing legs. The front will be a problem as you dont want a speed bump there; perhaps the 1x1 pannels will react differently if they are only slightly below the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghostbuzzer7","CreatedById":138096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T21:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks your tips have solved my life.
