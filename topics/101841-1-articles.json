It\u0027s hard to imagine that the two large units on the bottom aren\u0027t enough to turn that thing however you need it.\n\n\\*\\*Regardless it\u0027s worth mentioning that that thing looks rad. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T03:06:09Z","Content":"Whatever you\u0027re planning on doing with this... it cannot end well. lol"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T07:34:39Z","Content":"I\u0027ll bet its for the Minmus jump challenge some of us have been having fun with. \n\nI\u0027d guess its tearing itself apart with the strong SAS units pulling different ways.

I was able to replicate your explosions and I think I know your problem.\n\nYou\u0027ll get this kind of behaviour often when you have a ship directly in contact with the surface of a planet, not using wheels or landing gears or legs. You\u0027ll observe you do not get the explosions when you leave the ramp\u0027s gears down and switch to the craft back and forth. \n\nIf you look closely, when deployed the back corner of the ramp\u0027s frame (the corner pointing to the camera in the above pictures) settles below the surface, which is why it pops out when the craft loads, which destroys the SAS module.\n\nSo in effect, the problem is both with the game physics and your design which doesnt take into account the wonky physics. You\u0027ll need to redesign the ramp such that you can leave it in a deployed state with only the landing gears touching the ground, or better yet use landing legs. The front will be a problem as you dont want a speed bump there; perhaps the 1x1 pannels will react differently if they are only slightly below the surface."},{"CreatedByName":"ghostbuzzer7","CreatedById":138096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T21:14:31Z","Content":"Thanks your tips have solved my life.

It sure does look cool, i wonder how it will perform ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
