Allow me to suggest the following:\u003Cp\u003E- More realistic aero allows players to leverage their existing knowledge of aerodynamics, however rudimentary, when designing craft. Everyone has seen real life rockets, aircraft, streamlined cars, and other aerodynamic shapes. They should be able to apply those shapes to their benefit in a game that purports to have realistic flight simulation and see good results. Instead, they are punished for making craft that would have good aerodynamic properties IRL, due to dead mass of nosecones, tall and thin being less structurally sound than pancakes, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo an extent, it makes sense, but you could apply the same argument to orbital mechanics, and almost nobody has prior knowledge of orbital mechanics. The problem is that referencing realistic aerodynamics significantly limits the creativity of players. You can easily imagine a real world rocket or plane because they basically all look the same in the real world. Changing KSP to a system that works the same way will result in there being only a few effective solutions for any given problem, and thus players will not be able to create those wacky Kerbal designs that \u003Cem\u003Esomehow\u003C/em\u003E fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- More realistic aero is more challenging. Currently, pretty much anything can be thrown into orbit by simply strapping ever more radially attached boosters to the lifter. Having the frontal area of craft matter adds to the challenge by making overly wide designs less efficient.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ruins the \u0022more boosters\u0022 mantra which has been an integral part of KSP\u0027s style for a long time. Also, \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E challenging isn\u0027t necessarily better. KSP is quite difficult already, and adding what basically amounts to \u0022hard mode\u0022 isn\u0027t a way to expand upon the challenge. Tuning up the difficulty is usually a sign that a games challenges are not complex enough. An example of adding challenge without just boosting the overall difficulty would be adding more planets along the likes of Tylo and Eve, which are very difficult to conquer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- More realistic aero allows players to reuse experience from other flying games. Pretty much everyone who has played a non-arcadey flight game has to \u0022unlearn\u0022 their piloting techniques and learn new ones when trying to fly in stock aerodynamics. The learning curve for KSP is already pretty steep, why not allow players to tap their existing experience for parts of it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps it is just personal experience, but I\u0027ve never found KSP flight to be that jarring compared to realistic sims. From my experience with FAR, the only real difference I noticed was that everything is slower and more fragile, which can hardly be called an improvement from the gameplay sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- More realistic aero is educational. Part of KSP\u0027s satisfaction is in figuring out how some of the more complex mechanics work and learning to manipulate them to your advantage. Just about everything I know about orbital mechanics and spacecraft design is from KSP; because of what I\u0027ve learned here I have a better (though nowhere near perfect) understanding of real life maneuvers in space and I can reasonably claim the title of armchair rocket scientist. Aero is different, it\u0027s a mechanic that the player must figure out, only this time the things it teaches you are wrong, wrong, wrong. There\u0027s less satisfaction in figuring it out because it doesn\u0027t give you a better understanding of real life aero or the feeling that you\u0027re an armchair aircraft designer.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is debatable. The joy I get from flying hilarious monstrosities around balances out whatever I\u0027m losing in educational value.

I agree that the rules in the game are arbitrary, but it seems to me that an arbitrary set of aero rules that are closer to reality and other games would serve KSP well.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve done better than most at arguing your case without falling to that, but I still have to question how you can simultaneously claim that realistic aerodynamics make it both easier and harder at the same time.

The game is marketed as a space simulation game, ergo the game must be developed as a sim. Also, I want to quickly make a point. A realistic aero model will not be true-to-life accurate. This is not something we can ask of Squad and this is overcomplicated. A realistic aero model aims to make things which exist/work in reality behave as they would in reality while not necessarily modeling all the complexity and intricacy of real-world physics. A realistic aero model can imitate reality even if its not necessarily working like reality or modeling the same physics by which reality works, as long as the effects are generally predictable based on the real laws of physics and their calculations.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ENow, I personally am unable to find an answer for the debate of realism vs gameplay.

As you have probably seen, the first few flights of a player trying out FAR are always frustrating, as they now have to deal with not only do they have enough thrust and fuel, but also whether their rocket is aerodynamically stable and a more advanced gravity turn. Throwing a new player into that from the beginning isn\u0027t a good idea.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first few flights are a bit frustrating no matter the aero model, it\u0027s rare that a player can into space on the first try (I\u0027m sure there are some, I certainly wasn\u0027t one of them).
