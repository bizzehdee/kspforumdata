The launch was successful, and I detached my final upper stage. I did some experiments, and transmitted the science back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I was going to then go back to the space center to unlock some more parts. However,\u00A0I was stopped by a alert that said, If I was to go back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E my game would not be saved past the point where I launched the laboratory. I could have done a quick-save, but loading would just take me back up to \u0022in-flight\u0022 mode, with no way of going back to the space center without losing my science, orbit, and my save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done heavily-modded science worlds before, and I could always go back to the tracking station/ Space Center, when my Vessel was in orbit. Does anybody know if I can go back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E without reverting to a \u0022pre-launch save\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Sorry, I still haven\u0027t been playing that much Modded KSP yet.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-09T00:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally that only happens when you are in the atmosphere or you are accelerating in space.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you want to go back to the spacecenter, you need to land and stop or splashdown.
