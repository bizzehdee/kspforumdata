Also you need to turn no later than velocity=100m/s. That should be around 0.3-1.5km, depending on launch TWR. A good launch TWR is 1.2 sea level TWR BTW, and you turn start at 1.3km or so. Ferram himself commented a page or two back to someone with a similar question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny time you\u0027re not running at 100% thrust you\u0027re wasting mass (you could have used a lighter engine, and you\u0027re suffering more gravity losses than you could/wasting the Oberth effect).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe: #2, it takes ~1800-2000m/s to land on the moon; Apollo LM budgeted 2400 for DOI, descent, and hover.

However, i try to push through the thick atmosphere as fast as I can at around 1.8 TWR and below 220m/s. After which I throttle down and try to keep my apoapsis not too far from my current altitude(at a 30 to 60 second Time to Apoapsis so that, by my logic, I don\u0027t lose it again due to atmospheric drag). So far this has worked for me. But I\u0027m not sure this is the most efficient launch. I have gotten orbit with 9100m/s dV to an equatorial LKO(350km x 350km) with my CTV(Crew Transfer Vehicle) which has RCS and an additional 500m/s dV for orbital operations afterwards. This using FAR, KW Rocketry, MFS RFRM and procedural fairings. Should I find some better profile? Thrust less/more in some places?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 Munar/Zero-atmosphere landings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m struggling to adjust to the larger and longer descents in this mod. i did a Munar landing and, well, it went fine but was probably very inefficient. I set my periapsis at 10km behind my target landing site. I then tried to keep my TWR to around 1.5 whilst controlling my vertical speed with pitch. I touched down around 10 seconds after zeroing my horizontal speed(purely by chance). Is there a better method to do this? I don\u0027t want to waste fuel on keeping my vertical speed low during a 3 minute burn to burn off my horizontal speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9100 m/s is really good, less delta-v used than most real rockets. Lunar descent from a 100 km orbit (or ascent) takes a minimum of 1726 m/s with no gravity losses. So if you can do it with 1800 m/s that\u0027s really good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
