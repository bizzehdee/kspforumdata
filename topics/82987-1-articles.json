I just send my 4 part probe to Eve/Gilly. The plan was to leave a Scansat sat in orbit around both and have a lander for both. So lots of decoples was set ud. After decopling the lander for Eve from rest of craft the engine was selected as core part. The plan for probe was to let engine and fueltank burn up during entry to safe a decopler (playing with DR). Tried to change core part with the control from here of probes. But didnt work. So i lost the lander when engine broke. Now i have to wait for next transfer window and spend money on new rocket (playing no save mode). Is there anyway i could avoid what happened?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T21:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can switch between ships in immediate vicinity by pressing [ and ] keys (referring to english keyboard layout). So if you want to control different part of the ship than the one that stayed in focus after decoupling, keep press either of these keys until you get focus on the part you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romby","CreatedById":70744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T21:38:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk so i have to add decopler. Which will then set Heatshield as core part, change ship after dropping engine and again after dropping heatshield. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romby","CreatedById":70744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T21:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is isnt that i drop engine and i can switch. The problem was that engine exploded and entry and rest of ship disapered because engine was set as core part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T22:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mod, Select Root, but that works only in the VAB/SPH\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T22:06:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made a test and I built a ship with SRB as its root part, a pod, and a few sepatrons aimed at the SRB to overheat it. I launched to the atmosphere, then activated sepatrons. The SRB overheated and exploded and the game immediately switched focus to the command pod. Nothing has disappeared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wonder what exactly happened in your case as I probably don\u0027t understand it sufficiently.
