No parts or FFT engines are generating any heat (checked with debug menu), the radiators are deployed (but do not help), and normally the craft cools down within a few hours in-game. In the save file, \u0022tempExtUnexp = 5840\u0022 exists on all parts. I\u0027ve already tried reinstalling and removing several mods and editing that specific part of the save file. Is there any way to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft this is affecting is a large interplanetary ship with 200\u002B parts and FFT engines. Another craft in Kerbol orbit that is made of fewer parts which are all near-stock or stock is not affected by this issue for some reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis issue seems similar to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/205833-overheating-bug-on-ksp-1122-rss-on-loading-a-save-game/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/205833-overheating-bug-on-ksp-1122-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E-on-loading-a-save-game/\u003C/a\u003E , however I am not using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
