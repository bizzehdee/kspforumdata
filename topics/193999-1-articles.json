for the double post as I added this to another thread already, but wanted to tease this content out into its own thread so it might get more attention.\u00A0 Of course this is my own personal opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been playing KSP since beta and touch back into the game at least once a year to run a new space program and over the years I have my list of (more or less) essential mods I use whenever I can when playing KSP.\u00A0 A combination of several types of mods but collectively they greatly improve my overall experience with the game.\u00A0\u003Cu\u003E While yes, all these are mods, having to rely on mods for what I would consider base game play leads to an unreliable experience patch to patch.\u00A0 Many of these mods listed below play into each other and really expand on the science elements (more variety has always been better for me), or more meaningfully expand on the kerbals themselves.\u00A0 I find I care much more about the game when I have to consider the needs of the kerbals themselves, giving them a meaningful purpose to be included, and really ups the immersion and realism factor up for me.\u00A0 Factoring in things like life support and basic needs seems pretty obvious to me.\u00A0 They are their own life forms and needing basic necessities of life (whatever that means to them) seems pretty basic as leaving a kerbal in a can orbiting a planet for years seems improbable to me.\u00A0 Besides the needs, actually giving them a purpose!\u00A0 Attaching fuel lines, deploying science experiments, or doing science in labs (vs transmitting science back) are all really meaningful to me in KSP.\u00A0 \u00A0I think it should be optional to add this but for me I have far less investment in the game without having some collection of these mods below added to my program.\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*SCANSat: Basically the first mod I ever load.\u00A0 Greatly enhances the unmanned phase of my exploration.\u00A0 Gives a meaningful purpose for sending out probes and playing with orbits so I can map out a planet and use that information for planning ahead to my landing phases (maned or unmanned).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (Kerbal Attachment System): Basically an essential mod for me.\u00A0 I love the aspect of having my kerbal\u0027s function in a reasonable way.\u00A0 Gives them a more meaningful purpose to actually send manned mission beyond planting a flag.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E (Kerbal Inventory System):\u00A0Basically an essential mod for me.\u00A0 I love the aspect of having my kerbal\u0027s function in a reasonable

mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support: Kerbals gotta eat!\u00A0 In my mind this is a necessary/essential element to my game play.\u00A0 Needing to factor in the needs of my kerbals into my ship designs and overall space program adds a realistic and fun challenge.\u00A0 Makes the Kerbals more meaningful from a sandbox perspective.\u00A0 Base game makes them feel much more like cargo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*MechJeb: Pretty much an essential mod.\u00A0 Being able to autopilot operations means I can walk away at times (for life reasons), or have an autopilot handle some of the trickier maneuvers I am not good at.\u00A0 Greatly improves my enjoyment of the game and I consider to be essential to my gameplay.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbal Engineer Redux: should really be base functionality.\u003Cbr\u003E\nChatterer: Just makes for a funner, and more immersive game play experience.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEasy Vessel Switch (EVS): should be base functionality.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCommunity Tech Tree: Quality of Life (QOL)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTextureReplacer: Nice to be able to personalize my kerbals more.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Kolonization Systems (MKS/OKS): I only play with this lightly, mainly for the expanded parts so I have more base type elements to build.\u00A0 I believe much of this is being addressed in KSP2 already.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTransfer Window Planner: Quality of Life (QOL)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nManeuver Node Evolved: Just makes flying better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[x] Science!: Basically anything that adds more \u0022science\u0022 type things I will add to my game.\u00A0 Exploration and science is the name of the game for me, and doing it in a way that I keep my kerbal\u0027s alive.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJSI Advanced Transparent Pods: Just a fun aspect to add, though mod support is spotty, so has limited effect.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMagic Smoke Industries Infernal Robotics: Having this type of functionality I really wish was base game.\u00A0 The mod itself I have never had reliable results with and usually ditch it, but having robotic arms (etc), would be a fantastic addition to the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nScience Alert:\u00A0Quality of Life (QOL)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nContracts Window \u002B:\u00A0Quality of Life (QOL)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nField Training Lab (FTL): Expands on the focus I like to have with Kerbal\u0027s themselves.\u00A0 The base game has a fantastic focus on the ship building/flying/etc, so having more attention on the kerbals themselves is fantastic to me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP Craft Organizer:\u00A0Quality of Life (QOL)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWorldStabilizer: Hopefully won\u0027t be needed in KSP 2\u003Cbr\u003E\nDMagic Orbital Science Presents: Probe and Rover Science Pack: Again, more science!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Planetary Base Systems: Just more parts and the aesthetics are really nice.\u00A0 Plays well with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life support.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOPT Space Plane

It is also an excellent reason of launching into polar orbits. However, by showing the biomes it removes a bit of the exploration fun to turn it into a race, roaming all biomes to get MOAR science.

I do use it, but mainly because I\u0027m running multiple missions at the same time and I \u0022pin\u0022 all the next windows available to me to help on mission choice.

Developpers should never count on modders to end their work, but thay can see how active the community is, give the good tools to enable people to add more diverse gameplay mechanics and focus on making the gameplay fun, keep high modularity and high performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course that is also just a point of view, but I believe that KSP is meant to be relatively simple, to enable casual players to have fun while understanding a bit better space stuff\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E That\u0027s why I would be surprised to see complex life support or principia like physics \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-20T13:38:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2020 01:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Altaille\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-20T21:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few of those seem like good things to have as stock features- the transfer window planner and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E for sure, otherwise doing interstellar missions would be vastly more difficult (judging transfers to other planets \u0027by eye\u0027 is hard enough, never mind other solar systems!) and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E is one of the best QoL mods out there in my opinion as it makes it much harder to miss a critical maneuver node.

Also mods can target any point and just deal in that item without risk of tripping over another mod unless it too targets that point at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"betaking","CreatedById":58281,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-29T22:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndon\u0027t care for mechjeb,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhaving something like kOS (maybe with a \u0022Scratch\u0022 or \u0022Greenfoot\u0022\u00A0like interface) would be good though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nshouldn\u0027t just be able to autopilot your way stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-30T03:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223793438\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193999\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221590792124\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258281\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022betaking\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, betaking said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndon\u0027t care for mechjeb,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhaving something like kOS (maybe with a \u0022Scratch\u0022 or \u0022Greenfoot\u0022\u00A0like interface) would be good though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nshouldn\u0027t just be able to autopilot your way stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut all space flights are controlled by computers.
