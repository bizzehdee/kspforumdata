It is attracted to larger ships. Part clipping will summon it quickly, but it can also be lured to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E units that are misaligned from each other or even just by having more than one \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E unit on the craft. Trying to dock multiple units together can also make your multi-ship look very delicious, due to the modules sometimes not lining up perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally speaking, what\u0027s happening to cause this effect is a self-feeding phantom force. Part A is attached to part B, part A starts to move and part B follows slightly later. Part A gets pulled back by part B but by then part B is in a slightly different position from where part A was getting tugged to. It creates a tiny wave that on small ships is harmless and not really noticeable, but on larger ships the wave can become self-feeding and gradually get stronger each cycle until it rips the ship apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s some things for you to try:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Turn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E off. Sometimes it is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E causing the effect and turning it off stabilizes the ship. I have this happen most often on noodly rockets while in air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Try using fewer total docking ports, or avoiding making parallel docking circuits--make series-docking ships where possible. The wave can more easily feed itself when it loops around on itself. If you put all the modules in a line, it is less likely to be able to develop a self-feeding wave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.a.) If you do build a parallel circuit multi-ship, check the measurements VERY carefully. Try to make sure it matches up exactly by putting the exact same set of parts, attached only via attachment nodes, on all legs of the series circuit. If that doesn\u0027t work, try making them almost match up but be just barely off. Either one could work, all I know for sure is that the two will act differently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Check very carefully for part-clipping. Re-make modules if you have to. Parts that currently seem stable while the ship is partially built may in fact house the problem and may not show it until the ship gets larger. Pay attention to the way things fit together. Some parts clip very easily and willingly in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. Watch your symmetry. Sometimes multiple parts in symmetry look like one part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Try to summon the Kraken by wiggling the ship. See if you can beckon it to come while the ship is smaller/has fewer modules on it. Maybe you\u0027ll find that it\u0027s only a matter of time before the ship starts to wobble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) Try to use fewer parts, especially along the length of modules. The little bits hanging off the sides are generally fine, but use huge fuel tanks instead of big stacks of smaller tanks anywhere you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.) Try using the Kerbal Attachment System mod to install struts between the most wobbly modules. If you increase the ship\u0027s rigidity, you might prevent the Kraken from eating the ship. It\u0027s also possible, though less likely, that adding struts will make your ship more delicious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.) Alter the part configuration files and make their connections stronger/more rigid. This is essentially cheating but sometimes makes the game behave in a more reasonable manner. It\u0027s really up to you whether or not you feel like you are cheating as well as whether or not you\u0027re okay with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all I can think of. Hope one of these helps! If all else fails, build smaller. I know it\u0027s not what you want to hear, but KSP isn\u0027t built for what some of us are capable of dreaming up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberius K","CreatedById":163867,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T23:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for that, \u00A0I feel like the Kraken has a personality now. \u00A0My Kraken is content in just wobbling rather than gobbling and thankfully KJR sent it packing. \u00A0I think because I \u0027eyed\u0027 the rotation when docking the two\u00A0identical solar panel banks I introduced the slight asymmetry. \u00A0It is odd that there is no problem until reloading the craft though, surely the physics should be identical in both cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
