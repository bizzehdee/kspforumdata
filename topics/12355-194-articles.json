I had one last night that was pushing 12 and I\u0027ve heard of others with 20\u002B minute transfer burns. If transferring from Kerbin (especially lower orbits), the length of the burn can easily take up a sizable arc-length of an orbit, making it very inefficient as the craft \u0022chases\u0022 the target marker around the navball due to the orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible (is it already?) to have MJ take a look at the estimated burn length and enable an option to break up the burn into shorter segments and perform them in 5 - 6 minute long chunks at periapsis during successive orbits? This would allow greater efficiency from the Oberth effect and frankly, most planetary transfer windows aren\u0027t so tight that an hour or three to make \u0022segmented\u0022 transfer burns like this will affect things very much.
