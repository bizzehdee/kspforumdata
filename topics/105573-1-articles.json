But this was because I didn\u0027t do the training scenario\u0027s. As a first time player you just \u0022start career\u0022 and see what happens (with kind of a depressing end result). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a strong believer that tutorials should not exist and complex game mechanics should be explained in game so no tutorial is needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think that version 1.0 in not as noob friendly as it could be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should\u0027t have to watch youtube movies to know what I should do in career mode.

I meant that the simple texts we have now are not detailed enough, and need to show better how a rocket generally should be built; you need fuel, a rocket engine in direct connection to the tank, symmetrical layout, aerodynamical layout, what is needed to control the rocket (reaction wheels/aerodynamic control surfaces), and maybe how to reach orbit (Get out of atmosphere and burn sideways until you somehow achieve orbit).
