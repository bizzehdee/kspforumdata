I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been designing and testing ships, and working out mission logistics for months. I had to redesign some things when they came out with a 0.25, so when they came out with 0.9 I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t migrate just yet, but now it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been months.\n\nNow I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m finally getting ready to launch (still in 0.25) but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also getting jealous of you guys with the all new features and the new biomes. So I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m wondering what could go wrong if I upgrade after departure but before arrival at Jool.\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve heard things about probe cores no longer having any torque, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m using any of them for that. I am worried Kerbels and skills.\n\nNone of my Kerbels have skills, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m worried that when they get there they won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be able to change tires, move the science around or do other thing is because they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have the right skills. \n\nHow does that work? \n\nAny other dangers or pitfalls?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T11:12:22Z","Content":"The code that manages struts and fuel lines changed significantly for 0.90, you might discover that they\u0027ve disappeared from ships in flight. The old Mk3 parts were removed, so if you have vessels that use any of them they will quietly disappear. The kerbal skills thing was new for 0.90 as well, not sure what will happen to any kerbals you already have in space.\n\nJust proceed cautiously. Back up your 0.25 game, then migrate a copy of the save over to your 0.90 install and see if it works. That way you can revert to 0.25 if things go awry.\n\nNot sure if you\u0027re a mod user, if you are that might throw some additional stumbling blocks into the mix."},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T11:21:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The code that manages struts and fuel lines changed significantly for 0.90, you might discover that they\u0027ve disappeared from ships in flight.\n\nThere\u0027s my deal-breaker right there.\n\nOr more accurately a ship-breaker!
