I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been designing and testing ships, and working out mission logistics for months. I had to redesign some things when they came out with a 0.25, so when they came out with 0.9 I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t migrate just yet, but now it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m finally getting ready to launch (still in 0.25) but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also getting jealous of you guys with the all new features and the new biomes.
