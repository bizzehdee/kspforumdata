I don\u0027t see as many in 1.0.4 as I saw in 0.90. However, as I posted back then kraken alters the way you play the game in ways you don\u0027t even realize. Its a subconscious kraken avoidance mechanism. In general I see a critical bug about every 20 missions or so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUneven tank draining I have traced, its usually do to an assembly error. I place a cubic strut under the command module (its a physics-less part) door, and then two going sideways, when jeb gets out he lands o the strut, Then i can hit R and get then [shift] and s and he recedes from the ship. Again, the bugs alter the way you play. RCS I never use except for dedicated docking ships and refining intercepts, keep it off until you need it. So for example, suppose I am fine tuning a planetary intercept (focus planet) I first try to get close using my engines, then switch to RCS and use these to refine proximity. Once the orbit is refined I turn off RCS, because if you don\u0027t before warping or after warping the RCS will kick in and change attitude, but by doing this it applies differential thrust that will alter your orbit. To be safe you can shut off both the reaction wheels and RCS. If I do this I never have a problem and the ship intercepts where it is supposed to. If you design your ship where each thrusters along 3 axis are exactly the same distance from the center of gravity this should not happen, but this is difficult to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T22:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a Mun lander suffer a Kraken attack resulting in it\u0027s engine going missing, it slammed into the ground shortly there after.

First thing I discovered when making my transfer burn was that my ship had no battery left, since it relies on a remote guidance it was dead. I decided to rescue this ship with a solar paneled and manned version, then transfer the man to the dead ship and use the rescue-rescue ship to do the actual rescue. This all worked well. I did a 45k atm brake and then leveled the orbit to 75 /33k orbit about kerbin with reentry over the badlands continent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen things started to go wrong. I hit the space bar, however instead of the decoupler firing the parachute fired (and this was not the stage order either). So I reacted by setting the parachutes pressure at 0.25, re-entry went as planned but then the dreaded message appeared that the chute was destroyed by pressure, however I was only going 250 at the time. It seems that the kraken was taking a few whacks at me here. Not sure why. I could go to a recent backup, but I had one more trick up my sleeve. The attached engine and tank still had not fallen off and appeared to be stuck. So lets let them break the fall. I went to alt-F12 and hacked gravity. This allowed the ship to slow down enough and kept the trajectory around 45\u0027 lengthening the amount of time to slow down and decreasing the small gravity vector relative to drag. I turn the ship sideways to face the wind and decided to open the storage bin doors in hope that it may help. This got the craft down to about 10 m/s, -surface relative velocity on direction and kaboom the engine blows up and slows the craft down, however the tank and decoupler still do not fall off and the ship is flipping end over end toward water and I cannot any longer control which hits the ground first. luckily the next bounce hits on the tank and the wide open instrument storage and stops the spinning, so then as the ship came to its next bounce I unhacked the gravity and the open doors of the storage bin brings it to a prompt stop. Mission salvaged and of course the decoupler, still \u0027fired\u0027 and still stuck. Yeah its cheaty, but when the kraken puts a few claw marks in your back side kicking him in the nuts is proper order.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T15:50:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my earlier days I used quicksaving a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started playing hard-mode in Post V1.0 it became much more involved, since every maneuver mattered and a crash-landing could have a serious impact on the Kerbals.
