As I understand it, some games do not allow modders to access certain core game code, variables, and features.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to know if it is possible in Kerbal Space Program to make custom, animated Flight Indicators that have access to variables such as yaw, pitch, roll, vertical speed, altitude, and attitude. If you\u0027re curious about what I\u0027m trying to make, feel free to ask, however, please note that I am designing a custom indicator that does not exist on any aircraft of spacecraft that I know of and it may be difficult to describe without photos, which I do not have. The purpose is to provide a new way of visualizing flight variables in a way that is uniquely relative to the process of regaining control of a flipping, spinning spacecraft.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you for your time and help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Li0n","CreatedById":142527,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T22:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou keep your project secret so not easy to respond to you but you may want to check this mod that add \u0022gauges\u0022 to the screen.
