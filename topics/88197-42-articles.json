An number of people have gotten in trouble by basically placing a metal plate close to a power transmission line, a wire connected to a transformer and then to ground. No \u0027sparks\u0027 but they stole power none the less. I think we are getting away from the basic point because this is either electrostatic degassing and the drive is an artifact, or the so called virtual particles are interacting through a field undetected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can give a cogent counter example. Take an atom smasher. We take a proton and accelerate the proton in a magnetic field (using electromagnetism). Once the proton is going really fast it collides with other proton and this gives rise to virtual particles that transition to many different things, but ultimately what we see is electromagnetism indirectly. So the Cannae drive may be generating a resonance starting with a microwave, but then that could be converted to something else which then gives off a VP that transitions to something else and reverses itself once it finds a suitably similar target. Fields can act at great distance and VP interact with fields, it not a proof of anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base question is if mass is behind the drive, and you apply the unit, there is a chance that some known or unknown force is interacting with that mass, which means its useless as a drive. Alternatively its not interacting with that mass but the whole universe, which means its useful as a drive. But you cannot really distinguish the two in the lab because in a lab and particularly a vacuum chamber there is mass in every direction that can be pushed off of. There is no earthly place to perform this experiment. To confirm that this really is a drive, not a degassing equipment, throw it into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should point out that science is coming up with a hypothesis and finding a way to test it, not of creating a forgone conclusion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T06:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is an aether used by EMDrive as a reaction mass, I would expect a very similar behavior.
