If I ever were to expand (adding a Sr port to the bottom via EVA construction after I\u0027ve reached that point in the tech tree), I guess I should use a tug rather than having \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on station parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI switched to the Jumbo-64 fuel tank and added a SEQ-24 storage unit, which gave me more room to space out my solar panels and the two rings of docking ports. I\u0027ve removed some things I realized were redundant: no need for radial attachment points for the ports, standard-size docking ports already have lights, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can add more batteries, but I thought the Z-1K seemed like enough, given that the reaction wheel and probe core are the only consumers of power here. This will go in medium-low Kerbin orbit, so darkness will last a dozen minutes or so, during which the probe core would consume less than 20e out of 1000e.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI normally do use the non-retractable panels. But as you mention, breaking panels is a concern for docking, and I think the retractable panels will let me play it safe when docking something unwieldy.\u00A0 The extra 0.028 tons seems relatively negligible in this instance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI certainly don\u0027t anticipate having 9 things docked here anytime soon.

Maybe that\u0027s not actually a good use case?
