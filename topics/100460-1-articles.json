As evident by the z fighting. That can screw up the boolean operation. It looks like you are trying to cut some square holes into that detail there but not easy to tell without a good look at the two objects. This can be achieved with much more ease using the inset tool (select faces to inset and use hotkey I). But if you want to use boolean then try to scale the boolean object(the square insets) a small bit on the Y axis(set origin to geometry first) first then apply scale and try boolean again.\n\nbooleans are not a one shot sollution for cutting into meshes. I mainly only use them for cutting various details into spherical/cylindrical objects where they do an excellent job\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T22:28:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T23:29:38Z","Content":"\u003E I\u0027ve clearly said in the title boolean DIFFERENCE\n\nBut the screenshots show \u0022Intersect\u0022 even more clearly.
