Obviously when you are focused on a spacecraft time can pass from 0x (pause menu displayed) to 100000x depending on user input. Time also passes at 1x when you are in the tracking station which is made obvious by the clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I\u0027ve recently encountered some evidence that suggests time is passing when you are in either the VAB or the R\u0026amp;D building, which means the simulation of all the ships in space is still moving forward. I had been under the impression that time was frozen while you designed spaceships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone confirm if the simulation is meant to keep running while you are in the VAB/SPH/R\u0026amp;D/Astronaut buildings?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T15:25:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is intended that time will move forward while at the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
