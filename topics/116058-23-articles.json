First mission would be launching Quanta A relay in Kerbol orbit and then Quanta B would be sent to orbit other star. Any message sent to A wold be mimicked to B instantly, the only delay would be from the standard comm sats in Kerbol system.\n\nThe Ansible is a SciFi invention not really explained in the Ender\u0027s Game series. Same idea. Instant communication over unlimited distance. It was built in ships but no limitations were mentioned in the books.\n\nFor the sake of balance I envision a comms antenna that has to be out of a planetary SOI so would have to orbit in a gap in a systems planetary layout, would have to receive signals as standard radio waves and translate them on board and given to the Quanta. They could only be run as paired, so quanta a/b could only talk to each other. Each system would need it\u0027s own pairing.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that I have NO skills in programming, modding, or modeling or I would start on it tomorrow.\n\nAlacrity"},{"CreatedByName":"OndrikB","CreatedById":160905,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T19:13:07Z","Content":"Do the Sigma OPM Mods (recolor, tilt etc) work with GN?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-12T19:13:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2016 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by OndrikB**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T11:21:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 hours ago, OndrikB said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Do the Sigma OPM Mods (recolor, tilt etc) work with GN?\n\u003E \n\nI have never tested them so I cannot be sure 100%\n\nbut I can\u0027t think of any reason why they should not work, if you try it and find that it doesn\u0027t work very well, please let me know so that I can fix the issues they may cause ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-13T11:21:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2016 11:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Sigma88**"},{"CreatedByName":"OndrikB","CreatedById":160905,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T17:20:59Z","Content":"Also, do you have any warp-drive recommendations?

A number of the supported planet packs only bring in a single planet, would it be possible to have GN combine more of them around one star, the way you did with Asclepius and Kronkus?  I know those two were made by the same modder, so I don\u0027t know how much work it would take to have, say, Arkas, Saru, and Urania all together, but it would be cool to have more \u0022busy\u0022 solar systems to explore.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m following a set of self-imposed rules when building GN, and one of those is that every mod should have it\u0027s own system.\n\nit would pretty easy to do what you ask, just make a cfg like this:\n\n    @Kopernicus:FINAL\n    {@Body,*{\t@Orbit:HAS[#referenceBody[XXX]]\t{\t\treferenceBody = AAA\t}\t@Orbit:HAS[#referenceBody[YYY]]\t{\t\treferenceBody = AAA\t}\t@Orbit:HAS[#referenceBody[ZZZ]]\t{\t\treferenceBody = AAA\t}}\n    }\n\nthis will move all the systems that are in orbit around the stars **XXX**, **YYY**, **ZZZ** to orbit the star **AAA**\n\nif you need a more specific help with that feel free to pm me ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Elowiny","CreatedById":117659,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-16T08:42:32Z","Content":"I noticed  a little mistake : The description for Sido (The Sido planet pack star) says \u0022OPM star\u0022 instead of \u0022Urania star\u0022...
