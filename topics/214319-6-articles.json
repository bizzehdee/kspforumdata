The issue with that is it\u0027s fine for when your doing a game that is complete and the \u0027bugs\u0027 might be a list of things that are impacting one or two people, but when somethings a buggy EA mess that has a community screaming that it is broken and needs hotfixes, saying nope just wait is border line slapping the fans and purchasers in the face (in my opinion), especially when you could easily have a \u0027release\u0027 and a preview build in the steam list with preview being more rapid fire updates that get pushed to release in one big hit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I think has a lot of people upset at the moment is that you (the company, not you personally) have charged us (the players) a lot of money for a EA product when most things in this type of state are 1/2 the price, your asking near full release AAA price and then unlike when we had the product for free or even 7$ we are being told \u0027no, your gonna have to wait for patches for weeks at a time\u0027. Stop and look at how that is likely to be seen by the community. Harvester and his small group of programmers could throw out at times 4 versions in as little as a few days when it was nothing but really a love project at the time, while the company formed around literally making the sequel can\u0027t and then wonder why the community is \u0027well why?\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do work in the industry and even I am wondering, WHY a studio formed specifically for this purpose can\u0027t match a few guys working as their parent company lets them from time to time could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mushylog","CreatedById":227298,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-04T10:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on what I read, on both the KSP2 team and the people complaining, I think the team is going to make things a lot better, and I think the players who are deeply disappointed (haven\u0027t seen that many personally, just one or two on Steam refunding the game) just expected too much - or maybe they didn\u0027t realize it was an Early access... And to be fair I was surprised too, to see that it was EA! I actually thought it was done and finished. I wasn\u0027t expecting much, in fact I had no idea what to expect, I just know that the latest trailer really hyped me up!

Now I must do my penance by explaining what it looks like from the other side!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure one of our producers could give you a more precise answer, but here\u0027s the general idea: every time we release an update, we essentially take a snapshot build of the game and then test it like crazy. That uses up a huge amount of QA bandwidth, and for a game like KSP2 it really is a non-trivial amount of work to test it in a way that approximates the range of activities that the entire community might get up to in the game. As they test that snapshot build, they sometimes discover bugs. Many of them (hopefully most of them) will be known bugs that are already tracked and that we\u0027re already working on. But some of these bugs might actually be new bugs that have emerged since the last update. Those point to unintended outcomes related to recent checkins -- i.e. by fixing one problem, we have created a new problem. We are trying very hard to hold ourselves to the standard of \u0022the game should get better with every update,\u0022 and that means that we take this sort of bug very seriously. This means that when such a bug arises, production and engineering go over these issues with a fine-tooth comb and figure out what broke, and then additional fixes are applied to the build until it\u0027s in a good state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as you may have noticed, getting a candidate build to a level of quality that it\u0027s safe to release involves a lot of coordinated activity among a lot of people who also need to be advancing other areas of the game (for example bringing about perf improvements or working on roadmap features). Our update cadence is therefore carefully balanced against our need to keep pushing the entire game forward toward 1.0.\u00A0 Of course I would love to drop an update every day like the update Easter Bunny, but the reality is that each update comes with a cost, and we want to have the bandwidth to work on cool stuff like Colonies and Interstellar too. With that in mind, and because we want each update to contain lots of meaningful improvements, we can\u0027t release rapid-fire updates. HarvesteR was amazing and deserves his godlike status in this community, and I remember hanging on to his every post back when he was updating KSP. But I suspect that he was also constrained by similar production realities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, I think it\u0027s safe to say that our key focus today is to correct issues that affect the quality of gameplay, which means performance bugs, bugs that stop some players from being able to play the game at all, bugs that result in loss of vehicle, bugs that result in mission failure, bugs that result in the game crashing, and bugs that ruin campaign saves. When such fixes are complete, we do not intend to sit on them for a long time. One of life\u0027s great frustrations is to read a complaint about a bug online and know that it\u0027s been fixed internally. As long as the wait between updates may feel on the outside, let me assure you that it feels even longer on the inside!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163018-nestor/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022163018\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163018-nestor/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@nestor\u003C/a\u003Eis going to yell at me for speaking about this topic in a sloppy fashion, and I encourage him to join me in this thread if he\u0027d like to add more to my explanation.
