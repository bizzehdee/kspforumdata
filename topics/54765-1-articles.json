You can fit a Rockomax 24-77 almost anywhere you can fit an LV-1R, and the 24-77 has slightly better ISP and way better TWR. It\u0027s also a lot more powerful, so you get more total thrust out of the same amount of surface attachment space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-1 is so weak that it won\u0027t push most tiny probes much better than an ion engine will, and since the ion engine has way better ISP, it\u0027s almost unconditionally a better choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you could use them for fine control if the Rockomax 24-77 is too powerful at minimum thrust--though while it\u0027s a theoretical possibility, I\u0027ve never actually encountered this problem even on small craft. When the craft gets too small for 24-77s, it\u0027s usually a cinch to just put more fuel tanks on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I really can\u0027t find any use for the LV-1 or LV-1R except for laughs, though it\u0027s not even good at that because it\u0027s so weak you can\u0027t really push anything around with it. It might be funny if it exploded a lot, or sent your craft in funny directions...if it could even lift the craft in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to increase the ISP of the LV-1 and LV1-R to 560 in vacuum. This would place these engines squarely between the LV-909 and the LV-N in terms of TWR and ISP. It would make for an engine that helps close the gap between NERVAs and regular rockets, and it would also allow players to build moderately efficient ships in a smaller size, without having to resort to ion engines. But most of all, it would make the LV-1 and LV-1R actually useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I figured 560 ISP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe proportional median point between two numbers can be found by dividing the larger by the smaller, finding the square root of your result, and multiplying that by the smaller original number. For instance, the proportional median between 5 and 20 is 10: 20/5=4, sqrt of 4=2, 2x5=10. So I used this formula on the approximate TWR of the LV-N and LV-909 on Kerbin (2.67 and 10, respectively), which gives a proportional median of ~5.16 (about 5). This is already very close to the TWR of the LV-1 and LV-1R, so I nabbed the proportional median of their ISP as well: 800/390=2.05128(sqrt)=1.43223x390=558.57\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T05:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Ant really isn\u0027t designed for primary propulsion, it\u0027s for probe landers and small probe course corrections.
