As an example; in Historical Progression and History of Spaceflight, both packs note the importance of Sputnik as the first artificial satellite in orbit. However, Historical Progression is satisfied by simply achieving orbit, whereas History of Spaceflight requires the user match a particular orbit (presumably the one that Sputnik ended up in).\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain; I am not criticizing this difference, merely pointing out that there appears to be a difference in philosophy.

With permission, I had slowly been working on a revamp of pap1723\u0027s Historical Progression. I took a long break from KSP and literally started playing again just this weekend. I would like permission to blend the two packs together; specifically, I would like to use the current coding that you have on relevant missions with the parameters from Historical Progression. I am aware that your license allows me to do exactly that without explicit permission, but I would rather pay you due respect first and ask.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, if you want to discuss this at length, feel free to DM me.

I also feel that just specifying that an orbit has to be achieved doesn\u0027t represent the original mission specs well, for anything other than an equatorial low orbit. A more modular approach is of course still very much possible - for an example of this,\u00A0I\u00A0recommend taking a look at the contracts I built for BDB, which aim to achieve exactly that: a modular approach to a bunch of iconic mission profiles that can be applied to most bodies in a planetary system, without the requirements being overly rigid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are of course free to apply any material from this pack as you see fit.

A moment later it blips back in, errors and is gone again. I reproduced this for a whole range of contracts. Even upon accepting the contract as soon as it arrives, it gets auto-declined upon removal, citing that the requirements aren\u0027t met.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m 100% sure cheating the contracts into availability worked before, as it was the only sane way that I could do any sort of testing when I developed this pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-16T16:51:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2020 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Morphisor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eightiesboi","CreatedById":133828,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-16T20:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223882286\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192880\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221605527517\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022202433\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Morphisor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Morphisor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133828-eightiesboi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022133828\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133828-eightiesboi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@eightiesboi\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Thanks for the kind words.\u00A0 You\u0027re right, this pack aims at reproducing the actual flight in the most accurate way possible. I also feel that just specifying that an orbit has to be achieved doesn\u0027t represent the original mission specs well, for anything other than an equatorial low orbit. A more modular approach is of course still very much possible - for an example of this,\u00A0I\u00A0recommend taking a look at the contracts I built for BDB, which aim to achieve exactly that: a modular approach to a bunch of iconic mission profiles that can be applied to most bodies in a planetary system, without the requirements being overly rigid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are of course free to apply any material from this pack as you see fit.
