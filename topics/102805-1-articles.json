I personally would strip all the intakes and jets off and then put one shock cone intake on one side the a jet on that side and then place another shock cone intake on the other side then the second jet. This will reduce the tendency to flameout early on by tricking the game mechanics. You ideally wanna be doing at least 1500-1600m/s at 30km or faster. You can do it with less but it just makes your life harder. \n\nMake your initial climb up to 15-20km as quickly as you can then level out so you are climbing at about 10-20ms and just throttle back as your jets start to struggle for air until you get a flameout at under 1/3rd throttle then hit the rockets on.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nTweety"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T23:48:39Z","Content":"If you want to do spaceplanes, getting NEAR/FAR should be a high priority, tbh. Right now you seem to be fighting stock aero, which is unintuitive and not designed for planes.\n\nAlso, kicking the rocket in at 18km is at least 10km too low... nurse the jet throttle as long as you possibly can, keep the angle of ascent low, build up as much horizontal speed as you can muster before you finally kick in the rocket.\n\nIf you\u0027re relatively new to SSTOs, dump the docking port and the crew tank, and make a simpler design. It\u0027s not a thing you can pick up on first try, and the crew tank particularly is a lot of weight that doesn\u0027t contribute to thrust or fuel. IMHO, it\u0027s a crew tank, OR a cargo - because the crew is the cargo in the first instance."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T00:11:11Z","Content":"Make sure your wings are all oriented correctly.

SM did a report about this: [http://youtu.be/GvWzB81vXgM?t=2m49s](https://youtu.be/GvWzB81vXgM?t=2m49s)\n\nAt trans-orbital speeds, drag is the dominant factor. So if you can get by with less wings, so much the better. (Consider the Skylon; the wings on that one look *tiny* in comparison to the rest of it.) In fact, every little bit of stuff subtracts from performance. So remove as much stuff as you can. Do you have any excess fuel that could be subtracted?\n\nAlso, if that were my plane I would add another LV-909, or use two or more of the 48-7S instead. My reasoning is that that phase of the flight requires a relatively large boost of thrust to be efficient. Since the 48-7S has such a nice thrust-to-weight ratio, a few of those would dramatically improve the transition phase without adding much more weight.\n\nFinally, your ascent profile can change everything. Experiment with different ways of approaching the transition. Can you start the rockets before the jets shut down? (The extra speed means more intake air.) What about crossing over at a faster or slower rate of ascent? \n\nHope this helps too. Rest assured, building a SSTO is a tough challenge, and all those iterations you\u0027ve done are not unusual.

I used to need 50% of my fuel to get to a nice orbit, and now i\u0027m doing it with less than 20%. As to a starter, i\u0027d say go to 18K in a little time as you can (almost vertical climb), then level off and accelerate from there, with as little climb as you can. Try to see where you design stands, but you\u0027d want to be at least 1600 m/s before reaching 23K, where you\u0027ll need to throttle down to prevent flame out. Only switch to rocket mode once minimum throttle is still is too much to keep the engine from flaming-out.\n\nAlso, instead of making a multi-purpose plane (yours seems to be both cargo and transport), make separate versions.

A plane that size can be flown with a single turbojet engine. The advantage to that is you eliminate asymmetric flameout, you just keep the engine powered up until it stops making thrust. Perhaps try that vessel with a single jet engine and two small rocket engines.\n\n2. Climb profile: The climb profile varies with your ship, but here\u0027s what works very well for me, with similar ships.\n\n- Climb at 45-55 deg. until 10km altitude. That\u0027s 45-55 degrees *attitude*, although down this low your attitude and prograde vector should be very close.\n\n- Between 10km and 20km, gradually lower your pitch. Shoot for about 20 deg pitch. More important is where your prograde vector is, this should be down to about 10 deg above horizon by 20km. 5 degrees above horizon is fine at 20km also.\n\n- Above 20km, try to keep your prograde vector about 5 degrees above horizon. This will keep you climbing, and also allow you to build horizontal speed.\n\n- Above 36km, you should aim for level flight, with a slight climb. Prograde vector should be very slightly above horizon. Usually, you will need a pitch attitude of about 15 degrees at this point.\n\n- Your speed should reach over 1900m/s surface, or 2050 orbital. Ideally, you can reach 2300-2400 m/s at about 40km. Horizontal speed is more important than vertical speed.\n\n- When the jet stops working, switch to rockets. A low thrust setting is all that is required to give you the final push out of the atmosphere. Use rockets burning prograde, or perhaps 10 degrees nose up if required. Again, using rockets to maintain *horizontal* speed is more important than gaining vertical speed.\n\nYour design looks like it should reach orbit easily, with two jet engines or a single jet."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T01:05:51Z","Content":"In my spaceplane ascents using stock aero, I shoot for 700 m/s at 20 km, 1600 m/s at 30 km, and 2175 m/s at 36 km.

You are going too fast in the lower atmosphere, then transitioning to rockets too early and climbing too steeply.\n\n That is also way more engine and intake area than you actually need for that size airframe.\n\n![XL%20Series_zps7iaxcdes.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/XL%20Series_zps7iaxcdes.jpg)\n\n The best way to avoid asymmetric flameout issues is by using a single engine. This is adequate for up to 20t of aircraft, though 10-15t is more common. Also note how little rocket is actually needed for this job.\n\nTry this profile:\n\n At takeoff, pitch as steeply as you can to maintain 100 m/sec airspeed. \n\n Keep increasing pitch as necessary to maintain this speed until your climb rate hits 500m/sec.\n\n Maintain a maximum climb rate of 500m/sec until you hit 20km altitude.\n\n Reduce climb rate to 100m/sec, and maintain that to 27km altitude.\n\n Reduce climb rate to 50m/sec, and maintain that to 32km altitude.\n\n Reduce climb rate to 10m/sec, and maintain that until your angle of attack is 15\\*\n\nAt this point, your engines will begin to flameout. Throttle back incrementally to keep them lit and maintain 15\\* pitch.\n\n You should hit a suborbital trajectory around 40-45km altitude. Switch to map view and throttle back as necessary to maintain a 72km apoapsis.\n\n Eventually you will be unable to keep the jets lit. Switch to rockets at that point and throttle just enough to maintain a 70km apoapsis.\n\n When you have drifted up to 70km altitude, complete circularization.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T12:52:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T14:56:28Z","Content":"One thing to add here - if you experience assymetric thrust/flameouts, alt\u002Bright click both the turbojet engines (like you would when transferring fuel in tanks) and tweak their individual thrust limiters to keep symmetric thrust, while slowing overall throttle (ctrl) to prevent flamouts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As you can see, I had to throttle the left engine to keep it from smothering the right one\n\u003E ![IVyPKmN.png](http://i.imgur.com/IVyPKmN.png)\n\u003E It made all the difference - when I just switched to the rockets at the first sign of flameout, I barely managed orbit with no fuel left.

These 2 things never bothered me me very much and i kept forgetting about it in the SPH.\n\nThis time, i used the thottle to adjust my vertical speed, something i never did before. I always kept the throttle at 100% and used the pitch for this, which was not very accurate. Now, I had an eye on my ascend rate, acceleration and intake air and adjusted the trottle to keep it all in control.
