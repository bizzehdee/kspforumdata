Climb profile: The climb profile varies with your ship, but here\u0027s what works very well for me, with similar ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Climb at 45-55 deg. until 10km altitude.

This will keep you climbing, and also allow you to build horizontal speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Above 36km, you should aim for level flight, with a slight climb. Prograde vector should be very slightly above horizon. Usually, you will need a pitch attitude of about 15 degrees at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your speed should reach over 1900m/s surface, or 2050 orbital.

You probably won\u0027t do multi purpose mission anyway, so make everything you bring to orbit count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDone that in the X8. Kerbals were supposed to take a nap in the crew module if there\u0027s no maneuver to fly. Well, since my kerbals already managed to fly to Duna with the tiny and uncomfortable 3 man capsule, any development for increasing the quality of comfort during flight was therefore ditched due to resolve the now conflicting goals \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E (managing to get into orbit vs. a nice flight wasn\u0027t much of a choice for me) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zephram Kerman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zephram Kerman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh, I forgot to mention one more thing. I notice you have MechJeb on this plane. If you\u0027re using MechJeb\u0027s \u0022prevent flame-out\u0022 utility, be aware it is overcautious. Even with the safety margin set to 0%, MJ will cut throttle too much. If you\u0027re trying to coax the turbojets to the edge of the envelope, don\u0027t use that utility. Instead, manage throttle manually. (I like to keep an eye on the yaw indicator. Once it starts sliding over one way, I know flame-out is near.) MJ flame-out prevention will rob too much performance.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMachjeb was only used to control keep pitch, heading and roll steady. Also, i used this intake mod to assign the intakes to the engines, so there are no suprises or assymentric flame outs. all left intakes are aligned to the left engine and vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here\u0027s what i did today:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- removed the crew module\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- added another LF-Tank for the Jets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- re-did the wings, as CoF/CoM was messed up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- re-aligned the RCS-Thrusters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe the rear landing gear was also moved a bit forwards and i fixed the action groups, because a few intakes where not toggled. These 2 things never bothered me me very much and i kept forgetting about it in the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time, i used the thottle to adjust my vertical speed, something i never did before. I always kept the throttle at 100% and used the pitch for this, which was not very accurate. Now, I had an eye on my ascend rate, acceleration and intake air and adjusted the trottle to keep it all in control. I was _so_ surprised by this: 1600m/s at 30 km with 0.20 intake air left iirc. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did 2 mistakes during the kick-out burn and quickloaded, but then i managed to get into an 260km circular orbit. YAY!!!!!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space, i transferred a bit fuel back to the jets to have reserve, because i thought \u0022you certainly mess up the timing to land!\u0022 I did. Re-Entry was somewhere above the desert west of KSC, during the flight back to the runway, fuel was about the run out, so i throttled up and down to keep my consumption rather low. After a while i thought \u0022Well, now you don\u0027t need that much fuel....but your speed is as slow as your consumption!\u0022. \u003Cstrong\u003EJust \u003C/strong\u003Ebefore the runway, i got a surprise flameout on one jet and i landed nearby. I just 50m away from the runway. Cause of the Flameout: Assymetric fuel transfer. The other engine had 0.95 LF left, the flamed out one was dry. Who thought that this tiny amount of fuel might get important anyway? But hey, all survived and the did not end up at the other side of the planet! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 flaw i still have: I needed to transfer fuel from my rocket to the jets during ascend, but before overhauling the design once again, i\u0027ll just experiment with more agressive flight profiles. I think i kept the vertical speed to 10-20 m/s to early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut once again, thank you for you tipps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
