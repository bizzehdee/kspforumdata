Also it is using 2 nuclear rockets with 60kn each and an isp 800\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The rocket equation when using Isp is DeltaV=Isp*g0*ln(M0/M1), where g0 = Gravity (9.81m/s^2), M0 is mass when full of fuel, and M1 is empty weight. So pulling down from above, we have an approximate empty weight of 12.8 (Fuel units weigh about 0.0111 each, so 46.1-(0.0111*3000))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E DeltaV=800*9.81*ln(46.1/12.8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E DeltaV=7848*ln(3.6015625)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E DeltaV=7848*1.325\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E DeltaV=10398.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So you should have plenty of DeltaV for things, assuming you have a way to get all that into space directly. The harder part of those engines is they are pretty bad in Atmosphere by comparison (Having an Isp of 280 instead of 800 in atmosphere, plugging that into the equation you come out to 3639.51, on those engines alone, you won\u0027t even get into orbit from the surface! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For TWR you are looking at TWR=Thrust/(m0*g), so in this case, TWR on Kerbin would be 120/(46.1*9.81), or 0.265, whereas in space it would be 2.603 (120/46.1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As such, I would expect your ship to work quite well in space with those engines, but on Kerbin, It wouldn\u0027t lift off by itself. Taking that ship, strapping it to a rocket and getting it to space first is your best bet.

It seems to make sense to me that a lower TWR leads to longer flight times and KER is definitely correct, as far as I can tell from my tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Disregard. I might have gotten confused when I added mass, will test again tonight.
