I have been watching a lot of Twitch streamers over the past 24 hours, one thing stands out and that is the game is indeed still very \u003Cstrong\u003Ealpha\u003C/strong\u003E. Graphics wise the solar system looks absolutely superb, the model textures as well and the sense of scale seems very vast. Seeing were the orbital mechanics of objects around solar bodies in navigation views was very nice and also the maneuver nodes and node execution time is a nice addition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now for the negatives (from what I have seen) if you have a KSP back ground, like most of us here, \u003Cstrong\u003Ea lot is still left to be desired TBH\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big downside IMO in this iteration being: the only means to get from A to B is using the warp mechanics and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to do approaches targets. There seems no convention \u0022engine\u0022 implemented yet, I read this will be added upcoming patches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe warp mechanics is rather simplistic and does not take conservation of local momentum (you initial orbital velocity) into account. So your ships relative velocity vs your targets relative velocity does not need to be cut before warping to target and is magically adjusted when getting out of \u0022 warp\u0022. For me \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E method of implementing such plot device is rather immersion breaking tbh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther more the UI, icons for Pg/Rg/NM/aNM/R/aR have not been implemented! Nor are there any indicators of you ships orbital velocity vs reference body, or relative velocity vs a target. I hope this will be implemented asap when the conventional engines are released in the future, otherwise I can\u0027t see how one could ever do more complex navigation outside of point, click and warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-25T11:32:47Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2017 11:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Gkirmathal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T18:13:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022spotted\u0022 this one as well follwing it look interesting and eventually promising ^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
