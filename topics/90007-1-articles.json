VTOL, SSTO, cargo bay with ramp... it lacks cloaking, but that\u0026#039;s about it.","CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T14:06:28Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T14:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, if you have seen the Avengers, or Agents of SHIELD, this might perhaps remind you of something. Here, a picture is worth a thousand words:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tuLbdiH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tuLbdiH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is a dramatic picture indeed. But why is it so squat? And does it work like the thing in the movies? Well, for that I have to show you the hardest thing of this build: the stock cargo bay with working ramp to offload \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E recover the included rover. Yup, it carries a rover. And up to six kerbal in pressurised compartments, and I only put two seats in the cargo bay, but you can of course increase that number, plenty of room there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nB6jqD8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nB6jqD8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, it gets high, as in \u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E high. So I guess with enough fuel depots, you could perfectly use this on Laythe. Efficient airbreathing jets as lift engines mean that Duna is off the table, but I\u0027m working on that for another \u0022slightly bigger\u0022 design. Suffice to say I have yet to find a way to move battle tanks around the system! But that one will probably end up using KAS to secure the payloads, so in the meantime, have fun deploying your scientists/troops at any point where they can breathe the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p7uMWbu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p7uMWbu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should give you and idea of its capabilities, so let\u0027s talk user manual. The bay is perfectly workable (I have done rover contracts with this, for 100% recovery at the runway), but it is finicky. You should deploy both stages of the \u0022ramp lowering mechanism\u0022 (AKA the landing legs) in sequence. If both engage at the same time, the ramp actually works as a misaligned kraken drive, so be careful with it! If the Quinjet starts floating, disengage the rear landing legs quickly and try again, it should work if you take your time and look up the action groups in the description. The good part is, when they disengage, the bay bounces back into a very clean dock with the locking docking port, so the RCS engine for pulling the ramp up is not really necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, getting this to orbit is \u003Cem\u003Etight\u003C/em\u003E. Your rocket delta-v is kinda limited, and this isn\u0027t the most arihogging of designs, so you can\u0027t go much over 1,500m/s without switching to rocket power. And even though I tried to get both engines to flame out at the same time by having a thought-out intake placement, the small differential you can\u0027t get rid off is enough to screw with you due to the engines being placed so far apart, so let them switch automatically when they want to. You have ample T/W on rocket mode, too, but in airbreathing mode, it is nothing to write home about, just enough to climb too quickly and run out of air before getting to sufficient speed if you are not careful. And while I am talking about the ascent, a word of caution. Everything is completely misaligned! Not in a bad way, though, but you thrust 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA below centreline, and the main cockpit is angled down 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. The end result is that, if you control from the cockpit, you are thrusting in space about 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA higher than the navball tells you. Which is kinda cool, since in low level flight that means you velocity vector likes to stay in the same place you are pointing at. Yup, the way I worked things out, when you think you are horizontal the engines are thrusting 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA upwards and the wings see a 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA angle of attack. Like real planes! (short off) However, when you are on VTOL flight, you have to keep an eye on that: unless you point yourself 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA below the horizon, the VTOL engines are thrusting slightly backwards, and you don\u0027t want to go backwards on a VTOL designed to actually work like a conventional plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd come to think about it, I almost forgot about that part! The VTOL system \u003Cem\u003Eis a total aesthetic choice\u003C/em\u003E: rip it out, and this still works just fine, lifting off about halfway into the runway, at about 70m/s. Or you know, replace it with efficient rocket engines to create your own Duna-rated STOVL version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMGUR ALBUM:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/xzI2L\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

But why is it so squat? And does it work like the thing in the movies? Well, for that I have to show you the hardest thing of this build: the stock cargo bay with working ramp to offload \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E recover the included rover. Yup, it carries a rover. And up to six kerbal in pressurised compartments, and I only put two seats in the cargo bay, but you can of course increase that number, plenty of room there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nB6jqD8.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/nB6jqD8.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, it gets high, as in \u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E high. So I guess with enough fuel depots, you could perfectly use this on Laythe. Efficient airbreathing jets as lift engines mean that Duna is off the table, but I\u0027m working on that for another \u0022slightly bigger\u0022 design. Suffice to say I have yet to find a way to move battle tanks around the system! But that one will probably end up using KAS to secure the payloads, so in the meantime, have fun deploying your troops/scientists at any point where they can breathe the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p7uMWbu.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/p7uMWbu.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should give you and idea of its capabilities, so let\u0027s talk user manual. The bay is perfectly workable (I have done rover contracts with this, for 100% recovery at the runway), but it is finicky. You should deploy both stages of the \u0022ramp lowering mechanism\u0022 (AKA the landing legs) in sequence. If both engage at the same time, the ramp actually works as a misaligned kraken drive, so be careful with it! If the Quinjet starts floating, disengage the rear landing legs quickly and try again, it should work if you take your time and look up the action groups in the description. The good part is, when they disengage, the bay bounces back into a very clean dock with the locking docking port, so the RCS engine for pulling the ramp up is not really necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, getting this to orbit is \u003Cem\u003Etight\u003C/em\u003E. Your rocket delta-v is kinda limited, and it isn\u0027t the most arihogging of designs, so you can\u0027t go much over 1,500m/s without switching to rocket power. And even though I tried to get both engines to flame out at the same time by having a thought-out intake placement, the small differential you can\u0027t get rid off is enough to screw with you due to the engines being placed so far apart, so let them switch automatically when they want to. You have ample T/W on rocket mode, too, but in airbreathing mode, it is nothing to write home about, just enough to climb too quickly and run out of air before getting to sufficient speed. And while I am talking about the ascent, a word of caution. Everything is completely misaligned! Not in a bad way, though, but you thrust 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA below centreline, and the main cockpit is angled down 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA. The end result is that, if you control from the cockpit, you are thrusting in space about 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA higher than the navball tells you. Which is kinda cool, since in low level flight that means you velocity vector likes to stay in the same place you are pointing at in level-ish flight. Yup, the way I worked things out, when you think you are horizontal the engines are thrusting 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA upwards and the wings see a 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA angle of attack. Like real planes! (short off) However, when you are on VTOL flight, you have to keep an eye on that: unless you point yourself 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA below the horizon, the VTOL engines are thrusting slightly backwards, and you don\u0027t want to go backwards on a VTOL designed to actually work like a conventional plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd come to think about it, I almost forgot about that! The VTOL system \u003Cem\u003Eis a total aesthetic choice\u003C/em\u003E: rip it out, and this still works just fine, lifting off about halfway into the runway, at about 70m/s.

Whatever kind you are using now is seeing lift, so if you put the other kind on the same orientation, it\u0027ll think it is flying sideways and not generate lift. In the stock aerodynamic model, of course. Also, the IR hinge must make thing easier, but I doubt you can get the same kind of rigidity as with a docked payload bay... now that soulreaver has dissected mine, what about trying it again stock?
