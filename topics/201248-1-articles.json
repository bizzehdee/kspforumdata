This is measured in seconds and represents how long a given engine can produce a given thrust with a given quantity of fuel; much like miles per gallon in a car, more is better as you\u2019re sipping the fuel instead of guzzling it.

This is a key part of the rocket equation as it tells you how much of your rocket is fuel and how much is, well, rocket. You want the fuel fraction to be as high as possible, so using one FL-T800 will be better than 8x FL-T100 tanks as the dry weight of the bigger tank is comparatively less for the same mass of fuel. This is one key reason why rockets use stages- dropping the dead weight of empty fuel tanks and heavy booster engines makes you go further with what you have left. Cutting weight where possible e.g. using fewer, larger tanks or removing some parts you don\u2019t absolutely \u003Ci\u003Ehave\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Eto have,\u00A0will improve your delta-V under most circumstances, but the heavy stuff like science experiments are why you\u2019re going out there in the first place so there\u2019s always a balance to be struck.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nDelta-V is simply\u00A0how much can you change (delta) your velocity (v). Speed is distance (in metres,\u00A0m) over time (in seconds, s) so delta-V is in metres per second (m/s); not to be confused with acceleration which is a change in velocity (m/s) over time (s) and is measured in m/s/s or m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. Going anywhere in space requires changing your velocity so delta-V gives you your range- using a delta-V map gives you an approximate guide to where you can get to with the delta-V you have available and there are some in-game mods that are helpful for this too, such as Astrogator and Where Can I Go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen designing a mission, start at the top with your mission payload. Decide where you\u2019re going and if you\u2019re coming back, then design your probe/lander/rover/whatever accordingly. Add the uppermost rocket stage to have enough delta-V to do what you need to do, whether that\u2019s returning from the Mun or capturing into orbit of Eeloo, then add each stage below so that each has sufficient range to let the next one do its job with a small margin (I\u2019d say 10-20%) on top. Keep the weight down by using a smaller number of bigger tanks e.g. one FL-T800 instead of 8 FL-T100s, and make sure to check the surface \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and delta-V for the first stage to ensure it can get off the ground in the first place. One useful trick for launch rockets is to add fuel tanks on top of radial solid boosters and enable the crossfeed on their decouplers- the tanks on the boosters should drain first, powering the main engine(s) and then being dropped with the spent boosters. This can give you quite a lot more fuel without impacting your surfaceTWR too much as solid boosters are generally pretty powerful for their size and weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrial and error is the best way to learn. Videos and tutorials can help, but they\u2019ll only get you so far and you need to do it for yourself to really understand it. Don\u2019t be afraid of making mistakes, by learning what doesn\u2019t work you\u2019ll also learn what does.

XD (Not sure what i expected, as what everyone is saying, it is literally rocket science)). Most of what you explained I did already have a realistic grasp on (say the fact that the more you put on your rocket the heavier it will be, the more thrust required, thus requiring more fuel, thus making the rocket heavier). As stupid as it sounds, for some reason I hadn\u0027t\u00A0thought to actually take the time and make each section piece by piece making sure they each had enough fuel and the correct boosters for their designated spot on the trip. I\u0027ll get back to this later but I have done multiple attempts at a Mun mission each time failing. I made it there but always never had enough fuel to take off again, essentially being stranded.

Once again what I said to King, I also hadn\u0027t\u00A0thought to lay out my entire mission as the stages, essentially going in reverse not from Kerbin to Mun but rather Mun to Kerbin. Starting with the lander and making sure it can land and take off and then proceed to enter Kerbins Orbit close enough to hit the atmosphere for an airbrake. Then looking at what it takes to go from Kerbins Orbit to the Mun, then the stages to take off etc. You talked about using side boosters but essentially running a main engine plus the side boosters off of their fuel. Im assuming this is with the fuel lines (which at my point in the game dont have researched yet but will keep that in mind as I can see how you can still get the starting push up with the side engines then once in the air they are gone but still full on fuel in the main fuel tanks.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, I appreciate your comment and will take note of the things you have pointed out and appreciate your time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125662\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Snark\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Noting down your System I will try it.

Tried different engines on the lander stage as well as extra fuel but always fell short as then my lower stages couldnt get me there in the first place!
