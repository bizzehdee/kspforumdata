It can also happen if you connect wings/control surfaces to a rounded part, because the angle snap sometimes attaches a little tilted, due to the model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then what basically happens is you reach a point where one of the lift surfaces could be at zero AoA, and generates zero lift.

You can watch how the CoL shifts. If there\u0027s a dramatic jump, you just need to make sure it\u0027s at an AoA that you either aren\u0027t going to be near, or that the resultant lift is small and won\u0027t cause an out of control situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can rotate the ship by either SHIFT\u002BCLICK and SHIFT\u002BWASD the whole thing, or you can select the rotation gizmo and then the root part (I think you can also SHIFT\u002BCLICK when using the rotate gizmo).
