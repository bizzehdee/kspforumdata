I was immediately hooked and bought the full game after only a few hours of playing, and I have been happily shooting off rockets ever since. I\u0027m getting pretty good at building and flying conventional rockets - I\u0027m assembling a space station in LKO and mining/refueling operation over Minimus - but so far a working SSTO spaceplane has escaped me. I have been able to get to 75-80km apoapsis, but have usually required anywhere from 800 to 1200 more dV in order to circularize....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027m happy to join the community! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T12:03:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, you\u0027ve done a lot in KSP!
