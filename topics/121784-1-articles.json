A space Station cupola or something. Maybe one of those inflatable ring habitat mod parts. Just, a base part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou launch it into space (or leave it on the ground, whatever) and set up a station. The \u0027Market Place\u0027 then checks the SoI and whether it is landed or in orbit, then assigns condition modifiers based on those conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: If on Kerbin, fuel, standard ore, and normal metals would be cheaper, but \u0027rare metals\u0027 , \u0027super rare metals\u0027, and \u0027offworld products\u0027 would be highly valueable. (More thoughts on said products later.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut just in orbit, the price of metals goes up, along with fuel. While rares, super rares, and offworld products are down a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtrapolate how the multipliers work across Kerbol System\u0027s various planets, and you have a wide base market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this market sets values for products, and then over time, prices rise and fall based on [insert simulated simplistic demand trends code here] and what the player sells or buys at the market. Movement of materials outside of the players hands are not simulated. We assume that with a full fledged market, invisible Kerbals are running around the player universe. (To keep from murdering the physics engine) The wares being bought and sold are not based on parts either, but extracted from files such as the community resource pack. Essentially, if it\u0027s deemed a resource in code, then it can be bought and sold (Assuming you have a vessel that can store it when you\u0027ve bought it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means you can buy and sell, just about anything you can afford. From valuable asteroid materials back to Kerbin, to selling food in orbit around Duna, to revealing new low G or zero-G manufactured products to the markets on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the mentioned off world products, rare, and super rare metals. It\u0027s a simplification and split off of ISRU metals. Now you have ore and metals, which can be found anywhere, and then rare metals, which are harder to find, and super-rares, which pretty much only exist in the areas that are a pain to reach, but worth the trip. That is, unless someone decides to up the realism a notch and actually split metals into things like iron, cobalt, aluminium, silicon... etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOffworld products, are materials or products that require different sets of resources, but can only be manufactured in a facility in a specific flight condition. Zero G products are worth a decent amount on the ground, but as the name implies, can only be manufactured in orbit. Low G products are similar, but for the surface of Low G planets. Either type go for amounts similar to rares and super rares in places like Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaid manufacturing units can be additional unit parts, allowing the player to manufacture in space, or on-site on another world. And don\u0027t fear a player cheating the system and selling something they manufactured on the very same station as a Market Place. The SOI and Condition value adjustments would make the operation fairly unprofitable to sell in the same place it can be manufactured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the core idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther whimsy ideas that popped up in my head while writing this. Not important, but might be interesting ideas to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Add an antenna to a market station, and other market stations, and have the markets influence each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Give the player an always accessible \u0027market overview\u0027 window that shows them system-wide general market behavior (average of all market values) as well as the ability to look at a station in particular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stock Market (Buy/Sell/Trade without ever moving the products in a ship, just let the background handle it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Other companies. (A handful of companies are picked at loading and their own sales and purchases \u0027manipulate\u0027 the market instead of some semi-random demand modifier.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u0027Event\u0027 like demand spikes (both up and down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Shipyards (BUY fully built ships you designed at whatever station happens to be there. Would likely use EL mechanics.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nahim","CreatedById":78568,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T20:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo....
