I have no problems with docking ships in orbit but when it comes up to landing my ship almost always either crashes to the ground (that\u0027s less often) or falls over (almost always).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean landing without using parachutes of course. I have no problem deploying parachutes and waiting till it safely falls down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd without using mods. I know there are mods that can land for me but that\u0027s not what I have on mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the general rule is to \u0022kill horizontal velocity\u0022 in sufficient height and then brake the fall until I am on the ground. But I never manage to kill that horizontal shift well enough. I usually kill most of it using my main engine, then aim upwards and try to get the rest using RCS. But I never manage to put my own aim exactly at the center of the navball and the main engine thrust always adds some acceleration in random direction which is usually not visible when my vertical velocity is more than 5 m/s but is enough to make my ship fall over when I touch the ground. Also the main engine thrust never matches the gravity, I am always accelerating either down or up, which makes me \u0022bunny hopping\u0022 all over the place as I never manage to kill all velocities at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on slopes (which is almost anywhere on Mun now) is another story as I can\u0027t see the slope gradient on my navball, I found chase camera completely useless for landing and the fact that my ships are usually symmetric mean that I have no idea which direction should I be driving on navball to make it up slope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some kind of trick to it or do I just need more practice?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-13T12:50:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2013 12:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T06:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell first things first, for slopes, you might want to head for the bottom of craters, they\u0027re probably the best place to land on the Mun right now.

Your muscle memory tells you one thing, while the actual directions are only correct on the NavBall(unless you can think very fast and pan the camera around). In any case landing sites should be identified from orbit, not when you are already killing speed. A few other points: 1. Doing suicide burns is only good if you produce medium to high-TWR craft with atleast 1.5 times the fuel amount needed for a normal landing, since killing all rvel while in orbit results in large dV losses. You pick most of the speed back on the way to the surface, so you end losing almost twice the default dV required for a landing. 2. I didn\u0027t say not to use visual navigation, I suggested you should use it for anything but directional movement. 3. Your Navball has different modes like Target, Surface and Orbit. In any of the three cases it shows relative velocity with the appropriate markers needed for gaining/losing it, not just vertical. If it showed only vertical velocity the pro/retro-grade markers would always be in the top/bottom centers of the navball. 4. If you are more used to suicide burns (however bad this would prove when you try to land on another body, not just the Mun, Minmus and Duna, being the easiest to reach) you should not have almost any horizontal velocity to start with. Even if you have any, that high up in the orbit, you have more than enough time to kill it on the way down by pointing your engine at the prograde marker and burning in short bursts until the marker centers on the \u0022top\u0022 of the Navball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T13:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally, you just need more practice.

Design of the lander is also crucial - lights help to an extent, I-beams help a great deal actually, tall and narrow tips over while short and wide lands. How do you widen the lander? If you\u0027re using an FL-T400 for a tank, swap it out with four FL-T100s - one in the center and three outboard, and connect the outboard tanks with fuel lines. You\u0027ve added no mass, but you\u0027ve definitely widened the base. An Fl-800? Use four FL-T200s. A Rockomax 8?
