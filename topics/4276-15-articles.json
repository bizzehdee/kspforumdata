Also i will be rebalancing their power. currently they are merely twice as powerful as the 0.5 versions. however according to specs from Space X the Griffin engines will be more powerful than a mere twice their smaller counter parts. If I make it so Three can power the Failcan core to space with equal thrust they should make 900 thrust. and chug fuel. however I think i will up their power from their original 690 to like 750 and leave their fuel consumptions down. This should result in slower launch speed but more lifting capabilities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen cost comes into play and needs balancing they will of course cost a good bit more than 9 kerlins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: first succsessful launch.
