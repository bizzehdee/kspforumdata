If anything, I can see this being more of a game mechanic suggestion than a question. For all we know, career mode might not even go in-depth enough for re-usable crafts to matter, but we won\u0027t know until we get there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T23:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you may also have to pay refurbishment and recovery costs.

Anything on rails, and below a certain cutoff threshold altitude (which i *think* is about 30km for Kerbin, but please speak up anyone if that\u0027s wrong) will be destroyed. I don\u0027t see any of this changing soon. Recovery feature has already been added, yet it still works like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the way it works now, best I can think of for a re-usable multi stage rocket is to have two stacked booster stages. First stage needs to be large, and be able to lift the whole rocket into a sharp suborbital, with say Ap at 100, with trajectory set for splashdown just off KSC. That suborbital will give you enough time to decouple and use the next stage to circularise, then switch back to the first stage booster to land it. Then return back to the craft in orbit, decouple second stage, deorbit and land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T05:55:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bsalis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bsalis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(which i *think* is about 30km for Kerbin, but please speak up anyone if that\u0027s wrong)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E23 km for Kerbin.
