Mainsails and SRB\u0027s) but once in a stable orbit around kerbin, you must have a ion powered craft that has at least one kerbal aboard. The kerbal does not need a capsule, so you could use the external command seat for top efficiency. And with that you must go to minmus and reach a stable orbit, and land all with the power of ion engines. Return to kerbin is not necessary.
