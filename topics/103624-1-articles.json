A dog is sentient. A \u003Cem\u003Etapeworm\u003C/em\u003E is sentient even, though certainly less so than a dog. Supposedly even some single-celled organisms have shown signs of sensing the environment and acting in self-preservation. This is all varying levels of sentience. \u003Cem\u003EThere are literally millions of sentient species on planet Earth.\u003C/em\u003E Yet over and over again, you see science fiction authors calling intelligent aliens \u0022sentient aliens\u0022 and intelligent computers \u0022sentient computers\u0022. Where in the heck did this come from?! Don\u0027t they know their English? If I was an alien, I\u0027d be insulted to be compared to nothing but a mouse or a tapeworm \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe proper word for intelligence is \u003Cem\u003Esapience\u003C/em\u003E, which means the ability to reason- i.e., the possession of intelligence. Where the cutoff between sapience and non-sapience lies, however, is not as well defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people contend- sometimes with some arrogance, in my opinion- that humans are the only sapient species on Earth. This does make sense to some degree, because we are the most intelligent, we are the only ones to use \u0022high\u0022 technology, have a complex language, etc. However, if we define sapience this way, then there\u0027s no reason a more intelligent alien race (or, more likely, a machine intelligence we create ourselves) could come along and tell us that we are not sapient, and that only it and beings more intelligent than it are sapient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d prefer to define the minimum level of sapience to be based off of some measure of intelligence that requires sub-human sapience (such as self-awareness). This would help finally give intelligent non-humans the respect and protection they deserve (i.e., force Japan to stop the torture and murder of dolphins), and set up an important precedent whereby, if we ever encounter or create our intellectual superiors, the moral precedent exists for them to respect \u003Cem\u003Eour\u003C/em\u003E rights as sapient beings. Of course, that doesn\u0027t mean that they would, but it might help to have the moral high ground. Otherwise, if we had defined sapient beings as simply being the smartest things around, how could we rightfully object to being slaughtered or otherwise repressed? So I think it\u0027s important to set up a fuzzy boundary (pun intended \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) between human rights and animal rights.

Sentience is not something you either have or don\u0027t have- it\u0027s a spectrum. Every higher animal- say, vertebrates- will have a reasonably high level of sentience. Software on our computers can already be very minimally sentient. As I said before, a tapeworm or protozoa may have minimal levels of sentience (which certain software has probably already exceeded). This idea of a continuum of sentience has been around for decades, here\u0027s one variation on the idea- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience_quotient\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience_quotient\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be useful to define a certain cutoff limit between sentience and non-sentience, and this is commonly assumed though people may not realize it- because too broadly defined, even a rock could be considered to have some near infinitesimal amount of sentience. Basically, like sapience, there is a problem of where to draw the line between sentience and non-sentience.
