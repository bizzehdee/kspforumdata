I made the flag without problems, but implementing it is an issue. I know how to insert a flag into KSP, but I am having other problems. The flag needs to be in .png format, but that does not work for me. I made it with Firealpaca, the problem are the layers. It tells me that layers can\u0027t be used with .png format, but KSP does not accept it in the Firealpaca format. Can you tell me, how you work around this problem or how to solve it?

If so, then even if you can\u0027t export to .png directly you should be able to export as .jpg or .gif or something that you can pull into Paint and change to .png there. If you can\u0027t export, then I would take a screenshot of the flag in Firealpaca and edit the screenshot down to the proper size in Paint, then save as .png."},{"CreatedByName":"Old_Gaming_Geezer","CreatedById":74452,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T19:59:57Z","Content":"I\u0027m not familiar with the software you are using to create the flag, but if you collapse the layers into one layer, then save it as a .png file it should work fine, assuming of course your image file is the same resolution as the standard flag files."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T20:14:29Z","Content":"Most image manipulation programs these days will have an export function that will let you make an image in whatever file format you need it to be in. I myself use GIMP when I need to do something fancier than what I can do with MS Paint (I use Windows, obviously). \n\nPush comes to shove, you oughta be able to take a screenshot with whatever native OS you\u0027re utilizing; for Windows, it\u0027s Alt-PrtScn, for Mac it\u0027s Command-Shift-3. You can then crop the image to the correct size in the native Paint program (MS Paint or Paintbrush) as needed and save it as a .png from there. Saving in the PNG format almost always merges layers into one."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T02:52:05Z","Content":"Just a quick addition: when your graphics program says layers can\u0027t be used in png format, it *most likely* means to warn you that if you continue to save as a png, the layer information will be lost, should you ever want to edit it again. Since you do want to lose the layer information (as png doesn\u0027t support it) you should continue to save, ignoring that warning.\n\nYou may also, of course, want to save a copy in Firealpaca\u0027s native format, with the layers, in case you do ever want to edit it again."},{"CreatedByName":"ZentroCatson","CreatedById":143939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T05:42:50Z","Content":"Oh, I\u0027m actually using a Mac with OSX.
