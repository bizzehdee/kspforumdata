Of course in such a scenario all bets are off. Maybe the US would have dedicated the resources to rocketry that were now dedicated to designing and building the B-17, B-24, and B-29 (and starting work on the B-36).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe Germany would not have bothered with spending money on a young rocket enthousiast named Werner von Braun, not given him the funding and resources, the facilities and manpower, he used to develop his A2 amateur sounding rocket into the A3 mail rocket and A4 long range rocket (or V2 as the military designation ran), would not have got funding to start work on the A9/A10 intercontinental rocket (which could probably have put something small into orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T07:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jwenting\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jwenting\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne major point to consider is the background.

That would have left the Germans in complete control of Europe staring at the unsinkable aircraft carrier HMS Britain off their coast, and fighting Allied shipping in the North Atlantic (with probably a new front in Central Asia and the Middle East).

If they were able to strangle the convoys from America or even get the US and maybe Canada to back out of the war then they might have eventually squeezed Britain into submission.
