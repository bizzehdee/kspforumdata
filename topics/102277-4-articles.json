If I set SAS to one of these directions, I can warp just fine.\n\nAnother thing I\u0027ve noticed: actually, it limits non-physics timewarp to 10x (what sometimes still is too slow). If I CLICK on the second arrow (on the top left panel) most of the times it will work. BUT if you use the keyboard shortcut (\u0022.\u0022), it will go back to 1x when I get to 2x (what gives me the impression of 2x limiting).\n\nDid I make myself clear?

Seems to be in-order for me now except for one thing. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s vessel design (moments of inertia) or some planet-tracking or whatnot, but sometimes time warping can impart odd spins (totally different directions, even) onto the craft or stop the spin when coming out of time warp.
