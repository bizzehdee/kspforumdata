Unfortunately I don\u0027t know enough about coding to tell if a Unity thread is the same as CPU thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can show you the difference in FPS and dT per frame for my system, which is more than able to run KSP, with MJ and without it. And it\u0027s at a point when I get my SSTO(around 120 parts) next to a reactor station with around 200 parts in orbit. Not such a hard impact from parts themselves, but I think MJ goes crazy with calculations there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe performance boost in case some of the unused calculations get stopped when windows are closed(or even better - when the modules are blacklisted).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill haven\u0027t gotten around to blacklisting like I wanted before, but now that I think about it - it will not bring any performance improvement, and I don\u0027t feel any urges to automate my gameplay, so it\u0027s cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if someone knows or has made tries and errors for dependencies for blacklisting - maybe this could be added to the mod documentation.

Great heaping gobs of it. ;-) One of the ships\u0027 booster stage was a ReStock ThunderMax tank with two rings of 8 5-way blocks, plus two rings of four stock 4-way on the lander. The other one had a booster with four Rockomax 64 tanks (under a ReStock Bigger, Badder, Quad Coupler - a part also used to put four mainsails under the ThunderMax) that also had sixteen 5-way blocks. Both very agile ships with RCS, plus they had plenty of reaction wheel torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used both of those booster core stages with various asparagus arrangements around and different payloads for many flights. The four orange tank one is the main core of the ship still circling Duna and the same for the assembly waiting to go to Eve. The ThunderMax one with a single mainsail in the middle makes a very nice fuel tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to shut off RCS and finish the docking with just torque for turning while goosing the ship forward with engine thrust. (Four mainsails on each ship so very little throttle was needed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wobbling as they approached was all due to SASS and TGT\u002B. The magnetic port attraction would dampen the oscillation. Using TGT\u002B on both ships has always been a problem because as one ship pitches or yaws, the other tries to track it. That correction causes the first ship to try to track the one docking to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey just keep giving feedback to each other\u0027s targeting and it increases until they\u0027re swinging way off target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution has always been to get them aimed at each other about 100 meters apart, set kill rot on one (usually the larger one with a slower turn rate) then turn on docking autopilot, sit back and watch it do its thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it appeared to be doing with the docking ship was yawing and pitching to keep the port tracking on the other ship instead of translating straight sideways. I much preferred it when the docking autopilot relied on the human to get the right ports aimed at each other then just flew it in to dock with little correction needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T10:21:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Galane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Galane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERCS delta V?
