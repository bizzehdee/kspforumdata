If I may make a suggestion, every high tech node should be at least twice the cost of it predecessor, this should making adoption of highly advanced technology more chalanging The Engenering techtree allows a lot of freedom, but if you don\u0027t balance it with steep cost of the best technologies, the game, becomes highly unbalanced as it gives access to very powerful parts with much lower investment than the stock tech tree. This is especially true for any part that can make or break missions, which without a doubt the high Isp nuclear/electric engines. In real life it only very resent that we starting to use this engines, that should tell you something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-11T17:24:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2016 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"garwel","CreatedById":141813,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T20:40:03Z","Content":"[@Probus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102512-probus/) Any info on changes in today\u0027s version?

Open your persistent.sfs file in a text editor.\n\n3. Search for \u0022antennas1\u0022.
