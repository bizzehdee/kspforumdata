I am only suggesting this for the updates coming waaaaaay later. Im suggesting that there should be a mode for experienced KSP players where they can only fly on IVA or something. I know it can technically be played that way right now but I think some experienced player would like that idea where they can ONLY fly in IVA. I think there are still a lot missing to be able to get a full IVA experience (ex. External cameras, screens; i know there are mods, but im suggesting it stock). Just a suggestion. I wonder also if the devs are going to implement some kind of life support in stock in the future. Anyone knows?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-18T18:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe *may* see a nascent hardcore mode with 0.24 or in the update after it.
