It\u0027s fairly easy to do something like, a stayputnik \u002B antenna, and launch it for really cheap. Or to make 1 satellite to fulfil several contracts in one flight, by changing orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be better, if sometimes the contract gave you a prebuilt satellite, of varying mass, that you had to launch ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking things like, weather satellites, TV satellites, all sorts of other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd making custom satellite models could be a fun thing for the community to do - design-a-satellite competitions and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the occasional grey-suited Kerbals with sunglasses saying \u0022We need you to launch this, into this orbit.

Not only that - as a space agency I should receive a satellite then bring it to orbit needed and then pass control over it to the contractor. That\u0027s how it should be done and this also will eliminate the spamming sat contracts exploit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carmoldu","CreatedById":109336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T18:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also thought about this and I think it would be a great idea. This would prevent the 1-satellite launches completing multiple contracts problem as there would be a specific satellite for each orbit, as it has already been said. Also, this could lead to being able to actually fail a contract, as a limited number of satellites could be given to the player in order to carry out the contract and if all were lost due to failed launches, you would fail the contract (so there wouldn\u0027t only be contract failure due to exceeding the time limit).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flashcactus","CreatedById":103335,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T18:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice idea. I myself thought that the sat contracts would give me a subassembly that I have to launch. Turned out it\u0027s a lot simpler.

A chance to get your work incorporated into the game, and all that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there could be all sorts of amusing things. Like, a Soft Drinks company wants you to launch a satellite that\u0027s shaped like a replica of one of their bottles. Or a TV sports company wants one that looks like a sportball. And so on. As well as stuff like telescopes, university science projects, weather satellites and so on. As well as the occasional 40ton colossal spy satellite from the Kerbal Secret Service. What\u0027s in that satellite?
