This is likely to be an out of memory crash as the game can only use a max of about 3.4 gig before it will crash and there are a number of memory leaks and inefficient uses of memory that mean that this will happen eventually with how long depending on amount of mods and game settings. There are lots of threads that discuss ways of reducing the amount of memory used."},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:43:13Z","Content":"Ok, that\u0027s what I was expecting.
