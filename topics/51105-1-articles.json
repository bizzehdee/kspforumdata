The fact that I was using the dev build of Ioncross without playtesting the new version much means that all of mission 2 and 3 crumbled, which had a good chunk of the parts for a base going in. Without having the scrubbers on the command pod/hab modules stay active when the ship isnt focused, a lot of my crew perished during a simultaneous launch scenario. I even thought of hyper-editing them back in, but they wouldnt survive planetside without constant attention.

Today I present to you my current in-progress mission report on my attempt to Terraform and colonize Duna!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackstory: KeithStone Kerman, head of the Keithstone Kethane Mining Corp, has had a moderate level of success mining Kethane on the Mun and establishing his credentials working for the Kerbal Space Center as a mining and geology engineer. Looking to further his fame, he has teamed up with the famous (and more environmentally conscious) Nikoly Kesla Kerman, who has started making a big name for himself in the realms of engineering and inventing many forms of power generation and propulsion only thought to be science-fiction fantasies just years before. Now the two of them have set their eyes on Duna, hoping to not only colonize it, but to establish a full-fledged terraforming operation in hopes of giving kerbals everywhere a second home, close to home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy I\u0027m doing it?: I\u0027ve attempted several runs at Duna, both on and off the forums, but I\u0027ve usually put harsh restrictions on myself to try to make things a little more realistic and/or challenging. This time, I\u0027m doing things mostly for the narrative and the aesthetic, foregoing realism. I\u0027m not afraid to quicksave, use MechJeb, or have fun with mods, or use completely unrealistic pseudo-science (and in some cases flat out BS) as I play this one out. After all, it IS KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods Used (in whole or part):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiofuels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuantum Struts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditor Extensions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIoncross Crew Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIon Hybrid Engine pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToroidal/Spherical fuel tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovaPunch 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELack Luster Labs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProceedural Wings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelect Root\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUDK\u0027s large station stockalike parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Interstellar pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZ_Thing Sciency Dome Part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexture reduction packs for B9, NovaPunch, and Aies (iirc)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-03T17:13:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2013 05:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KeithStone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KeithStone","CreatedById":71277,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T22:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPre-Mission Notes and progress\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00A6\u00C2 Use of the \u0022unrealistic\u0022 power-to-size drives from the Hybrid Ion Pack will only be used when an excess of additional parts (Tesla Coils, antennae etc) are used to make the device or ship appear to be capable of such power generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00A6\u00C2 Pre-mission operations include the launching of the Calladrius Mk4 Space Station to establish the reults of long-term experiements on a large number of space-born kerbals as well as experiment with the new bio-fuels concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00A6\u00C2 An additional pre-mission flight to bring up the AC-Pidgeon, Nikoly\u0027s personal interplanetary flagship, and dock it with the Calladrius for future use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission 1-Establish initial polar ionization bases in an attempt to strengthen Duna\u0027s Ionosphere and make it capable of sustaining an atmosphere safe from solar radiation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00A6\u00C2 With the oversight of Nikoly, two gigantic \u0022Kesla Coils\u0022 were constructed with the idea that an \u0022ionization network\u0022 could be established, making Duna safer from the threat of having any attempts at strengthening its atmosphere from being \u0022blown away in the (solar) wind\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00A6\u00C2 Keithstone Kerman oversaw the construction of a satellite network to aid in this process. Three monitoring satellites were constructed (without any testing of their capabilities) and ended up being horribly off-balanced. Luckily, Nikoly foresaw issues with the satellite network and ensured that the ITV was loaded with extra delta-v, and drained the fuel tanks of the satellites so that the main vehicle could help establish their new orbits once the Kesla Coils were deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00A6\u00C2 A Single \u0022Tuning Rod\u0022 (diffusing rod?) was constructed to help give readouts on pockets of ionization and to help keep the ebb and flow of the new ionosphere in check. Keithstone decided that since it would be in a low polar orbit, it would be a great place to slap on a few kethane detectors!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00A6\u00C2 The mission was deemed a moderate success. Putting the 180\u002B ton beast in to orbit was a challenge, but once there the vessel was releatively easy to control. However, once in Duna orbit several key issues became apparent. Namely, that there was a giant mountain on the north pole and a huge crevace on the south pole. This made landing the two coils perfectly a challenge, and it was opted that they be landed NEAR the poles in hopes that they still worked in a slightly off configuration. All three satellites were deployed in to their orbits, and the tuning rod\u0027s lower polar orbit was established. Kethane scanning revealed several decent pockets for further use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPost Mission launches\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00A6\u00C2 Additional oxygen was brought up to the Calladrius. Unfortunately it seems that there is a slight issue keeping the scrubbers online, since they appear to have been wired to the light switches and toilets, causing interesting results. Ground control is investigating this issue and a possible resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/tl9bh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
