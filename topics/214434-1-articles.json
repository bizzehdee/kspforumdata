We could have everything be entirely procedural but it would likely impact part variety; that\u0027s why I think a mixed approach is best. Having a selection of part diameters, with variants\u00A0(Tanks, trusses, tubes, fairings and bays) and then perhaps only being able to just certain values (length) (maybe profile shape) for given set of parts would limit the scope of procedural parts and retain modularity we like.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen people suggest to add procedural landing gear but without fully describing what that entails. Personally I think adjustable landing gear (if you used the mod) are great but they don\u0027t need to be fully procedural, adjusting a few values is great (leg length, angle, etc) but they don\u0027t need scaling or to be fully customisable, just enough for quality of life.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame goes for other parts like Pod or Engines maybe a few part variants make sense, perhaps different crew configurations (number of seat/cargo storage) or rocket motors with nozzles type selection (number of nozzles)\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003Ebut I don\u0027t need to rescale them, don\u0027t change the entire model. Basically be very selective over what to apply procedural settings to and even then, not all adjustable parts need to be fully procedural.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aNERVASman","CreatedById":211629,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T08:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nprocedural parts would work if they did it the same way as with engine plates\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
