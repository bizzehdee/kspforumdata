Thus my late feedback about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing I must say is, I like the contract system, and I like it a lot. Honestly, I like it better than the whole science system and the main reason is, the contract tells me where to go and what to do, unlike Science where I need to figure out what is missing in a long list of what I already have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince certain stage I am playing completely without making science measurements and contracts still provide me enough science points that I already almost uncovered the whole tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contract system \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E have the problem I was afraid will be there, though. If you build a fleet of reusable ships which return all their parts to KSP, you\u0027re rich. If you build classical rockets where you lose majority of parts during the mission, you lose a lot of money. I don\u0027t like that approach. Or rather, I am missing the freedom of choice to run my space program either way because in real world, reusable technology is not that much (if at all) cheaper than \u0027classical\u0027 rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few more thoughts about contracts available at the moment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I don\u0027t see the reason to distinguish between suborbital, orbital, or escape trajectories for tests. I don\u0027t think there is any real-world difference between them, you\u0027re in vacuum, microgravity, and . In my opinion, just specifying the body, the situation (landed/splashed/flying), altitude and speed range should suffice. Eventually specifying whether the speed is surface- or orbit-related.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Some tests (particularly engine tests) can be \u0027cheated\u0027 and still count. You just tweak the engine fuel to zero (if it is SRB) and its thrust to zero and you\u0027re safe to run the test without it having any ill effects on your ship. Convenient but not very realistic, real-world scientists would be probably rather angry if you tried that on them. In my opinion the game should be slightly more strict in this regard and e.g. require the engine will run at least one second at full thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It would be really nice if there were contracts (e.g. from R\u0026amp;D Department) to perform science measurements which are still missing in science archives. Not just \u0027send us some science from Mun\u0027 but specifically - perform temperature measurement when landed in Mun Midlands, for example. If nothing else it would cut on the bother of figuring out what am I missing. Plus the test case could tell me via its green checkmark whether I am sitting in Midlands or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T23:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas always you make great points, and I agree with all. your last point about the midlands though, you really should have something on the hud to indicate the current biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think contracts as the only source of funds isnt good. I know we will be able to trade science for funds(probably with the admin building they are working on), but I would like the option to take out a loan for a probe mission to eeloo or whatever you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackAdder128","CreatedById":111431,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T15:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that real-world less-reusable rockets should be viable, specially considering the real-world difficulty in properly qualifiyng parts that have participated in re-entry for safety, although I don\u0027t want to comment too much on the topic, as I haven\u0027t spent enough time with contracts to find out if non-reusable rockets are viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There are a few reasons I haven\u0027t spent much time with contracts yet: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. My 9-yr old has discovered Kerbal space program and spends a fair amount of time flying planes and blowing stuff up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I have recently discovered the X3 games (what they lack in realism they make up for in immersion)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Contracts don\u0027t feel that compelling compared to my pre-exisitng hopes and expectations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFocusing on item #3, as I\u0027ve posted once elsewhere, I would really like the option to focus more on putting up space infrastructure than testing parts or performing one-time \u0022government-funded\u0022 mission types. Putting up specialized satellites and space stations or maintaining them for science and profit sounds marvelous, especially as enabling steps for that big Duna base down the road. Crafting a frankenstein rocket to make profitable the testing of half a dozen parts for pocket change to get to the next \u0022government-funded exploration mission\u0022 is just not as motivating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve been made aware there are some mods that meet my expectations a little better than the stock game, and I\u0027ll go down that road one of these days, but I personally would really like to see space infrastructure as an optional cash focus in the stock game at some point. I thnk that would make a much stronger career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
