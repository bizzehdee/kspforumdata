You say you want to get the whole community in on the project. Thats cool, if you actually read what I wrote then you\u0027d know that\u00A0 I\u0027m not discouraging it at all, however until you actually get people familiar with Kopernicus then you are opening yourself to all hosts of issues from general PQS issues plaguing the resulting pack, or persistant bugs in the cfgs that are easily avoidable. Also I still have no clue why you are so insistant on comparing this to CRP, as they are nothing alike.

Its just a community library to ensure mods play well together. If you are trying to make a CRP for planet packs, then what are you suggesting? Designated/restricted orbital bands? user specific planetary designations?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you are suggesting has nothing to do with CRP so i wish that you\u0027d stop referring to it.

You say you want to get the whole community in on the project. Thats cool, if you actually read what I wrote then you\u0027d know that\u00A0 I\u0027m not discouraging it at all, however until you actually get people familiar with Kopernicus then you are opening yourself to all hosts of issues from general PQS issues plaguing the resulting pack, or persistant bugs in the cfgs that are easily avoidable. Also I still have no clue why you are so insistant on comparing this to CRP, as they are nothing alike. Like i said, CRP is a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELIBRARY\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E mod. It doesnt actually add \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EANYTHING\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.
