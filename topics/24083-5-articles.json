You know, like aerodynamics on stable flight, as separate from T/W, or Delta-V. The delta-v demonstrator could be a VTOL rocket, for example, while the ones used to explain aerodynamics a couple with different classical configurations (Delta\u002BCanard vs a classic T-tail, for example). Thus one section could be called \u0022On the art of getting a stable plane\u0022, while another \u0022T/W: How much is enough?\u0022. Those are the ideas I\u0027ve been toying around with, but I really want to have a consistent structure before I begin so it is really simple. So far the chapters I\u0027ve come up with would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntro: delta-v to orbit vs orbital speed. Title, anyone? \u0022SSTO: what does that even mean?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying, CoM, CoT, CoL: This is where the aerodynamics stuff goes, and I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m going with \u0022Earning wings: On the art of getting a stable plane\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking off: and landing, what it takes to start and end the flight in the first place. Not trivial. Let\u0027s call that one \u0022There and back again: How to stay in one piece while visiting air.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET/W, isp and powerplant issues in general: ascent profiles, gravity losses, impact on mass ratios and delta-v and all that jazz. This is the part where you learn how to make a T/W 0.5 plane fly, and why that could be a good idea. The title could be \u0022Taming fire: How much oomph is enough?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirhogging/cutoff speed: This could be called \u0022Speed demons: Getting the most out atmosphere\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-space: docking, payloads, stuff that alters your in-space delta-v and advanced techniques and tricks in general.
