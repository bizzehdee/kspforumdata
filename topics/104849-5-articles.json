All they do throughout the interview is gush about the book. But Weir talks and admit happily about all the stuff that he got wrong. I think the trailer is getting alot from the book right. Its hollywood everything has to look cool or else people might not be interested int it. I love the suits I hate the helmets. Remember these have to be suits that he has to take on and off alone. Real spacesuits are impossible to take on and off alone. So the suits in the book take a giant leap forward in spacesuit technology. Again from the trailer you can clearly hear the abrupt cutouts and sound editing to make it all sound more compelling in a three minute trailer. There is no way they throw away the plot of the crew not knowing. Its too good a plot. So that bunch of pictures is probably Watneys FIRST transmission to NASA. Listen to it again its an abrupt cutout. Its \u0022Houston be advised\u0022 in one tone and then \u0022we are receiving a video message\u0022 in another tone. From the sound of it, its two differnt people actually. Jessica Chastain first and then Kate Mara. Then it flashes to the pictures. How do you know thats not some NASA engineer piecing the pictures together. To be critical of that part of the trailer really annoys me because it is clearly a nonlinear chain of event edited together to create a cool moment in the trailer. The hermes is gorgeous. Also to be annoyed at a transmission is ridiculous! It is nit picky and pedantic beyond anything that is acceptable. I am disappointed it doesn\u0027t look more realistic but lets pretend for the movies sake that NASA all of a sudden has an unlimited budget.
