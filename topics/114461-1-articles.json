So I thought why not combine these two and add lava fields on Moho: A fluid that is super hot. Perhaps in a way that with enough ablator and cooling one could stay long enough for a splashdown experiment."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T22:58:19Z","Content":"There was something like that in 1.0.0, but it was a bug. You only have to add an ocean tinted with red and reproduce that bug. Really Squad, I want more after Unity 5.1.\n\nBut lets think about how does affect the distance from the sun. If your spacecraft explodes at a similar orbit to Moho, the planet has to have lava."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:17:38Z","Content":"Since thermodynamics are a thing now (a better thing at least), and Moho goes through \u0022Cycles\u0022 (thats how the atmosphere got removed wiki says), it would be awesome to have lava and a burning hot atmosphere (at least uncomfortably warm)."}]}
