Its main scientific mission was over, but perhaps its most famous piece of data was still to come. It was in a unique position to take a picture of the entire solar system from essentially an outsider\u2019s perspective, showing our tiny place in this universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PIA00451.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002230.00\u0022 height=\u0022307\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA00451.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese images (a \u201Cfamily portrait\u201D of the Solar System) capture 7 of the Solar System\u2019s 8 planets (Mars was kinda in a bad position in its orbit, if they used a different filter they might have gotten it even at that point though) as no more than tiny dots against a grainy backdrop. None of them may look particularly special from this viewpoint, but those dots are the planets we are all familiar with- these dots are all entire worlds. Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and, of course, Earth. As Carl Sagan put it, \u201Clook again at that dot. That\u0027s here. That\u0027s home. That\u0027s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut we know there are more dots out there. Wouldn\u2019t it just be awesome, in the original sense of the word, to see those as well? Not just eight, but thousands of worlds, all tiny, distant dots (until we can do better). Accomplishing such images, even for relatively \u201Cnearby\u201D systems, will not be easy. There is so much we need to solve first. But I think, and I hope you will agree, that this is definitely a goal worth pursuing. How, exactly, is the subject of this thread. What technologies might come in handy to do this, and what problems do we need to solve first? And how might we incrementally go from tiny dots to entire worlds?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, quick disclaimer, I realize this may be the greatest necropost of all time. The last post on this thread was 10 months ago. But I saw something on this that got me really excited, so I decided to revisit the idea, make a new \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, and loosen the definition of what counts as direct imaging here. Instead of looking for ways to build a telescope capable of seeing surface details of a planet (too outrageous, but still on-topic if anyone has anything to add to that one), this thread can discuss ways of just getting images of planets as dots. It still has to be able to do this for pretty much any nearby planet, though- we have seen direct pictures of really huge, hot, and distant-orbiting planets. There aren\u2019t many of those, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch a system would completely revolutionize exoplanet astronomy. Current indirect methods of detection are very, very limited. Transits, for example, only catch transiting planets, and if the star is particularly bright then only the larger ones. There are almost certainly thousands of potential exoplanets just around nearby stars that we haven\u2019t found yet. And with direct observations of the planets themselves, we could learn so much about them- their composition, possible moons, their exact sizes and orbits, answering so much about what kind of a solar system an average star would be expected to have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, of course\u2026 there\u2019s always that slight possibility\u2026 one day, through such a telescope, out of hundreds of similar specks of light, we may find another pale blue one. And maybe it will also be a home to someone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what problems would such a telescope face? Well, obviously, one of the big problems here is distance. The nearest star system to our own is over 4 light years away. An Earth-size exoplanet around Proxima Centauri (Prox b?) would have an apparent diameter of around ~0.00003 arcseconds. I don\u2019t really have a good comparison for that but you can tell by the number of zeroes after the decimal point that that\u2019s, like, reeeeeaaaally small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDistance isn\u2019t the only problem, though, we also have to deal with other pesky sources of light. Planets are incredibly dim compared to their parent star (citation: I looked down and was not blinded), so we need a way of blocking the star\u2019s light so it doesn\u2019t overpower the image. That\u2019s not all they have to stand out against, though- since they\u2019re so dim, they almost blend in with random static background noise-you also have to separate them from that. Take another look at that family portrait picture- it was taken much, \u003Ci\u003Emuch\u003C/i\u003E closer to the planets shown in it then any possible target here, and yet it is clearly starting to suffer from some of these problems. There\u2019s a lot of static, and Earth isn\u2019t just \u201Ca mote of dust,\u201D it\u2019s \u201Ca mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\u201D Get too far out and you might just get the sunbeam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo block the parent star\u2019s light, the use of a Starshade has been proposed, and it\u2019s probably the closest and most well-known approach to solving this problem. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Worlds_Mission\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Worlds_Mission\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, for these kinds of observations, for some planets, the telescope doesn\u2019t have to be stupidly bg. A starshade on the James Webb Space Telescope could probably make out a bunch of planets. But unfortunately JWST is not launching with a starshade (at least they tried) and certainly not on schedule. An if we ever wanted better detail- views of exomoons, even discs or even \u003Cem\u003Esurfaces\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of planets- we\u2019d have to go bigger. But how? Here\u2019s a couple ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s an interesting concept that doesn\u2019t get much attention:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223483835\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179621\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221541728370\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00225984\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LaydeeDem\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/8/2018 at 8:52 PM, LaydeeDem said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirect imaging of an exoplanet\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Esurface\u003C/em\u003E is no small feat. It\u0027s comparable to observing the Apollo LEM on the Moon from the surface of the Earth. To do it at all requires a massive aperture. To do it and get a reasonable amount of detail requires an even bigger one. However there is a way to do it, and cheaply too! No need for massive mirrors or flying out to 550 AU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-cash.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00222014-cash.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022542\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-cash.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m actually surprised Aragoscopes haven\u0027t been mentioned yet. Rather than use a mirror as a collecting surface, instead an opaque disk or ring would be deployed in front of the spacecraft. It seems a little counter-intuitive, but since light\u0027s wave-like nature causes it to diffract, the brightest part of the shadow is actually in the middle. Place a detector \u002B relevant optics at this spot (the Arago spot), and you\u0027ve essentially created a\u00A0 telescope for very cheap. It scales too! \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/content/the-aragoscope-ultra-high-resolution-optics-at-low-cost\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAccording to this study\u003C/a\u003E, Aragoscopes from 100m to 1,000m were shown to be feasible, with a 100m Aragoscope being possible with what\u0027s usually budgeted for flagship class missions (Though we all know from JWST that those estimates tend to be a little low).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the science it would allow would open up a whole new world of astronomy. A 1km Aragoscope \u002B accompanying Starshade observing in visible light would be able to resolve Jupiter\u0027s disk and the Galilean moons from 7 parsecs away. Resolution gets better as you move towards the UV/X-ray end of the spectrum too, so such telescopes could potentially be used to directly image the event horizons of black holes such as Sagittarius A* and the BH in M87. The big issues with this design would be the need for very high-accuracy pointing due to the long focal length and the low contrast created by the obstructing disk. However I think these issues are likely to be solved within the next few decades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil then we can watch Cody\u0027sLab at least. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5RacK2VwqEk?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other idea is that thing I found that got me really excited that I mentioned earlier.

We still have plenty of data from Kepler (RIP, Kepler- you will be missed). There are thousands of known exoplanets, and dozens of them are potentially habitable. These have shown a great diversity of planets- all of these worlds seem to differ from each other just as much as\u00A0 the planets in our own solar system, in a variety of different ways. Unfortunately, however, we do not know what these worlds look like (for the most part). We don\u0027t even know what they look like in terms of how we knew Pluto looked like before New Horizons. In\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emost\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0cases, we cannot detect moons,\u00A0 we cannot detect atmospheres, and we cannot detect mass and composition.\u00A0In addition, we are\u00A0currently unable to detect the vast majority of exoplanets- most methods can only detect exoplanets with a high mass, and transiting only shows exoplanets that pass in front of their star in our perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eultimate\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0dream for exoplanet research would be some kind of telescope able to actually make out gas giant AND terrestrial-sized exoplanets that are relatively close to us, say, within 10 light-years. Not only would this give us a whole lot of new information on known exoplanets, but it could be a very effective way to discover new ones. These images would not\u00A0necessarily be detailed enough to see surface features- just detailed enough to see major moons, atmospheres, and computer models of surface features, like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/pluto-20100204.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethat one of Pluto using Hubble data\u003C/a\u003E.

Which might come first: Project Starshot or fancy telescopes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, there\u0027s a lot of complicated optical challenges I don\u0027t understand well enough that causes problems here- most notably, planets are dim, stars are bright. But it would certainly be worth the effort to overcome these challenges- wouldn\u0027t it just be amazing to see a whole solar system from this perspective (the Voyager family portrait comes to mind), and would it be even more amazing if one of these dots- just one- was some familiar, pale shade of blue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a less philosophical note, check out these guys:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.planets.life/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.planets.life/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u0026lt;- This is what I\u0027m talking about right here.

Because the atmosphere is made of \u0022cells\u0022 of different temperatures moving about, you get changes in the refractive index of the air; different refractive indices means refraction: light gets deviated and you end up with a blurred signal. There are two big ways to get around this, first adaptive optics which means that your mirror can detect when an incoming ray of light is deviated and deforms itself slightly to correct the deviation, a lot of telescopes already use\u00A0this, but there\u0027s still room for improvement. The other way is to get rid of the atmosphere between you and your target, you do this by sticking your telescope into space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn some cases (to observe IR and beyond-UV\u00A0parts of the spectrum) you \u003Cem\u003Ehave \u003C/em\u003Eto go to space because the atmosphere absorbs these wavelengths entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final limit is the one imposed by physics: diffraction. Light is a wave (and a particle, but it doesn\u0027t matter here), stick it through a thin aperture and you will observe some diffraction. Stick it through a big aperture and there will still be diffraction, you\u0027ll just won\u0027t be able to see it with the naked eye. Diffraction creates a hard limit on maximal resolution your telescope can get. The Rayleigh criterion gives a definition of the diffraction limit: you want the first maximum of one diffraction pattern to be further than the first minimum of the other diffraction pattern, then you can resolve the two and all is well.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn maths this looks like: \u03B8\u00A0 = 1.22*\u03BB/D,\u00A0\u03B8 is the maximal angular resolution,\u00A0\u03BB the wavelength of the incoming light and D the diameter (aperture) of your telescope. For Proxima Centauri b, sitting 4.2 ly away from us and having a radius about equal to that of the Earth, you\u0027d need a 2 km wide telescope to resolve it: that is for it to be larger than one pixel on your screen. PCb is a relatively bright object in the sky (m=11 according to Wikipedia) so collecting a good signal shouldn\u0027t be too much of a problem, this means an array of a few smaller telescopes which will have a diameter of over 2 km would do the trick. You\u0027ll need to put these into space though, since telescopes on Earth still aren\u0027t close to the diffraction limit because of atmospheric effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the main question: none of the telescopes you mentioned, and AFAIK no planned telescope project, would be able to produce any picture of PCb.

The forty meter E-ELT telescope for example is about the max we can do right now and there had and has to be a lot of research work for all the components. Afaik the E-ELT isn\u0027t assumed to have its full resolution power right from the start, some more tech is in development.

Which is achieved by three things: aperture, aperture and aperture. This is either a single big platter, or several small dishes apart from each other. A big single one has much more area to collect photons than several small ones so does not need as much observation time. Several small ones are called an interferometer, which is what people are intensely working on right now. It has its own problems, like positioning accuracy, data management and processing, etc. First results in exoplanet interferometry are very nice, see the VLT for example. And hopefully soon the EHT and TMT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing, many small sats probably won\u0027t help as much, you need a certain diameter to be able to distinguish clearly between noise from electronics or the background from the real signal you want. Not speaking of positioning and herding them all. The smaller they are, the closer false and real signals are together. If you prolong the exposure time instead because of too small an aperture, you also get many false signals. So, bigger is better. Which brings us back to aperture.

Building such a telescope, as I mentioned before, is going to take years, and because of that it could slow down our advancement in the understanding of these types of planets. A space-based starshade telescope may be a better alternative; you don\u2019t have to worry about the annoying distortions from Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and it could be both smaller and cheaper than a 100 meter scope. This is due to the starshade itself, as it can almost entirely block out the light of a target star and allow for a smaller mirror to be used. The reason for the large mirrors is to capture as much light as it can from the target planet, which isn\u2019t much because of the overwhelming brightness of the star. When the light of said star is almost entirely gone, you don\u2019t need a giant mirror to pick out something that has not become easy to spot.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne problem though: that starshade needs to be miles in front of the telescope and somehow stay perfectly aligned. I wonder how that would impact the price tag of such a mission. Also, I know that a previous starshade space telescope was cancelled before the TESS project started due to it eating up money JWST style, but that doesn\u2019t mean another similar mission won\u2019t be able to find some ground in the next decade.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-09T01:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirect imaging of an exoplanet\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Esurface\u003C/em\u003E is no small feat.
