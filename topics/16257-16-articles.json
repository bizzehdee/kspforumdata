RemoteTech is now partially MechJeb compatible, so those of you who want to RP a proper flight computer now have the option of doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also done some more work in controlling crewable but empty vessels. With permission from the guys at squad, I\u0027ve now made it possible to mix and match as many pods and cockpits as you want on a single vessel and even have a crewable vessel be completely without crew from the get go. So unmanned rescue missions are finally a reality \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EChangelog:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EFixed compatability with joystick throttle.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBought a joystick to test it this time.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EAdded compatability with MechJeb.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EHere by popular demand, now MechJeb will be able to activate local control.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EAdded in-game stats drawn from the part config file.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ein the same way you\u0027d normally check stats like specific impulse, crew capacity and so forth, you can now check each parts RemoteTech Stats.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EAdded support for crewable CommandPods that don\u0027t spawn crew when the flight starts.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith permission from the guys at Squad, I\u0027ve included two sets of modded stock pods; one thats available together with the stock pods but doesn\u0027t spawn crew, and one thats available with the normal parts.\u003Cbr\u003EAll modded pods carry some RemoteTech gear with them.
