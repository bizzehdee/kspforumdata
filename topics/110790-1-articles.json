I\u0027m hoping some of you are familiar with this bug and can either point me to a support thread, or perhaps we can gather up the information needed to find out what is happening. The situation is like this; I fly a lot of planes. Recently it seems like that\u0027s what I spend most of my time doing. This means that I also tend to land my planes on some pretty unforgiving terrain, and since at least 1.0.2 I\u0027ve discovered some sort of \u0027phantom acceleration\u0027 that causes me to go from slowing down, or a near stop, to suddenly having about 32m/s of speed and violently pitching upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few theories but I noticed something on my most recent landing, pressing B actually caused me to speed up. So I quickly released it and pressed it again, and I resumed slowing down. I think I\u0027ve pretty much narrowed it down to, if not the brakes, perhaps it is the Fixed Landing Gear. I thought at first maybe it\u0027s causing some sort of \u0027spring\u0027 force that propels me upwards, but it may only be happening while the brakes are applied. Has anyone else experienced this type of behavior? It isn\u0027t all that rare for me, it happens on pretty much any landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T15:29:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. Happened to me a few weeks back. All stock at the time. Using those fixed landing gear. When trying to land on rough terrain upon hitting the brakes my craft accelerated significantly. I noticed it only happened on the edge of a hill. If I waited and rolled over the hill the brakes then worked. But if I hit the brakes as I crested the hill it was like a catapult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T15:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought it might be a slope issue, but it seems to happen going both up and downwards. Going down the issue seems slightly complicated by your brakes no working and KSP\u0027s lack of friction causing you to accelerate wildly out of control. Of course, trying to land on a downhill slope is somewhat of a misnomer anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let me ask this, have you had this happen with any of the other landing gears?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T15:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t say. I\u0027d have to test it out. Maybe get some reproducible procedures and try them again with the other, retractable legs.

It\u0027s extremely frustrating though it seems to be somewhat better now. I can say from experience it still exists though. There are other things that could be at play there as well, having your engine above your CoM will cause it to pitch forwards, which can cause undesirable effects during braking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying out some other landing gear and they seem to work just nicely, I\u0027ll have to do more tests to be sure but it does seem to only be the Fixed landing gear, at least as far as causing this particular issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t noticed an acceleration, but I have noticed brakes taking a bizarrely long time to slow some of my planes.
