It\u2019s not the game\u0027s fault, it\u0027s just that I\u2019ve done all these missions before, both in KSP and in KSP 2. Right now that\u2019s not a big deal, the game is unfinished and the exciting new features aren\u2019t in yet. However I worry that once Base Building and Exoplanetary construction are in, they\u2019ll be blocked behind multiple levels of science before they can be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most important and exciting part of Base Building and Exoplanetary construction to me is being able to remove the tedium of repeated tasks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow many times do I need to get into orbit? How many times do I need to land on the Mun. If I can build bases and orbital construction yards\u2026 Just once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve launched a lot of things into orbit at this point, and while it\u2019s fun at first, there\u2019s only so many times I can do it before it starts feeling really tedious. Based on my understanding of the current plan, building an orbital shipyard solves that. I can make a few launches to get the shipyard built, and prove I can supply it by making a supply run. Then I can do all future launches from the shipyard and avoid having to do any more tedious launches from Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m hoping for when base building is released, and it sounds like the plan. I\u2019m just worried that that kind of base building and orbital construction and automated replies will end up locked behind Tier 3\u002B science unlocks, which to me would defeat the purpose.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially as a veteran player who\u2019s done all this before in KSP 1, I don\u2019t know that I could stay interested long enough to unlock Tier 3 or higher science before the tedium got to me and I moved on to something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my recommendation would be to make sure the tech to support base building, exoplanetary construction, and automatic resupplies is available at least in some capacity as early as Tier 2 science at the latest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLimiting the size of early tier construction yards could be used to make sure there were still more unlocks to be able to build _anything_ in space, but I want to be able to build _something_ in space pretty quickly once those new features come online.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-23T19:09:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2023 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 23\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by CiberX15\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-23T18:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy the black font.

Having to build that same factory or make that same trip more than 3 times stops being fun quickly. At least for me. Factorio solves this problem with templates and drones that can build the templates, so after a certain point, once you\u0027ve built an optimal factory layout, you never have to build it again, you just stamp down a template where you want it and the drones build it for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to me the OABs would serve that same role. I have to get an OAB to a given orbit, then get an automated delivery set up to it, but once that work is done I don\u0027t have to make that flight again. I use that base as the beachhead to launch the next mission to even further reaches of the system. Building each OAB in a new orbit would be like designing the optimal factory, and once in place it would act like the template, never requiring me to do that same task again because I put in the work to solve it with automation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur argument is really over _where_ in the game loop that tech unlocks though. Even in factorio the ability to build and deploy templates is kind of mid game content. However, in Factorio, the templates unlock right about the same time the factories you need to build start getting tedious to build. How much time does it take to place 3 buildings vs 30 etc. To me the basic launch to orbit in KSP starts out already taking a lot of time, and there doesn\u0027t seem to be a great way to speed that up that isn\u0027t unrealistic or un fun (You can use bigger engines and go faster but that\u0027s inefficient and also risks burning up your craft if you get going fast enough, so the mechanics basically reward you for going slower not faster), so to compensate I\u0027m recommending moving the automation closer to the beginning of the game to compensate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-24T19:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224351695\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022221883\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221703443707\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268461\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CiberX15\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, CiberX15 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me the basic launch to orbit in KSP starts out already taking a lot of time, and there doesn\u0027t seem to be a great way to speed that up that isn\u0027t unrealistic or un fun (You can use bigger engines and go faster but that\u0027s inefficient and also risks burning up your craft if you get going fast enough, so the mechanics basically reward you for going slower not faster\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the developers expect you to find it fun, which IMO is a completely fair expectation from a player who plays a game like this.
