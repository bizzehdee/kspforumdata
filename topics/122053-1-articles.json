I\u0027ve managed to get it into a 75x75km orbit with enough L/Ox to deorbit again to about 35km periapsis. Payload is currently only one passenger and about 400 units of Liquid Fuel. Powerplant is two Whiplashes and a Swivel (career limitations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m struggling to de-orbit it successfully.

Put the SAS to Prograde and do big S turns to slow my speed. If my vertical speed is too low (-200 m/s), I keep the nose up. Usually this way, you\u0027re safely under 1600 m/s at 30 km. At that point, just keep the plane straight with SAS assist and you can land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T21:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t RCS really draggy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T21:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use RCS thrusters on spaceplanes anymore; they cause too much drag and often burn off during ascent or descent. You\u0027ve got tons of torque anyways, given both the cockpit and the module on the tail. Definitely pump all your fuel forwards to ensure that your CoM is in front of your CoL. Keep the nose up as much as you can throughout your descent; this will generate a lot of drag and some lift, which will help slow you down more in the upper atmosphere. Nosing up will make your descent take longer, though, because all that lift is keeping you in thinner air for longer. This makes the descent much safer, but also means that you can easily overshoot KSC if you haven\u0027t prepared accordingly. Since you are using FAR, there\u0027s also a greater danger of your wings ripping off, so as you approach 30km, reduce your AoA to maybe 10 degrees or so; as you have found out, the air suddenly gets really thick and nasty at about 25km, which can easily result in unwanted explosions. Before then, angle as close to radial\u002B as possible (atmospheric forces will pull your nose down gradually) to maximize drag and slow your descent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T21:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t want to keep your periapse up.

As the atmosphere thins, those air/tailfin collisions become less frequent, and the tailfin loses power. Speed generally works in the reverse of this (i.e. more speed = more air collisions = more stable), but this is complicated by the weird things that happen to airflow as you go supersonic. Direction of travel also matters; during early reentry, you\u0027re often dropping fast enough that your tailfin is in the \u0022shadow\u0022 of the fuselage from an airflow perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for flaps/spoilers/airbrakes: first, this is complicated by the difference in terminology between FAR and the real world. In normal use, a flap is a trailing-edge surface that deflects downwards, while a spoiler is a trailing-edge surface that deflects upwards. In FAR, however, a flap is a surface that moves in three steps (default direction downwards, but can be reversed) while a spoiler is a surface that fully deflects in a single step (default direction upwards, but again can be reversed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the real world definitions for now: flaps add lift, but also increase drag. Spoilers reduce lift and increase drag. The purpose of flaps is to give you a bit more lift while flying slowly (i.e. take off and landing). The purpose of spoilers is to allow you to ditch some altitude without pitching the nose down (very useful during landing). With either of these, they work best when placed close to the CoM. Flaps or spoilers too far from CoM will introduce unwanted pitch when deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary purpose of airbrakes is to increase drag (they can also be used as control surfaces, but that\u0027s getting a bit advanced for this context). Stick a pair of \u0027em behind CoM, open them as you hit the atmosphere and reentry will become trivially easy. They\u0027re rarely necessary, but often convenient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-01T08:39:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2015 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T08:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys, all very useful!
