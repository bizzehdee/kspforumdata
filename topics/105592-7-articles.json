That is because all of the mods that are being claimed to be incompatible with win64 for actual code reasons (FAR, PP, RealFuels, RealChutes, etc.) have worked perfectly fine in previous official versions of KSP when the win64-lock code is removed; much of the code in FAR that is being accused of causing the issues hasn\u0027t been updated for over a year, well before 0.24 and the first official win64 version (where FAR worked perfectly fine, I might add, all it took was the 4 GB memory limits being exceeded and all of a sudden funky things happen).\n\nSo either the win64 unfixer is borked and it\u0027s doing a terrible job of removing the one or two lines of code that it needs to, or win64 is so broken with this hacked version that previously usable mods can\u0027t be, even after the win64 locking code is remove. Now, since the win64 locking code hasn\u0027t changed since 0.25, the unfixer shouldn\u0027t have changed in that time, so the sudden fact that there builds leaves us with only one conclusion: the 1.0.x win64 hack is far, far less stable than even the disaster that was 0.24\u0027s win64 build.\n\nNow, if that\u0027s not the case, one of you rebuilding any of these mods from the source against the win64 hack binaries and with the locking code removed should be sufficient to make the mods work and prove that win64 is as stable as you claim. However, all evidence up until now (including the vast majority of this thread) indicates that this is exactly the same thing that we\u0027ve seen with the first 0.23.5 win64 community hack; it has very serious issues that make it highly unstable, but those issues are blamed on mods (again); were it to be made an official win64 build again, those issues would persist, and rather than the issues being blamed on Unity / KSP, it would be thrown at modders (again). So if it\u0027s *not* as broken as it seems, and the stability claims aren\u0027t just marketing to try and convince Squad to put win64 back into production, you would be best served by trying to prove that it is more stable rather than trying to ascribe all the issues to mods that worked perfectly fine when win64 builds were first released."},{"CreatedByName":"morgadoster7","CreatedById":97409,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T22:53:48Z","Content":"I think ferram has a point.

Moreover, the problem lies not within the mods and, to be sure, most of us aren\u0027t claiming it does.\n\nYou can\u0027t say a boat has the problem of not flying, because the boat wasn\u0027t made to fly in the first place. In the same way, it is surprising that most mods DO work with this \u0022hack\u0022, since they weren\u0027t made with that in mind.\n\nHowever...\n\nI played the last official 64 bit release (.25 maybe?) and it was as stable as 32 bit, though I was using few or none mods at the time. So, is this workaround stable? YES, running 6 GB of RAM max. with 60 (functional) mods and not a single crash. Is it as stable as .25 x64 was? NO. Do my favourite mods work in this version? Maybe not, you must test it. Is it worth using this? OF COURSE, why not?\n\nAnyway, we don\u0027t need to promote it, we don\u0027t need to prove it is stable (it effectively isn\u0027t release stable), because Squad will eventually make it so, either with this engine or a different/better one.
