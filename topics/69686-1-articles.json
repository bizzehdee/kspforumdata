Or into an elliptical orbit that crosses the paths of multiple moons? And if we do the elliptical one, will I encounter issues of accidental gravity assists shooting me off where I don\u0027t want to go? I guess I could put my elliptical orbit slightly inclinded to miss the moons, but then do I get the advantage of the elliptical orbit in the first place? Or will I end up wasting too much fuel trying to get encounters with the moons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought is a single main craft (mothership / base) with a lander (or multiple landers) that can detach, go explore one of the moons, then come back and join the mothershiop again. This might turn into a full Jool-5 challenge, but it might not include Tyloo, if that adds too much complication to things. My main goal is to establish a permanent base of operations in the Jool system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T22:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re best bet is to put it either in a circular orbit inside of Laythe, or in orbit around Laythe or Tylo, if you do an elliptical orbit you are likely to be shot off by unintended gravity slingshots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
