It will merge folders where needed. PluginData and Resources are, like Parts and Plugins, standard folders in the KSP directory. But source is usually the actual uncompiled code and isn\u0027t needed. It\u0027s so other pluginmakers can take a look at it or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb requires a mechjebpart or pod on it to work. Then in the flightscene to the right is a tab you can click on. From there you can work with the different modules MechJeb has to offer.
