The chance that another agency would complete it sooner or later is changed depending on how much money you set to pay in your contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nExample:\u003Cbr\u003E\nGet a Probe To Orbit Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Requires a power source.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Requires an antenna.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Requires a thermometer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPayment:\u003Cbr\u003E\n$35,000\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis means that the chance of a space agency completing the mission may happen sooner, depending on the $35,000. Once the mission is complete, the funds are deducted from your account and a new ship which has these requirements is placed wherever you set the contract to be.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis also could be added onto by having rival space agencies competing to reach achievements, or put new spacecraft on new places.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt also could be added onto even more by having these NPC space agencies competing with yours to accept contracts and to complete them.\n"}]}
