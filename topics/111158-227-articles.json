Its probably what makes this community so much better than any other.\n\nAnd now question time!\n\n - How do you nominate a thread for TOTM, TOTW, TOTY, etc?\n\n - Does the solved questions count affect your rep?\n\n - How long has the share button been next to the follower count?\n\n - How can you get new emojis on the forums? Is there a way people can suggest them?\n\n - Is there a special \u0022Moderators only\u0022 sub-forum that you hang out in?
