Slow down, slow down. In this thread, I will make a deep explanation of how could colorable items work in stock KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, modder-friendly guide (I\u0027m a modder myself too, I just don\u0027t publish my mods):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexture suffixes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_me = Mask / Emmisive (Colorable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_ns = Normal / Specular (Normal Map (Not grayscale bump map!))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_de = Diffuse / Emmisive (Non-colorable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Mask / Emmisive (_me) defines the model\u0027s colorability using the Alpha channel and the main layer (Background in most cases, basically the layer where you paint your texture on). On Alpha channel you would put the following colors (hexcodes):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENon-colorable: #9f9f9f\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColorable: #898989\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, your Alpha channel would have the same layout as your layer where you paint the texture on, but for the colors you usually put, you would put the colors above for colorability or non-colorability. For example, I paint the texture of my Gas Tank, I painted the background layer, now the only thing left is to define colorability or non-colorability. I would just normally paint the whole alpha channel with the colorable color because I want my whole model to be colorable, but for people who don\u0027t want their whole model colorable, they would just paint the part they don\u0027t want to be colored with the non-colorable color. Now, let\u0027s move on to the Background layer defining colorability or non-colorability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the background layer, you could just paint it the way you usually do but I suggest this color (hexcode):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#8f1c68\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat color is basically gonna show the EXACT same color you painted it on the painting GUI ingame. For regular colors it would just change the color you painted on the background layer by adding the color you selected\u0027s RGB and hue values to the RGB and hue values you originally painted on your model. If you don\u0027t really want to use the color I suggested, you could use the shades of that color to get a bit different color between parts. Let\u0027s move on to normal maps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal maps could be generated by NVIDIA\u0027s photoshop tools normal map filter. It\u0027s background layer would be the normal map the NVIDIA Normal Map filter generated, but the alpha channel would contain the model\u0027s actual shinyness. You could put any shade from black to white (only neutral colors!) there to define the object\u0027s actual shine, but not glow. Let\u0027s move on to Diffuse / Emmisive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiffuse / Emmisive is a model texture that you usually paint. It\u0027s alpha channel defines the model\u0027s shinyness (but not glow), but it\u0027s normal map still needs an alpha channel that defines the model\u0027s shinyness to be a normal map after all. It\u0027s basically an UVW unwrap of your model that you paint and an alpha channel where you customize your model\u0027s shinyness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor non-modders: This tutorial (that will JUST MAYBE apply in the future) is too complicated for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope Squad really takes my request, even though this is complicated. Quite a few games already use this method, so modders that mod those games should easily mod KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MetalBreaker","CreatedById":126394,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T09:49:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-BUMP-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this thread really gets some attention because I really feel like nobody is interested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T12:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that it\u0027s not very well explained, and it talks about colors without using them.
