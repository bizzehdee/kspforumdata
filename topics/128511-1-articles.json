\u00A0If you have not upgraded it, then you will be unable to perform EVA, which is going to be a problem. \u00A0But if you have upgraded it, your Kerbals will be able to get out of their rockets and move between nearby vehicles, which will probably be your best bet for rescuing Jeb. \u00A0I suggest you try to do an orbital rendezvous and get Jeb from his capsule into an uncrewed capsule on a rescue rocket (this will be good practice for later too.) \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know you said you could not catch up a rescue mission with this capsule. \u00A0I do not know what kind of Kerbin orbit you have, but is it something highly ecliptic? \u00A0I noticed you had just a little fuel left, which with your Terrier might be just enough to attempt an aerobreaking maneuver to lower your orbit. \u00A0Here is how you do it: \u00A0wait until you are at the apoapsis (the highest point) of your orbit, then gently (with low throttle) thrust retrograte (opposite the direction you are moving) until your periapsis (the lowest point) of your orbit is between 50K and 70K above the surface of Kerbin. \u00A0That is enough to get it to skim the upper atmosphere, but save a little fuel for later (you will need it.) \u00A0Then you wait. \u00A0Each time it passes the periapsis, the apoapsis will get a little bit lower due to the atmospheric friction taking a little of your kinetic energy. \u00A0It will not be much, but in space a lot of little forces can add up to a big overall change. \u00A0Once you complete a pass where the apoapsis is between 70K and 90K or so, wait until you get to the apoapsis and thrust prograde (in the direction you are going) until your periapsis is just over 70K (this is why I said to save a little fuel.) \u00A0You should then be in a low, stable, and relatively circular orbit and much easier to rendezvous with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have a rescue capsule up there (remember the parachute!) and you are in position to rendezvous, have Jeb get out of his capsule by clicking the little EVA button on his portrait. \u00A0He will hang onto the outside of the door. \u00A0While he is hanging here, right click the capsule, and click the \u0022Take Data\u0022 button. \u00A0Jeb will grab all the science experiment results he has stashed in there and take it with him. \u00A0Then press the space bar to have him let go and float off into free-fall. \u00A0Activate his jetpack and use that to move (slowly!) toward the other capsule. \u00A0Once you are in front of the hatch, hit \u0022F\u0022 to grab, then once Jeb has a firm grip, have him get in. \u00A0Then deorbit and recover as normal. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen congratulate Jeb on successfully escaping an impossible situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T19:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222334420\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128511\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450898739\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133397\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fearless Son\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Fearless Son said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is your Astronaut Complex level at?
