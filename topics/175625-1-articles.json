And if the cost of lifting the materials is reduced, and the technology is developed and matured enough,\u00A0then it could happen. Eventually we can build habitats in SSO, permanently in sunlight, but also needing radiation shielding. Then, we could use similar infrastructure to build habitats in higher orbits. Eventually we may develop propulsion technology that can take a well sized habitat plus mining and manufacturing equipment\u00A0to another planet or to another location in the solar system.

Orbital habitats are not exactly easy. But they do provide a better colony than planets. To put this in perspective: the second most habitable place in the solar system, after Earth, is the ISS, and it\u0027s a very distant second. Any colony will be an artifical environment. As such, there are few advantages to planets. But orbital habitats retain many advantages: energy is abundant (solar can be used\u00A0as far out as Saturn, you just need bigger solar panels or solar concentrators), controlled levels of pseudo-gravity, better\u00A0controlled radiation doses, easy access to freefall and vacuum conditions, and enormous potential for growth. If space colonization happens, orbital habitats will be the preferred option, provided the people doing the colonizing are smart enough to realize that access to energy is of extreme importance.

People forget how close Mars is to Earth in terms of chemical composition. All the raw materials we need to build more or less anything are there in sufficient quantity to be useful, which reduces the problem to extraction and processing. Mars has enough ice in the poles, in the regolith, and in subsurface glaciers to fill an ocean or two, and enough carbon for at least a decently sized biospehere. Compare this to the Moon, which has no carbon, at least as far as we\u0027ve found, and a very small amount of highly inaccessible water ice near the poles. Space itself, of course, is even more useless, since it (by definition) has no usable resources other than constant sunlight. Oh, that\u0027s another thing about the Moon. Its day is 28 Earth days long. Compare to Mars, whose day is 24h 38m 35s, a figure that\u0027s conveniently quite compatible with the human sleep cycle and also solar panels and temperature regulation.

In principle, it\u0027s possible to build a completely closed-loop life support system, but everything wears out with time, and in space there\u0027s nowhere to go for replacement parts, other than back to Earth. With Mars, there\u0027s at least the faintest possibility (however remote it may seem) for self-sufficiency. Mars, at least, has real potential for independent growth, once sufficiently established. And make no mistake, self-sufficiency is something to strive for. A settlement that depends on constant supply will have a very hard time growing, and will amount to little more than a flashy show of technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m actually of the opinion that we won\u0027t see large permanent deep-space (including LEO/GEO) habitats for a long, long time.

Getting the large amounts of energy required\u00A0on Mars is somewhat problematic. Solar arrays can be used on the surface but that has issues, and nuclear energy is an option but carries significant risks for use in space. Compare this to the abundance of energy in space, where there is no night. Then it\u0027s a matter of accessing the energy. It is still difficult to get access to the large amounts required, but establishing the infrastructure near Earth will be easier than on Mars, due to sheer travel time and the required energy\u00A0to reach Mars. Once the solar energy system is up and running we can use the abundant energy provided to acquire, process, and use\u00A0materials, for many purposes. Orbital habitats could be built, but other structures may be useful as well. Large telescopes of various kinds, large manned spacecraft, more solar arrays, and quite a bit more useful things can be built.

No problem there. That is exactly what we need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not the best source out there, but we can figure out how to extract what we need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelivering mass to the Moon from Earth is energetically expensive. As such, the mass to be delivered to the Moon will be minimized as much as possible. Even so, if a base is constructed that will extract the necessary material, then it will take less energy per kg than delivering that mass from Earth. Once the infrastructure is in place, the energy required to move the extracted material to the\u00A0destination will be vastly reduced. The concept does\u00A0not involve sending millions of tonnes to the lunar surface and then bringing it back into orbit, rather, the concept is to build a moonbase for the purpose of extracting local material, and then that material would\u00A0be processed and delivered to wherever it needs to go. The mass of the moonbase would be as small as practical. Further processing would be done in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t have to compete with Earth sources, not so long as launch costs prohibit putting millions of tonnes into space economically, or even hundreds of thousands of tonnes of aluminum. The cost would be quite high even with much lower\u00A0launch costs. Energy is quite important, but so is cost. Sourcing aluminum and other materials from the Moon would only happen if it was economical to do so. Considering the large masses that would be needed for a colony, unless launch prices hit rock bottom, it would be cheaper to go for the Moon and, potentially,\u00A0asteroids.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelivering material from the Moon to a high altitude Earth orbit will take less energy than delivering the same mass to the same location but from Earth.

Of course, GEO is just an example orbit.

Getting a number of super rockets\u00A0to Mars would be an even more difficult task than getting the equipment for\u00A0scooping out lunar regolith to the Moon.
