After some fiddling around and quite a bit of misinformation on MY part, I came up with a fix for the NavBall issue. While this fix is specific to this add-on, it seems fairly common in other creative ship designs, so for noobs like myself it\u0027s a good lesson to learn.

Load the original Orbital Fuel Station (Stock) in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Click and lift the first PPD-12 Cupola Module (marked LK-S3E on the side) assembly from the top of the main stack and set it aside. Do not delete!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Click and lift the next part in stack: the MK2 Lander-Can assembly (marked T-C4N on the side). The connecting struts will disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. While you still have the MK2 selected, turn it right side up (by pressing the \u0022D\u0022 key twice).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Reattach the MK2 Assembly to the main stack. The struts will reappear . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Reattach the PPD-12 Cupola Module assembly to the top of the main stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Save the file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Repeat steps #2 and #3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Repeat step # 4 but turn the MK2 back to its inverted position as per Adam\u0027s original design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Repeat steps #5, #6, and #7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, \u0022Ctrl-Z\u0022 is your friend!!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ka2MG56.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ka2MG56.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RWyHky5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RWyHky5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T00:27:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think such a fix is even necessary - the reason the nav ball points down (as designed) is because you\u0027re controlling from the (downward pointing) Cupola.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the craft as originally downloaded, load it onto the launchpad, right click on the Mk-2 Lander Can and select \u0022Control From Here\u0022.
