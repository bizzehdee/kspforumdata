I overshot the light side by a bit and was suddenly landing in the dark, didn\u0027t know the hard cap was 3700m, and thankfully only lost the lander legs and engine. Queue rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI take my \u0022standard\u0022 Minimus landing rocket and replace the Material Lab with a lander can. So now I\u0027m a half ton heavier and less aerodynamic on liftoff. My liftoffs care about this as I use 4 Kickback SRBs as my first stage which pretty much pops me out to orbit. I know this isn\u0027t the most efficient method, but its been working. I can\u0027t do the gravity turn with them as when I eject them, there\u0027s a danger of hitting the rocket. So I eject, then turn, but at that point there isn\u0027t much thrust required to get to orbit (before the circularization).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this is to say, the rescue rocket is on the Minimus North Pole and I ended up using more fuel than I\u0027m used to. My normal reentry involve launching from Minimus, clearing its SOI, then doing a retro burn to pull my PA to about 40,000 - 60,000. Right before I hit the atmosphere, I burn everything left in the tank to take as much speed off before I start the reentry heat. Even so, I usually end up getting several heat bars before I decelerate enough to cool off. I do use a heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I have enough fuel to get me back to Kerbin, but I don\u0027t know if I have enough to slow me down enough to not burn to a crisp. In standard Kerbal practice, I ask this question now with my two Kerbals committed, instead of asking when I was redesigning my rocket. Reverting to a save is not an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how do I get back to Kerbin using the least amount of fuel? And is there an optimal flight path through the atmosphere I should be aiming for to minimize reentry heat? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am willing to spend some time (but not too much) having them aerobrake through the Kerbin atmosphere with enough speed to go back to orbit, and do this until enough speed is wiped off to successfully land. However, I\u0027ve never done that maneuver so I don\u0027t know the optimal altitude to aerobrake without landing. Too high, and it takes forever, too low and I reentry too early (and therefore too hot).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got 137 points of liquid fuel (and equal level of oxidizer), a 6.2 ton rocket, and the LV-909 engine.

And i won\u0027t wait for leaving Minimus\u0027 SOI, because this means higher delta V needed to lower your Kerbin periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is to find the perfect launch direction to make all the needed delta V in one big burn from Minimus launch. Else you\u0027ll need to orbit Minimus and plan a good ejection burn. This might be safer, but however, plan your ejection burn in a way that you don\u0027t need a big delta V later to lower your Kerbin periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are already near Kerbin (about 2/3 between apoapsis and periapsis) and want to lower your periapsis, it might be better to burn anti-radial instead of retrograde. You won\u0027t lose much speed, but your flight path with change significantly, allowing for a much bigger atmospheric drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing in with almost 3000 m/s, you want to aim at 25.000 m periapsis to land at Kerbin. Above 30.000, and you\u0027ll probably only get an aerobrake. For aerobraking, don\u0027t aim at anything above 40.000 - it won\u0027t brake you enough to make up for the risk of stacking heat damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you fear the full reentry will toast you to pieces, aim at 35.000 and do a one-orbit aerobrake. This should be sufficient. Make sure you have a little extra fuel left to fine tune your second reentry at 25.000 periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, may the force be with you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T13:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Foxboy said. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming that the \u00226.2 tons\u0022 you said is your wet mass, I make your delta-vee to be 953 m/s, which should be \u003Cem\u003Eplenty\u003C/em\u003E to get home from Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe theoretical optimum would be to do one single burn from Minmus surface, but that would be pretty hard to control just right, so I\u0027d recommend orbiting Minmus first. To take maximum advantage of the Oberth effect, you want that orbit to be as low as possible. So when you take off, go to max throttle and tip over to near-horizontal almost immediately, so you can do a surface-skimming circular orbit at really low elevation, say 6000-7000 meters. (If it\u0027s a couple of kilometers higher, no big deal-- Minmus has a pretty shallow gravity well, you don\u0027t lose all that much).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you\u0027re at the pole, it matters which direction you go. You want the plane of your Minmus orbit to be perpendicular to the direction to Kerbin. That is, if you picture someone on Kerbin looking at you, they should see your orbit as a perfect circle from that angle, not a back-and-forth line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will now give you time to plan your 2nd burn, which will take you home. You have leisure to set up a maneuver node. Your burn will be over either the N or S pole of Minmus (depending on which direction you\u0027re orbiting). If an observer on Kerbin would see you making a clockwise circle, you want N pole; if counterclockwise, S pole. (The idea is that the direction you\u0027re orbiting Minmus should be \u003Cem\u003Eopposite\u003C/em\u003E the direction that Minmus is orbiting Kerbin, so that your Minmus orbital velocity will be added to your going-home burn.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet up your maneuver node to take you to a Kerbin periapsis like Foxboy said. If you want to minimize reentry heating (i.e. spread it out over a long time), 35km or just a smidgeon lower (I usually use 34) works well. That will give you one pass to aerobrake to LKO, and a second pass for Kerbin reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou actually have a fair amount of excess delta-vee to work with-- 953 m/s should leave you a few hundred m/s left over as you approach Kerbin. So you have some additional options. One option would be to circularize into LKO after your initial 35km burn (won\u0027t take much), then launch another rescue vehicle to pick up (it would be a pretty cheap one). Another option is to burn up the remainder of your fuel as you enter the atmosphere on your second pass, to kill a few hundred m/s and give you just that much less reentry heating to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother area of strategy is how to handle the actual aerobraking itself (e.g. orientation relative to your velocity, how heat-tolerant your lander is, etc.) Do you have any heat-shield at all? Airbrakes? Any fins/airfoils?
