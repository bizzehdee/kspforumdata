At first, it seems like a big accomplishment to get into orbit. Then, it\u0027s a big deal when you land on a moon for the first time. Then comes your first interplanetary trip, usually to Duna, and you\u0027ll be really proud if you make it home intact. Then you\u0027ll try sending unmanned probes to Jool, get spaceplanes to orbit, assemble a large station in Kerbin orbit, land a rover on Mun, place fuel depots around the other planets, and assemble a large station in Jool orbit. You\u0027ll send a spaceplane to Laythe and back, land on Eve and return, jump into the Moho holes, and drive down the canyon on Dres (or jump across it). Many planets have special anomalies and/or unique geological features, and it\u0027s worth looking for these. You\u0027ll make a probe that crashes into the sun, and another that escapes its pull entirely. You\u0027ll do trips where you land on, and return to orbit from, Gilly and Minmus only using your built-in jetpack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you start using mods. You\u0027ll map out every planet and moon, so that you can land somewhere specific as needed. If you download the Kethane mod and/or wait until the upcoming resource system, you\u0027ll now establish a network of refineries/fuel depots to make interplanetary travel much easier, and large mobile refineries crawling across the surfaces. You\u0027ll do a Grand Tour, a single trip landing on every planet and moon in the system (other than Jool). You\u0027ll make gigantic spaceplanes that can deliver large amounts of fuel or cargo to orbit, without using any disposable parts. You\u0027ll assemble large bases on various planets or moons, solely for the neat screenshots you\u0027ll get of twenty Kerbonauts standing around. You\u0027ll build VTOL aircraft and reusable SSTO rockets, just because you can. Every landing will be on the runway at KSC, just because they should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you get creative. Cannons, blimps, helicopters, boats, hang gliders, giant robots... it\u0027s all been done. You\u0027ll make a full-scale replica of your favorite science fiction ship, no matter how inefficient it is, and get it to orbit just because you can. Every time a patch comes out, you\u0027ll go back and do certain accomplishments again to take advantage of the changes and/or see the new sights, so it won\u0027t all just be strange stuff. And you\u0027ll constantly refine your old designs; that spaceplane that you thought was so incredible a month ago now looks horribly inefficient to you, because you now understand the way things work so much better, or some new mod has provided you with a part you wished you\u0027d had back then. That 5-stage rocket you used to get one man to the Mun will be replaced by a better-designed 3-stage version that holds three people and has an integral rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, if your concept of the game is limited to just sending a 1-man lander to Mun, it\u0027s hard to really understand how much more there is to the game. I\u0027m not saying you won\u0027t ever run out of things you want to do, but sandbox games allow for things far beyond the \u0022intended\u0022 purposes, so don\u0027t assume you\u0027ll get bored any time soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crosswar","CreatedById":68376,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T22:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got the game like 1h after posting the message ye at first everything seems like a big accomplishment, for example i have been trying for 1h to get a perfect orbit angle and i keep failing, but its all good, its fun xD plus the space planes are so cool and fast,will spend allot of time in this for now it seems...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"llamatoes","CreatedById":57750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T23:12:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrust me, you will, I purchased in early November last year, mucked about for two months before getting Into orbit and am now doing colones on vall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Laythe is too mainstream)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"omegaspectre","CreatedById":54709,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T23:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no true multiplayer plugins as of now, also a word of advice.. don\u0027t mention multiplayer too often on here.
