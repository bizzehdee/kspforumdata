I\u0027ve been getting my nerd on in a serious way, and marathoned through Cowboy Bebop again with my friends. It\u0027s one of the best anime of all time, but I haven\u0027t seen many attempts to replicate some of its iconic spacecraft. So, here I am to fill in that gap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NYmt8AB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NYmt8AB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpike Spiegel\u0027s Swordfish\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ve seen one other Swordfish replica on the forums before, but that was back in the souposphere, and even then it wasn\u0027t able to fly without hack gravity.

I\u0027ve added additional control surfaces and Vernor engines, tweaked the balance, and made a couple other small changes. The old version of the Swordfish could really only fly with the Vernors on, severely limiting speed and flight time. Now the Swordfish can take off, fly, and maneuver using only its aerodynamic control surfaces. The Vernor engines boost the Swordfish\u0027s maneuverability to an insane degree, allowing it to stop and reverse directing in midair. It also allows it to take off and hover vertically. However, the Vernor engines really chew through fuel, so flying in this mode means much shorter flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/pB3AE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Primary lift is provided by two basic jet engines, but it needs pulses from the Vernor engines to get up in the air, and even more pulses to keep it there. It flies on translation controls, so get ready to have both hands on the keyboard. Again, flight time is limited to a couple of minutes, so in this case only I recommend emptying some of the fuel out of it and flying with Infinite Fuel on.

And there was almost NO Roll control without them and very little pitch control. Yaw was also a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I messed around in flight and discovered some things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off - the leading edge control surfaces on the front part of the wings were FIGHTING the ones on the back end. In other words, any pitch or roll you tried to input pretty much was negated by having the front leading edges almost entirely cancelling out whatever the trailing edges were doing. Once I turned off Pitch and Roll control on the leading edges, the Swordfish responded MUCH better than before. It could maneuver reliably without needing the vernier jets to be on all the time. They still come in VERY handy in short on/off bursts. But the craft no longer NEEDED them constantly on to fly true! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond - I re-angled the rear \u0022circle tail\u0022 so that the center of mass and center of lift were DEAD ON each other. This REALLY helped! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, I turned on the Yaw on the vertical stabilizers at the tips of the wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - when the vernier jets are off, you have a pretty stable, yet maneuverable flying machine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the verniers ON, you get SUPER-MANEUVERABILITY on the order of an SU-27 Flanker! This thing can reverse itself in mid-air, STOP with its thrust and go the other way! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT EDIT: Oh - and those vernier thrusters really help out in take-offs and landings. This Swordfish isn\u0027t a VTOL. But it\u0027s most definitely an STOL extraordinaire! With upward thrust from the verniers, i can practically stand this thing on it\u0027s tailwheel 50 meters into take-off and lift off!! And in landing, you can get down to some ridiculously slow speeds for a nice soft touchdown. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore I retract my comment about the landing gear above. It\u0027s rather a moot point!

You just have to watch in the show carefully and then take some notes from a source like the plan view above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing is that you are almost certainly NOT going to be able to do this properly in stock mode. You\u0027re going to need IR Robotics at bare minimum. I also recommend Bahamuto\u0027s parts pack - the ones with the pop-out engines and such. Lackluster Labs will also have some form shapes that\u0027ll help. Lastly - tweakscale, because you\u0027re going to have to adjust some things for closest result. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at the \u0022arms\u0022. There are at least 3 large thrusters on the white \u0022shoulder\u0022 sections. The big thruster right behind the \u0022elbow\u0022 of the assembly is the main VTOL thruster. (\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E Right where you\u0027ve got the big landing gear, in fact) But there are stabilizing thrusters pointing forward and to the sides relative to that. Plus what appear to be Linear RCS Thruster ports towards the rear facing outwards, and at the very tip of the rear part of the shoulder facing backwards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it were me, I\u0027d build the arms first as an IR Robotics sub-assembly first if possible. You\u0027ll need a rototron at the main connecting point between the \u0022shoulder\u0022 and the main body. And a powered hinge (possibly also a small sliding piston) at the \u0022elbow\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the show, when the Red Tail comes in to land, it bends the \u0022Elbows\u0022 up and folds the guns near vertical, and rotates the \u0022Shoulders\u0022 so that the main VTOL thruster is pointing down. The other thrusters probably gimble to provide stabilization. Plus the RCS is helping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBahamuto\u0027s parts pack would be invaluable, because it\u0027s got at least one rocket thruster that\u0027s a rectangular unit, that looks like a vent when not operating, but when active, pops out the bells of the rocket thrusters. It\u0027d make a good match for that VTOL vent above. (Rockets also make better VTOL thrusters than Jets anyway - more responsive.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other thrusters - well I think for the power you need and the response time, you\u0027ll need to use Vernor thrusters like you used with the Swordfish. They may have to be spaced differently because they\u0027ll be static rather than gimble mounts. But that\u0027s the sort of compromise you have to make when doing a recreation that\u0027s also intended to fly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure HOW to really do the bubble cockpit justice.
