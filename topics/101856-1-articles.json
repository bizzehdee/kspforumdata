The Mars landers utilized a \u0022balloon\u0022 airbag system to drop the rover on the surface of mars. I think something like this should be implemented as an alternative to landing on the surface with rockets. It could be dropped from orbit without concern for damaging the rover and lander assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T03:57:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[MOD - Changed thread title, since it was about landing airbags rather than specifically about Mars rover landers]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T04:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly problem is that the airbags can only take so much weight, the Curiosity rover is way too heavy for them, and so, it couldn\u0027t use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a lower gravity environment, maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know RoverDudes survival pack has inflatable floaties and airbags, but I haven\u0027t used the mod myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T05:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile air bag helps, you are not gonna be able to rely on it for a drop from orbit, there is only so much force they can absorb before they burst and crush whatever is behind them.
