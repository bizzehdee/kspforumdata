The Mars landers utilized a \u0022balloon\u0022 airbag system to drop the rover on the surface of mars. I think something like this should be implemented as an alternative to landing on the surface with rockets. It could be dropped from orbit without concern for damaging the rover and lander assembly."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T03:57:58Z","Content":"**[MOD - Changed thread title, since it was about landing airbags rather than specifically about Mars rover landers]**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T04:36:27Z","Content":"Only problem is that the airbags can only take so much weight, the Curiosity rover is way too heavy for them, and so, it couldn\u0027t use them.\n\nIn a lower gravity environment, maybe.\n\nI know RoverDudes survival pack has inflatable floaties and airbags, but I haven\u0027t used the mod myself."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T05:03:34Z","Content":"While air bag helps, you are not gonna be able to rely on it for a drop from orbit, there is only so much force they can absorb before they burst and crush whatever is behind them. You have to significantly slow down with a retro burn not very high from landing, then you can drop and deploy.\n\nThink of them like parachutes but for use in airless environment.\n\nRoverDude\u0027s Survival pack has some. Lack\u0027s Stock Extension also have some. Both abuses the stock wheel collider I believe, to do the air bag effect. Perhaps they can be considered and added to the stock game."}]}
