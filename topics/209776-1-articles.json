Stock KSP basically expects you to keep failing until you learn and succeed, as it is aimed at people like those who actually do rocket science.\u00A0 They expect us to adapt and learn and get better through the experience. It is very different from the average space sim that uses a magic system to get around. Those are quite fun but do little to prepare us for real physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you feel like it, persevere, Try the mod to fix the tutorial or just start a sandbox game and experiment around to get a feel for what works.
