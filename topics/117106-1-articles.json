Set it to no higher than 30 to 40%. That will give you a much smoother turn and less aerodynamic stress.\n\nAnd activating the AoA with a max angle of 10 to 15 degrees is also a good idea.

Once the top tank start to have some empty space, put sas on attitude or prograde hold, then alt-click on the two orange tanks and fill the top tank from the bottom one.

You can change that by using a fuel line from the bottom tank to the upper one. That way the lower tank drains first and the center of mass shifts upwards, making you flight more stable."}]}
