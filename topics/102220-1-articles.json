It\u0027s in version 0.52!**\n\nHi, this is my first mod (I will accept criticism graciously).\n\nIt has one custom resource:\n\n- Strange Matter: The basis of this mod.\n\nIt features 5 parts\n\n1. The ResGen 1 unit itself: This unit will consume ~8.6 units of Strange Matter to produce most units of fuel/resources.\n2. The ResGen 2 unit: This is the Mk2 variant of the ResGen 1, able to be fitted onto the Mk2 parts.\n3. Strange Matter Collection Unit: So far, this is the only way to actually generate Strange Matter, albeit at a slow pace.\n4. Strange Matter Containment Unit: The only thing that can store the Strange Matter. It contains 500 units of SM.\n5. Strange Matter Engine: Consumes SM and EC for a reasonable thrust of 150 and an ISP of an ION drive.\n\nAs of now, none of these parts have custom models ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif). If anyone could try this mod out (maybe make a custom model\u002Btexture) that would be great. The target look for these parts are either Stock-alike or Futuristic.\n\nPictures!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
