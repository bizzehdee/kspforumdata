The orbits will intersect in one or two places. At these intersects, we\u0027ll make a burn that will give us an intersect. Try to be as precise as possible. You\u0027ll want that intersect to be as close as possible. (I usually aim for an intersect that is 1-4 km apart) The orbit you will be in will probably not be co-planar.

At the intersect point, the Heads Up Display (HUD) will switch from showing the \u0022orbital velocity\u0022 to the \u0022Target velocity.\u0022 This is the speed of your vehicle relative to the target. As you can see from the below picture, my speed is 31.3 m/s in relation to the target. You can also see that my station is 3.7km from the ship. To get ready to dock, we need to cut the speed down to as close to 0.0 m/s as we can. We will do that by pointing the ship so we are burning in the retrograde position. Since the HUD is showing the ship as it\u0027s related to the target, burning in the retrograde is retrograde in relation to the target. In the picture below you can see that I\u0027m moving into the retrograde position.

Conversly, if you need to go a little faster, you can use the \u0022H\u0022 key to burn forward. get as close to 0.0 m/s as you can. if you end up showing 0.1 m/s or so, you will be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/rendezvous%20from%20launch/12_zps89dbd917.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212_zps89dbd917.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve made it this far, Congratz!

As soon as you complete the burn, flip the ship completely around. You will want to get in the \u0022retrograde\u0022 position. Pay very close attention to the target. You will want to get very close. As soon as you are within 100 meters or so, burn till your speed is 0.0 m/s in relation to the target. If you get in close enough, you are ready to start making your RCS moves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/2_zps2c7cf37a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222_zps2c7cf37a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The next thing to do is refine your targeting. To do this, you will want to click on the Docking clamp you will be docking with. Click it, and push the blue button marked \u0022Set as target\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/3_zps8f82c0e4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223_zps8f82c0e4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Now, point the ship toward the docking clamp. In the HUD, this is the same pink circle. We will be making a slow approach so we need to use RCS. Once you are pointed toward the docking port, turn on your RCS and use the \u0022H\u0022 key to move toward the target. If you aren\u0027t quite on as you get closer use the \u0022N\u0022 key to burn RCS in the reverse direction. Then re-aim you ship and use the \u0022H\u0022 key to move toward the target. Rinse and repeat. Keep your speed at or below 0.6 m/s. This is slow enough that if you collide with your target, you probably won\u0027t do any damage, and if you hit the docking port, you will probably dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote\u003C/strong\u003E: When you are this close to the station, only use the RCS. Regular engine burns might push your target. RCS won\u0027t push on the target though, so you can use it as much as you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPro-tip\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E- If you have ASAS on your ship, keep it turned on. As you maneuver, use the \u0022F\u0022 key at the same time you are pressing the movement key to temporarily toggle the SAS system. For example: If you want to move to the right, push the \u0022F\u0022 and the \u0022D\u0022 key at the same time. when you release, the ship might wobble a bit, but it will stay closer to where you want the ship to point. Also, if you are having trouble getting the target lined up, hit the capslock key to move into \u0022precision\u0022 mode. It can help make the painfully accurate maneuvers necessary for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/4_zpsf410b54e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224_zpsf410b54e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Keep making this short RCS maneuvers until the two docking ports collide. You should aim for touching while moving 0.3 to 0.5 m/s. Once they touch, the magnetic system will take over. \u003Cstrong\u003ETURN OFF YOUR SAS SYSTEM\u003C/strong\u003E and don\u0027t touch the keyboard. The ship might move around a bit, but just be patient. Also, switch to your target (You can cycle between ships/stations that are close by pushing the \u0022[\u0022 key.) and make sure that any SAS system is off. Just let the ships move around until they dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/5_zpsf31c0a1c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225_zpsf31c0a1c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Once the ships are aligned, they will \u0022snap\u0022 together. Congratulations! You have docked! (If it\u0027s really taking a long to snap together, you can toggle your SAS when the ships look like they are close to being lined up, and then immediately turn off your SAS. This can help ... sometimes). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/6_zpsbd7bae9a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226_zpsbd7bae9a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Margaul","CreatedById":69414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T07:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote\u003C/strong\u003E: These instructions are intended for Odo, who started this thread, but I\u0027d like feedback because I intend to post it as a tutorial if it works well\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis set of instructions is a little different. I\u0027m assuming that you\u0027ve read the first two sets of instructions. I\u0027m mostly just showing the differences between docking from launch to docking from two different orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The first thing to do is make a maneuver, and then burn till your orbit intersects with the targets orbit. When I started this, I was in a polar orbit and I was moving down to the targets orbit. For ease of showing examples, I\u0027m showing the orbits when I was ready to make the corrections. As you can see, my intersect is at the \u0022bottom.\u0022 I\u0027m flying the lander in these pictures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/minmustutorial/1_zpsc32f315d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221_zpsc32f315d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Because the lander is behind the command module I\u0027ll be docking with, I\u0027ll burn to make an orbit that is slightly lower in altitude on one side. This will allow the lander to catch up. If the lander was in front of the command module, I would make an orbit that was slightly higher in altitude. This would allow the command module to catch up to my lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/minmustutorial/2_zpsdb5210d0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222_zpsdb5210d0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. After the orbit looks the way I want it to, I\u0027ll time warp until the intersects get closer together. The first picture shows the orbits right after the burn and the second picture shows when I have intersects that are nice and close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/minmustutorial/3_zpsdbe372ab.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223_zpsdbe372ab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/minmustutorial/4_zps5407421d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224_zps5407421d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, I ended up an intersect that is really close. If the orbits never quite meet up like that, you may have to make a small burn. As you set the manuver up, the program will show you a projected intercept. Work the node till you have an intersect that is close together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Once the ships are close together, make burns that will lower your target speed to 0.0 m/s. Then point the ship at the target, and use RCS to burn closer to the target. Make sure you are targeting the target docking port. Also, use the \u0022[\u0022 key to switch to the target ship, and point it toward the docking port of the oncoming ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1073.photobucket.com/albums/w398/margaul/minmustutorial/6_zpsd6abfe6a.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226_zpsd6abfe6a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
