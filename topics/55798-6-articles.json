It\u0027s possible the red icon is still just based on current velocity and orientation though, I\u0027ll have to double check. Considering parachutes or other rockets may be in use, I don\u0027t think your equation is sufficient to determine whether the craft will be going to fast by the time it reaches ground level. I\u0027ll see if I can do anything to improve the predictions, but its kinda a tricky problem and I\u0027m trying to give the pilot very simple feedback.
