Problem is, I have no idea where to begin. I\u0027m at a point where I\u0027m willing to give of the texturing to someone else in the community if they would like to give it a go. With that being said, I would also love to do it myself, but like I said, I have no idea how to go about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a temporary 2.5m model that represents what I want the final product to look like. I applied a temporary texture and imported it into the game. The config file has been set up in such a way that I can just copy, paste and adjust some values for the different sizes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone has any tutorial or guide suggestions, please do let me know. And if anyone would like to give it a go themselves, just say so and we can get in contact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColdJ","CreatedById":211123,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-02T20:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be helpful to know what tools you have available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you can take a screenshot of the original part, bring it into the picture editor of your choice, grab a section of it and put that on your texture pic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could do something similar with the originals texture pic too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll you are doing is getting a sample which you can then use to create your own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GamingHen","CreatedById":214105,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-03T07:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224403716\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225306\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221719953450\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022211123\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ColdJ\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, ColdJ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be helpful to know what tools you have available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you can take a screenshot of the original part, bring it into the picture editor of your choice, grab a section of it and put that on your texture pic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could do something similar with the originals texture pic too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll you are doing is getting a sample which you can then use to create your own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I\u0027m modelling in Blender. I have access to Photoshop and Substance 3D painter, but I would prefer if I don\u0027t have to use Substance. I think I understand how to get the colors correct, but how do I go about adding a Grunge Map or something similar? Do I just get random ones online and choose one that feels right, or is there some library of stock-alike textures somewhere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColdJ","CreatedById":211123,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-03T07:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game is your library, all the textures are there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad to look up what a Grunge Map was. If you feel the need then yes go find something suitable, but really as I said, take a screenshot of the part you are trying to look like and open it in your photo editor, then manipulate it and add it to your texture pic, that is the easiest way to get the result you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-03T07:42:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2024 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 3\u0022\u003EJuly 3\u003C/time\u003E by ColdJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
