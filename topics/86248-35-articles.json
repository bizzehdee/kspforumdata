Really, getting reputation is tricky. Some of the coolest ships out there hardly get any, but sometimes a single funny (or helpful, or just overwhelmingly true/relevant) post will get you several comments. Doing unique and interesting things is almost a surefire way to get some rep, like my Blender renders of other people\u0027s craft. (Which I assure you I\u0027ll be getting back to shortly!)

After craft, of course. Post craft, post craft, and post more craft. And spend a long time on them, testing, building, refining. It will show. Also, replicas. People recognize craft from real life, and they rep it. If it doesn\u0027t look stock, or even better, not like KSP at all, so much the better. People rep craft because they enjoy looking at them. Make the release page enjoyable, and useful. If it has lots un-spoilered pictures, it will take to long to load. Same with animated gifs. Take your craft out for a photo shoot, to get the best pictures of it. Even if it would never look like that during flight.
