Then- just copy paste the folder eg.\u00A0liquidEngineSkipper_v2 under Squad/Parts/Engine from your 1.9 install into your 1.8 install. To remove the old models, go into the .cfg of the old part (liquidEngineSkipper.cfg under Squad/Parts/Engine/liquidEngineSkipper) and change from \u0027category = Engine\u0027 to \u0027category = none\u0027 and add the line \u0027TechHidden = true\u0027 after the \u0027TechRequired\u0027 line- this will just hide the old parts but will not delete old crafts because they had a missing part.
