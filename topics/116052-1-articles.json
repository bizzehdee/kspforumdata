Let kerbals drag them out and deploy them around the lander/base. Scientists could read the data for a slight bonus. Engineers could deploy them better for a slight bonus. I dont care. Give us reasons to be on the surface longer than 10 seconds. \n\nPerhaps the various experiments in the ALSEP could be taken out of the Science Lab(if landed as a base) or the Lab Jr and then deployed. Just something.\n\nOn another note, if once landed the game spawned \u0022Collect surface sample(or EVA report) from these 3 places within ~300m\u0022 that would be great too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T22:23:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T23:15:44Z","Content":"While realism is not the ultimate goal it still can be a good inspiration. So I looked up the reason for a number of EVAs in reality. The vast majority seems to be installation. Next is repair. Then handling of experiments that can only be handled from the outside. And still quite some for testing of EVA equipment.\n\nWe have the repair thing, but no random fails. We can open solar panels from the outside even if the craft has no power.\n\nThen there is some interaction with experiments from the outside.\n\nSo in comparison to reality the most missing thing is some construction work.\n\nAnd for to direct answer the question: Yes, I think there should be more EVA activities possible."},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T23:16:19Z","Content":"\u003E On another note, if once landed the game spawned \u0022Collect surface sample(or EVA report) from these 3 places within ~300m\u0022 that would be great too.\n\nThat\u0027s actually a really good idea."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T23:35:47Z","Content":"Even just stock-ifying KAS/KIS would be a huge boost. I installed them when 1.0 came out and since then I haven\u0027t even bothered going to other planets (not due to lack of ability; I\u0027ve landed and returned from every solid surface except Eve and Tylo in previous versions) because I\u0027ve been having so much fun messing around in Kerbin orbit (and, to be fair, with my mining base on Minmus).\n\nJust recently, for instance, I figured out a great way to do \u0022rescue stranded astronaut and recover his/her command capsule\u0022 missions at almost no cost. I rendezvous with the stranded capsule with the H-Wing (already in orbit), harpoon it, tow it to rendezvous with the Klaw Construction Co. base (already in orbit), and have an engineer pull a small heat shield off of the heat shield rack and some parachutes from storage and bolt them all onto the capsule, then use the H-Wing to tow the capsule into a sub-orbital trajectory. Detach harpoon, speed up to restore the H-Wing into a stable orbit, switch focus to the capsule, and ride the heat shield and parachutes down to a safe landing.\n\nAll the infrastructure I needed was already in place, and I can do it 15 more times before I need to send up another rack of spare heat shields. More importantly, building stuff in orbit is loads of fun."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T01:42:54Z","Content":"Yeah, KIS/KAS should be made stock yesterday."},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T02:27:18Z","Content":"\u0027Not in scope\u0027, unfortunately.\n\nAlthough it would be a nice feature.
