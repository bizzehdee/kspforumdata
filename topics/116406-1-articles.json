I\u0027ve got a giant mothership, atmosphere probes, a heavy science lander, the whole shebang. Thing is, my mothership doesn\u0027t have quite enough delta-v to make it out to Sarnus in one go. So, to counteract that problem, my science lander is fully equipped to refuel the mothership. My mission calls for a pit stop in the Jool system, to top up the tanks and test out the hardware.\n\nI\u0027ve been testing the lander on Vall, and I feel like I\u0027ve run into a wall. It carries a full science suite for airless worlds, as well as a refinery and the big ore tank. I need it to be able to make orbit from Vall\u0027s surface carrying the full ore tank, drop that off at the mothership to be refined, and then make it back down to the surface to mine the next load. I\u0027ve been able to do this on the Mun, but Vall, being larger, is foiling those designs. Now, no matter what I try, my landers aren\u0027t performing the way I need them too. And, if they do, they\u0027re massively heavy, bigger than my mothership can manage. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

What is it that I\u0027m doing wrong?"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T15:04:54Z","Content":"Remove the refinery from the ore hauler, or refuel someplace like Bop or Pol?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T15:50:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Remove the refinery from the ore hauler, or refuel someplace like Bop or Pol?\n\nI totally agree... i consider mining Vall \u0022UNREASONABLE\u0022..."},{"CreatedByName":"spudman2","CreatedById":84199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T16:37:10Z","Content":"I don\u0027t have advice, but I would like to say that I\u0027m the same boat as you; between \u0022enough dV to do anything useful\u0022, \u0022enough TWR to leave the ground\u0022 and \u0022enough capacity to actually refill something\u0022, I can only get two at a time.

Your best bet is cut the first 800\u002B dV off by refuelling at Minmus with existing infrastructure and/or taking a Jool gravity assist. Harder to set up, the gravity assist will save you more dV than attempting a refueling op."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T17:32:40Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121794-Has-anyone-managed-to-create-a-miner-capable-of-net-gain-to-orbit-on-Moho?p=1950595\u0026viewfull=1#post1950595](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121794-Has-anyone-managed-to-create-a-miner-capable-of-net-gain-to-orbit-on-Moho?p=1950595\u0026viewfull=1#post1950595)\n\nMoho takes just a bit more dV than Val.\n\nFor moho, it is much better to take the refinery down to the surface.\n\nAlso, I think you should use 1x poodle rather than 4x LV-909s. 10kN more thrust and 0.25 tons less mass.\n\nPlus your Isp is 5s better.\n\nThese aren\u0027t major differences, but it will help.\n\nThat said... I\u0027d probably opt for a refueling craft on Laythe.... perhaps a dedicated tanker that isn\u0027t just for that mission.\n\nVal\u0027s dV requirements are essentially 860x2.\n\nYou need 860 to get to orbit after mining, but you also need to haul enough fuel back up to replace the fuel you used getting down.\n\nAt Laythe the atmosphere will do that for you (so you can land with pretty much empty tanks), and you can get up to ~1,300 m/s (or better in 1.04 I hear) on very efficient air breathers...\n\nSo you only need the last 600m/s or so to be done on rockets, which is far more economical than lifting off of Val....\n\nBut I\u0027m not sure how much extra dV (if any, oberth and all) it will take to travel to your next destination.\n\nI would make a dedicated mining\u002B refinery\u002B tanker ship that doesn\u0027t go with the rest of the mission, and just stays in the Jool system to refuel things there."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T19:19:58Z","Content":"How-to question moved to the how-to subforum."},{"CreatedByName":"bigcalm","CreatedById":143587,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T23:24:06Z","Content":"Here\u0027s what I\u0027m trying out on Moho (which has slightly higher g but otherwise broadly similar) - figures are with a full ore tank:\n\n![G2jPQJ3.png](http://i.imgur.com/G2jPQJ3.png)\n\nFor Vall you probably want to throw away all the solar panels and replace them a lot of nuclear isotopes.\n\nHow you *get* it to Vall is somewhat harder. My current system is to have 2 large shunts - one to take the lander empty of fuel (~27tons) and one to take enough fuel to make the first landing, docking them together in orbit."}]}
