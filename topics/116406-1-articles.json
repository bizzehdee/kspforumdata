I\u0027ve got a giant mothership, atmosphere probes, a heavy science lander, the whole shebang. Thing is, my mothership doesn\u0027t have quite enough delta-v to make it out to Sarnus in one go. So, to counteract that problem, my science lander is fully equipped to refuel the mothership. My mission calls for a pit stop in the Jool system, to top up the tanks and test out the hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been testing the lander on Vall, and I feel like I\u0027ve run into a wall. It carries a full science suite for airless worlds, as well as a refinery and the big ore tank. I need it to be able to make orbit from Vall\u0027s surface carrying the full ore tank, drop that off at the mothership to be refined, and then make it back down to the surface to mine the next load. I\u0027ve been able to do this on the Mun, but Vall, being larger, is foiling those designs. Now, no matter what I try, my landers aren\u0027t performing the way I need them too. And, if they do, they\u0027re massively heavy, bigger than my mothership can manage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ldW3j\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Your best bet is cut the first 800\u002B dV off by refuelling at Minmus with existing infrastructure and/or taking a Jool gravity assist. Harder to set up, the gravity assist will save you more dV than attempting a refueling op.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T17:32:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121794-Has-anyone-managed-to-create-a-miner-capable-of-net-gain-to-orbit-on-Moho?p=1950595\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1950595\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121794-Has-anyone-managed-to-create-a-miner-capable-of-net-gain-to-orbit-on-Moho?p=1950595\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1950595\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho takes just a bit more dV than Val.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor moho, it is much better to take the refinery down to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think you should use 1x poodle rather than 4x LV-909s. 10kN more thrust and 0.25 tons less mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus your Isp is 5s better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese aren\u0027t major differences, but it will help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said...
