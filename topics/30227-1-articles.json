Unfortunately GameEvents provides onUndock but no onDock event. Is there another way to check this event?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I would like to know how many tons of a specific resource are available on the vessel (only the name of the resource is known, e.g. \u0022Oxidizer\u0022), how do I do that? I don\u0027t see any suitable methods in Vessel or PartModule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally I would like to know whether or not more file access methods are planned. I would like to access the directories,where my mission files are, but that is not possible (accessing System.IO is forbidden). I use FileBrowser so far, but that has other issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T14:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few new file access methods in GameDatabase.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T14:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nobody44\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nobody44\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (accessing System.IO is forbidden). \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thanks the devs for that, wouldn\u0027t be safe to download any plugins otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nobody44","CreatedById":66369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T15:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are a few new file access methods in GameDatabase.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErr....

I want to see which files are there, and of course, I want to open them. For now I use KSP.IO.TextReader and FileBrowser and it works, but it has some side effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured out how to access the resources, maybe there are simpler methods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIterate over all parts on your vessel, each part has the Resources property and you can access the resource by using [\u0022LiquidFuel\u0022] as accessor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
