After this, I think we should take it to PMs, just to avoid derailing. This is going to be a bit long, as I want to cover everything at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, I \u0022work\u0022 for BuNine, a group that consults directly with David Weber on visualizing and filling out background in his Honorverse books. A better explanation of who we are can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bunine.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bunine.org/\u003C/a\u003E It\u0027s mostly unpaid volunteer work, but we *do* have a board of directors, and some people *do* get *some* income - mostly by way of royalties from work provided for the book \u003Cem\u003EHouse of Steel: The Honorverse Companion\u003C/em\u003E. Everything I have done, as well as everything that has been produced by BuNine for David can be considered hard canon, although over time, things may change, superceding previous canon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own 3D work is mainly for B9 (heh...) internal use. Line drawings of ships (such as those in the Companion) are all well and good, but 3D modeling helps to fit things better and allows the line art to be more accurate - some of the line art in the book was changed based on my 3D models, mostly weapons port locations. That said, there\u0027s no objections (now - I\u0027m under an NDA for some things, but my ship work is okay to post publicly) to my posting stuff I\u0027ve done, and that\u0027s about as much of a project that will see the light of day as my stuff is likely to get. That\u0027s not saying that *someday* down the line, there may be something going on, but if there is, I\u0027ve not been told. There *are* two more companions coming out. The next one should be sometime late this year or early 2015. That one will be titled \u003Cem\u003EHouse of Lies\u003C/em\u003E, and where HoS concentrated on the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the Protectorate of Grayson, this next one will deal with the People\u0027s Republic of Haven and I believe the Andermani Empire (and maybe Silesia, but I\u0027m not sure about that). I don\u0027t recall the name of the third companion, but both subsequent volumes will also contain pages of color plates and line art. None of my work is directly inside the books (they wanted to keep a consistent look for the art, so Thomas Marrone (credited in all my videos and renders) did all the line art and color plate art - incidentally, Thomas is also the person who got me interested in KSP), but it *was* used for reference for some of the art, so therefore, I get a short bio and author credit in the book.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you don\u0027t seem to have kept up with the series, you should know that there\u0027s an additional 10\u002B books after \u003Cem\u003EWar of Honor\u003C/em\u003E. Some are mainline books, others are side-novels/trilogy written by David, others are side-novels/trilogy co-written by Weber and Eric Flint, and there\u0027s a Young Adult trilogy co-written by David and Jane Lindskold, not to mention, the series is up to six anthologies of short stories and novellas based in the Honorverse written by David and other authors, including the aforementioned Eric and Jane, as well as John Ringo, Joelle Presby (another BuNine memeber, as well as her husband - both active-duty Navy), Charles Gannon (who currently has a book nominated for a Hugo, I think), and others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, yesterday (5 March), the comic \u003Cem\u003ETales of Honor: On Basilisk Station\u003C/em\u003E issue #1 went on sale. This is a comic published by Top Cow, probably best known for their \u003Cem\u003EWitchblade\u003C/em\u003E comics (which was also made into a live-action TV series, and adapted for a Japanese anime). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe comic is part of a multimedia blitz being conducted by Evergreen Studios (\u003Cem\u003EWalking With Dinosaurs\u003C/em\u003E). There should also be an Android and Ios Honorverse game coming out sometime this year. Evergreen is doing this because they are already doing concept art for an Honor Harrington live-action movie set to come out sometime in 2017. The CEO of Evergreen was already a huge fan of the Honorverse, and the fact that they\u0027re based in Alaska means (hopefully) we won\u0027t see a lot of the typical Hollyweird BS. I believe most of the sets will be CGI, similar to \u003Cem\u003ESky Captain\u003C/em\u003E but not quite to that extent. WWD was critically praised for the CGI work, but slammed for the writing and dialogue, which, to be fair, was forced on them by Fox - there wasn\u0027t supposed to be *any* dialogue in the movie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mentioned all that in conjunction with talking about my stuff because David and BuNine consider what *we* do as \u0022book canon\u0022 and what we will be seeing for the comics and movie as \u0022other canon\u0022. Book canon will be as accurate to the books as we can make it, whereas what\u0027s seen in the comics and movie should be considered canon only for themselves, since adapting to a different medium (writing vs, a visual medium) pretty much requires changes to attract fans and non-fans alike. Basically, you should consider the books and the work B9 does as definitive, and everything else is only an adaptation and may not look at all like what we\u0027ve done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://tales-of-honor.com/honor-harrington\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://tales-of-honor.com/honor-harrington\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s pretty much everything in a nutshell.

I don\u0027t know *how* to do textures. I can\u0027t UV map. I don\u0027t know how to use Paint Shop for much more than adding text to a pic, resizing, and cropping. I\u0027m pretty much self-taught with Blender, so even though I\u0027ve been using it off and on for almost ten years, I still don\u0027t know a lot about it. Online tutorials don\u0027t help much, because no matter how basic they are, I still can\u0027t seem to follow them. There are a few exceptions, though. I have a slight learning disorder that makes it dificult for me to learn something unless I have someone right here next to me to show me what something does or how it works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the lights are individual area lights in each light panel inside the boarding tubes - 16 tubes, 24 light panels per tube = 384 lights. Raytrace transparency for running lights. Individual area lights for each lighting panel inside the boat bays, lighting inside the cutters (can be seen in the back of the aft boat bay), and so on. There\u0027s also a lot of interior detail that just isn\u0027t visible, or finished (which is why I haven\u0027t lit the boat bay galleries yet). As for rendering \u0022only\u0022 at HD, I render at my monitor resolution.

The thing is, Honorverse warships are pretty much the exact opposite of what most people expect from sci-fi ships nowadays - there\u0027s very limited greebling, because it\u0027s stupid to put stuff on the surface of a warship - what you see in my images and videos is what absolutely *has* to be surface mounted. So, overall, the ships are plain and I can get away with just modeling the detail. There\u0027s no paneling to speak of since canon has the ship\u0027s hull/armor \u0022grown\u0022 in place using nanotech, which means it\u0027s all a single piece Basically, the frame and internal equipment is built, then the hull is applied over it, which makes things difficult for major repair/removal/replacement of components too large to fit through cargo doors (this is actually touched on in one of the books when a reactor is found to be faulty during acceptance trials). Also, there\u0027s no real deadline for any of this. I work at my own pace, and it\u0027s good enough for other peeps in BuNine to work from, or to post online when someone has a question. As for the lighting, aside from raytracing the transparent stuff, and shadows from the sun, nothing else is casting shadows. I tried that once and it was a mess. Even my fills (only two) don\u0027t cast shadows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried once to do some texturing and failed miserably at it, so I pretty much decided to not try anymore. If worse comes to worst, I could suggest getting BuNine a texture artist, but TBH, it\u0027s not necessary. These renders and animations aren\u0027t needed for much else other than reference, and I\u0027m not *required* to add as much detail as I have. I do it because I enjoy it. Polycount will be reduced once I freeze the mesh. Because these are still WIPs (and have been for almost three years, with many changes and rebuilds), the mesh is still unfrozen, and I set the smoothing to two iterations. Without smoothing on, the count is roughly 1.2 million or so (that\u0027s counting the pinnace, the two cutters, and the Fearless combined), depending on whether I have unseen stuff activated in layers or not. If I had decided to animate the weapons hatches opening and the energy weapons running out (think Age of Sail ships running out their cannon - missile tubes stay put), the polycount would have probably hit over 10 million. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two months was a nice break from working on the stuff anyway. I\u0027d been going pretty much for the six months prior at almost nothing *but* modeling and rendering stills, so being able to get away from it for a bit was nice. It\u0027s not like I couldn\u0027t play games or do other stuff while it was rendering. I didn\u0027t try Skyrim, because I *knew* that would play havoc with my render times, but I reinstalled MechWarrior 4 and its expansions, Homeworld, and a few other, older games that wouldn\u0027t hog a high overhead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kola2DONO","CreatedById":77488,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T14:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA crapbook air with 4gb of ram.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Madrias","CreatedById":89995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T14:57:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found the biggest disadvantage with what I did when I built my rig is no one tends to believe it.
