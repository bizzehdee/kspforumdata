I know I can always just transfer in remaining life support from a container before staging for re-entry, but it gets annoying having to do this every time and is easy to forget to do so. Is there any way for the mod to deplete the life support storage containers (including the one from Universal Storage) first before depleting the command pods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2)\u003C/strong\u003E I prefer to use real 24-hour time in-game, but the mod treats the warnings and time warp cancellations as if the game was using 6-hour Kerbin time. For example, the Mk1 Pod starts off with 3 units of life support, which equates to 18 hours or 0.75 real days; 0.75 days forces the toolbar icon to be red already and causes the time warp cancellation to be already in affect when I know I have plenty of life support remaining.
