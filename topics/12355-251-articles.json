My job is to setup the missions and the equipment to accomplish the missions and see how it performs; make changes where necessary. Jeb and his cohorts are the pilots and flight engineers and they do the piloting, and crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can do most of the piloting functions required by the game, except for more complex docking (I can do the Apollo style docking with ease; flip 180 and move forward if lined up). MJ offers efficiency and pinpoint accuracy, especially when landing components next to one another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for everyone who has worked on and working on MJ.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T12:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, don\u0027t go there on this thread or I\u0027ll invoque the mods \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlphaAsh : disable them in the toolbar config ?
