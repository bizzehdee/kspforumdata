Rather than re-invent the wheel, I\u0027ve been trying to find a way to take advantage of the R\u0026amp;D screen\u0027s tech tree GUI to draw the block diagrams. However, I have not been able to find any suggestions/recommendations for making use of the tech tree GUI other than ways to add more elements to the existing R\u0026amp;D screen. What I have in mind would be more along the lines of a custom window in the VAB/SPH and the Tracking Station, possibly even in flight, featuring a block diagram with the same or similar styles to the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m quite certain I\u0027m way off base here, just to show that I\u0027ve tried Google: I\u0027ve looked through Anatid\u0027s KSP API Documentation, specifically the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Anatid/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API/blob/master/src/RDArchivesController.cs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERDArchivesController Class\u003C/a\u003E as a means of doing so, but I do not believe this is related to my intent.

From the looks of it, I might have to put in a fair amount of work to implement a block diagram system (which I don\u0027t mind one bit!) if it needs to be built from the ground up. If possible, I\u0027d like to avoid that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my main question is if there is a way to utilize the tech tree GUI for custom graphs/diagrams/etc without having to create it from scratch? I recognize that the current static, unmovable tech tree does not have all the features that I am ultimately hoping for, however if I could access the Objects/Functions necessary to extend its capabilities, I think I\u0027d have a lot easier time with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m quite new to the modding scene with KSP, but I\u0027ve been a web developer for a number of years now and am proficient in C# and Unity.

There seems to have been three main issues: 1) The GUIUtility.ScaleAroundPivot() call was too intense, and throwing everything way off. Instead of calling it, I just used the length between the two vectors and provided that length as the Rect\u0027s width argument in the GUI.DrawTexture() call. 2) The conversion between Rect coordinates and Vector2 coordinates kept conflicting with another. At first I thought only a few calls would work if I treated the first Vector2 (ptA in the code below) as if it were in Rect coordinates, but then I\u0027d get weird offsetting behavior with the drawn line. I finally decided to just try modifying ptA so that every reference to it in the DrawConnection() method received it as though it were in Rect coordinates, and that seemed to do the trick. 3) The angle calculation was \u0022right\u0022, but determining whether the value should be negative would often cause the line to rotate in the opposite direction. At the onset I was not sure whether positive rotations corresponded to clockwise or counterclockwise movement. But it looks like clockwise rotation corresponds to negative angles and counterclockwise rotation corresponds to positive angles\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACwhich is convenient since that\u0027s the mathematical standard I learned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1214.photobucket.com/albums/cc483/kdjohn91/screenCapture3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenCapture3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Epublic static void DrawConnection(Vector2 ptA, Vector2 ptB, Color color, float width)\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E            Color savedColor = GUI.color;\u003Cbr\u003E            GUI.color = color;\u003Cbr\u003E            Matrix4x4 savedMatrix = GUI.matrix;\u003Cbr\u003E            Vector2 rectPtA = new Vector2(ptA.x, Screen.height - ptA.y);\u003Cbr\u003E            float angle = (ptB.y \u0026lt; rectPtA.y) ? -Vector2.Angle(ptB - rectPtA, Vector2.right) : Vector2.Angle(ptB - rectPtA, Vector2.right);\u003Cbr\u003E            GUIUtility.RotateAroundPivot(angle, rectPtA);\u003Cbr\u003E            float mag = (ptB - rectPtA).magnitude;\u003Cbr\u003E            Texture2D lineTex = new Texture2D(1, 1);\u003Cbr\u003E            GUI.DrawTexture(new Rect(ptA.x, rectPtA.y, mag, width), lineTex);\u003Cbr\u003E            GUI.color = savedColor;\u003Cbr\u003E            GUI.matrix = savedMatrix;\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, I\u0027m quite relieved to have overcome what I initially thought was a very minor and simple problem \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E!

By design it\u0027s meant to be used through the Unity tools by creating \u0022proper\u0022 unity prefabs and objects. Doing it through the scripting interface is... ugly to say the least.
