For starter the shape is not exactly the same, the rear fins are at the same height than the actual wings, which is not the case of the real life Su-35, and also the aerobrakes are not placed like the real one, but overall it looks very similar.  \n  \nIt flies extremely well. It is very stable. It reaches Mach 1 (Mach 1 is actually 340 m/s, it goes to a maximum of 334 m/s) under 10,000 meters. It can go faster than that if you go higher although equal performances are not guaranteed and you\u0027re likely to run out of air intake if you go up too fast so it can only ascend gradually.  \n  \nFor any of you interested here is the ship file:  \n  \n[http://www.filedropper.com/ku-35](http://www.filedropper.com/ku-35)"},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T18:11:50Z","Content":"looks amazing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) it looks more like a high altitude fighter than a su-35"},{"CreatedByName":"Lucky90","CreatedById":84549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:01:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E looks amazing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) it looks more like a high altitude fighter than a su-35\n\nWell as I said, it\u0027s **based** on the Su-35 and I followed the schematic as much as I could. But yeah it\u0027s highly maneuverable, but it\u0027s not incredibly fast."},{"CreatedByName":"Carcharoth","CreatedById":108687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:23:29Z","Content":"Keep working, early attempts never resemble real aircraft, but gradually you will have more skill and experience."}]}
