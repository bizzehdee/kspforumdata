I made it to LKO relatively easy but I\u0027m still about 800 delta V short of getting to the Mun... if we add orbital, docking, and departure maneuvers delta V inflates to about 1000 more... but all of it would be OK if KER could calculate it in advance... this way I had to guess so any advices?

My guess is that you have a command pod on the rocket\u00A0set as the root (if you don\u0027t change it with the root tool, the root is whatever part you placed first, usually a command module of some sort). As far as I can tell, KER \u0022follows\u0022 the root part and assumes that you will always be controlling that part (or rather, whatever vessel that part is attached to) through all stages, and calculates dV accordingly. Setting a part on your jumper as the root of the combined vessel should solve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not, a workaround is to build your jumper as a subassembly, and add it\u0027s dV to your launch vehicle with manual addition. It\u0027s a bit of a pain, but at least you won\u0027t need to guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeverEnoughFuel!!","CreatedById":147738,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T23:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I wasn\u0027t clear enough... Mun jumper is not the problem, problem is nuclear thermal rocket nozzle on SSTO... it comes from Interstellar mod (or was it NFT?), and must be attached directly to a reactor to give any thrust... in SPH I get 0 delta V in KER display... it works pretty well... but still swallow nice amount of fuel and its ISP doesn\u0027t\u00A0 look as much... or do I need stronger reactor? \u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/lmz11whon/c0c49653/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://postimg.org/image/lmz11whon/c0c49653/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T23:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKER really can\u0027t cope with this.
