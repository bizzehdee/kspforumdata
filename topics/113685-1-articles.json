Well now there\u0027s a company producing a very high end phone. It\u0027s got plenty of features and a great camera and I recommend you guys check it out here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/saygus-v-squared#/story\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/saygus-v-squared#/story\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think about this? It doesn\u0027t cost much more than a typical flagship smartphone but has a better camera and more storage along with a high capacity battery for it\u0027s size. My phone is in the 5.5 inch range and it doesn\u0027t even have a 3.1Ah battery. This along with the promise of 500gb\u002B cards could mean a lot of change for phones. Any thoughts on this or is it useless to you?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T08:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing for sure: data transfer rate of an SD card will never match an internal storage, and google avoids installing apps to sd card for that reason.

There are much more important factors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first digital camera was a 1,3 Mpx Fuji that made better pictures 15 years ago than a 13 Mpx camera on my new phone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capacity of the battery also says nothing.

Currently phones with similar specs can get by with 2Ah batteries but more power is nice. I see where you\u0027re coming from with the sensor and aperture size though and no specifics have been announced presumably because they haven\u0027t even ordered parts yet. It does seem kind of shady as the same company failed to launch a phone a few years back. The waterproofing is nice but the 801 seems outdated now even though it was fairly new when the phone was first shown off in January. They have working models that do support the dual mSD and fingerprint along with other promised features but nothing much past that. I\u0027m more concerned about what happens after the indiegogo ends. Will they open an online store for the dongle to stream to and extra batteries and such?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T10:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a bit questioning over the 21 MP part, although higher res existed back then (heard nokia\u0027s zeiss breaked 40 MP), even so we are not sure yet whose lenses will be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBattery: my phone (xperia m2 aqua) have 2300 mAh yet it can last for 2 days with intermittent usage (like, uh, reading this forum, or browsing. also chatting).
