I\u0027ve been reading about the curiously designed ISRO vehicles lately, and here\u0027s something that deeply confuse me about the GSLV launchers:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe GSLV is a 4 staged rocket (of a sort). It has 3 stages stacked in tandem and 4 strap-on boosters acting as stage 0. The thing that confuses me a great deal is how the 2 starting stages are arranged. It uses a solid S139 booster as the core which does 4.7 MN with 269s Isp, and the four strap-ons are liquid boosters which does 760 kN each with 262s Isp. So far so good for me, even the usage of a solid as the core is a bit odd, but I totally understand the design choice since it has a higher Isp and is adopted directly from PSLV along with the second stage (which justifies using the S139 as the core stage given that they don\u0027t need to develop a new interface to mate with the second stage.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it is the burn time and staging order that gives me trouble: not only the liquid strap-on boosters DOES NOT separate from the core (still okay for me, the Russian Angara had considered a similar staging choice), it has a whole minute longer burn time than the core. It doesn\u0027t make any sense to me. From my understanding, the last bit of fuel in a stage is the \u0022best\u0022 fuel, since the fuel are only pushing the higher stage and payload, without pushing on a lot of yet unused\u00A0fuel. But for this vehicle, the last 60 second of the boosters\u0027 fuel is literally pushing an empty, heavy solid rocket casing. If one consider the liquid boosters probably have a higher fuel fraction than the solid core, it comes out even worse. An analog that came to my mind is an Ariane 5 that does not throw away the solid booster after they has burnt out...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is, judging from the numbers, it seems to me that it is so OVERWHELMINGLY beneficial to at least jettison at least something for the first stage, even at the cost of complexity and some perhaps costly redesign. In my opinion, at this point the staging has gone\u00A0beyond sub-optimal and entering the realm of counter productivity: the performance that the vehicle will gain from a better staging would be very large and this is exactly what they did for GSLV Mk3. The Mk3 uses a Titan style staging by the way, where strap-on boosters are ignited on the ground, and the core stage is only ignited after the booster separation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it follows that there\u00A0has to be some reason that forced ISRO to opt for such a design. Could any of you friendly folks give me some insight on this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T23:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d have to dig a little to be sure, but I\u0027d guess that the dry mass of the solid booster core is so low, comparatively, that it\u0027s still quite fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T23:45:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe GSLV first stage is the same as the PSLV (S139 solid stage), and their second stage is very similar, both powered by Vikas 4 engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that using this architecture, large boosters were the easiest way to push the design to 2.5t GTO. Being limited in power (India currently only produces Vikas variants in that range of thrust), bigger boosters meant longer burn times. Using proven components meant a cheap launcher and therefore they could allow losing a bit of efficiency by arranging the staging as they did (it\u0027s actually more \u0022not exploiting possible efficiency\u0022 that \u0022losing efficiency\u0022 since the launcher fills its role which is enough).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-01T00:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may not be the most optimal design overall, but it is apparently the most optimal with the components they already have developed and available.
