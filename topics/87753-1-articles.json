Maybe it would encourage earlier exploration if Duna or Eve had launch windows much earlier in the game? As it currently is, the first windows don\u0027t open for more than a hundred days (apart from Moho, but that has huge Delta-V requirements) which is quite a while and a lot of players don\u0027t seem to like to warp time too much. A launch window to another accessible planet in the first thirty days or so might be worth thinking about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T13:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEve has a reasonably good window open in Day 1.

With default difficulty (as you say) one can max out the tech tree without leaving the Kerbin System. As the new player learns how to achieve orbit, then transfer to the Mun, then land on it, and then return, he/she will be likely to keep repeating this process, as it\u0027s what they\u0027re comfortable with. They may eventually branch out to Minmus when they learn about inclination changes, and then rinse and repeat. By the time they\u0027re super comfortable with the Mun and Minmus, it\u0027s highly likely that they\u0027ve maxed the tech tree; but this is where the silly bit comes in.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn awful lot of gamers need the game to tell them what to do, like giving them missions or objectives, or else they get lost and lose interest; gamers that just \u0022Play for fun\u0022 is surprisingly not as common as one would think, most require set progression to guide them forward (think of the shooters, while they may seem repetitive to some, they actually have a quite well designed progression system that keeps the player playing and striving for \u0022that next camo\u0022). The point of this? The tech tree basically is your \u0022game progression\u0022 to a lot of people, once it\u0027s done, the game is done. That\u0027s why I say at least make it so the tech tree \u003Cem\u003Erequires\u003C/em\u003E a player to go to at least Duna to complete it on default difficulty... That will force the average new KSP player to leave the Kerbin System if they want to \u0022complete\u0022 the game, which is likely to make them realise that the extra planets are there, they are a big challenge, but look cool and make them want to go there, as it\u0027s further \u0022progression\u0022 in the game. It\u0027s all about game design!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: So I don\u0027t think it\u0027s about transfer windows, more about the Tech tree and gamer mentality. Change the tech tree on default difficulty to force newbies to go to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-18T13:45:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2014 01:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Random Tank\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
