Its a very hi spec, very high fidelity, ultra-realistic military sim. I dont have to go into too much detail about the game/sim, \u00A0but suffice to say its a mature title at the head of its game, generally for people who know what they are looking for and at least roughly what they are talking about (otherwise it just wouldnt get on your game radar)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you wouldnt think so from the attitude in the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you imply \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eanything \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Eis wrong with the game (like openly wondering if something is a bug or if you just not sure how something works, implying that there might be a bug)\u00A0you will have the developers themselves come along and complain about how its a feature, not a bug. Or how about YOU fix it. Or RTFM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr if you try and give a reasonable bug report, if you dont also include a sentence or two about how how great the devs are, you will get a bunch of stick about how ungrateful you are being.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps you are having difficulty using certain tactics and want some tips? Someone will come along and say you should probably play a different game, this one is not for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the kicker is the devs \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eencourage \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Ethis behaviour. They have said up front that they appreciate people backseat-moderating so that the devs dont have to deal with it. They \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Esupport\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0people being turned away from the game for asking questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I know, you do often get people asking the same stuff over and over again, when the answer is easy to find. Or people being rude and entitled about bugs or the devs or how often it is updated. But that is a constant for every game, and you dont get the same level of contempt, say for example, in this here set of forums.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve literally had the devs themselves write comments on threads just to call me, or others,\u00A0names.
