It was if I had a phantom joystick or seperate SAS mode activated when I didn\u0027t (neither MechJeb or RemoteTech) that kept wanting to induce an extreme left or right roll. Things would be fine if you turn SAS on, but any attempt at a roll command with fine controls enabled issued an immediate reversal of your command as soon as you stopped the roll command and would often go past that, making you only able to roll in one direction.Now normally, this wouldnt be a problem, however with SETI Rebalance and the pretty much universal removal of reaction wheels and needing RCS... this proved to be a major fuel waster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo after being fed up with a glitch in my save that caused Kerbal Alarm Clock to freeze the game at timewarp anytime I was flying a ship (but only at 1000x and above), and my wanting of alarms for Transfer Windows, and being overall fed up with the phantom roll commands, I decided to do a complete new install and downloaded all my mods Via GitHub, KerbalStuff and Curse (where applicable).... I am pleased to report that at least the roll command bug seems squashed (YAY)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, I\u0027m done with CKAN...
