Forgive me if I am resurrecting an idea that has already been discussed, dismissed, or for which a solution already exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like games with logistics management aspects.\u00A0Games where you need to carefully collect or manage resources to unlock new capabilities. The addition of Funds and Science to career mode are a great start but as has been discussed in many forums only really limiting early game. Once I can start science spamming Minmus or leaving probes hanging in orbit to collect those \u0027perform x at y\u0027 contracts I dont have to worry about either again. That makes me sad. And yes I know I could exercise self restraint and just not do those cheaty/spammy things but if that was the way I was going to live Id be 30lbs lighter and not playing games in the first place. Im imagining a solution where those techniques some people call \u0027cheaty\u0027 get turned into actions called \u0027necessary\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience is already covered by tech tree mods and science unlock scaling and I cant think of any better ways to handle that. Im proposing a solution for Funds, a user scalable, periodic funds deduction that is modeled as the operating cost for running a space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I had the knowledge or the skill to make a mod for KSP I would do it like this: (default values or rationalization)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Period fund deduction calculated from factors below\u00A0(monthly)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Cost of KSC buildings and levels (balanced against running out of money after 1 month in the game not doing anything and then scaling by each building level so a maxed out centre costs enough that you have to run a few lucrative contracts per year to maintain)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Cost of kerbals (10% of hiring cost * lv with some additional costs for kerbals on missions)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Cost of active vehicles (10% launch cost with some additional cost for distance from kerbin)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would force me, and other(s)\u00A0who think(s) like me, to not rely on warping for science in the MPL, carefully consider the benefit of leaving probes throughout the system to cash in on random perform x in orbit of y contracts and generally taking mission cost and payback into consideration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am fully aware this may not be everyones cup of tea. I can imagine very few people would enjoy coming back from a 7 year long mission to find out the space centre has been repossessed by KerbBank and turned into a housing complex. But that is the beauty of a mod solution, especially one that is user scalable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour Thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-17T20:12:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2016 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by dilznick5\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jkortech","CreatedById":146934,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-18T21:23:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re working on adding part of this as part of BROKE.
