Well it came, and still no delta V readout. Is there any word from the dev\u0027s as to when they plan on adding this? I mean, I can make an excel spreadsheet that does the equation, and I dont really see how it would be that much harder to add it on console than it was to add it to PC... to be fair, I dont design games and I dont know what challenges it holds, but it is the single most requested feature, it\u0027s kinda silly that they left it out. Anybody else agree, or does anyone know if they are going to add it at all, and if so, when?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-02T03:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad Does not release a roadmap of their plans.\u00A0 We have no idea what they are planning to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsole Versions of KSP are not made by Squad, but by a subcontractor called Blitworks.\u00A0 Squad has to wait for the PC version to be proven stable before they will consider porting it to the consoles.\u00A0\u00A0 Then Blitworks has to port the actual code over to the consoles.\u00A0 Then that has to be proven stable.\u00A0 Some features that are \u0022easy\u0022 to do on a PC are very complicated on a console due to the nature of KSP physics and the graphics centric nature of console games, so those have to be reworked. \u00A0 Once that is done, the game has to go through some certification process for each console they are released on.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 That whole process takes time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat time frame is about a year or so behind PC releases.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
