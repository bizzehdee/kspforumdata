The orbital rendevous of the mission was simple for me, after having some practice at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up docking twice, with a third attempt where I had run out of RCS fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first attempt, was quite successful. I ended up backing a craft up into the other craft, and having the other craft clamp it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QHXyy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QHXyy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second attempt was also successful, but I ended up spending a lot of time on it due to the other craft spinning.
