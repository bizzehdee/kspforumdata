Basically NASA\u0027s supply line and facilities are divided up amongst states as part of pork projects, so it is inherently designed to spend the money it is allocated as inefficiently as possible. Thats why Space X is able to design the Falcon heavy for about 450 million, and NASA has to spend 20 billion to fund the SLS, which is only marginally better-and several years behind in development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven in inflation adjusted dollars the Atlas V only cost 1.9 billion.
