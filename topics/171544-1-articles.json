advantage of messing about with kOS is I can do more or less repeatable actions and log data while I\u0027m doing it.\u00A0 So I thought I\u0027ve have a look at my gravity turns.\u00A0 I usually end up cranking the ship over to something that looks right, and switching \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to stability assist if I think it looks like Prograde is sending it a bit too low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I set up my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E launcher with a payload slightly within its load capacity, went straight up to 50m/s, held a specific deflection until 100m/s\u00A0and then held prograde the rest of the way to orbit, but limiting MaxQ to about 0.25 atmospheres.\u00A0 I then ran it a few times for different deflection angles, and tried limiting the engines a bit to look at the impact of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 So I now have graphs for 3 different initial TWRs, going up pretty much the maximum angle where it could still make orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225oMAVwn.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022415\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5oMAVwn.png?1\u0022

did consider calculating these and logging them but was too keen to get started) as I increased the angle until it reached the point where larger angle become less efficient.\u00A0 I guess you need a much higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to find that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for this\u00A0particular vessel I can determine an optimum starting angle based on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, but I need to do some more experiments to see what impact drag has.\u00A0 My drag calculation to work out (Cd x A)\u00A0seems a little bit flaky at the moment though so I need to figure out whats going on there first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know there\u0027s a few on here who like to do their calculations before launch, have you got any insights on working out optimum gravity turn angles?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime

on all 3 of those lines an extra half a degree meant it didn\u0027t make it to orbit, so the point where drag exceeds gravity losses is somewhere around or beyond the point where it causes you to
