Or, hey why not curse KSP shareables? But specify where with a link (duh!) Also list the mods used. (debris doesn\u0027t count)\n\nI\u0027m doing this because I\u0027m running out of fun things to do in KSP so I figured this would be good. Please be fair \u0026 I hope you enjoy!\n\n(just to keep things diverse, the following mods are allowed: KW, FASA, Hullcam, EVE, Any others you might like)\n\nIf you have questions ask them. It\u0027s a free country. You shouldn\u0027t even bother to read this part.\n\nSAVE FILE Download:\n\n**RULES:**\n\nThis is going to take a lot of cooperation. So follow the rules or don\u0027t play.\n\n**1.** Don\u0027t blow up people\u0027s things as soon as they get into position. You have no friends.\n\n**2.** No crying. Otherwise you are 6.\n\n**3.** No cheats! this allows you to do whatever so none!\n\n**4.** Any obvious! Play fair or die!\n\n**5.** No fly ships that aren\u0027t yours!\n\n**TURNS LIST**\n\n*P.S. If this works I\u0027ll do it again some day!*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T21:44:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 09:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AlextheBodacious**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T00:30:23Z","Content":"I believe there is already a thread for this."},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T01:41:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I believe there is already a thread for this.\n\nYup:/\n\nI still think it should be in challenges or some KSP related category. But nearly 2 years on, I\u0027m pretty much talking to a brick wall.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90278-Naval-Battle-Club/page344](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90278-Naval-Battle-Club/page344)\n\nThe third rotation wasn\u0027t by me as I had attempted to end it due to a lack of purpose but because of that the rules aren\u0027t getting updated. I have a new thread ready, I\u0027m just waiting for it to coast to somewhere above 400 pages. But with macey\u0027s return the primary purpose of the thread is once again here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T01:44:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 01:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Spartwo**"}]}
