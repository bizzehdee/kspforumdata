I have since booted up KSP on my mac to see if it was the same on there but I can still use those saves without issue. I am curious as to whether or not there is a way to recover the planes, rockets, and what not in any way other than loading them onto a thumb drive and and transfer them that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-11-26T03:41:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2021 03:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by barbar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-26T14:43:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Technical Support.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using the same version of KSP that the old machine was running?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"barbar","CreatedById":179623,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-27T01:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth are running the same update\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-27T04:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPost your save somewhere someone can look at it, I\u0027ve got a few ideas about what may be wrong and if I\u0027m right they\u0027re fixable.
