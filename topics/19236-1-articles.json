If this is so, then will the significantly higher gravity on Eve slow EVA operations to a halt? Will it even be possible to get up if a kerbal on EVA falls over?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what about the ladders? Even though a kerbal\u0027s mass hasn\u0027t changed, would the lighter ladder still be able to hold up the weight of one or more kerbals on Eve?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I suppose the question I\u0027m asking is \u0022How you intend to get around the high gravity during Eve EVA ops?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor, since I know there are rover mods, \u0022How do you intend to get around the high gravity with only stock parts?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientAstronaut","CreatedById":36093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T20:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can make stock rovers, but either way, I will likely be using rovers. Eve is not one of my target objectives for .17, so it\u0027s just going to be a little side travel for me someday. Even if I decide to make a landing on it, my plan is to just use a rover or walk around a few meters.
