The second bullet point to me seems to imply I target a group and it chooses available relays from that, so I could target all my GEO sats from one probe instead of having to settle with just one. This sounds like a very nice addition since my main issue with the current system is that if the targeted relay is obstructed by Kerbin or whatever else, the probe will lose connection with no way of changing it. It would be nice to have a fallback relay, if KEO 1 above KSC is out of sight, target KEO 4 behind it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever use the cone ?

The file has 2 identical craft, one where I changed the control point to the side docking port, and back to the probe core, the other was never changed (and works). I tried comparing the numbers in the save file, but wasn\u0027t sure what to look for. I was hoping to find something specifying the control point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to try launching a probe core with a single docking port, and hacking gravity, then checking before and after swapping control points in various save files (initial launch, switch control point, switch control point back).
