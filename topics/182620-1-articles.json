The odds of more bodies being added even to the stock solar system are slim (not everyone wants them, and there are myriad excellent mods which fill the need for more planets). Extrasolar bodies are not on most people must have lists, and even then, mods exist to fill this need. Not to mention that it would be very difficult to reach other solar systems with the stock propulsion technologies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-05T18:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159377-ozymandias_the_goat/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022159377\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159377-ozymandias_the_goat/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Ozymandias_the_Goat\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0- IIRC most players never even leave the Kerbin local moons and go interplanetary.
