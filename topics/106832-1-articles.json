I noticed the issue in a rather intuitive craft, so it was easy to experiment and recreated the steps leading to the bug. This, or at least the symptoms, are a frustrating isse, which has, including many earlier versions, destroyed some ships i spend up to an hour building without saving. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost ships with these earlier issues included symmetrically placed parts and struts, so I assume the problems is based on a similar behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Version\u003C/strong\u003E: v1.0.2.842 Windows 64-bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBug, or similar symptoms, were found in versions reaching at least as as far as 0.23, probably older. As for my PC, that was before a hardware wipe.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods / Add-Ons\u003C/strong\u003E: All Stock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESteps to Replicate\u003C/strong\u003E: I picked parts unrelated to the craft I identified the original issue, and all parts can be interchanged. For simplicity, I restrict myself to a Modular Girder Segment XL and struts (not that it got simpler with all the girders, so I numbered them). This works in a new vanilla save, issue occurs regardless of gamemode:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Go into VAB, I used radial angle snap in all cases (not sure if matters). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use a Modular Girder Segment XL (1) as central core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Radially place another single Girder XL (2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Now radially place two Girder XLs on Girder XL (2) using radial simmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Do the same with two struts, connecting Girder XL (2) with it\u0027s radial Girders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Now pick up and place Girder XL (2) back to Girder XL (1), this time in symmetry. Sometimes 2-times symmetry does not creat the bug, higher symmetry counts are more reliable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe debug log shows a \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003ENullReferenceException\u003C/span\u003E when it is reproduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: This can be done with placing a single girder and strut in step 4 and 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Happens\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the bugged part can\u0027t be placed. Putting the greyed out part besides the craft starts their obvious bugged behaviour: These parts can be clicked, but will move the whole ship, so there is no way to remove them. Parts can be placed on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the simplest version, issues increase when complexity of the situation increase. E.g. instead stacking another Girder XL on the central and reproducing the bug on it instead of the core piece allows you to remove it, including the bugged parts, but sometimes leave their nodes remaining in the VAB, even when starting a new vessel. At times you\u0027ll get an infinite spam of null reference exceptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther situations result in actually parts placed where you wanted them, additional to the ghost parts, but often in a variety of bugged states. In some cases this can lead to all buttons in the VAB not reacting anymore, requiring quitting the game via task manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Notes/Pictures/Log Files:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture link (three pics\u002Bdescription, album doesn\u0027t for for me):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ML6YRJ1,b5q5KLw,VCPFajR#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/ML6YRJ1,b5q5KLw,VCPFajR#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T11:06:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 11:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
