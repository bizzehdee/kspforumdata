Having two Irons and two (working) Sulphurs in the system for their crews to use would help alleviate some of the stress. Plus it would allow them to make regular runs to The M\u00FCn and possibly Minmus. They still needed to get some more fuel in orbit, but for now they could make do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were a few changes in this new Iron, made primarily to the relay antenna and the launch fairing. No one was quite certain how the fairing of the previous Iron had ripped the antenna off, so they made its new placement rather conservative and increased the width of the fairing at the same time. (And they crossed their fingers.) The only other changes were minor tweaks to the placement of smaller, less important parts.

Any stable orbit would do. Once there, the Fe-2 would await the second piece, the craft that would accompany it to The M\u00FCn. The guidance software that launched this Iron was perhaps more accustomed to \u0022rockety\u0022 rockets, and burned the shuttle into a slightly higher than expected orbit. It continued burning until the craft\u0027s periapsis was above the atmosphere, and then shut down, entering into its quiet slumber.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0169_fe2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0169_fe2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that, the Iron 2 was safe and sound in its rather temporary 70km by 120km parking orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EManganese M\u00FCn\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext up was the Manganese Module bound for Pequoni Research Station at the M\u00FCn. While the module itself was identical to the previous Manganese, its destination necessitated a much larger launch vehicle. Something the LV-10 was not even remotely capable of lofting into orbit. Thus was born the LV-11 Nocturne. A rather simple rocket, the LV-11 used two of the KS-25 Vector engines to power its way into space. One Vector was capable of lifting a Titanium and its tank, so two should be more than capable of pushing a skyscraper full of fuel and experiments to The M\u00FCn, right?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170122_ksp0389_mn3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170122_ksp0389_mn3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170122_ksp0395_mn3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170122_ksp0395_mn3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course they were.

The Iron 2 sailed overhead just as the first stage burned out and the second stage\u0027s Skipper took over. The second stage placed the craft almost into orbit, requiring only the shortest of burns from the Manganese\u0027s wet workshop styled propulsion stage to finish the ascent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the Manganese 3 was in orbit, the Iron 2 was a mere 22 kilometers ahead of it, an easy distance to clear. The ground controllers had the flight computer pull back from the craft\u0027s original apoapsis to allow the station to catch up with the Iron 2, set up the rendezvous, and then wandered off to the snack table.

In the dark, as is only right and proper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat munar trip began some half orbit after the docking. The controllers transferred all of the fuel from the Iron into the Manganese\u0027s propulsion module (it would need it), calculated the burn so that the Manganese could rendezvous with Pequoni Station. A long, seven minute burn that would use up almost all of the two ship\u0027s combined fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe burn went exactly according to plan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170122_ksp0420_mn3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170122_ksp0420_mn3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the Mn-3/Fe-2 would need most of its fuel to complete the transfer and rendezvous, the space program would need to send more fuel and soon.

He let the aircraft roll towards them, bumping and shaking across the imperfect terrain. Once close enough the figures were easy to see: Kirny, a monk of the same order as Munlin and Archibald; Gene, his fair hair bright in the morning sun; and Wernher, glasses and all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had been years, decades even, since he had last seen Kirny. He wasn\u0027t the most talkative chap, and spent most of his days on a different continent that Jonbald. From the looks of things he was now the Abbot of Sky\u0027s Reach, wearing the customary Abbot\u0027s poncho. Quite the promotion from the once silent librarian.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0154_co2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0154_co2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0470_co2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022591\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0470_co2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kirny.

Though we do wish you were visiting under better circumstances.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Better circumstances? Curious. I\u0027m not sure things could be any better.\u0022 He smiled and turned to face the others. \u0022And who do we have here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah, yes. Our guests. May I present Gene Kerman, a recent graduate with a specialization in aerospace engineering.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Engineering?\u0022 Jonbald smiled at Gene and shook his hand. \u0022Interesting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes sir, that\u0027s why I stuck around.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And here, we have Wernher von Kerman the Thirtieth, a recognized expert in rocketry, and something of a celebrity in the Westlands.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher smiled and extended his hand to meet Jonbald\u0027s. \u0022Ja, liquid rockets specifically. Getting them to fly und nicht go, uhm, Boom. Ja?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald chuckled. \u0022One should hope. Very well, gentlekerbs, we have an offer to discuss. If you would be so kind as to join me in my aircraft....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With all due respect, sir, we were both dragged here somewhat against our will. Our hosts have been kind, gracious even, but so far not a word as to why we were pulled from our homes, our lives, and brought here. So before I climb into another metal deathtrap, I think we deserve to know what this is all about. Sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Very well Gene, you do have a point.\u0022 Jonbald\u0027s smile went crooked for a moment. It was rare for someone to catch him off guard, though he should have expected such directness from one of the Genes. \u0022Tell me, did you ever look up at the stars? Wonder if you could reach up and touch them? Perhaps pluck the moons from their appointed rounds?\u0022 They both smiled and nodded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course you did, you\u0027re kerbals. What if I told you it was possible? That we can go\u0022 Jonbald waved his arm skyward \u0022up there and change the very shape of the heavens? It\u0027s true, I promise you. Kerbals can go to space. Kerbals will go to space. And I\u0027m here to offer it to you. Space. All of it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So tell me, how would you like to be astronauts?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Award\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Manganese module arrived at The M\u00FCn shortly after Jonbald left for Sky\u0027s Reach.

If everything went according to plan this would be her last shift as Flight Director. It was a tough job, scheduling everything, shepherding her flock, but a rewarding one. It was different than being the chief, the big boss, calling the shots here in the trenches. Much faster paced. As an administrator she had time to think over decisions. Here? Here you lived by instinct and muscle memory.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you had to work to keep your instincts right.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tanks on the Manganese 3 were running more than a bit dry as it completed the final rendezvous burn. Following that the flight computer was switched off and control of the new module and the Iron shuttle were handed over to the remote operators at Pequoni 2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170122_ksp0432_mn3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022526\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170122_ksp0432_mn3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first order of business was to separate the Iron from the Manganese. While they could attach the ship to the station as it was assembled, doing so would force them to juggle ships when they needed the Iron. More work now meant less work later, so they just bit down and pushed through.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce free, the Iron was allowed to drift. They moved the Manganese module around, twisting, tumbling, lining it up for its final docking. There was only one node that made any sense, at the zenith of the station, above the solar arrays. This would place the new MOLE lab directly opposite the existing lab, proximity future scientists would hopefully appreciate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170122_ksp0438_mn3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022555\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170122_ksp0438_mn3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170122_ksp0444_mn3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170122_ksp0444_mn3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that done, the Iron 2 was moved in to dock at the end of one of the Sulphur shuttles. Unlikely they\u0027d need to use the older Sulphur again;\u00A0in lieu of a space garage making it a more permanent\u00A0part of the station was the only option.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170122_ksp0448_mn3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170122_ksp0448_mn3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew wasted no time in unpacking the new kit. Elkin in particular was quite eager to dig into the new science experiments. Not the cryogenic one or the power tools, mind you, but the important one. The big one. Making ice cream in orbit. Sure, he\u0027d get around to those other experiments sooner or later, but Ice Cream? They\u0027d gone YEARS without that most important of snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170122_ksp0467_mn3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170122_ksp0467_mn3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the flight operations crews back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E were slowly trickling out of Mission Control on their way to the snack room. Nothing special for this, since all they\u0027d really done today was baby-sit a computer, but snacks were snacks. (And the endless talk from Elkin about ice cream this and ice cream that had made most of them a bit hungry.)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Boss was just wrapping up her duties when Orsby, the World\u0027s First Representative, burst through the door. As usual he had a stack of plaques and checks in hand. A larger stack than usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let me guess? The recent accomplishments of our space program have attracted contributions from numerous organizations, and we have started constructing our first station at The M\u00FCn. Right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No ma\u0027am. We delivered that one some time back. I\u0027m here today to recognize the recent accomplishments of your space program. You have attracted the attention of numerous organizations, and we would like to reward you for these feats.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, okay. So if it\u0027s not The M\u00FCn, then what have we done this time? First ice cream in orbit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wrong agin. I\u0027m here to recognize the following: First craft to escape the orbit of Laythe. First fly by of Vall. First docking at...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRosuki grabbed the plaques from Orsby. Fourteen of them, and almost all of them for.... No, it couldn\u0027t be.

Commencement of construction of the first station at Vall. First EVA at Vall. First entry into suborbital spaceflight at Vall. And finally, first landing at Vall. Among a few others.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo they had made it. Macfred and his crew _had_ survived. All these years and finally, proof. Proof. Except... Why hadn\u0027t the crew contacted her? Or anyone? Had they landed on Laythe yet? Yes, of course they had. They had to if they wanted to use the lander on Vall. Were they all ok? What sights had they seen? Oh, she couldn\u0027t wait to call them up, to congratulate them, to beg them for stories. For answers. Her mind raced. At first she was relieved, but that fleeting moment brought by this nugget of truth was short lived, replaced by confusion and questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne question in particular.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They climb into a rocket, strap into the seat, and wait until the screaming stops. I thought every kerbal understood the basics of....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, no, no, no, I understand how kerbals get to space. How do you know this? How do you know my crew landed on Vall?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe smiled. \u0022We have our ways.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So I hear. How? How do you know they landed at Vall if they\u0027re not on the network?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who said they\u0027re not on the network?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe met Orsby\u0027s dumb smile with a blank stare. Instinctively she reached down to her console, pushed a few buttons, and brought the map up on the Big Board. \u0022There.\u0022 She zoomed in to Jool, shifted the view between Laythe and Vall. \u0022No contacts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Perhaps you should discuss this matter with Jonbald. I apologize, but there are other matters I must attend to. We do hope you enjoy the awards we\u0027ve presented today, and look forward to the continued successes of your space program. Orsby smiled, a smile that was somehow deeper than his usual one, bowed, and then slipped out of sight before Rosuki could respond. Typical.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt still didn\u0027t answer the question. How did they know? The ship had to be on the network. Some network. Could Sieta\u0027s old satellites could pick them up? Why weren\u0027t they relaying data back to the space center? Was it being filtered? She had been there the day Jonbald brought the network back online, in the tracking center, and she didn\u0027t remember him doing anything special. Although, now that she thought about it he had been working on the dishes long before she arrived. At least the first time. The second time she had just let him work his magic all on his own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe tried to call Jonbald on the radio. No answer. A quick check with the air traffic controllers in the tower revealed he had called in a deviation to his flight plan. Seems he needed to pick something up from his old base at the North Pole and would be out of communication range for the next several hours. What convenient timing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so she\u0027d have to get her own answers, find her crew without Jonbald\u0027s help. And there was only one way to do that: look at the raw data from the dishes. She was across the space center and through the doors of the tracking station in record time. It was quiet in there, as always, just the whirring of fans and the gurgling of the fish bowl in the corner. Aside form the goldfish the only other living creature present was the radio operator, a new kerbal by the name of Hercas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Rosuki burst through the door Hercas was \u0022busy\u0022 putting a golf ball around the floor. He quickly hid the club, kicked his overturned cup out of the middle of the floor, and nearly slipped and fell on the golf ball when he saw that The Boss was in the room. He was probably hoping his slacking had gone unnoticed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes! Hello! Uh.... Good to see you here! Wasn\u0027t expecting visitors, to be honest.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I need you to check something for me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, uh, ok.\u0022 He balanced his putter in the corner and sat down in his chair. \u0022What can I help you with?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re missing some spacecraft. We know they\u0027re there, but they don\u0027t show up on the map and they\u0027re not on the network. I want to check if the system is broken or if there\u0027s something blocking them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t need to check. They\u0027re being filtered out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Explain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, early on we were seeing false contacts. Noise. Lot of noise, asteroids mostly, with an occasional fast burst and whatnot. All of the noise was making it difficult for you folks to work with the new launches, so Jonbald had us install this device.\u0022 He pointed to a nondescript black box perched atop his terminal. Three wires ran into it, one for each of the dishes, one wire ran into the system. \u0022Every now and then he gives us an update for it, so we crack it open and move some pieces around.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So it hides contacts?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes ma\u0027am.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What would happen if we disconnect it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ll start to see ghosts again, and the background noise will go up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHercas turned the system off and stood up. He fumbled around in a drawer for a moment to find some connectors and a splitter. Solution in hand he twisted the cables loose of the filter box, attached them to the splitter, and then sat back down. He looked back at Rosuki for a moment, hand dangling from the system\u0027s main switch. She nodded, he grimaced, and then pushed the switch back up. The lights in the room flickered, the system whirred back to life, and the map view appeared on Hercas\u0027 monitor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA green line flickered to life, a line connecting their position on Kerbin with the Neon satellite in keostationary orbit far overhead. Soon another line joined the first, then two more, then many, many more. Soon the sky was full of lines; green ones, red ones, blue ones. All the colors. Soon The M\u00FCn was enveloped, followed by Minmus.\u00A0Even the other four moons and that Milbas thing.\u00A0She reached over Hercas\u0027 shoulder and pulled the map view out to the system level.

Scandium. Calcium. Potassium. All the elements.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there it was, orbiting Laythe. The Jumble of Parts. The quick burst of telemetry data they received from it showed no kerbals on board. Data, though. Lots and lots of science data. Samples from Laythe; its atmosphere, its oceans, its sands. Rosuki\u0027s hands shot up and she cheered, years of worry dropped away in an instant. She grabbed Hercas\u0027 hands and danced around the room, the radio operator visibly shocked by her sudden exuberant burst. Realizing the awkwardness she stopped, turned back to the console and started searching again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, now we need to find our lost kerbals.\u0022 They had to be somewhere. Vall, obviously, but near as she could tell they just weren\u0027t on the network. Hopefully that meant they were in a secluded spot on the surface, temporarily out of range of the short-range communications relays orbiting the cold moon. The Jumble was still connected though, and they would undoubtedly check in with it again before leaving the system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the only option was the leave a message. What do you say to a crew that\u0027s been gone for so many years, cut off from everyone at Kerbin? Was it their fault? Her fault? Was there any point in assigning blame now? No, best to just go about things as usual, follow the procedures. She set up the console, pulled the microphone towards her, and hit the transmit button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbin calling Jumble of Parts. We show you on the network, reading your telemetry five by five. Please respond, same frequency. Message repeats. Kerbin calling Jumble of Parts....\u0022 She repeated her message again, resisting the urge to include a long \u0027welcome back\u0027 message. It was hard to say what shape they were in, or if they were all still alive. Anything could have gone wrong, best not to make assumptions. She repeated her simple message a third time, dropped in that most final of \u0022Over\u0022s and released the transmission key. All they could do now was wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd wait they did. Several minutes later a light blinked. A return receipt from the Jumble of Parts, and automated response to indicate it had received a transmission. Good. Soon the message indicator would start propagating through their ships, hopefully reaching the waiting eye of one of the crew. Hercas wheeled back to his station, nudging Rosuki out of the way. He flipped a few switches, reset a few knobs, then turned to face her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now? Now we wait.\u0022 She wondered how long it would take. Not long, surely. Macfred had always been punctual about his checkins, something engrained into him as a young radio operator. She looked at the radio operator. This kid could be the next Macfred, if she wanted it. Strap him in a capsule and send him to orbit. They needed more astronauts, new astronauts, so why not? She didn\u0027t even need to run it past the Council first. This was still her space program, not the Council\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer mind drifted back to The Council. To Jonbald. What was he up to? She glanced at the filter box, now sitting unoccupied atop the console. Filtering had been Jonbald\u0027s job in the past. Filtering and programing and running reports on his fellow kerbals. Why was he still doing it? This was supposed to be an open space program, no secrets. So what was this business they\u0027d just stumbled into?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Jonbald.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radiokerb looked up, confused. \u0022Ma\u0027am?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jonbald.

Rather similar to what they\u0027d been doing for at least four decades now. A proven plan. Just with a small twist or two at the start. A little something he\u0027d learned from one of the Bobs.

I\u0027ve been battling allergies, colds, and a flu or three since late last year. The schizo Houston weather hasn\u0027t helped. Worse: sometime in January something screwed up my eyes; either a virus, trauma, or just severe old age (38...... I\u0027m already 8 years past mandatory\u00A0retirement age).

The crew of the Jumble was busy preparing to leave for Vall, trading their stories of Laythe for supplies and fuel. Meanwhile Val, Jeb and their crews were debating a return to Kerbin. Bob had discovered some new state of matter and some new property of the universe while experimenting with a sliver of Exorem, and he needed Kerbin to test his results at scale. Their debate was to stay or to go, and was reaching comical levels of inanity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yet those two events were nothing compared to the real source of chaos. Something was troubling The Forgotten, and all morning Thomlock had seen them hustling about, heard them grumbling on their radios, and generally witnessed them being busier than bees. Their conversations were impossible to follow one-side at a time, so Thomlock grabbed Burvin and pried loose some details.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Our ship at Dres missed its check-in again. Crew of asteroid miners, should be filling the last of our Kerbin-bound tankers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You guys run blind, though, right? Sometimes go munths or years without contact?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurvin nodded. \u0022It\u0027s not uncommon for a crew to miss one or two windows, but these guys have been silent for too long now. We\u0027re more than a bit worried. Not that there\u0027s a thing we can do about it; a direct transfer to Dres isn\u0027t possible for another eight years, and we\u0027d get there twelve or thirteen years from now. If something\u0027s wrong, then something\u0027s wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And of course we\u0027re trying to see you folks off, and helping as much as we can. Meanwhile the Legend himself, Maclie Kerman, is bringing the Jool Jester in to dock, arriving some time after you guys leave. \u00A0He\u0027s almost as much flight time as you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And he was awake for most of it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey both chuckled; Thomlock still gave him a dirty look.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s got a mostly-full tanker with him. Maclie and his crew have been out in an eccentric orbit, slowly using Tylo and the moons for gravity captures. They arrived at Jool about the same time as you, but we need the fuel.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Going back to Kerbin. Or Dres. That\u0027s the real debate this morning. We could use the fuel to drop down to Kerbin right now, or we could drop even further and set up a Dres transfer. Very expensive, and if the refinery at Dres isn\u0027t working, we\u0027d be stuck there. As you know there aren\u0027t many of us left, and we keep losing agents at Kerbin. Some time back the order was given to regroup at the M\u00FCn, to vote on a new course of action. Some of us are concerned that if we rendezvous at the M\u00FCn we may not have enough fuel to send a ship to Dres.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Besides, we kerbals tend to go a bit weird when away from home for so long. You should know that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe smiled at that. \u0022You implying something there kid?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe. Anyway, the Jester holds eight to eleven, and we were planning to hitch Val\u0027s Lakewethingy ship to it. That\u0027ll give us twenty two seats, more than enough for the eight of them and eight of us. And there\u0027s another point of debate - do we allow you four to tag along with us? It\u0027s always better to travel in larger numbers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm. We\u0027ll see. I\u0027ll have to talk it over with the crew first, but I wouldn\u0027t mind having a bit more legroom. It\u0027s no fun to be crammed into something the size of the Sulphur for several years. When are you kids looking to shove off?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not sure yet. Another hundred, hundred fifty days, maybe. The longer we wait the quicker we get there, thanks to some weird physics. The Jester has enough oomph for us to go almost anywhere. Big sucker, designed as a tug. Big ugly tug. Let us know what you decide. If you\u0027d prefer wait you\u0027re welcome to what fuel and food we don\u0027t need. And to the station, of course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, thanks. We\u0027ll see. Good talking with you kid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Same. Have fun on Vall.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock finished up his morning routine and made his way back to the Sulphur. It was the last time he was likely to have a good cup of koffee for several munths, and in something approaching full gravity at that. He was just placing the mug into the mess hall\u0027s sink when Agake walked past, arms full of science equipment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is the last of it. Macfred says there\u0027s no rush, but we\u0027re all packed up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fine, fine.\u0022 He motioned towards the door. \u0022Lead the way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey made their way to the first ladder, just outside of the mess. Agake handed half of her gear to Thomlock and started climbing. Up, up and away. Away from the welcoming centripetal force and into the spinning nothingness of microgravity. The koffee was sloshing around weirdly in his stomach by the time they reached the station\u0027s core, and he started to question his breakfast choices. Macfred drifted out from their ship to greet them, and Thomlock could only answer with a burp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly afterwards they were free of the Infinity, and drifting back towards their jumbled mess of a station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0209_sulphur.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022586\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0209_sulphur.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0211_sulphur.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022625\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0211_sulphur.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting back to the Jumble was not straight-forward but not too costly. They kicked the Sulphur 5 into a higher orbit, made the needed plane change, and then dropped back down to rendezvous with the station. Aside from some of the smaller antennas having shut themselves off it was in exactly the same condition as when they left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0227_sulphur.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0227_sulphur.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlextrix brought the ship in slowly and docked opposite the Sulphur 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a fair bit to take care of at the Jumble of Parts. Most of the work was internal, shuffling science data around, making sure they had what they would need for the Vall landing, but there were a few external tasks to attend to as well. After some discussion it was agreed they would take the second Sulphur with them, using it as a tug to raise / lower orbit at Vall. This would be needed to conserve fuel for the landing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a small amount of juggling the Sulphur 3 was docked up behind the Sulphur 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0238_sulphur.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0238_sulphur.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext there was a bit of housekeeping to attend to. There was no reason to drag all of the extra RTGs out to Vall, so Macfred went EVA and started extracting them from the hull. This was a slow process, as for some reason he could only carry three at a time, but he had them all mounted on the station before the Jumble slipped into Laythe\u0027s shadow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0239_sulphur.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022587\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0239_sulphur.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock cornered him as he was coming back into the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok kid, so what\u0027s your take on these Forgotten kerbs?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They seem genuine enough.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm. They don\u0027t come across as a bit strange? \u0027Let\u0027s all go live in space like a big happy family\u0027 type of strange?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No stranger than you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good point.\u0022 He helped Macfred store his helmet before continuing. \u0022It just seems so fake to me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How so?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look at it. Free fuel, free ships, free parts. From where? They exist outside of Kerbin\u0027s support. Outside of anyone\u0027s control. And they can\u0027t even explain how. None of them even know where that station came from. \u0027It was here when we got here\u0027 and so forth. Ok, but how did it get _here_? No answer. Instead they\u0027re all worried about black holes and other impossible to measure things when they\u0027re sitting in a giant piece of magic.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And that\u0027s not the end of it. did you hear there\u0027s another ship of them coming in? The Jool Jester?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maclie\u0027s ship? The first ship to visit Jool?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022One and the same. Seems he\u0027s been here in the system for almost a year now, just lurking around, waiting on us to make a move. They\u0027ve got a ship missing at Dres, and a ship that could supposedly go rescue them, but instead they\u0027re just milling about here, waiting for us. I don\u0027t like it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You don\u0027t like much.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, that\u0027s not true. Anyway, the whole lot of them are going back to Kerbin and have invited us to tag along. Wanted me to pass the word on to the crew. We could dock one of the Sulphurs up with their ship, hitch a ride back to Kerbin, just how up like lost heroes walking out of the shadows. Or something. Seems fishy, and after that Hallock kid, I\u0027m not sure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Think Jeb\u0027s in on it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomlock shook his head. \u0022I\u0027m not even sure there _is_ an \u0027it\u0027, but I doubt it. Jeb just seems to be along for the trip. I figure he just wants to go home, like the rest of us. Either way it\u0027s an offer. It\u0027d be more comfortable than strapping ourselves to one of the Potassiums and riding back in this dump.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022True, but we\u0027ll worry about that later. Right now we need to get to Vall.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey finished stashing the EVA suit into the airlock and made their way back to the Sulphur. Once everything was squared away they undocked, pushed both Sulphurs back form the station, and moved a safe distance away before bringing the main engines online.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey had one stop to make before heading to Vall:\u00A0the two Potassium tugs. The sooner they burned for them the better. The two Ks were in basically the same orbit as the Jumble, but had fallen behind them slightly. And so their first burn was to climb into a high enough orbit that the Potassiums would catch up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0243_sulphur.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0243_sulphur.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220170102_ksp0249_sulphur.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022589\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20170102_ksp0249_sulphur.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne orbit later and there they were. They left just as they slipped into Kerbin\u0027s terminator, and so they arrived just the same. The initial rendezvous was in the light, the final docking was in the dark. This was just a welfare check on the two big tugs, making sure they were both still fully intact and were still powered up. At some point in the last several munths both of the large tugs had shut off their communications, so Macfred was a bit concerned. As it turned out whatever glitch had affected the Jumble of Parts also hit the Potassiums, their antennas now retracted and disabled.
