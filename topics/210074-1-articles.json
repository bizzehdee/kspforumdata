Its a trickier problem than it seems on the surface though because it means players would also need to design interior continuity into their vessels. You couldn\u2019t for instance put a 1.25m battery or probe core between two inhabitable spaces because you couldn\u2019t move through them. Its also difficult to do things like radially attached crew tubes at any angle. Its a subtle thing but it greatly reduces your design options. We\u2019ll just have to see if the devs think that\u2019s worth exploring.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rutabaga22","CreatedById":221143,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-11T23:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224184719\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210074\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221665529317\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou couldn\u2019t for instance put a 1.25m battery or probe core between two inhabitable spaces because you couldn\u2019t move through them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would be a pretty easy thing to fix.
