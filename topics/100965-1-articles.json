So... I have had little inspiration with KSP, but I sat down and decided to try to make a plane. Holy Krap. This has to be one of the best crafts I have ever made. I proudly present...\n\nThe Faelchra Mk I:\n\n![eJNcB3I.png](http://i.imgur.com/eJNcB3I.png)\n\nIt is an air breathing high altitude plane that uses an inline cockpit. It can take off at speeds of 50 m/s or above, at 5,000 meters it can fly at a constant speed of 300 m/s. When approaching higher altitudes it can fly faster, with 10,000 meters it can fly up to 500 m/s.\n\n![TH2hZHA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TH2hZHA.jpg)\n\n![AXrbiIh.png](http://i.imgur.com/AXrbiIh.png)\n\nIt has a great reaction with a balance amount of fuel throughout the entire vehicle. Compared to my previous craft, the [Vallum Aero-Wind](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99665-Vallum-Aero-Wind-%28Low-part-count-fast-and-easy-to-fly!%29) (Shamless Plug) It is just about the same size, but can travel more efficiently, land better, and is centralized around the cockpit, giving more protection to the crew. It has a better turning circle, faster speed, and higher air intake. \n\n![ZG1a9aw.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZG1a9aw.png)\n\n![hoNtbwE.png](http://i.imgur.com/hoNtbwE.png)\n\nI hope you all like this craft as much as I did, if you have any comments, suggestions, or criticism, PLEASE put it down below!
