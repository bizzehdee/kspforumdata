So here it goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice to have some sort of configuration that certain dish will target the nearest available dish with active connection to the mission control, and in some sort, that satelite would point a dish back, making it an active connection, so we don\u0027t have to switch vessels, assuming, that some of us are planing to have more than twenty, thirty, forty satelites in orbit, also a bit lazy just to go onto them, and target them to a certain satelite, later and thanks for reaing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gornakosh","CreatedById":58121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T22:44:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow THAT was fast, thanks a lot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw am i the only one who gets his geostationary orbits messed up by the game? I got 3 Geostationaries around Kerbin, they were almost perfectly distributed around the planet and were only off between each other for like 5 seconds per orbit. But on a reload suddenly one of the three got moved close to another one and now i got a good part not covered anymore and need to launch a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
