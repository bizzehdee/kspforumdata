The way you could get to other stars would be if you can coat your rocket in a heat resistant material you could get very close to kerbal. If you can do this right you can adjust your orbit to slingshot out of the kerbol system by getting really close to kerbol you can pick up a lot of speed. This method is impractical with our solar system since the sun is too hot and too big however since kerbol is 113 times smaller than the sun and a very dim star it is possible to do this you could get to a very high speed and since space has no friction there is nothing to slow you down the only thing to slow you down would be kerbols gravitational pull into which can be countered by burning away from the sun and using the gravitational pull of moho. you could also get a boost from jool to get to an even higher speed. This would be a long and complicated way to get to the stars but a very practical way you could get to a significant fraction of the speed of light and does not use hyper drives and other unproven wormhole method imagining that kerbol is pretty close to the centre of the galaxy stars would be 1-2 light years away from each other making your journey to the stars a quick and easy journey.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arbolus","CreatedById":74833,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T16:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat could get you \u003Cem\u003Emaybe\u003C/em\u003E to 0.1% of the speed of light if you\u0027re using liquid fuel rockets. Gravity assists are useful but not as effective as you seem to think they are - Voyager 1 slingshotted around Jupiter and Saturn and it\u0027s still taken nearly 30 years just to get to the edge of the Solar System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, you could wait a hundred years for everything to be aligned in the right way, and then spend another thousand years on the journey, but by the time you got there you\u0027d find you\u0027d been overtaken by a faster means of propulsion that wasn\u0027t invented when you set off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T19:15:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting to other stars is a rather irrelevant topic when there are no other stars to visit and no plans to implement them exist either.
