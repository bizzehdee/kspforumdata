I miss the tourist missions, and the base/station building ones from ksp 1, especially when it would have you come back to add modules to the station after a while. Designing unique crafts that I wouldn\u2019t otherwise build is one of my favourite parts of science mode, I hope we get more opportunities to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-09T07:16:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2024 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 9\u0022\u003EJanuary 9\u003C/time\u003E by Suppise\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMerging part of this post as a reply to another of a similar topic\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pg17","CreatedById":232200,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-14T20:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I don\u0027t miss the procedural missions as much as I thought I would, I will say that those missions added to the money constraints was the only incentive I had to try to create \u0022industrial lines\u0022 of spacecraft that would be the most DeltaV efficient and cost effective for specific kind of roles.

In KSP1 I had rockets build for different kinds of payloads and some standard missions. Now I just build very inefficient crafts. I do however think this will change with resource gathering and colonies. You are limited by what is available at the colony and shipping stuff to colonies will take time and can probably only be done during certain launch windows.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EA career game mode could be very cool in terms of gameplay.
