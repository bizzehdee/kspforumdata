Any amateur from there can easily run the game on its own without the need for going through Steam, and Valve knows that. It is only when you haven\\\u0027t downloaded the game you paid for yet the first time can you use it to trade for another game or gift it to another person. It\\\u0027s possible for Valve to actually put in more control to enforce using Steam, but that is more restriction than what Valve wants to implement. For one, it would probably require an always-online element, and another could create difficulties in multiplayer content between PC and Mac users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, allowing for resale of a game already on a person\\\u0027s system is farcical, as it would pretty much be just selling a copy of the game, and not the game itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to see Bobby Kotick or John Riccitiello have an aneurism?
