Aside from space planes and rockets, what ways have you guys tried to get to space, or have successfully gotten to space with? I have tried cannons, another test I had tried was to use constant explosions below my spacecraft to do the trick, but that didn\u0027t work too well. Also, on smaller planets and moons, you could probably use the detonation blast from decouplers if you were smart, but I\u0027ve never seen it done... so what have you guys tried?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, space travel! I am actually currently doing some tests to see the feasibility of using a rocket in LKO with a small space craft to propel it to interplanetary space, or into minmus orbit, where it can be propelled by another into a planetary intercept. It\u0027s a bit of a crazy idea and would definitely need some part tweaking and things like that, but I like toying around with it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what have you guys got goin\u0027?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XeroCoolUSN","CreatedById":64458,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T04:20:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about a long device that spins(think centrifuge) and then releases space craft at velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wrestlingforme","CreatedById":27362,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T04:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a planetary cycler would be a good idea.

Has anyone toyed around with sending kerbals on interplanetary trajectories? Because the cannon concept works alot better out of atmosphere and you can get anywhere from 500 to 1200 m/s if you do it right. The trick is you stick a rocket on both sides so that it doesn\u0027t really move anywhere in space. Or you can attach parachutes to it and only fire retrograde so the cannon just falls back to the atmosphere. I\u0027m planning to build a rig that acts sort of like a loading gun, so you would dock a 2-part craft (one part is the \u0022ammo\u0022 and the other is a small craft with rcs and landing legs) and use it like that.
