Because I really like to go to other planets and build bases there for my kerbins. But there are just so few colony\u00A0pieces that its hard so i got a mod, but that kinda slows my ksp down so in the next update i hope the devs add a more expansive colony system. As well more places to colonize i know we have eve but I\u0027ve been there so many times its just gotten old and again in the next big update I hope they add a completely new solar system.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-10T09:01:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is, if squad keeps adding stuff for everyone, for instance for you, is slows the game to. A mod doesn\u0027t slow down ksp, but a part and sripts. So if the Dev\u0027s add some new parts or/and scripts, it eventually will slow the game too, maybe a bit less than mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there are so many people who want new features in KSP, but I think the Dev\u0027s want to keep the game basic and simple.

If dev\u0027s make to much \u0027stock\u0027, they have to maintain much more and updates will be bigger. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOfcourse some things can be added, but I think squad will keep the game quite simple so it doesn\u0027t get to complicated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
