That said, there\u0027s not much space for improvements left. It won\u0027t probably affect steam reviews, since KSP will be still a damn good game, but professional reviewers could (I\u0027m not saying they will, but there is that possibility) roast KSP on open fire if there\u0027s one too many bugs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldnt be surprised if the \u0022Professional reviewers\u0022 end up being alot more harsh than the steam reviewers. Steam reviewers are folks that actually play the game and enjoy the type of game and leave positive reviews. Those that don\u0027t like this type of game either never buy it or are just ambivalent about it when they try it and decide it isnt right for them, often not careing enough to leave a review either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPro reviewers on the other hand are being payed to review the game. They have to post a review weither they like this type of game or not and are much more likely to blast any faults they find if they dont like the game for any reason. Add that to the learning cliff and limited time for the reviewer to overcome that and you have a recipe for negative \u0022Professional reviews.\u0022 Seeing as how squad is not a huge company and is not likely to be buying positive reviews like some other companies do... well lets just say I wont be surprised by a mirror image of the review bias we often see on high budget titles such as EA games that get 9\u0027s and 10\u0027s from places like IGN but 3-4\u0027s from players. KSP will probably get rave reviews from players and luke warm from the pros.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CG_Kerbin","CreatedById":117777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T08:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eone day the kerbals will get to number 1 and then they will rule the world!
