Why is that good? Well if your fuel tank setup is one that lets most of the fuel flow back towards the rear of the craft, then it will eventually balance it out once fuel gets depleted, which is important after re-entry and setting up for landing, at least for my XRSTS-04E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T03:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JonhyBee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JonhyBee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe take off is a little skechy tho.

That\u0027s a great achievement, and it\u0027s very tricky to do. Secondly, post the craft file. For, uh, science reasons. And stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome design advice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I would get rid of those big RCS tanks the nukes are attached to and use the little spherical tanks so you can balance your craft\u0027s center of mass better. It should only take 4 spherical radial tanks to balance that one by the nose. You\u0027re already a bit tailheavy with the nukes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) some people will suggest replacing the nukes with the little 50 thrust .5 ton engines - the 1m yellow and black landing-type engine whose name escapes me. you *might* find that if you do that, then you only need 1 of those jet engines, which means you can get rid of that ton or so worth of radial intakes and practically fly into orbit with that one jet engine alone. It will also help reduce the risk of losing your rocket engines on take-off or landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) this is the big one: move your rear landing gear forward closer to the center of mass of your ship. You have enough wing for that mass that you should be able to rotate and get airborne long before you run off the runway. Also, hitting the brakes and waiting until the engines have spooled up to full throttle will cut your takeoff run by a fair chunk. If you find you have to really be \u0022nose up\u0022 (pilots call it alpha, or angle of attack) before it lifts off, then you need to add a bit more wing. I like to use the intake nacelle under the aerodynamics tab to give my planes a little more length so I can do just that, since it also adds moar air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you should completely ignore all my advice and strap on a pair of SRBs (preferably the BACC) and a few lawn chairs so you can use it as a shuttle.

I had put the back wheel on long struts cause I was worried about the LV-N hitting the pavement at rotation. Turns out there is a nice spot under thoses RCS fuel tanks to put wheel just under the CoM.
