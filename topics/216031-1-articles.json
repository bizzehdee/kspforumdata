I basically just always have infinite fuel. The in-game toggle for \u0022infinite fuel\u0022 is \u0022off\u0022. I previously had a mod that allowed a cheat menu where infinite fuel was also an option. I have since removed all mods and uninstalled an re-installed the game, and the fuel issue is still present.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
