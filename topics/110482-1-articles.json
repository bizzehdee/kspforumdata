There is one thing bugging me however, and that is that I have no target indicator in external vehicle view. I\u0027ve watched some videos on this subject and they all have their target marked by a green diamond with a distance indicator in EV-view. This is of course of great help and I have no idea why I don\u0027t have it, and I would really this feature for when I start to do docking missions. I guess I also should mention that I have set the object as target as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play career mode and have the tracking station fully upgraded, most other buildings are atleast level 2. I run the mods Kerbalengineer, Europeflags and Planetshine. Does anyone have any idea of why I\u0027m missing the target indicator?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help much appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-V\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T13:57:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Valday\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T13:18:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it may be from a mod, given what you are describing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T13:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried \u003Cstrong\u003E[F4]\u003C/strong\u003E yet?
