You really can\u0027t do smooth, efficient transfers where your departure path is more or less parallel with your starting moon\u0027s orbital path. Such transfers look great to start with but as soon as you leave the moon\u0027s SOI and swing just slightly wider, the moon you just left will catch up from behind and suck you back in to a lithobrake. To avoid this, you have to use a sub-optimal transfer burn where you give yourself a significant amount of outwards velocity at the expense of forward velocity, to get yourself out beyond the sweep of the moon\u0027s SOI as it speeds by inside you. And this means you arrive at the target moon at a more pronounced angle to its orbit, which makes the capture burn bigger than it should be. It\u0027s all very annoying, but that\u0027s what you get when you cram such big SOIs as these moons have so close together that they almost overlap. But fortunately, once you get beyond Tylo, you no longer have this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duxwing","CreatedById":42282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T19:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answer! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few comments on going inward:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Going outward may require less fuel.

As I mentioned, due to the size of the SOIs compared to your ship\u0027s speed, a by-the-book optimum transfer isn\u0027t workable between Laythe and Vall, or Vall and Tylo, due to the sheer size of their SOIs compared to the speed you\u0027re moving away from them. It has to do with KSP\u0027s 2-body physics and SOIs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe by-the-book optimum has you leaving the starting moon nearly parallel to its orbit, so it takes a while to get any horizontal separation. While you\u0027re still in its SOI, this is no problem because your motion is figured relative to that moon. But once you leave the moon\u0027s SOI, now both you and the moon are moving relative to Jool. Because your orbit is slightly wider at this point, the game treats you as moving slower than the moon relative to Jool, even though you were just moving faster than the moon while in its SOI. Thus, the moon catches up with you despite you just having achieved escape velocity from it. And because you haven\u0027t yet moved very far outwards or inwards towards the target moon, you\u0027ll be swept up by the big SOI and back where you started, only on a lithobraking trajectory heading in the opposite direction you just left from.

The 1st method is wait a bit after the optimal transfer window, then crank your ejection angle backwards to give you more inwards or outwards velocity from the get-go so you can sidestep the SOI coming up from behind, while still hitting the target. This involves both a bigger transfer burn and a bigger capture burn. The other is to do the transfer burn from just barely inside the moon\u0027s SOI, so even a little bit of inwards or outwards velocity puts you out of reach as the moon goes by behind you. In this case, you use the normal transfer window and ejection angle so the capture burn is also normal. However, the transfer burn is bigger because you\u0027re sacrificing Oberth by burning way out there, and if you circularized out there to wait on the transfer window instead of being in a highly eccentric orbit, you waste even more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duxwing","CreatedById":42282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T17:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI may have solved the problem: a Hohmann transfer between any two bodies orbiting a third costs the absolute value of the difference between the costs of Hohmann transferring (-\u0026gt;) from the origin (O) to the parent (P) and from the parent to the target (T):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EO-\u0026gt;T = |O-\u0026gt;P - P-\u0026gt;T|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis formula considers all Oberth Effects, the first occurring regardless of transfer method and the latter being cancelled by the dV cost of descending to the parent.
