Isp does not care about your mass, payload or whatever. So no, it is very realistic (and probably simply factual). Now it is another question if it allows us to reach 0.25c, but K^2 didn\u0027t say that; he only claimed 0.2c at 4:1 ratio (which by the way is again just a calculation and has nothing to do with future tech). Read up what he claimed and what Isp has to do with this; you said nothing that contradicts what he wrote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would go for a 16:1 ratio, you could go for ~0.4c (ignoring relativistic effects for simplicity). Therefore more than 0.2c is not fantasy. But maybe not worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumans needing space/shielding/food is also no concern. There is enough space out there, and enclosing (or shielding) something scales slower than volume (until you reach some other problems, but we probably won\u0027t). Food and other goods (each being a miniscule part of the total mass) can either be recycled or be used for the M/AM reaction; so no waste there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:44:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am agree with K2, I read many methods already simulated . . . .\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimulated is the key word.
