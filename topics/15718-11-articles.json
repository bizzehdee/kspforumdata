This update is now complete and I just need to test it to make sure everything I changed works properly (most of it does so far). I anticipate releasing version 0.2.0 this weekend barring a disaster during testing. Here is a change list for your previewing pleasure:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDune Raider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fixed super bouncing (mostly). I\u0027ve taken the Prowler off of some wicked jumps and landed awkwardly but safely. I\u0027ve also rammed into various structures at KSC without any catastrophic bounces. It did bounce a few times but only once or twice and never very far before it settled on the ground (usually upside-down :\\ ). Hopefully that means the worst part of the bug is gone for everyone else but we wont know until the community gets a chance to test it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-New \u0022universal chassis\u0022 meant to act as a common platform for all future Dune Raider bodies. I simply split the old Prowler body into two separate parts. The wheels and chassis will form the basis for all future Dune Raider configurations. The chassis contains the electric battery and no means of recharging it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Removed the lights as a separate part and integrated them into the Prowler body. I had to split them up in the past because of the way the various old parts handled animations but with the new configuration I managed to fix that. The Prowler body was also modified to allow for stock solar panels to be attached in an aesthetically pleasing way. No more broken \u0022unbreakable\u0022 power sources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Wheels can now withstand more abuse (see bounce testing above) without breaking and also consume less electricity. You still need to be careful about what you drive over but at least you can be more adventurous. The stock solar panels do not produce electricity as fast as the old method so I balanced the consumption to be reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFire Hawk:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Revised the model for the core module. It now looks more \u0022rocket-shipey\u0022. It\u0027s still far away from the quality some modders can manage but it\u0027s better than the old model and I am happy with it. Plus, I think my relatively low polygon models makes for a better KSP experience overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-New landing legs. The animation won\u0027t play in reverse so when you close the gear they \u0022snap\u0022 closed and I have no idea why. Either the KSP coding is bugged (possible) or I did something wrong (likely). However, they are pretty cool legs that fold flat against the body of the Fire Hawk. You might even find a use for them in your non-CORE creations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Removed the integrated RCS ports. I found that they do more harm than good so I just took them off. There is still RCS fuel available if you want to attach stock RCS ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Other slight tweaks to the models you likely wont notice or care about. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStay tuned!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrluckypants96","CreatedById":67764,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T23:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having an issue with the Dune Raider rover.

Turns out that I don\u0027t have to do anything to enable tweakable functionality in 0.23. Everything I want enabled is enabled by default.

You can delete them yourselves, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I have been scratching my head over is enabling career capabilities to Anvil. I\u0027ve looked at where Squad puts their rocket parts and I think I\u0027ve settled on putting Anvil V into \u0022Heavy Rocketry\u0022 and Anvil IV into \u0022Very Heavy Rocketry\u0022. My problem is that I would like to balance the costs of my rockets somewhat reasonably against Squad\u0027s parts. My assumption is that if you are playing career mode you are doing it for the reward of earning advancements and I think it would be a downer to reach a certain milestone just to get super powerful rockets for dirt cheap (or a rip off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe snag is that Squad and I are playing by completely different standards of balance. One of squad\u0027s biggest fuel tanks has 6000 units of fuel where my smallest has about 3000 and my biggest has 45000. It all works out to be reasonably balanced in actual practice but we are working on difference scales. I have no idea how to come up with a price that will be fair.

My problem is that I would like to balance the costs of my rockets somewhat reasonably against Squad\u0027s parts.
