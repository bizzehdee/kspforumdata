I have been advised by one that does sci-fi that sometime in the future, he will need to know some sub-orbital mechanics, specifically, an Ultra-HALO jump from a sub-orbital flight in order to avoid some advance anti-air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know of any online resources to help calculate distance vs height/speed needed? Preferable would be something hooked up to Google maps or Earth, but even just numbers (ie at this height and speed, it will take this distance to hit the ground on a ballistic course) will do and we can figure it out from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I have been able to find so far is some equations. I can try to figure them out, but I do not think that I got high enough in Math to really understand them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T03:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no simple formula. You have to integrate the trajectory, and you need to know a lot of additional information about the way the jump is performed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
