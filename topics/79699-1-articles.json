If I\u0027m staying inside Kerbin SOI, I\u0027ve got a lander setup that can get me to minimus with a transport section that usually has 20-30% fuel/oxidizer that I then dock with a station I have there in min orbit where I move all the extra transport fuel to except for what\u0027s needed for the deorbit burn (provided the tanks on the transport ship I have docked to the station aren\u0027t full, then the transport section I brought gets docked to the transport ship as an addittional engine/tank) then I proceed to land on Minimus ditching the transport tank after the deorbit burn (if I still have it), land there and do whatever I went there to do. I then launch from Minimus do a low power burn to return to Kerbin via a mun capture transfer, and while I\u0027m there, land on the mun. I then take off go to kerbin orbit, rescue the lost kerbinaut, then do a minor deorbit burn to start aerobraking, and usually have 20-100 M/S of delta/v left for a final braking burn in the last half second to second. So yeah, inside of Kerbin SOI, my lander usually gets back into atmosphere with 1-5% of the total delta/v it had, but have had a few missions where my final deorbit burn after rescuing the lost kerbin has been done using the RCS props.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as my interplanetary transports go, I typically try to leave kerbin SOI with 50% or more of the delta/v needed for the round trip and at least one lander full refuel (monop, fuel, and oxidizer) as I\u0027ve lost count of the number of times I\u0027ve miscalculated the hoffman transfer burn badly and have needed a 300-500 M/S correction burn (my normal interplanetary hoffman transfers do normally need a plane change \u0026amp; correction burn, but it\u0027s usually just in the 10-50 M/S range). I\u0027m really glad I do this even if it takes the extra time to build/fuel the interplanetary transport as on my latest trip to duna and after landing on Duna, I had my \u0027Apollo 13\u0027 incident. I went ahead and did my orbital docking after the lander ascended from Duna in the darkside of Duna. In doing so I had forgotten to take into account the orientation of the transport and wound up crashing the lander at 10-20 M/S as I was doing my rendevous speed kill burn into the rear end of the transport. The resulting explosion completely crippled the transport rendering it incapable of managing a stable straight burn even at just 1% thrust, however, enough tanks did survive so that the lander was able to dock up, detach the ones that would unbalance the thrust of the lander even more (damage to the lander rendered it offbalance, and even with ballasting the contents of the fuel tanks the lander could only maintain 40% thrust while towing the remaining tanks without spinning, it could manage 60% without the tanks sustained, and brief bursts of 100% provided the rcs was on) So I then proceeded to limp my way back to kerbin ditching tanks as they emptied (love love love having built a modular transport ship, next time I need to remember to build more then one of the primary engine stages that has a forward facing docking port) In this case, having way more fuel than I needed made sure I did not need a rescue ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rus-Evo","CreatedById":107004,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T12:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts too hard to get transfers correct when you are basically eyeballing the angles and comparing to the diagram for the burn, so yeah MOAR fuel to get you through.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T14:14:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI send fuel out ahead of any kerbal crewed missions that are beyond Kerbin\u0027s SOI.
