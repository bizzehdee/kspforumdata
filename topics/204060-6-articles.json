Plant growth levels are more limited by access to light and fresh water than they are to CO2, and with global temperatures rising and droughts becoming more common, access to fresh water is going to be the biggest problem with that approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoreover, most CO2-scrubbing activity is done not by plants, but by marine life -- algae, seaweed, and the like. The oceans are already full of carbon-scrubbing organisms, and here the limiting factor is access to sunlight (since the algae, phytoplankton, etc. needs to be close to the surface in order to get light). This is actually one of the biggest concerns for a runaway feedback loop. Marine life that provides CO2 scrubbing is sensitive to temperature. If the ocean temperature rose too high, it might be curtail the life cycle of that marine life, leading to dramatically decreased ocean CO2 scrubbing capacity, leading to higher temperatures and a runaway loop that could cause a major extinction event within mere decades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGranted, that particular outcome doesn\u0027t seem terribly likely right now, but it\u0027s still worrisome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is some good news, though. The most promising carbon capture technology uses marine algae kept in\u00A0tanks, and it works very well. It\u0027s just not being done on a broad enough scale to make much of a difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224011266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204060\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221627501837\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204106\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SOXBLOX\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, SOXBLOX said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsevenperforce\u0027s graphs of solar activity and temperatures back on page two are really interesting.

Solar activity went up in the 1780s, down in the early 1800s, back up slightly, down a little around 1900, up between 1940 and 1990, and is now on its way back down to its lowest levels since the 1840s.

It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period (Figure SPM.3). Anthropogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century over every continental region except Antarctica4 . Anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global water cycle since 1960 and contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0\u2013700 m) and to global mean sea level rise observed since the 1970s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022igdz2r9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002263.02\u0022 height=\u0022380\u0022 width=\u0022603\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/igdz2r9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssessed likely ranges (whiskers) and their mid-points (bars) for warming trends over the 1951\u20132010 period from well-mixed greenhouse gases, other anthropogenic forcings (including the cooling effect of aerosols and the effect of land use change), combined anthropogenic forcings, natural forcings and natural internal climate variability (which is the element of climate variability that arises spontaneously within the climate system even in the absence of forcings). The observed surface temperature change is shown in black, with the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to observational uncertainty. The attributed warming ranges (colours) are based on observations combined with climate model simulations, in order to estimate the contribution of an individual external forcing to the observed warming. The contribution from the combined anthropogenic forcings can be estimated with less uncertainty than the contributions from greenhouse gases and from other anthropogenic forcings separately.

KSP players will be very familiar with eccentricity, but for those who haven\u0027t actually played, it represents the circularity (or lack thereof) of a particular orbit. When the eccentricity is close to zero the orbit is very circular, and so the heat from the sun is fairly constant over the course of the year. When the eccentricity is higher (up to 0.05 on this graph), the orbit is less circular, and so there is much higher solar insolation during part of the year. This is the biggest climate forcing function for our planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to resonances between Saturn and Jupiter, the eccentricity of Earth\u0027s orbit is on a cycle of approximately 100,000 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe red and green lines at the bottom represent global temperature (red comes from sedimentary isotope analysis and green comes from ice core analysis). Using these different datasets, scientists are able to reconstruct how insolation impacts global temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s basically what happens. During periods of low eccentricity, the oceans are cooler, and so they are able to directly absorb a higher amount of carbon dioxide (yes, gases can be dissolved into liquids; that\u0027s how fish get their oxygen, after all). Once the eccentricity of Earth\u0027s orbit starts to increase and solar insolation starts to spike at certain times of the year, the oceans warm rapidly, releasing their absorbed carbon dioxide and causing a surge in global temperature. However, once the oceans run out of carbon dioxide and the eccentricity of Earth\u0027s orbit starts to decline again, the ocean temperatures begin to cool, slowly absorbing more and more carbon dioxide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last of these surges was in the Medieval Warm Period, so we should be in the cooling-down part of the cycle. Unfortunately, we\u0027ve been releasing millions of tonnes of carbon that was buried deep underground in oil reserves, and so even though the eccentricity of Earth\u0027s orbit is decreasing and we SHOULD be cooling down, there is simply too much carbon being released for the oceans to absorb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-28T21:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo essentially, the oceans normally soak up CO2\u00A0 when they are colder due to being further from the Sun due to Earth\u0027s eccentricity.
