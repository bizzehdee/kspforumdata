The 2nd tube is a part of the retractable hatch, i also plan to put a chute or something in it. The 3rd tube is the most important, it has room for the engine, its currently empty though, and that\u0027s the reason of this post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: Do i make a removable SRB-like engine to put inside of the 3rd tube, that i can remove, refuel and then re-install it on the plane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor B: Do i simply reinforce the insides of the 3rd tube with lots of aluminium foil and stuff, so i can simply pour the fuel inside of it without any removal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes yes, i can use those rocket motors you buy in stores and all that, but in my country, as far as i know there are NONE of those stores anywhere.
