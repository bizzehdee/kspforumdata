Wasn\u0027t public knowledge? Wow. I used to live about 30-40km from that place. The Star City was on the drive to Moscow, and one of Moscow\u0027s defense ring objects was located almost in the city. (Officially, any incident there was reported as taking place in our city, including when a stockpile of AA missiles went boom.) We were basically told in kindergarten that Gagarin\u0027s plane went down because another plane flew too close to it.
