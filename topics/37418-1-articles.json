The resulting drag slows the spacecraft. Aerobraking is used when a spacecraft requires a low orbit after arriving at a body with an atmosphere, and it requires less fuel than does the direct use of a rocket engine.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T06:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDipping into a planet\u0027s atmosphere in order to shed excess velocity.

It involves having your periapsis low enough so that it enters the atmosphere and slowing down during recently to lower your apoapsis. However, having your periapsis too high, you will still be on a hyperbolic trajectory after aerobraking, but too low, you will soon be lithobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T06:05:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup. You can use atmospheric friction to bleed off your excess speed. Aerobraking is particularly useful for slowing down after an interplanetary transfer out to Eve, Duna or Jool, since it allows you to get captured for free. It\u0027s also occasionally used during Kerbin returns, if you want to slow down gradually without smashing directly into the atmosphere at 10G or more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IllicitMedic","CreatedById":66677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T06:11:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome guys thanks!
