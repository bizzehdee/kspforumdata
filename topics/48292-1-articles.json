You would have to use the parts that the father node have given you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPer example, if a node gives you a parachute, an engine and a fuel tank you would have to use them to get specific Science points (SSP) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you could have a couple improvement nodes coming from the one you have unlocked, something like \u0022Fuel storage\u0022, \u0022Engine Thrust\u0022 and \u0022Soft landing\u0022 that could improve the ISP of the engine, the dry mass of the fuel tank and the drag of the parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach one would affect all similar parts so thrust and efficiency would improve in all liquid fuel engines with one node and SRB with other, RCS with other and the same for structural parts weight, solar panels efficiency, batery capacity etc. And there could be diferent tiers like \u0022Engine Thrust I\u0022, \u0022Engine Thrust II\u0022, \u0022Engine Thrust III\u0022 etc. each one improving thrust a small percentage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s talk about those Specific Science Points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to have some kind of random variable so you won\u0027t know exactly how many more launches you have to do to get an improvement, and when you recover a vessel or transmit the data you get an unexpected message saying \u0022Thanks to the analisis of your previous missions you can now research \u0022Fuel Storage\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this to be more \u0022uncontrollable\u0022 the SSP could be hidden so you don\u0027t know how or when will it happen just like in real life we can\u0027t know when a new tecnology will appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way those points can be earned would be related with the use of the specific part they will improve and how it is being used. You will get more info about how to make better parachutes using them in an atmosphere instead of looking at them in the vacuum. And you could learn more about how to make better landing legs landing on a high gravity planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you will get much more information if you can recover the parts you are trying to improve so return missions will be more valuable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last thing I would like to see are prototypes. They would work just a the normal part, but would give you extra SSP. They would be more expensive (once we have an economy) and you would need to take them back to Kerbin to get the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe possibilities are as big as the tech tree itself: better air intakes, faster rover wheels, lighter aircraft... the SOI of Kerbol is the only limit for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Please tell me if I have written something wrong, you will help the rest to understand the text better and you will also help me to express myself better in english\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-14T10:59:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2013 10:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Juanfro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
