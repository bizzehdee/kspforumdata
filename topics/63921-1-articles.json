For example a Kerbin day is only 6h long*. However the MET timer doesn\u0027t reflect that at all - You can go ahead and check that, just start a mission without leaving launchpad, and time warp. You\u0027ll see 4 sun rises before the timer shows a day has passed. Now, it isn\u0027t a huge problem - obviously we\u0027ve played for so long and no-one mentioned it.

Time intervals are constants. When saying \u0022a day\u0022 you normally mean a sidreal earth day. If you mean otherwise, you need to specify. If we were to speak in sidreal kerbin days, they would indeed be about 6h. And the same goes for years. \u0022A year\u0022 is really just ~365.25 (sidreal) earth days.
