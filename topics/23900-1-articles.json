I\u0027m talking jets here, not space planes. I had an easy time of this in 19.0, but am having a bit of difficulty with it in 19.1. Before, I\u0027d average a speed of about 1500m/s and would complete the trip in about 45 minutes. Now with the current version I am running out of fuel mid way through with similar designs I\u0027ve used in the past. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E I know its a bit of bore, but do any of you do this?
