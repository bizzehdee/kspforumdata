Actually, if you have a million dollars to spend on that, then it\u0027s likely that you are among the privileged, not the persecuted. And there is no reason to believe that a privately owned colony controlled by Elon Musk or anyone else is going to be a political and religious utopia that would be any better than where you currently live. It\u0027s actually likely to have less freedom than on Earth due to rationing and safety concerns and to ask more of its citizens than to just contribute taxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou saw the same dynamic in the 18th and 19th Centuries as the United States began its western expansion. The death rates on the wagon trains were staggering, but people still went. The prairies they settled on were in Tornado Alley. They had no hospitals, very few doctors.
