Second, this is on the WNTS list. Third, if you want a mod, post this in Add-on Affairs.

In fact i think it was one of the very first objects that used it. It was placed at the end of the runway and once you got within a certain distance it would launch you into space pretty much instantly. Or blow you, one or the other."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T21:28:09Z","Content":"**[MOD - Moved to General Add-on Affairs subforums, as that is the appropriate place to be making add-on requests]**"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T22:00:31Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think you get the physics behind the Higgs particle at all..."},{"CreatedByName":"custume","CreatedById":112591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T05:22:19Z","Content":"Hello all,\n\nYes there is another mod that can do this but not in the same way, and there is a lot of crafts that look like a mass relay but will not function.\n\nSo the idea is to create something similar but that really works.\n\nAnd my idea is not a warp drive or similar, the idea is a mass effect field that can be use not only for travel but for construction of bases (anti gravity or mass reduction of the base item before landing). \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think you get the physics behind the Higgs particle at all...\n\nHey im not a scientist and my collage day are long gone.\n\nFor what I understand the Higgs can alter mass on the quarks lvl , or can increase or decrees the force between particles, and we can make this type of particle, and this particle can alter the weak force or weak nuclear force between quarks and maybe leptons.\n\nSo in theory we can alter mass in the sub atomic lvl in quantum mechanics, and according to CERM we can make this particle right now, don\u0027t have any use for it but we can make them.\n\nSo if the Higgs can remove mass to a particle basically works like the mass relay in negative charge, and if we remove all the higgs from the particles we can restore the mass to a particle or add more (good for gravity systems). \n\nOkay is not perfect but have more scientific background that a lot of parts, and can really work (in theory) in real life.\n\nThx all, and thank you Sumghai for changing location.\n\nBest regards to all\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T05:33:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 05:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by custume**"}]}
