The low wing, high tail plane design is becoming my favorite wing mounting scheme.

I used mod parts, but you can repeat the concept. There are two cargo bays, cockpit, and a liqui/oxy tank, followed by wings, solar and batteries (underneath) but still one or two engines. Here, there are two rockets because it is vertical take off. When I runway it from Kerb, I swap it the other way - 2 jets - 1 rocket. Look closely, its hard to see. There are two rockets and one jet nuzzled in-between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still get the speed I need and don\u0027t overweight from fuel or excess engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne extra note - I build faster planes. A lot of the larger ones you see have more engines to push that mass through the air. As you get bigger, expand. But I find it best to add more engines and no necessarily more fuel tanks. Apply an engine body radially rather than additional, radial tanks. Then decide if you need more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother concern:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at your center of mass and lift point. Judging by looking at the wings, I bet your lift point is far out in front of your COM. This does not help lift. You can consider placing the wings so the COM is in front or on top of the lift point. I put it behind because, as you use fuel, the COM changes over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo, you may want to try making your elevators horizontal and having a separate set of vertical stabilizers or hybrid elevator/stabilizers. But pay attention to wheel placement first, as was said. Very important to have the rear wheels directly behind/hugging the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-02T17:09:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2014 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Friend Bear\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emultipost mayhem\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T06:24:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFriend Bear,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to edit your post above so that it flows a little better.

This results in less drag overall. Remember, your space plane will be landing with it\u0027s dry weight. It\u0027s landing speed will usually be half it\u0027s takeoff speed. Your wheels can handle quite a high decent landing speed, especially if you double up the main landing wheels.

The big concern is that your rate of decent doesn\u0027t get to high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of making sure you can take-off. The wheels can safely handle takeoff roll speeds that are incredibly high. Your main limiting factor is the runway, and the solution for that (short of Modding KSP to have a longer runway, or rolling your SSTO out to the feild by the runway) is to add more thrust. If you really want to add some umph you can even attach some seperatrons to use as jtags, or even use some small boosters for launch. It\u0027s not really an SSTO if you drop them. You can keep them on if you want to get the SSTO bragging rights. seperatron-based jtags will be recoverable if you add a parachute, but the small booster will place your seperation point too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to do an angled takeoff with a launch-clamp.

Always screenshot planes in the SPH with CoL and CoM showing if you want troubleshooting assistance. It helps a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Also, showing the wheels would help, many problems with take off are due to poor wheel placement in relation to CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I think this plane might have a hard time lifting due to forward weight. Generally you want the bulk of your weight in the rear to help lift off the runway and keep the nose up while landing. Fuel is heavy. Think of it this way, your plane body is a lever, the rear wheels and center of mass are your fulcrum, and the control surfaces are the downward force applied to one side to lift the other side. If your front end is too heavy, the control surfaces won\u0027t have the strength to lift it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Avoid Jet Fuel only parts for SSTO\u0027s. In the grand scheme of things, your jet engines will use very little fuel to get to space and the added weight of a dedicated part is not worth that trouble. Just use LFO tanks only... unless you need the shape, like the adapter behind the cockpit. On that same note, that adapter has enough jet fuel to get high and fast enough to switch to rockets by itself anyway so you really don\u0027t need the Mk2 Fuselage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I really need to see the CoM/CoL because the wings look very far forward and I have a feeling your CoL is probably on top of or in front of the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Don\u0027t forget the control surfaces, it\u0027s not going to do much without those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. I disagree with the above comment on engines. Once you strip the dead weight of that Jet Fuel tank, that Turbo jet is all you need for a plane that small and the LV-909 can use the help, it\u0027s not that powerful. Also 2 Jet Engines means you have to keep a greater attention on your intake air and manually shut off the jets, which isn\u0027t hard but it is more complicated. An even number of Jets is even worse because have to keep at least 2 running all the time, with an odd number of jets, even if you have 3, you can shut off 2 a lot sooner to stretch the intake air for the 3rd. All in all, for a bird this size, 1 Turbo Jet is plenty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is not to say, there are not reasons to use 2 turbo jets (obviously the image I posted earlier does) but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do however agree that the 48-7S engines, though less powerful, are very good for plane ascent because they are so light and have almost the same fuel efficiency as the LV-909. The other option is to switch to dual turbo jets after all and use a single Toroidal Aerospike which has the same isp as a LV909 in a vacuum but a lot more thrust and better atmospheric ISP.
