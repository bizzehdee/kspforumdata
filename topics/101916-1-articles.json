And before you ask...\n\n1. Both docks are facing the correct way\n2. All sides are identical pieces, hence the same length\n3. I\u0027ve tried \u0022leaving\u0022 the ship and reloading it from the space center\n4. I\u0027ve restarted KSP\n5. I\u0027ve tried weeping shamelessly\n\nI\u0027ve also attempted redock multiple times. I\u0027m pretty sure angle isn\u0027t an issue at this point. I\u0027ve also rotated to different docks on the hex-dock-thingie. Since it\u0027s the last of the 4 sides, I know I can clamp onto 2 sides at once. I\u0027m not sure what else to try. \n\nI\u0027m running version 0.90.0.0 via Steam on Linux. \n\nAny suggestions?

If you can get two sides to clamp at once, my only guess is you need to do it so both ports connect simultaneously rather than sequentially, as you\u0027d then encounter the above issue re: same target.\n\nOther than that no idea, but cool design btw."},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T10:05:52Z","Content":"There is a bug where the docking ports sometimes keep believing they are docked even when they are not. Then they refuse to dock again. Try right clicking both of the reluctant docking ports and see if they display an undocked status. If either one says it\u0027s docked, even though they obviously aren\u0027t, you have hit this bug. I don\u0027t know if you can fix it with the right click menu, but save file editing has been mentioned before.\n\nAlso I\u0027m sorry that I cannot give more detailed instructions. I haven\u0027t done anything with docking ports in KSP so far."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T12:19:18Z","Content":"mhhh, as far as I know it\u0027s not possible to dock docking ports on when they are both on the same ship, might be wrong though. In case you encounter the bug, let me know via pm, I have had this quite a few times and could explain how to edit stuff to make it work again."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T14:34:13Z","Content":"I believe it is possible to connect two craft using multiple docking ports. I\u0027m not sure if the loop configuration might be a problem for the program, but it seems far more likely that you have encountered the docking port bug.\n\nAs mentioned above, save file editing is the resolution I have seen discussed on the forum.\n\nGood luck and happy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T15:54:04Z","Content":"From looking closely at the image, it appears the top port may not be perfectly aligned (very slightly rotated). Do you have \u0022NavyFish Docking Alignment Indicator\u0022? That also has a rotation alignment on it, although that may not help with this square setup. Try to undock that top part, give it a slight twist, then quicksave. When you quickload, it should reset the ports and they should snap together. \\*Disclaimer: I haven\u0027t used the quickload trick myself, but I\u0027ve read on these forums that it works. Also, you may want to use alt-f5 first so you can go back to where you started if things go wrong. Alt-f9 lets you choose what to quickload."},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T18:05:39Z","Content":"I can confirm you can \u0027multi-dock\u0027 ships, but they both need to be linking at the same time. The Ares Helm in my current Let\u0027s Play does it.\n\nI do, however, recommend the Docking Port Alignment Indicator, in particular for rotation control. Even just a hair off 0/90/etc can set one as non-linking (which caused me serious roll issues on said interplanetary craft). \n\nIf you\u0027re incredibly curious, you can find me playing with it here:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLFAzt4d0ck?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThe redocking procedure for the right engine starts at around 13:00. \n\nHope it helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T18:47:34Z","Content":"Multi-docking is hard!

Keep in mind you\u0027re in a beta (and for a long time it was alpha) so a lot of the polish you need for proper controls just aren\u0027t there yet, as they were much more worried about the mechanics under the hood than the interface. The mods really just add that polish for you.\n\nBut, I understand your preference. Good luck to you!"}]}
