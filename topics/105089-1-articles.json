[http://imgur.com/a/YMnzu](http://imgur.com/a/YMnzu) I recently discovered Kerbals can survive reentry into Kerbin in 1.0.2 without a capsule after purposely trying to turn Jebediah into a fireball (insert guilty face here). It only takes a bit of EVA pack thrust near the end of the fall (and maybe some luck to land on hilly terrain, although Bob survived the fall onto flat ground when I had to do the same with him after forgetting some parachutes), to successfully land them. They do get a bit warm, but surprisingly do not burn up. Jeb seems to love it, that darn badass!"}]}
