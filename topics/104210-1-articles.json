What I kinda had in mind is some type of GIS software where I can see the layout of the plots/graves and be able to click on them and see who is buried there (birth/death date, who it is deeded to, etc.). I was hoping to be able to have this tied into the cloud somehow also, so when I go and meet with a family out at the cemetery I can just bring my iPad along with me and view what\u0027s available for purchase right then and there. I had been looking into just using Numbers and just using the cells in the spreadsheet as plot\u0027s but that\u0027s my last resort. I\u0027m just looking for someone else\u0027s opinion. Maybe someone has a better idea than me! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T22:45:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 10:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bigdad84\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T00:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*gasp*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need a GIS and you don\u0027t need a cloud service.
