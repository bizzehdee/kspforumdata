As long as there\u0027s the slightest slope, the rover will start to roll. There seems to be no way to park it other than deliberately breaking the tires so the wheel no longer works like a wheel. Even rightclicking and disabling the wheel simply removes the ability to control it rather than stopping it, it still rolls freely after doing that. You can lock the wheel to stop it steering but that\u0027s not the same as locking it from rolling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T04:41:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the top of the screen to the right of the altitude display, there are three buttons. Lights on/off, landing gear up/down, and brakes on/off. Holding the B key only keeps you stopped as long as you hold the key down, but mouse-clicking on that altimeter button locks the brakes until you take them off again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T04:48:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s the altitude meter at the top, and there are three buttons at it\u0027s right: Lights, landing gear and brakes.

This is most handy. Now my kerbals can exit the craft and repair a blown tire without having to watch the rover roll away from them and leave them stranded as they try to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
