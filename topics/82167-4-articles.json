But NEAR isn\u0027t complex. You don\u0027t suddenly get unexpected behavior changes when going transsonic, you don\u0027t get people scratching their heads about stability derivates, you don\u0027t see your planes break apart on a hard turn... it just works, consistently. It\u0027s absolutely mainstream compatible. For a new player, there would hardly be any difference between learning the idiosyncracies of the current system from scratch and learning a NEAR-based system from scratch. It\u0027s just existing players who\u0027d have to adjust, and they have the advantage of experience to offset the learning curve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one of the regular problems taken out.

Or any combination of increasing planet radii, increasing atmosphere heights, lowering sea level Isps or just plain giving Kerbin a more dense atmosphere. Who says the sea level pressure on Kerbin has to be that of Earth? Duna and Eve also have different sea level pressures than the RL planets they are representing. Combining factors means each individual change will be smaller: bringing Kerbin to 637km (one tenth of Earth), increasing the atmosphere ceiling to 80km, increasing sea level pressure by 10% and lowering Isp by 20% (ASL)/10% (Vac) would go a long way toward maintaining the curent stock difficulty even with NEAR implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with increasing planet radii more than a few percent is that the surface detail suffers if the mesh isn\u0027t redone. Was glaringly obvious when I played RSS, for instance. Went to the Moon, and the terrain was so stretched out that a normally steeply rimmed crater looked like a flat field from the surface. Of course, RSS makes things a LOT bigger, but I\u0027m fairly sure that if Squad went and resized celestial bodies, they\u0027d also redo the mesh. Which would be a lot of 3D modeling work. Of course, the dev notes speak of the largest 3D modeling effort ever undertaken at once, soooo....
