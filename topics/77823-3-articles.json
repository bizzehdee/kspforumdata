If that is the case, then maybe Kerbin is a post-apocalyptic world and the Kerman lineage really represents the last of their kind; this lineage is maintained either through natural means (like binary fission) or cloning. Because Kerbin is recovering from the apocalypse, accessibility to knowledge is scant, and their manuscripts on basic rocket science were one of the few things they could recover. The space program is merely a distraction to keep the Kerbals from recognizing their true nature; should the space program suddenly become insolvent, there is nothing left to unify the remaining Kerbals, and the descent into utter extinction would begin (perhaps irreversibly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, this conclusion is about as far reaching as it gets, but hey, it could happen!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T01:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRender\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRender\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m still of the opinion that Career mode should have a \u0022training wheels\u0022 mode by default, wherein you won\u0027t have to actually worry about your funds until you\u0027ve successfully reached orbit.
