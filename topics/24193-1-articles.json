I\u0027ve watched a couple of docking tutorials but they didn\u0027t seem to do me a whole lot of good. I\u0027m trying to do completely manual docking (read: from launch to dock, no mechjeb or any other autopilot/assist tools). I\u0027m completely hung up with a few points and I really need some help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part that I \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E do is the actual dock to dock maneuvering. If I let mechjeb get me into range of my target and put me at a reasonably similar speed, I can maneuver the craft using RCS/translation controls manually and get it docked up. I\u0027m getting decent at it. My problems are in the previous stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first problem is knowing where to time warp to so that the target is \u0022over\u0022 the correct spot. I\u0027ve tried lining it up right over the space center, but depending on the speed of my launch and how fast I reach apoapsis, it moves so much that it\u0027s never really there anymore, so I end up trying to manually do what mechjeb would do automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInclination changes: How do you do these? Are you supposed to burn in between the apoapsis and periapsis, or on one or the other? The thing I\u0027m trying to dock with had a rough launch so it\u0027s at a weird inclination (like 6 degrees or so) and I try to match that, but with very little luck. I end up inclining the orbit too much on one side and not enough on the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaching the target: I guess this is what they call a phasing orbit? I know if I\u0027m behind the target I\u0027m supposed to be going faster/be below it in altitude, and vice versa for being ahead, but I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out how to determine what a valid orbit is to actually reach the thing.

If I can manage to get the target within visible range and I\u0027m not going way too fast, I can almost certainly manually fly the vessel into place and dock it, but the whole \u0022getting there\u0022 part just has me stumped.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ben Kerman","CreatedById":49475,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T14:48:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you even know how to use maneuver nodes?

You need to launch sometime before the target overflies KSC. Generally a climb to orbit for a fuel efficient ascent is about 4 minutes, not including coasting to apapsis. For LKO depending on the exact altitude you generally want to launch when your target is over the desert peninsula to the continents west of KSC. But don\u0027t sweet it - if you reach orbit and your target is within 100km of you you\u0027re already in business. I\u0027ve done countless docking and only three times I managed to get a \u0022hole in one\u0022 where I arrived at AP and the target was right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway so you\u0027re in orbit somewhat close to your target. What you need to do is click on the target until a pop up box comes up that says \u0022set X as target\u0022, do this.

So you already know that by going into a lower orbit you catch up and if you go to higher orbit you slow down. You notice on your orbit you have either one or two points called \u0022closest approach\u0022. What you want to do is reduce at least one of them to as close to 0m as possible (but anything under 1km is close enough for docking via pure visual). Assuming you\u0027ve already matched inclination with target, if you\u0027re ahead of target you burn prograde you will see that the \u0022separation\u0022 value at these closest approach points reduce, visa visa for if you\u0027re behind the target. Simply keep burning until separation at closet approach is under 1km and warp to that point and you will be in position for final docking approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that if the separation between your target and yourself is too great you might want to do a prograde/retrograde burn without trying to reduce closest approach to zero. What happen is then with each orbit your get closer and closer to your target and the game will recompute the closet approach for you. Once the separation is within a small distance (say 30km), do the above to setup the encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vindianajones","CreatedById":58043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T15:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot.

The timing for launch is a bit tricky, with Kerbal Engineer Redux you can display distance to target, wait until this is around 500-400km away and then launch, this only applies for LKO at a 90 degrees heading (aquatorial orbit) (thanks to Scott Manley).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. After launch you should get a decent approach at apoapsis, change your navball relation to Target, and start burning retrograde to kill all velocity in relation to the target. then you can start the approach (just burn a towards the target, I wouldn\u0027t go faster then 10 m/s under 1km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If you missed the target with the launch, you have to check if the target is infront or behind. if it\u0027s behind leave, push you\u0027re Periapsis to be higher then the targets orbit (it becomes the new Apoapsis). a few KM should be enough. Warp and check after one revoluton how much closer the approach becomes and continue warping until you get a decent approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If the target is infront, keep Apoapsis on targets orbit and leave the Periapsis a few kilometer below the targets orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re inclination is of (more then 0.5) you can adjust it on the Ascending or descending note (just set a node and pull normal/antinormal until inclination is around 0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps a bit, I get good approaches but I suck at the actual docking part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blackstar","CreatedById":61238,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T15:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Temstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESimple.
