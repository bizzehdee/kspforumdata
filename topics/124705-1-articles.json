Take off and land again without blowing up anything except the inevitable airbrakes. Ship is totally stock. MechJeb is allowed, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll help you much. I call it the Flame Dart for all of the times I\u0027ve accidentally overheated and exploded. Be warned, watching it steer itself on SAS is kinda hypnotic.
