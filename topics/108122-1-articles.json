If you could keep the internals cool, there\u0027s no compelling reason why you couldn\u0027t sustain Mach 3 at SL. Now, I think it would be great if KSP engines modeled that, because then what you\u0027d get at SL is that you can continue pushing the engine far past what you \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E do, eventually leading to the turbine failing, possibly in a spectacular uncontrolled fashion that destroys the entire region of the aircraft around the engine.

In KSP we need not include that additional control as an extra complication... we already have the engine overheating mechanic in place. So running engines at full throttle for extended periods should cause the engines themselves to overheat much more quickly than it currently does. This gives the precooler a more significant purpose as well. Something like: with no precooler, start to overheat pretty much immediately at 100% throttle, engine explodes within 2 minutes. With a precooler, start to overheat after 2-3 minutes, engine explodes after about 10. Tweak the balance as required since I just made these up arbitrarily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrow in \u0022afterburner\u0022 characteristics (massive thrust and fuel flow increase above ~90% throttle) for the turboramjet, put it all together and I think we start to get a more believable model even before we start to touch the atmosphere itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile every aircraft is going to be theoretically limited by heating of the skin given ideal engines, it shouldn\u0027t be the primary factor for the vast majority of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CodedThreat","CreatedById":142832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T05:22:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks basic.syntax for typing that out.
