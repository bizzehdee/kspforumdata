It specificly mentioned high mach levels which would generaly imply significantly higher than mach 1. Even mach 1 is not generaly done at low altitudes if for no other reason than folks dont like geting their ears blasted by a point blank sonic boom. Even the few jet aircraft that have been made that can reach multipule mach speeds do it at high altitude, I doubt their airframes could handle it at sea level and it would probably do bad things to the engiens as well."},{"CreatedByName":"mcdjfp","CreatedById":142713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T23:44:59Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know about others, but my biggest concern was the very moment the drag went away, it was suddenly increased a couple of days later.

Scott Manley for instance... he basically says \u0027the pods are not slowing down enough. It\u0027s very hard to do sub-orbital flights... you\u0027re having to run *[word unclear]* parachutes at high altitudes...\u0027 The drag was far too low. So, we upped the drag basically, to what it should have been... before the bug fix. And that also meant tweaking lift values, tweaking the parachutes again. \n\nWe\u0027ve not quite finished with the Aero balances... obviously quite a few people have been critical of it, BUT, it is working as intended at the minute.

In KSP we need not include that additional control as an extra complication... we already have the engine overheating mechanic in place. So running engines at full throttle for extended periods should cause the engines themselves to overheat much more quickly than it currently does. This gives the precooler a more significant purpose as well. Something like: with no precooler, start to overheat pretty much immediately at 100% throttle, engine explodes within 2 minutes. With a precooler, start to overheat after 2-3 minutes, engine explodes after about 10. Tweak the balance as required since I just made these up arbitrarily. \n\nThrow in \u0022afterburner\u0022 characteristics (massive thrust and fuel flow increase above ~90% throttle) for the turboramjet, put it all together and I think we start to get a more believable model even before we start to touch the atmosphere itself.\n\nWhile every aircraft is going to be theoretically limited by heating of the skin given ideal engines, it shouldn\u0027t be the primary factor for the vast majority of them."},{"CreatedByName":"CodedThreat","CreatedById":142832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T05:22:33Z","Content":"Thanks basic.syntax for typing that out.
