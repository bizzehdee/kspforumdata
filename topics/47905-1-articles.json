Whatever the delta-V map says for Moho should be taken with a grain of salt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you might want to try is what I did for my last mission there. I ignored the transfer window, and left Kerbin when it was at the ascending node. Setting the Pe down to intersect with Moho orbit at its descending node. It doesn\u0027t matter which node you use, leaving at descending is the same. At the solar Pe, i did a retro burn to change my arrival time back at Pe to rendezvous with Moho.

You\u0027d be surprised what you can do with just that small ship. If your main ship could push a small ship like that to an intercept with moho, that small ship could do the rest I\u0027m sure. And try to use the Skipper engine for your transfer burn. That engine is powerful and efficient you\u0027ll only have like a 2 minute burn at most.
