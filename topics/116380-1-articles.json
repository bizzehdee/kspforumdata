Now that things have settled down and I have a perfectly working install of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E for KSP v1.0.4 on both my Mac and my PC it\u0027s starting to get more and more attention from me. Particularly when I\u0027m bored and want to try something a bit different. Different, such as building a 100% solid launch vehicle. Or different as in flinging a probe out to Saturn. Y\u0027know, different.\n\nI won\u0027t bother to list the mods I\u0027m using (gads, what a list), though if you\u0027re curious about anything specific please ask. Mostly I\u0027m using procedural parts, Bobcat\u0027s old Soviet engines, and AIES bits for the miscellaneous other. As much as I\u0027d like to use the really nice looking bits, such as RadierNick\u0027s probes, I\u0027m trying to keep the main save playable on both OS-X and Win-32. Until we get 64-bit KSP for both the really nice stuff will have to wait.\n\nDon\u0027t expect to find a space program with any set direction or sense of purpose here. This is for the crazy stuff in a crazy universe: Our own.\n\n* * *\n\n**Launching the Brazilian VLS-1**\n\nFor no particular reason what-so-ever I decided to recreate the VLS-1 rocket of the Brazilian Space Agency in Kerbal Space Program Real Solar System. This is a peculiar, all-solid satellite launch vehicle created by a little-known space agency down near our planet\u0027s bulging midsection. That Brazil hasn\u0027t had more success or seen more investment in space operations is honestly a bit confusing given their primary launch site, Alc\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A2ntara, is only a couple degrees removed from the Equator. More details on that in the usual places, such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Space_Agency). The point of this post is the VLS and not ruminations on a country I know next to nothing about.\n\nAnyway, the VLS-1. While I stumbled across a diagram at some point in working on this (located in [this](http://www.aeb.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PNAE-Ingles.pdf) official document (large PDF warning)), my primary source of data was the (probably somewhat incorrect) Wikipedia page on the rocket. This rocket has been somewhat maligned for its all-solid approach following the explosion in 2003 that took 21 lives, but that is exactly what makes it an interesting bird form an engineering standpoint. So let\u0027s jump right in.\n\nThis is a simple 1-meter rocket that consists of three stages and four strap-on boosters. All solid. The rocket has 4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters at the top of the third stage, and is (allegedly) capable of placing 380kg into a 200km by 2000km Earth orbit. My early versions of the VLS-1 used winglets/fins, which were unnecessary. I ditched these in the final design. Details on the real thing [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLS-1).\n\n* * *\n\n**VLS-R0**\n\nMy first test flight, VLS-R0, was tuned to exactly the burn durations listed on Wikipedia. Boosters for 59 seconds, first stage for 58, second stage for 56 and the third stage for 68 seconds. I tuned the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and thrust to as close to the real-world values as procedural SRBs would allow, and let it fly.\n\n![20150715_kspr0002_vlsr0.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150715_kspr0002_vlsr0.jpg)\n\nThe result was predictable: The craft overheated and exploded before the boosters had burned out.\n\n![20150715_kspr0005_vlsr0.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150715_kspr0005_vlsr0.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**VLS-R1**\n\nMy second flight of the VLS-1 was more successful. I tuned each of the stages to have a more sane level of thrust, resulting in a longer burn duration for each. This version also featured the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and fuel as present in the actual VLS-1, though I removed these in the third test.\n\n![20150716_kspr0002_vlsr1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr0002_vlsr1.jpg)\n\n![20150716_kspr0008_vlsr1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr0008_vlsr1.jpg)\n\n![20150716_kspr0017_vlsr1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr0017_vlsr1.jpg)\n\nMuch happier result this time, with my relatively dumb payload almost making it into orbit. And by relatively dumb, I mean \u0022I forgot the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and, oh, by the way, this payload\u0027s balance is way off-center.\u0022 Had I been within the mass limits of the rocket (300kg) this poor dumb satellite would now be plaguing mission controllers all over the planet. Thankfully the payload was already too heavy for the rocket so it burned up over the Congo.\n\n![20150716_kspr0025_vlsr1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr0025_vlsr1.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**VLS-R2**\n\nThe third test was the most successful to date, and, thanks to my revised payload, was also the first to succeed in placing said payload into orbit. This was also the last flight which featured both winglets and lacked lifter-based \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. My slightly less dumb but still imbalanced payload was still operational when it crossed the Andes on its first orbit. It was suffering from the solar power glitch that plagued \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E in recent versions, though that is now thankfully corrected.\n\n![20150716_kspr1003_vlsr2.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr1003_vlsr2.jpg)\n\n![20150716_kspr1010_vlsr2.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr1010_vlsr2.jpg)\n\n![20150716_kspr1015_vlsr2.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr1015_vlsr2.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**VLS-R3** \n\nWith the launcher and the launch profile mostly perfected, it was time to sit down and make it accurate. This included removing the fins, reducing the size of the radial decouplers (I opted for the AIES ones instead of the fat ones from stock), and the reinclusion of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system on the launch vehicle. Unfortunately, my attempts at making the booster separation somewhat cleaner resulted in a far too close to reality case of the rocket exploding on the launchpad.\n\n[You don\u0027t really need to see another picture of something blowing up, do you?]\n\n* * *\n\n**VLS-R4**\n\nReview of the issue at hand revealed that using procedural SRBs as separation motors on a procedural \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E resulted in one of two things. First, the main SRBs now had zero thrust. Second, there was a random chance of the small separation motors exploding due to a random overheating bug. So for the final design I reverted back to the \u0022hope the atmosphere pulls them away\u0022 method of forcing the strap-on boosters to clear the rocket and conducted one final test.\n\nMy final design is slightly shorter than the 19.5m of the actual rocket (though KSP thanks it\u0027s taller on account of the launch clamps), but that\u0027s all because of the fairing. The strap-on boosters and the first stage are tweaked to where their atmospheric \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is 1.3, while the upper stages are closer to a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.5. Still a bit on the insane side, but somewhat less so than the real thing. Without throttling the g-forces on payloads could very well reach the point where apples become applesauce.\n\n![20150718_kspr0022_vlsr4.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150718_kspr0022_vlsr4.jpg)\n\n![20150718_kspr0024_vlsr4.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150718_kspr0024_vlsr4.jpg)\n\n![20150718_kspr0029_vlsr4.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150718_kspr0029_vlsr4.jpg)\n\n![20150718_kspr0042_vlsr4.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150718_kspr0042_vlsr4.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**Launching from Alc\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A2ntara**\n\nTo conduct the above tests I added Alc\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A2ntara both to regex\u0027s launch sites config and to the RemoteTech ground station configuration.

(I hope.) I\u0027ve landed kerbals on the Moon recently and plan to do a short write-up about my RSS moonshots over the last several releases. \n\nI\u0027ve been spending most of my RSS time exploring various parts mods and fidgeting with the install so I can get it to work on both Windows and OS-X, which aside from the 8k textures I\u0027m using on Windows has gone well enough. For now, here\u0027s a short (~45s) video I shot while building out the communications network in my current RSS save: \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/njSwAhEijPs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T08:22:25Z","Content":"**Random RSS Ramblings of a Mad Monk**\n\n**A Journey to the Moon**\n\n**The Early Attempts**\n\nMost of my adventures in RSS have been more of the kind I posted previously - picking a random real-world craft and trying to replicate it using procedural parts and the available engines. I\u0027ve dabbled here and there with building communication networks and sending \u0022kerbals\u0022 to orbit, but generally have spent more time dabbling in rocket and spacecraft engineering than in exploration. \n\nMy few early attempts at sending a spacecraft to the Moon mostly met with failure before reaching Earth Orbit. My first success at reaching the Moon was last July in KSP v0.23.5. An unnamed craft, likely some variant of Alpha or Beta (my test names are far less original than I usually admit), was launched from the Mid Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the DelMarVa peninsula. The launch vehicle was a strange beast of a craft that from my screenshots appears to have been largely cryogenic. (The distinct lack of notes related to this project is rather out of character for me.)\n\nRegardless, this monster that was little more than a giant tank of hydrogen became the first to enter Lunar orbit.\n\n![20140716_kspr0076_unknown.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20140716_kspr0076_unknown.jpg)\n\n![20140716_kspr0094_unknown.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20140716_kspr0094_unknown.jpg)\n\nThe second craft to successfully reach the Moon was a somewhat more conventional design. Launched later the same day from Cape Canaveral, the \u0022Lunar Comms-A\u0022 was adapted from my then-standard geostationary communications satellite. Its Mk5 launch vehicle was likewise a slightly heavier variant of my usual geostationary launch vehicle. The plan was to place a couple of these in Lunar orbit in preparation for a surface landing.\n\n![20140716_kspr0116_lunarcomms.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20140716_kspr0116_lunarcomms.jpg)\n\n![20140716_kspr0131_lunarcomms.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20140716_kspr0131_lunarcomms.jpg)\n\nThat surface landing never came and the Lunar program was abandoned. In time the world forgot.\n\n* * *\n\n**If You Believe....**\n\nFast forward to July of this year and KSP v1.0.4. While I was playing around with the various parts packs to find what I want to use long-term, I decided to pull up the FASA Apollo and take it for a spin. My first launch was less than stellar and fell more than 600m/s short of the Lunar transfer burn. I completed the TLI using the command module\u0027s supply of fuel, thinking I might just be able to complete the capture at the Moon and land. \n\nNot only was I wrong, but the poor kerbals riding along on the short Apollo died when their craft exploded due to an overheat bug or a part that hadn\u0027t been updated to the proper heat values. (I think it was the floats.) \n\n![20150727_kspr0009_apollo.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150727_kspr0009_apollo.jpg)\n\n![20150727_kspr0016_apollo.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150727_kspr0016_apollo.jpg)\n\nThe next attempt was far more successful. Caranna and Ermore Kerman became the first to land on the Moon following a launch form Earth. When asked by reporters whether the two brave kerbals and their friend in orbit, Dunbart, had been returned to Earth, the press secretary Pleaded the 5th. \n\n![20150728_kspr_0004_moonlanding.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150728_kspr_0004_moonlanding.jpg)\n\n![20150728_kspr_0010_moonlanding.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150728_kspr_0010_moonlanding.jpg)\n\n![20150728_kspr_0019_moonlanding.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150728_kspr_0019_moonlanding.jpg)\n\n![20150728_kspr_0027_moonlanding.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150728_kspr_0027_moonlanding.jpg)\n\n![20150728_kspr_0031_moonlanding.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150728_kspr_0031_moonlanding.jpg)\n\n![20150728_kspr_0036_moonlanding.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150728_kspr_0036_moonlanding.jpg)\n\n![20150728_kspr_0040_moonlanding.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150728_kspr_0040_moonlanding.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**... They Put a Bot on the Moon**\n\nLanding kerbals on the Moon is so easy that it\u0027s almost cheating. Landing an automated probe is another thing entirely, and that was to be the next goal of my resurrected Lunar program. First up: The Vandal Probes. Making use of the recently developed \u0022Gargantua\u0022 4 meter launch vehicle, these probes usually involved a combination of orbiter and lander. \n\nThe Gargantua, developed for placing large communications satellites into Geostationary Earth Orbit, consists of three principal stages. The first stage, fueled by KeroLox, uses a pair of RD-146 engines. All subsequent stages are HydroLox, making use of two cryogenic engines: the LR-87 and the NK-33. Further, four hard points are available for the use of strap-on solid boosters. \n\nThe majority of these launches occurred at night, as this game is starting at day 0 in year 1, and the most favorable inclinations for Lunar launches in the Winter of 1951 happen to be at night. All Vandal launches have taken place at Brownsville, TX.\n\nVandal 1, seen here launching at sunset, successfully reached both Lunar orbit and the surface of the Moon. Unfortunately its speed at contact with the surface was unfavorable for its survival. Or the survival of any of its constituent atoms for that matter. The orbiter it left behind, however, has been tremendously useful to subsequent missions.\n\n![20150808_kspr0109_vandal1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0109_vandal1.jpg)\n\n![20150808_kspr0155_vandal1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0155_vandal1.jpg)\n\n![20150808_kspr0170_vandal1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0170_vandal1.jpg)\n\n![20150808_kspr0173_vandal1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0173_vandal1.jpg)\n\nVandal 2 exploded shortly after reaching orbit due to the part-clipping overheat bug and was otherwise unremarkable. \n\nThe landing attempt by Vandal 1 made it rather clear that I needed a more sophisticated method for landing autonomous craft than maneuver nodes and RemoteTech\u0027s cranky flight computer. So I finally bit the bullet and installed kOS. To get my bearings with this strange new scripting language I launched a small toy satellite, once again returning to the Brazilian VLS.\n\n![20150808_kspr0224_vlskos.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0224_vlskos.jpg)\n\n![20150808_kspr0229_vlskos.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0229_vlskos.jpg)\n\nThe LEO-Comms A \u0022VLS-kOS\u0022 was poked, prodded and spun around like a top as I felt my way around kOS and its internals. Its job complete, the small test sat was dropped back into the atmosphere and disposed of with fire.\n\nChanges were made to the Vandal landers to correct the overheat bugs encountered on both the Vandal 2 and Vandal 3. Vandal 4 saw a change in the standard pattern with the orbiter having been replaced by a primary descent stage. Unfortunately, the fuel not burned off from the lander during what would have been the bulk of its descent left it too heavy to land at the end of its descent, and the Vandal 4 met its end at over 90m/s. \n\n![20150808_kspr0263_vandal4.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0263_vandal4.jpg)\n\nA few quick revisions to the lander and the Vandal 5 was ready for its attempt at Lunar glory. It merely added its matter to the ancient dust.\n\n![20150808_kspr0283_vandal5.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0283_vandal5.jpg)\n\nVandal 6 decided to explode multiple times shortly after launch, so Vandal 7 became the next revision of the project. This time the lander had more than enough thrust to properly complete the descent, though it still lacked engines capable of being throttled. The Vandal 7 also saw a return to the orbiter-lander combination. \n\nThe Vandal 7 was to be the last of these probes, though it crashed more times than I care to think about. Unlike previous failures, each taking the better part of two hours to reach their failure point, this mission was not going to fail. Working from a quicksave in Lunar orbit, the landing software and process was iterated, updated and revised. Each revision and test from that savepoint taking 20 minutes to reach their final outcome. Yet eventually the goal was accomplished: Soft Lunar Touchdown.\n\n![20150809_kspr0303_vandal7.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150809_kspr0303_vandal7.jpg)\n\n![20150809_kspr0315_vandal7.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150809_kspr0315_vandal7.jpg)\n\n![20150809_kspr0364_vandal7.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150809_kspr0364_vandal7.jpg)\n\n![20150809_kspr0383_vandal7.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150809_kspr0383_vandal7.jpg)\n\nThe exact definitions of \u0022soft\u0022 and \u0022touchdown\u0022 being a bit open for interpretation. On what was to be the final attempt of the weekend, the lander exhausted its onboard fuel just a short distance above the surface. The bouncing and rolling that followed didn\u0027t break any major pieces of the craft off, so it\u0027s good enough for me. Sure, it\u0027s a bit dinged up with only one solar panel still working, but it\u0027s on the Moon.\n\n* * *\n\nWith that milestone \u0022completed\u0022, my RSS/RO exploration project can move into its next phase: Mars. Though I might spend a few more days perfecting my automated Moon landing script before I fling something off to good old Ares.

Weird. Fixed that, all seems well with the world, installed a couple other small mods and got back into RSS.\n\nToday I returned to the final planned probe in Project Vandal - The Vandal 8. This was physically identical to the Vandal 7, but I\u0027ve put in some work to clean up the landing software. It\u0027s still the ultimate hack job of a script, but for the most part it worked.... Unfortunately the craft didn\u0027t. The lander encountered a strange bug during the descent that prevented certain things from working - such as the lights. And the landing gear. A reload from the quicksave fixed the landing legs (thankfully), but not the lights. No big deal. Descent started from 82km for a \u0022targeted\u0022 landing in the region of Mare Nectaris.\n\n![20150907_kspr0428_vandal8.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150907_kspr0428_vandal8.jpg)\n\nFast forward 20 minutes to the touchdown. The script was working perfectly, and even brought the lander down nicely to a few m/s rate of descent. The plan was to \u0022drop\u0022 the lander from a 5 meter height and have it land. Vertical speed at contact should not have been more than 3m/s, and wasn\u0027t, but unfortunately the legs were a bit too \u0022springy\u0022, and the lander bounced. The craft might have stayed upright had the RCS not decided to freak out... I have no idea what was going through that lander\u0027s mind, but in the opinion of my kOS script it was \u0022landed\u0022 and should have been holding itself locked upwards.\n\nA third attempt at landing from a quicksave was considered, but I ultimately decided the end would be identical: Another Vandal sitting on its side.\n\n![20150907_kspr0438_vandal8.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150907_kspr0438_vandal8.jpg)\n\n![20150907_kspr0439_vandal8.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150907_kspr0439_vandal8.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n**Project Gothic**\n\nBut enough about Vandal. Vandal is behind us, Project Gothic is ahead. Intended to be an evolved version of Vandal, Gothic will start with a somewhat heavier lander and orbiter combination, and will ultimately end with a lander that is heavy and capable enough to deliver a crew to the surface and return them to orbit. The orbiter for the first several Gothic missions will be a heavy communications satellite, used both for Lunar communications and to act as a relay into the deeper Solar System. Mars is on the horizon....\n\nThe first Gothic payload is almost ready, all that needs be done is to develop the control software and find a launch vehicle powerful enough to deliver it to the Moon. And maybe ditch those radiator panels... needs some testing (and some heat control system that actually works in RSS/RO).\n\n![20150907_kspr9003_gothic1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150907_kspr9003_gothic1.jpg)\n\nI expect the first Project Gothic launch to be in two or three weeks.... It\u0027s the busy season again, and a couple of slightly unplanned trips are coming up in the next two weeks. So we\u0027ll see.... Still a bit of dev work to do on that, and as the Gothic landers will have throttle-able engines I\u0027ll need to write legit landing software. And being able to target specific landing sites would be extremely useful.\n\n* * *\n\n**Project Cicero**\n\nSimultaneously, Project Cicero will develop the tools needed for delivering crews to orbit and keeping them there indefinitely. And maybe in letting them come home.... Maybe. I have yet to choose the crew delivery vehicle for Project Cicero, but I don\u0027t intend to use any of the capsules in FASA. Not that I dislike FASA, but most of that was 50 years ago. And, though I haven\u0027t updated the Solar System configuration to one that uses a more recent Epoch, I\u0027m operating as though this RSS save is somewhat current. (Maybe in time I\u0027ll whip up an RSS config that doesn\u0027t start in 1951. Shouldn\u0027t be all that difficult... the numbers are easy enough to come by.)\n\nProject Cicero will be the test bed for technology needed to land crews on the Moon and beyond, and will use much of what\u0027s developed for Gothic in doing so. Both projects will merge into a single, large project in the future.\n\nThat\u0027s all for now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-08T03:35:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2015 03:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T08:46:10Z","Content":"Anything else?

The fine folk over at the Schlitterbahn (which didn\u0027t exist in 1950) will have front-row seats once rocket launches become routine, assuming they end up building a Schlitterbahn there in this now screwed-up timeline. And Mexico may end up with some rockets that took wrong turns, but hopefully we can avoid provoking a war. \n\nThe first object to slip above 100km was the first sounding rocket we launched: The Rio Grande Sounder. This brass-trimmed beauty propelled its steampunk bullet high enough to win a very small contract reward, and even survived reentry. The science payload was recovered in the deserts to the north of Brownsville.\n\n![20161016_0004_riogrande.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20161016_0004_riogrande.jpg)\n\nNext up were a long series of failures. Well, that\u0027s not entirely fair, as the launch of the Trinity sounding rocket did reach way up into space (apoapsis above 300km). Development of orbital rocketry is not proceeding well; and two variants have developed: Gulf (an R-7 clone) and Bayou (kinda-sorta-Atlas? using pieces from Gulf). The first launch of Gulf (Gulf Alpha: 1951 d302) failed milliseconds after launch when the onboard flight computer shut down. Apparently none of the engines were properly tagged for kOS. This caused minor damage to the launch pad and wounded the boss\u0027 pride a bit. \n\n![20161016_0017_gulf.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20161016_0017_gulf.jpg)\n\nThe next Gulf launch, Gulf Beta, succeeded in reaching out into the Gulf of Mexico, before the flight computer shut down while attempting fairing deployment. The guidance script was expecting the fairings to use ModuleDecouple, when instead they\u0027re using something else that will need to be teased out of the system.\n\nPhotographers also noted the fairings were exhibiting some \u0022shader issues\u0022, otherwise known as Glitch.\n\n![20161016_0022_gulf.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20161016_0022_gulf.jpg)\n\nMore debugging of hundred-ton kerosene-filed darts next time, whenever that is."},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-16T18:14:12Z","Content":"This is a nice series!

A small machine launched yesterday morning from the shores of South Texas has become the first artificial object to enter Earth\u0027s orbit. Officially named Gulf Zeta and designated 1953-001A, the craft has been nicknamed Zinger by the many who have heard its zinging and beeping sound on the 740 kHz frequency, interrupting radio news programs from here to Canada. Officials at the Federal Communications Commission were unavailable for comment regarding the illegal use of this radio space.\n\nThe Texas-based Random Aerospace was believed defunct after facing heavy fines and penalties in the first quarter of 1952. The largest of their losses were due to the failure of the Gulf Delta spacecraft and the contract attached to it. Despite having won an astronomical lawsuit against the rocket firm, their primary benefactor instead offered yet another launch contract of the same rates and term. The advance of said contract offset the losses incurred by failing the previous, and allowed these pesky mad scientists to continue to annoy the hard-working citizenry of the world. Allegations of money laundering between the two firms has attracted the interest of the Texas Attorney General.\n\nThe previous four launches in this class have mercifully ended in failure, otherwise our skies would be polluted with who knows how many zinging objects of major annoyance. The most recent of these failures, Gulf Epsilon, was blamed on issues in the machine\u0027s control mechanisms. Gulf Delta, the subject of last year\u0027s legal dispute, tore itself free from its moorings, leaving a large portion of the spacecraft on the launch pad while continuing onwards to space, only to rain burning hot death down on unsuspecting retirees in the Florida Keys.\n\nA lucky accident nearly saved us from this fate, as one of the engines on the Zinger\u0027s many rocket \u0022stages\u0022 suffered what the mad scientists called a \u0022burn-through\u0022 event. Said engine was unfortunately able to continue powering its way through its appointed task and onwards to its eternal rest in the black beyond the sky.\n\nA rather nondescript metal barrel resembling a trash can or small oil drum, Zinger is expected to remain in orbit for the indefinite future. Its batteries will die out within the next several months, and our radios will hopefully return to their normal static. With luck one of the other great powers of the world will send a similar device with the means to silence this pest long before then.\n\n![20161016_0103_zinger.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20161016_0103_zinger.jpg)\n\n![20161016_0120_zinger.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20161016_0120_zinger.jpg)\n\n![20161016_0124_zinger.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20161016_0124_zinger.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-13T09:20:23Z","Content":"**2017-04-13 - A Late Yuri\u0027s Night**\n\nIt doesn\u0027t get much more random than this.

I had to tweak a few things, nudge a few others, but in the end I had a working spacecraft.\n\nTest flight? Bah. This was the test flight. What could go wrong?\n\nI pulled up the ever-faithful wikipedia and read up on the Vostok 1\u0027s actual orbit. I then pulled up an orbital calculator to determine my launch azimuth, updated my Soyuz launch script to handle the Vostok ([available here!](https://github.com/cydonian-monk/kOS-Scripts/blob/master/awayvostok.ks)), and then let the mission fly itself.

So what could possibly be the problem?\n\nFast-forward 90 minutes or so and I was all ready for the deorbit burn. The various documents scattered across the intertubes tell me the reentry burn for Vostok 1 took place somewhere over Egypt (give or take). So I did the same. Except, well, my orbital parameters were a bit different. I \\_suspect\\_ the Vostok 1 climbed to its periapsis and then burned level until it hit its apoapsis somewhere on the opposite side of the planet from the Republics. Guess I could go check that, too, but by this point it was too late.\n\n![20170413_ksp0198_vostok1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20170413_ksp0198_vostok1.jpg)\n\nThe little bit of gas in the space bug\u0027s tail wasn\u0027t enough to bring poor Yuri down inside the Soviet Union. Instead his reentry was delayed by 15 minutes or so, meaning he would land in the cold Northern oceans, likely freezing to death or more likely drowning.\n\n![20170413_ksp0232_vostok1.jpg](http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20170413_ksp0232_vostok1.jpg)\n\nOr that\u0027s what might have happened had the Vostok\u0027s drogue chute survived reentry. Or had Yuri\u0027s ejector chutes actually bitten into the air once he was free of his spacecraft. Unfortunately for Yuri neither of those happened, and he slammed into the ocean at speeds unbecoming a living person.\n\nOops.\n\nI know what the problem is with the personal chutes (my older fork of Vanguard doesn\u0027t support Real Chutes.... Double oops). I\u0027m not sure if changing the reentry orientation will help preserve the capsule drogue chute (facing up instead of down), but ultimately that wouldn\u0027t be enough to save poor Yuri anyway. Maybe the next \u0022volunteer\u0022 will have more luck. And maybe I\u0027ll figure out the actual launch corridor.\n\nA shout-out to any of you bored souls that joined in for the music and the scenic low-orbit views.
