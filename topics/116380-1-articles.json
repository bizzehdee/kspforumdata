Now that things have settled down and I have a perfectly working install of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E for KSP v1.0.4 on both my Mac and my PC it\u0027s starting to get more and more attention from me. Particularly when I\u0027m bored and want to try something a bit different. Different, such as building a 100% solid launch vehicle. Or different as in flinging a probe out to Saturn. Y\u0027know, different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI won\u0027t bother to list the mods I\u0027m using (gads, what a list), though if you\u0027re curious about anything specific please ask. Mostly I\u0027m using procedural parts, Bobcat\u0027s old Soviet engines, and AIES bits for the miscellaneous other. As much as I\u0027d like to use the really nice looking bits, such as RadierNick\u0027s probes, I\u0027m trying to keep the main save playable on both OS-X and Win-32. Until we get 64-bit KSP for both the really nice stuff will have to wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t expect to find a space program with any set direction or sense of purpose here. This is for the crazy stuff in a crazy universe: Our own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunching the Brazilian VLS-1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor no particular reason what-so-ever I decided to recreate the VLS-1 rocket of the Brazilian Space Agency in Kerbal Space Program Real Solar System. This is a peculiar, all-solid satellite launch vehicle created by a little-known space agency down near our planet\u0027s bulging midsection. That Brazil hasn\u0027t had more success or seen more investment in space operations is honestly a bit confusing given their primary launch site, Alc\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A2ntara, is only a couple degrees removed from the Equator. More details on that in the usual places, such as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Space_Agency\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWikipedia\u003C/a\u003E. The point of this post is the VLS and not ruminations on a country I know next to nothing about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the VLS-1. While I stumbled across a diagram at some point in working on this (located in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.aeb.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PNAE-Ingles.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E official document (large PDF warning)), my primary source of data was the (probably somewhat incorrect) Wikipedia page on the rocket. This rocket has been somewhat maligned for its all-solid approach following the explosion in 2003 that took 21 lives, but that is exactly what makes it an interesting bird form an engineering standpoint. So let\u0027s jump right in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a simple 1-meter rocket that consists of three stages and four strap-on boosters. All solid. The rocket has 4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters at the top of the third stage, and is (allegedly) capable of placing 380kg into a 200km by 2000km Earth orbit. My early versions of the VLS-1 used winglets/fins, which were unnecessary. I ditched these in the final design. Details on the real thing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLS-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVLS-R0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first test flight, VLS-R0, was tuned to exactly the burn durations listed on Wikipedia. Boosters for 59 seconds, first stage for 58, second stage for 56 and the third stage for 68 seconds. I tuned the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and thrust to as close to the real-world values as procedural SRBs would allow, and let it fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150715_kspr0002_vlsr0.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150715_kspr0002_vlsr0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe result was predictable: The craft overheated and exploded before the boosters had burned out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150715_kspr0005_vlsr0.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150715_kspr0005_vlsr0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVLS-R1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy second flight of the VLS-1 was more successful. I tuned each of the stages to have a more sane level of thrust, resulting in a longer burn duration for each. This version also featured the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and fuel as present in the actual VLS-1, though I removed these in the third test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150716_kspr0002_vlsr1.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr0002_vlsr1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150716_kspr0008_vlsr1.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr0008_vlsr1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150716_kspr0017_vlsr1.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr0017_vlsr1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch happier result this time, with my relatively dumb payload almost making it into orbit.

This was also the last flight which featured both winglets and lacked lifter-based \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. My slightly less dumb but still imbalanced payload was still operational when it crossed the Andes on its first orbit. It was suffering from the solar power glitch that plagued \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E in recent versions, though that is now thankfully corrected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150716_kspr1003_vlsr2.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr1003_vlsr2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150716_kspr1010_vlsr2.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr1010_vlsr2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150716_kspr1015_vlsr2.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150716_kspr1015_vlsr2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVLS-R3 \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the launcher and the launch profile mostly perfected, it was time to sit down and make it accurate. This included removing the fins, reducing the size of the radial decouplers (I opted for the AIES ones instead of the fat ones from stock), and the reinclusion of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system on the launch vehicle. Unfortunately, my attempts at making the booster separation somewhat cleaner resulted in a far too close to reality case of the rocket exploding on the launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[You don\u0027t really need to see another picture of something blowing up, do you?]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVLS-R4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReview of the issue at hand revealed that using procedural SRBs as separation motors on a procedural \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E resulted in one of two things. First, the main SRBs now had zero thrust. Second, there was a random chance of the small separation motors exploding due to a random overheating bug. So for the final design I reverted back to the \u0022hope the atmosphere pulls them away\u0022 method of forcing the strap-on boosters to clear the rocket and conducted one final test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy final design is slightly shorter than the 19.5m of the actual rocket (though KSP thanks it\u0027s taller on account of the launch clamps), but that\u0027s all because of the fairing. The strap-on boosters and the first stage are tweaked to where their atmospheric \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is 1.3, while the upper stages are closer to a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.5. Still a bit on the insane side, but somewhat less so than the real thing. Without throttling the g-forces on payloads could very well reach the point where apples become applesauce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150718_kspr0022_vlsr4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150718_kspr0022_vlsr4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150718_kspr0024_vlsr4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150718_kspr0024_vlsr4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150718_kspr0029_vlsr4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150718_kspr0029_vlsr4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220150718_kspr0042_vlsr4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150718_kspr0042_vlsr4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunching from Alc\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A2ntara\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo conduct the above tests I added Alc\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A2ntara both to regex\u0027s launch sites config and to the RemoteTech ground station configuration.

My first success at reaching the Moon was last July in KSP v0.23.5. An unnamed craft, likely some variant of Alpha or Beta (my test names are far less original than I usually admit), was launched from the Mid Atlantic Regional Spaceport on the DelMarVa peninsula.

My first launch was less than stellar and fell more than 600m/s short of the Lunar transfer burn.

Landing an automated probe is another thing entirely, and that was to be the next goal of my resurrected Lunar program. First up: The Vandal Probes. Making use of the recently developed \u0022Gargantua\u0022 4 meter launch vehicle, these probes usually involved a combination of orbiter and lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gargantua, developed for placing large communications satellites into Geostationary Earth Orbit, consists of three principal stages. The first stage, fueled by KeroLox, uses a pair of RD-146 engines. All subsequent stages are HydroLox, making use of two cryogenic engines: the LR-87 and the NK-33. Further, four hard points are available for the use of strap-on solid boosters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe majority of these launches occurred at night, as this game is starting at day 0 in year 1, and the most favorable inclinations for Lunar launches in the Winter of 1951 happen to be at night. All Vandal launches have taken place at Brownsville, TX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVandal 1, seen here launching at sunset, successfully reached both Lunar orbit and the surface of the Moon. Unfortunately its speed at contact with the surface was unfavorable for its survival. Or the survival of any of its constituent atoms for that matter.

So I finally bit the bullet and installed kOS. To get my bearings with this strange new scripting language I launched a small toy satellite, once again returning to the Brazilian VLS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0224_vlskos.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150808_kspr0224_vlskos.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0229_vlskos.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150808_kspr0229_vlskos.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LEO-Comms A \u0022VLS-kOS\u0022 was poked, prodded and spun around like a top as I felt my way around kOS and its internals.

Vandal 4 saw a change in the standard pattern with the orbiter having been replaced by a primary descent stage. Unfortunately, the fuel not burned off from the lander during what would have been the bulk of its descent left it too heavy to land at the end of its descent, and the Vandal 4 met its end at over 90m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/rss/20150808_kspr0263_vandal4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220150808_kspr0263_vandal4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few quick revisions to the lander and the Vandal 5 was ready for its attempt at Lunar glory.

The Vandal 7 also saw a return to the orbiter-lander combination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vandal 7 was to be the last of these probes, though it crashed more times than I care to think about. Unlike previous failures, each taking the better part of two hours to reach their failure point, this mission was not going to fail. Working from a quicksave in Lunar orbit, the landing software and process was iterated, updated and revised. Each revision and test from that savepoint taking 20 minutes to reach their final outcome.

A small machine launched yesterday morning from the shores of South Texas has become the first artificial object to enter Earth\u0027s orbit. Officially named Gulf Zeta and designated 1953-001A, the craft has been nicknamed Zinger by the many who have heard its zinging and beeping sound on the 740 kHz frequency, interrupting radio news programs from here to\u00A0Canada. Officials at the Federal Communications Commission were unavailable for comment regarding the illegal use of this radio space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Texas-based Random Aerospace was believed defunct after facing heavy fines and penalties in the first quarter of 1952. The largest of their losses were due to the failure of the Gulf Delta spacecraft and the contract attached to it. Despite having won an astronomical lawsuit against the rocket firm, their primary benefactor instead offered yet another launch contract of the same rates and term. The advance of said contract offset the losses incurred by failing the previous, and allowed these pesky mad scientists to continue to annoy the hard-working citizenry of the world. Allegations of money laundering between the two firms has attracted the interest of the Texas Attorney General.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe previous four launches in this class have mercifully ended in failure, otherwise our skies would be polluted with who knows how many zinging objects of major annoyance. The most recent of these failures,\u00A0Gulf Epsilon, was blamed on issues in the\u00A0machine\u0027s control mechanisms. Gulf Delta, the subject of last year\u0027s legal dispute, tore itself free from its moorings, leaving a large portion of the spacecraft on the launch pad while continuing onwards to space, only to rain burning hot death down on unsuspecting retirees in the Florida Keys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lucky accident nearly saved us from this fate, as one of the engines on the Zinger\u0027s many rocket \u0022stages\u0022\u00A0suffered what the mad scientists called a \u0022burn-through\u0022 event. Said engine was unfortunately able to continue powering its way through its appointed task and onwards to its eternal rest in the black beyond the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA rather nondescript metal barrel resembling a trash can or small oil drum, Zinger is expected to remain in orbit for the indefinite future. Its batteries will die out within the next several months, and our radios will hopefully return to their normal static.

Except, well, my orbital parameters were a bit different. I _suspect_ the Vostok 1 climbed to its periapsis and then burned level until it hit its apoapsis somewhere on the opposite side of the planet from the Republics.
