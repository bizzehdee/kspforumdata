I got my hands dirty a little bit and tried it myself. I can safely say that I am no modder by a long shot, at the moment. If I took the time to learn everything that I need to know in order to make mods, I\u0027d might make something that will one day be used by the masses. Whenever I went to Kennedy Space Center, I was amazed and awed by the marvels that science put together to send men (and eventually women) into space. Exploration is in our DNA and the exploration of space is the next frontier. When you think of all the brain power to make\u00A0the technology to do that, it becomes bigger than anyone can possibly imagine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does this have to do with modding\u00A0you ask? Well, I\u0027ll tell you! Mod makers spend countless hours modelling and texturing, running the models through Unity and sorting through countless lines of code to make sure everything works as it should. They do this with no pay and are\u00A0underappreciated for the most part.\u00A0But, KSP gives a platform for the most avid dreamer of going into space and there is where the mod makers come into play. Making dreams a reality (well, a KSP reality) is something that most people do not realize when they get a mod they love. But, everyone who plays KSP shares the same vision of exploring space. But, I feel that mod makers have a bigger dream.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, take time out of your day to thank your favorite mod maker. If they have a place to donate a cup of coffee, do so. If i had the money, I\u0027d give them all a good portion of cash just to make it worth their while. Because I have a dream, too. Thanks to KSP and mod makers, the dream is alive and well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESo Thank You Mod Makers for making dreams come true!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"evileye.x","CreatedById":153755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-17T18:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I call perfect timing: right after console release\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ixenzo","CreatedById":153148,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-17T19:05:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP in its form is and has been a barebones physics engine with minimal and illogical (from realism standpoint) content.
