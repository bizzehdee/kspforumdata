Performing a suicide burn at periapsis of an elliptical orbit is really no different in terms of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv than first circularizing and then performing a suicide burn. The only difference is that in the first case you burn right through the point where the orbit is circularized, while in the second case there is a pause in the action. The advantage or circularizing first, as Warzouz said, is that you can then select any site along your orbital path to land.

For my one and only Tylo landing, the stage I used for the suicide burn had an initial TWR of only about 1.
