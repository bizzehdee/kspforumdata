Performing a suicide burn at periapsis of an elliptical orbit is really no different in terms of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv than first circularizing and then performing a suicide burn. The only difference is that in the first case you burn right through the point where the orbit is circularized, while in the second case there is a pause in the action. The advantage or circularizing first, as Warzouz said, is that you can then select any site along your orbital path to land.

Orbital velocity around Tylo is much higher than any other airless body, which means that the duration of the suicide burn is much longer than other places. Unless you have a very high TWR, this can result in a considerable loss of altitude during the burn. The initial altitude must be high enough to account for this. For my one and only Tylo landing, the stage I used for the suicide burn had an initial TWR of only about 1.

(Yes, you will need fuel to take off again) and try a few different engines, watching the TWR and the deltaV. The gotcha is the destination-gravity. Your TWR needs to be greater than local gravity. I have built a few landers with those small radial rockets. 1000Kg landed on Mun needs more thrust to balance the gravity than 1000Kg landed on Minmus.\n\nThe basic Rocket Equation shows that the faster you burn the fuel in these conditions, the more deltaV you get. That\u0027s what a suicide burn does. If you need to burn X units of fuel per second to balance gravity and your system can burn X \u002B Y in total, only the Y gives you deltaV. The precise calculation is a bit more tricky, so I shall keep it quick and dirty. if you need a 10-second burn, the total fuel is 10 ( X \u002B Y ) and 10 Y is what stops you. Double the excess thrust, halve the burn time (This is where the rocket equation comes in: it isn\u0027t really this simple) and the total is 5 X \u002B 10 Y So you have saved 5 X fuel.\n\nNow, what does this mean for system weight?\n\nCheck the [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Liquid_Fuel_Engines](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Liquid_Fuel_Engines) for the stock parts.\n\nThe first thing to check is the TWR for the engine. Both the OV-10 Monopropellant Engine and the Rockomax 24-77 have the same TWR of 22.7, which is pretty good. The Rockomax has a slight edge on isp, which means it will use a little less fuel, and if you think you will need it in atmospere, the margin is bigger. Engine mass is 90 Kg.\n\nLet\u0027s assume 20000Kg on Minmus, which is rather large for a lander. Both these engines have 20 kN of thrust, which mean 1 Newton per kilogram, which is 1 m/s^2^ total acceleration. Not enough.\n\nTwo of these engines gives us 2 m/s^2^ and Minmus gravity is 1.635 m/s^2^ so we have the excess to stop. But the useful acceleration is only 0.365 m/s^2^which is rather pitiful.\n\nAdd a third engine, which feels more balanced as well although two will work, and your useful thrust is is nearly quadrupled to 1.365 m/s^2^\n\nA fourth engine, for a total increase of 180 Kg over the minimum, gives us 2.365 m/s^2^That reduces the burn time a lot, by a factor of more than 6. What does this mean for the fuel consumption? That table shows the Rockomax burning 9.3 Kg/s to balance Minmus gravity. So for every 6 seconds of the minimal system\u0027s burn you can save 5 seconds worth of fuel, which is conveniently half the mass of one of those engines. So if you expect more than 24 seconds, using four of those engines instead of two will pay off in mass.\n\n24 seconds with the minimal 2-engine rig is less than 9 m/s\n\n**Radial Engines?**\n\nI do have a preference for radial engines for landers. There is also the Rockomax 48-7S which has a thrust of 30 kN and a TWR of 30.7 to work with. It\u0027s a bit more of a fiddle to place them, and for a practical suicide burn the weight difference seems marginal. You don\u0027t need automatically need the weight of landing legs for radial engines, though they give you more margin for error.\n\n**The** [**Tsiolkovsky rocket equation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation)**.**\n\nThis is really old, and at the core of rocket design. It\u0027s described on the Kerbal Wiki in this tutorial: [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Advanced_Rocket_Design#Delta-V](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Advanced_Rocket_Design#Delta-V) and you will notice that time doesn\u0027t really come into it. Well, I hope I have showed why, when working against gravity, a faster fuel burn pays off.\n\n**Other Factors.**\n\nThis is where there might be a weakness in the simulation. The structure of the craft has limits in Kerbal Space Program. Connections between parts will break under sufficient load. But these limits are generally quite high. You could build a real lander with less inherent strength and reduce weight, because of the low gravity it operates in. KSP sets these limits quite high. Some real-world rockets have needed them insanely high. The Sprint missile, developed in the Apollo era, accelerated at 100g [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28missile%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28missile%29) . The warhead massed about 70 kg which meant the support structure has to be able to support 7 tonnes in flight.\n\nOn the other hand, while the Apollo LM was lightly constructed to land on the Moon, it had to survive launch too. The design started with three landing legs, the most stable configuration was five, but the engineers compromised on four to save weight.\n\nAlso, a lot of the landing process is the deceleration from orbit. The gravity effect only bites in killing the vertical speed. Which is also why just blasting straight up on launch wastes fuel. You can do a vertical flight to Mun, but it\u0027s a rather crude and unsubtle way of doing the job."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T10:31:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can someone please explain why a suicide burn, or anything else, is more efficient than killing all velocity at Ap and guiding it straight down from there ?\n\nEdit: Not so sure my answer is the correct answer to your question because it looks as if you meant Pe. I left it because of the confusion over what a suicide burn is. But what you want to look at is vectorial sum (here we\u0027re talking about vector components, so it\u0027s really just Pythagorean theorem).\n\nYour method requires burning dV\u003Csub\u003Eorbital\u003C/sub\u003E at first, then dV\u003Csub\u003Evertical \u003C/sub\u003Eon the surface (suicide burn for a vertical free fall), in two separate burns.\n\nReal suicide burn (with a small deorbit burn to be on a balistic trajectory) do these two burns at the same time, burning retrograde. Since these two burn are component on the vertical and \u0022orbital\u0022 axis, their values are the same (or very close) to the ones in your methods, but by burning them together, they require SQRT(dV\u003Csub\u003Eorbital\u003C/sub\u003E^2^\u002B dV\u003Csub\u003Evertical\u003C/sub\u003E^2^) dV, which is less.\n\nBecause gravity is an acceleration, which means it will increase your vertical speed for every unit of time you spend on a ballistic trajectory.\n\nSince you want to nullify vertical speed for landing (else it\u0027s called a crash), all gained vertical speed will need to be shed burning vertically (consuming deltaV).\n\nYet reducing your vertical speed means you\u0027ll reach the surface later, thus increasing the amount of time you spend on a ballistic trajectory, thus increase your vertical speed more, thus requiring more deltaV to nullify it.\n\nTherefore you want to reduce your vertical speed as late as possible, yet early enough that it is about 0 when you reach the surface. That\u0027s the definition of a perfect suicide burn.\n\nThis assumed atmosphere-less body, obviously.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T11:17:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 11:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain H@dock**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T10:47:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can someone please explain why a suicide burn, or anything else, is more efficient than killing all velocity at Ap and guiding it straight down from there ?\n\nBecause of the Oberth effect.

Doing this without losing so much vertical that you hit a mountain at hypersonic velocity means burning a good chunk above the retrograde horizon, which in turn wastes dV.

A weak engine will have to pitch so much to maintain vertical that it begins to waste again.
