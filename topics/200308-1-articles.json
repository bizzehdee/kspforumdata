Guidelines will be added in based on a democratic system, of course this is\u00A0 a work in progress and it will slowly be developed to the point where we will have weekly polls and we we debate on an issue that need be taken care of. There will be a weekly paper that will go into the specifics of what the primary issue is and peoples ideas to solve said issue. Now of course we are over a year away from the release of KSP2 but as I always say, \u0022A planned system is a working system.\u0022.
