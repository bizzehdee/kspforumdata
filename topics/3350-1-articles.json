This is where I\\\u0027m going to put out my new parts, reskins, what have you. Firstly, one of my favorite new mods is the Orion Drive provided by Technical Ben, but its\\\u0027 big problem is that, well, it tends to destroy everything that isn\\\u0027t an iPlate or a pod when used... so I went about tuning a few parts to be able to withstand the forces involved, and then decided to retex. I\\\u0027ll later remodel them.
