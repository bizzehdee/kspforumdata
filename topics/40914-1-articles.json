I ask this so I can utilze almost 100% of the UV space by means of resizing and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFace 1 has vertex coordinates of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0,0;0,32::32,0;32,32 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFace 2, of a separate seam has vertex coordinates of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E32,32;32,64::64,32;64,64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould I get all of the pixels on the edge, ie 0-32 and 32,32 as separate lines, or do the edges themselves count as pixels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm i going to have to size it down slightly smaller than a 32x texture face? Or can I, in a image manipulation program like gimp or photoshop, get a perfect 32x texture face for each, utilizing what happens to be a 1042x1024 sprite map?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stubbles","CreatedById":36867,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T02:47:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe edge is simply the edge of the island.

You need edge padding and space between each UV island, in order to prevent mip bleeding. The amount of padding needed goes up with texture size.

Even if you use 100% of the space, if it\u0027s for an unwrapped model and not used as BSP style texture, you will get some kind of bleed.

I work with transparencies in a XML multi-layer image for editing, then export to PNG. The transparent square indicators is how i determine different faces from other sections...do I extend the texture out 4 pixels in all directions from that face*If i were to use a 4 pixel padding* or leave it a solid color, or even transparent as i have been doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can say this, I did notice quite a bit of \u0022mip bleed\u0022 on a few of my models, now that I know the cause, I can fix it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
