I mean, its not like anyone that I\u0027m aware of asked for a random mechanism that stopped stuff working and messed up engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be happier if the default was that it was off or tuned low and have the ability to turn it up to the current level as a hardcore option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree. i\u0027m gonna play at 50% reentry heat (dunno if that reduces vessel heat too, but s\u0027worth a try). I was never really crazy about heat (reentry or otherwise) anyways. Also, rl nukes had some kind of internal insulation system that didn\u0027t require 1000 wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei love the smell of melting engines in the morning, it smells like ... orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes.

The solid core design needs to be constructed of materials that remain strong at as high a temperature as possible. Nuclear reactions can create much higher temperatures than the temperatures the materials can withstand, meaning that much of the potential of the reactor for very high temperatures is sacrificed. Even more limiting is the cracking of fuel coatings due to the large temperature ranges (from 22 K up to 3000 K over the length of a 1.3 m fuel rod), and the necessity of matching coefficients of expansion in all the components.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:03:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIncorrect.
