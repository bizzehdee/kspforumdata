It would make sense if it would, since lift is a function of attitude plus a lifting constant...\n\nno the wings being upside down dont cause this, its because i have some wings sloped down its creating lift in the wrong direction as you can see in the picture, i have a mirrored wing angled in the opposite direction i was hoping this would create a neutral lift, the plane still flies but im having problems reaching orbit, so i was thinking it might not be getting enough overall lift."}]}
