There is at least one effort to rebuild that site from the source code and torrent that was released, and if that pans out, then the CKAN admins should be able to do a mass search/replace to switch everything over to the new site. If that happens, everything might start working fine again when it\u0027s done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a less perfect world, mod authors may need to update links one by one, or the new site may not materialize, or it may have worse reliability, etc. It\u0027s too soon to know at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T00:47:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread locked, please continue discussion of the KS shutdown \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132157-kerbal-stuff-closed-to-the-public/\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E so we are not flooded with duplicate threads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
