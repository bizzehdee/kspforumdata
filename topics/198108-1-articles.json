Assume that the maximum velocity of a given spacecraft is 0.990c, and that timewarp still has the same scale delimiters as KSP1: 100 000x is maximum timewarp, giving a Kerbin year at 92 sec/year. At this sort of scale, it would take about 20 minutes running at maximum timewarp and maximum theoretical speed (ignoring acceleration phases) to travel from the center of this imagined world, to the most extreme edge. It would take 40 minutes to go from extreme edge to opposite extreme edge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if the game is scaled down in terms of distance or number of stars, 500 places to visit sounds like a lot and \u0027only 50\u0027 seems like very few.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough we have no evidence to do so, I think it is reasonable to assume the game will be within these sorts of bounds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would disagree with your assumptions. I would assume a maximum velocity of around 0.1-0.2c (although 0.5 may be achievable if they have antiatter rockets, avoiding velocity faster than this also has the nice side-effect of making it Ok to ignore time dialation). Given the general 1/10th scale, I would expect the nearest star to be 0.45 light years, not 4.5. I would also expect maximum timewarp ot be at least 10x higher. So assuming 1/10th the velocities, 1/10th the distances, and 10x the time warp, the 20 minutes comes down to just 2 minutes... which seems fine to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe standard KSP system is smaller with less bodies than our system.

The main gameplay loop of KSP is building a rocket/spacecraft to solve a specific problem or puzzle and that calls more for a mix approach, one in which those two phases are not one after the other but they proceed in parallel, and the player is not \u0022forced\u0022 to do any transition, because sometimes you whant to build a 5 cores \u0022Saturn Heavy\u0022 while some other times you may want to send a probe to Duna and get as much science as possible with only 0.625 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour distintion of \u0022big rockets vs small rockets\u0022 is too much a \u0022black and white\u0022 one, you won\u0027t replace a comnet sat launch, a exploration rover to a new planet or a mapping satellite in search for new resource deposits with a skyscraper-sized colonization ship, as you progress in the game you\u0027ll need and want both at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s use a \u0022the Martian\u0022 mission profile as an example, yes, you use a big mothership to move the crew between Kerbin and Duna, but the robot reconnaissance for the landing location, the presupply missions, the HAB, the DAV will get there before the big mothership and using traditional \u0022small rockets\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is not Cities Skyline or Spore the point is not colonize, colonization is just an excuse to give you new and interesting rockets to design, just like the passengers and industries in OTTD (open source remake of Transporter Tycoon Deluxe) are just an excuse for you to play with train lines and a good one at that, you\u0027ll need to move several KSCs worth of mass to build your colonies and the ability to build new space centers on other celestial bodies will change your point of view for the next wave of missions (ever launched a Eeloo Apollo Style exploration mission or even a mere Bop commsat from Laythe?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, when you\u0027re bored with the system you\u0027re in, you build a huge colonization mothership and get off to another system, maybe searching for a Kerbin-like\u00A0 planet (huge boost in colony development and huge discounts on resource usage?) to colonize and start over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s coincidentally why I think that this game could go well even with \u0022only\u0022 3 or 4 additional star systems, it will never need more than what the Devs (and modders) can design manually, exploration shouldn\u0027t be \u0022how far I can go with the strongest engine and 20 minutes at the maximum timewarp\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
