Just a disclaimer before I write:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know game development is hard (I\u0027m part of a game dev team myself) but I love giving suggestions and feed back, so that\u0027s why I post a lot in this section :P.\u00A0My suggestion today is to improve the Kerbal Solar System a tiny bit today, and other things that I think would be awesome in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd bigger asteroids that spawn randomly in Kerbol orbit (ones we can orbit, such like Bennu and comet 67P)\u00A0The gravity there would be enough to have Kerbals walk on it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA sample return capsule to return experiments without returning the full craft. It would be a 1.25M part, with a parachute, the space for 2 experiments, and a little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E for orbital corrections.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd another star system to the game, one very far away. (It doesen\u0027t have to be a big star system, but maybe a Binary with 2-3 planets and a moon of some sorts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith the new star system you need a warp drive, or the ability to go at a percentage of the speed of light. It would take a fairly long while to get there, talking an upward of 20 In-Game years, depending of course on the speed you\u0027re going.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Kerbals have invented the warp drive, and can go to a new star system, that means more science, and wasted science is...well wasted, so adding more futuristic parts such as very high reliability high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E engines, with one major downfall, but isn\u0027t one so bad that makes the game unplayable. More powerful solar panels, etc. etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUnderwater Exploration. Seriously, water is cool and all, but we need some sort of boats and submarines, as well as some underwater easter eggs and geography. As in, maybe theres an underwater trench on Laythe or something.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEither Revamp or Remove Dres. It\u0027s an extra science load, but it\u0027s a fairly boring dwarf planet. Make it have more geographically appealing features. I know there is a mod that revamps dres, but it should be in the base game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGive Rovers and Space Stations a purpose apart from experience and vanity. You could make it so that Kerbals will perform things better in EVA while experimenting in space stations. Rovers could be able to explore certain kinds of areas better.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake space stations have maintenance. I\u0027m not the type of person to make things super realistic (although I do like a little element of realism) but Space Stations are not realistic at all. Space Stations should occasionaly have problems that would need to be fixed, like an oxygen leak or something. If not fixed, the space station segment will break off. A little bit of micro-management would be nice on Space Stations, even make it toggolable if possible \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIVA in command seats, or a first person mode.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other suggestion that people would like to be implimented but doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s not, is EVA\u0027ing inside your bigger Capsules and Crew parts. It\u0027s not important, but it would add a nice little feature to the game, for giggles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, thanks for reading and let me know what you think.

I think a station should gain Science as it is crewed in orbit, and the location and orientation of the orbit determines the amount of Science gained over time. The Science gains can run down over time so you have to keep visiting the station to replenish the supply of experiments and keep the science revenue coming.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally for my positives, I do think that some more IVA stuff would be good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really\u00A0don\u0027t like the idea of a warp drive, it goes against the sort of kerbal-realism involved in the game. There are mods which add warp drives and they don\u0027t really belong as part of stock in my opinion.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis also applies to the extra star system. While it\u0027d be cool to have a binary star in the game, in practice this is an impractical\u00A0feature for a space program game which obeys regular orbital mechanics and simulates more-or-less the operations that real space programs undertake or could in theory undertake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not add one or two more planets to the current system instead of making a whole new star system? Then there are more distant and difficult destinations to explore while still staying in the realms of Kerbal-realism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I disagree with your thoughts on Dres. If you\u0027ve done a thorough mission to Dres you\u0027d know that Dres is home to a massive trench, several kilometers deep and a very interesting geological feature indeed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlong-side this, Dres is the only celestial body where Asteroids spawn in orbit, meaning you can refuel in orbit there. Overall, I think it is the fact that it doesn\u0027t look all that interesting that is meaning few people visit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IronCretin","CreatedById":158162,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-24T19:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222771886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147934\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474707629\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002265526\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RatchetinSpace\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, RatchetinSpace said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a station should gain Science as it is crewed in orbit, and the location and orientation of the orbit determines the amount of Science gained over time.
