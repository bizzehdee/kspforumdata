It will be a handy resource with everything you need to know, from optimal vehicle design to knowing the right phase angle you need to get to a certain planet - it will have everything. It will be useful because it\u0027ll be a downloadable .pdf, so it can be accessed offline and can be printed. A lot more handy than looking up YouTube videos, I think.\n\nI made a mock-up in an hour or two yesterday with bare-bones info (mainly just to get the layout set up), the graphical look of the user guide is based off the recently-updated KSP website. I\u0027ll add an image to the mock-up to the bottom of this post, some of you may have seen it on the KSP subreddit already.\n\nWhat I need to know is this: what sort of information do you deem essential to know about when playing KSP? I asked for feedback on Reddit and this is what I have written down on my spider diagram so far, it\u0027s a bit ramble-y but hopefully it makes sense:\n\nVEHICLE DESIGN -\n\n- What each part type does\n- Engine ISP, Fuel Tank capacity, etc. at a glance\n- When it is suitable to use a certain part (i.e. Nerva for Interplanetary travel, Mainsail for heavy lifting)\n- Description of Resources (What Liquid Fuel, Xenon, Electrical Charge etc. is actually used for)\n- How to make optimal, aerodynamically-stable spaceplanes  \n\n    - Also how to make a rocket that doesn\u0027t flip around at 11km\n\n    [\\*]Guide to resource mining and how it works.\n\nTHE PLANETS (AND MOONS!) - \n\n- Orbital and escape velocities\n- Delta-V required to reach orbit around planets, land on planets, etc.  \n\n    - This could be shown like the delta-V map, perhaps\n\n    [\\*]Atmosphere present? At which altitude does it start?\n\n    [\\*]Number of biomes?\n\n    [\\*]Oxygen present?\n\n    [\\*]Phase and ejection angles\n\n    [\\*]Gravity at sea level\n\n    [\\*]Anomalies (nothing spoiler-y, of course!)\n\n    [\\*]Radius of the planets\n\n    [\\*]Maximum apoapsis before leaving the SOI\n\n    [\\*]Altitude for a geo-synchronous orbit\n\n    [\\*]TWR for liftoff\n\nGENERAL INFO -\n\n- General information about orbital mechanics\n\n- How to dock\n- Abbreviations (EVA, dV, TWR, LKO etc.) and other useful lingo.\n- Equations (How to calculate ISP, dV, TWR etc.)\n- UI explainations (the Navball, IVA view etc.)  \n\n    - How orbits actually work in relation to the navball, i.e. what happens to your orbit if you burn prograde, or anti-normal etc.\n\n    [\\*]Key bindings\n\n    [\\*]Useful part descriptions (Engine ISP, lift rating etc.)\n\n    [\\*]Advanced techniques (Aerobraking, gravity assists etc.)\n\n    [\\*]A guide to how Science/Career mode works, explaining each of the science modules, their science yields and purposes among other things.\n\n    [\\*]Essential mods and general info about KSP\u0027s modding community\n\nHere\u0027s the basic preview I made yesterday to show how it\u0027ll look:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![vWQLWzb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vWQLWzb.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Please, if you have any ideas for what sort of info should be added, please let me know!
