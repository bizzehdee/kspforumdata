I found that I was actually lugging more fuel than I needed on my second stages, so I decided to replace the half-tanks at the top with some RCS tanks, and add outward RCS thrusters for better mobility. During testing, and about halfway through atmo, I kinda fudged my accent vector and had to correct with RCS. After this I started noticing a large amount of natural yaw while at full engine throttle. With SCS and RCS on to correct, I finally hit apogee but by this time my yaw problem was outside my craft\\\u0027s flight envelope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter scrubbing the mission, it dawned on me that the RCS tanks must not be draining in a uniform manner. The exact same design with LFE tanks instead of RCS tanks doesn\\\u0027t manifest this instability. I know I\\\u0027ve seen someone on a youtube video (orbital garbage collector I think) have the tanks drain at the same time. Is this possible stock, or is it a game file tweak?
