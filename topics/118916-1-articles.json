I\u0027ve been struggling with control surfaces and aero these last few nights so I thought I might ask for help. A few questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I tried to make a tail with rudder for an airliner ( A300) And couldn\u0027t get it to work with node stack. The rudder would pitch but not yaw. So the only way I found is to export it as an horizontal stabilizer and use attach surface instead. So it is solved but I m still wondering if there is a trick to make it work in node stack?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I have spoilers on my wings and I would like to have them be used only to brake and tiny roll adjustment. But they can only go up so I use the moduleaerosurface I took from the stock airbrakes ( module control surface would make it go down through the wing right?) But then with that module I can\u0027t seem to activate it for roll. Only pitch and yaw are available. Any way to force that module to use roll? Any way to make modulecontrolsurface only go one way? ( green in the pic)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://lacroixdidier.com/temp/A300_Wing_CtrlSrf.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022A300_Wing_CtrlSrf.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Then there is the flaps problem. Right now it\u0027s just an animation and I use actiongroup to position them. But it doesn\u0027t work at all. The plane vibrates like crazy and accelerate super fast. When the animation is playing all is fine. And sometimes, below certain speed it stops the crazy vibration and acceleration with flaps in fixed position. So not much success there yet. Any tips on the method to include a good flaps system? Any idea why the vibration and acceleration? Any example of well functionning flaps in a mod? I couldn\u0027t find one. Only flaps used as control surfaces. And I would like to keep the translation before the rotation so I don\u0027t like that solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Any links to a good thread/tutorial on aero and so on in ksp is welcome. I haven\u0027t found much information yet, almost nothing about it in the compilation thread ( sticky). All tips, advices and good examples are welcome to.

It\u0027s getting weirder and more confusing every day. After 3 evenings spent fiddling with my wings I finally found out the engines are probably the problem regarding the vibration and crazy acceleration resulting from the vibration. Not sure yet what is wrong with those engines though. At first it seemed like my intake air parameter were overflowing and causing the problem. But further test didn\u0027t prove that to be entirely true. The problem is greatly reduced but still appears. Especially on descent at low altitude. Seems like a drag issue of some sort but I haven\u0027t found out how to get rid of it yet. It\u0027s the same wobbly disaster as timewarping a flying plane but without the timewarp :S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s the engines because when I replace them with stock engines it seems like the problem is gone. Even weirder, my flaps animation has absolutely no effect when I use my engines. But when I use stock engines with srfattach the flaps produce drag!! ( no lift though) I\u0027m puzzled. Any clues what is going on? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill need to sort out : - Vibration/ crazy physics ( could it be node stack engines? so srfAttach stock engines are fine? I need to test my engines in srfAttach when I have time. If not that I have no more clue what is going on with those engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Flaps producing drag but no lift ( is it possible to add a moduleliftingsurface to affect only one mesh in .mu file? or modulecontrolsurface with 0 ctrlsurfacerange would still produce the lift with animated parts? again plenty of tests to make when I have time if nobody knows)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - node stack rudder yaw instead of pitch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - finding a module for spoilerons using roll instead of yaw ( restricted modulecontrolsurface or less likely roll forced into moduleaerosurface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe updated \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.lacroixdidier.com/temp/A300.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecrafts\u003C/a\u003E (my engines and stock engines version) for any good samaritan with some understanding of aero.
