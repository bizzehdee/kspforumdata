ALL THE TIME. So due to wear the joints on the orange suits are not pressure-safe anymore, and on EVA they have to put on the standard-issue suits.\n\nOr something like that."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:36:14Z","Content":"My personal understanding is that when KSP originally only had the Jeb/Bob/Bill trio, their orange suits were inspired/based on NASA\u0027s pumpkin suits (the [LES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_Entry_Suit) and it successor, the [ACES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Crew_Escape_Suit)). These pressure suits were only worn during launch and re-entry, as the bright colors facilitate easier search \u0026 rescue operations; when astronauts go on EVA, they instead wear white EVA suits with better thermal properties.\n\nThe silver suits worn by the rookie Kerbalnauts that were added later were probably inspired by the Mercury/Gemini suits. This was, apparently, the only way at the time to distinguish between them and the veterans.\n\nPersonally, I think that all Kerbalnauts should wear orange suits, and veterans be denoted by special colored stripes on their shoulders / sleeves."},{"CreatedByName":"Fearlessjames118","CreatedById":44818,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:17:14Z","Content":"Ah!
