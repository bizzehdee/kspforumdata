Fired the engine in orbit of Kerbin and there is no sound, no flame graphic coming from the engine its self. The burn its self does work but as I said there\u0027s no sound nor flame graphic coming from the engine.\n\nThis is a Stock build unmodded and I have tested as much as I can.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"a2soup","CreatedById":68260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T10:04:02Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t the L2 Atlas Low-Profile Engine from the B9 Aerospace mod...?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T10:04:26Z","Content":"Hi jabbashouse, I\u0027m not familiar with this L2 Atlas Low-Profile engine in the stock game, can you please provide pics (use imgur.com) and your game logs (see the support stickies)\n\nNinja\u0027d\n\nMoving to modded, jabbashouse I suggest you reinstall B9."},{"CreatedByName":"jabbashouse","CreatedById":119643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T10:17:12Z","Content":"Hi all,\n\nCurrently reinstalling B9, see if that works.
