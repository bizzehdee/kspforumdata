You have 2 hours to restore EC after failure, and then they die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, without a healthy storage capacity for CO2/etc, it seems that recyclers often end up \u0027losing\u0027 CO2/etc if you leave a ship for longer then it can store built up CO2/etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, for a one man command pod you need a WHOLE lot of batteries to get to the moon. Thankfully they are VERY light. Its a shame fuel cells don\u0027t come earlyer, but basically you should stick to orbital hops and experimenting on various kerbin biomes till you unlock solar panels or take a WHOLE LOT of batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering that just a flyby of the mun can get enough science to pretty much unlock solar, its not a huge issue IMO to have one flight where you have a half ton of batteries on your 0.8ton command pod, just add more rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: A half ton of the smallest batteries would be 100 of Z-100! or 25 of the Z400. for a total energy capacity of 10,000 either way. Pretty sure thats good for a couple days. IMO its more a fault of the stock batteries being too light per part, then TAC requiring too much electricity. Once you get solar panels (And the nice inline batteries) these problems mainly go away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-07T21:20:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2017 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by BlackMoons\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Dry","CreatedById":163177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-07T21:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should mention this here, too:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58236-13-real-fuels-v1223-july-30/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3142674\u0026amp;embedComment=3142674\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a spreadsheet for TAC-LS into RealFuels ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LosWashos","CreatedById":168710,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T14:23:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have now updated to 13.4dev but now I got the problem that there is no usage of the LS-ressources at all and the monitoring shows somewhat like \u0022minus a few years and hours\u0022.
