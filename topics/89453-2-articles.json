Mesh mirroring does in fact happen when using mirror symmetry. This mirroring is along the X axis though, so it\u0027s possible some parts are aligned in such a way that you wouldn\u0027t see it.

I even saw a post from someone on reddit where they suggested trait/role effects and went into the detail and reasoning behind each one; excellent stuff. In hindsight I probably should have mentioned that we take into consideration the suggestions and brainstorming that comes out of the community. Like you say, it\u0027s a huge brainpool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
