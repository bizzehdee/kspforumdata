DLC dont pay the Bills. DLC was invented some years ago, as a way to press out more Money from da Kids, without enhancing Quality by just selling each bit separately. The Quality of the games would not enhance if 100 billion People buy the DLC. only the Wallets of the Shareholder will get better. A complete Game that once could have been purchased for 50$ now costs 500$ because it is sliced into 100 Pieces. Most People are just not enough enhanced in their mind to add all that together to realise that some games cost more than the Computer they are played on. Humans are dumb and the Developers just found out. The Game itself wont be any Better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDLC is not for Funding the Game, its for increasing someones Wallet.

Memory was measured in small tens of kilobytes, programs were mostly loaded from cassette tapes, or from 5 1/4 inch floppy discs - if you were very lucky and your computer could handle a disc drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh - and we walked to school uphill both ways - and liked it that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://retroresolution.com/2015/09/22/r-type-zx-spectrum-review/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis\u003C/a\u003E is what an AAA game looked like back then. It cost \u00A310.00 (OK, \u00A39.99 but cut me some slack here). It was produced by one person. According to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.moneysorter.co.uk/calculator_inflation2.html#calculator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E website, ten quid in 1988 money is worth \u00A318.75 today. Now it\u0027s been a while since I bought a modern AAA game (actually I don\u0027t remember the last time I did) but taking Mass Effect: Andromeda as an example, the internet tells me I could expect to pay \u00A350.00 for it at release. Does that seem fair?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I don\u0027t know the details of how ME:A was produced. I have no idea how many developer-hours it took to make, what its marketing budget was or anything.

The cost of making computer games has moved on a lot too. Comparatively speaking, computer game \u003Cem\u003Eprices\u003C/em\u003E haven\u0027t moved on much at all - and I\u0027m talking about the first day, get it without a discount, prices, not the \u0027no way am I paying for this, I\u0027ll wait for a Steam discount\u0027\u00A0price.\u00A0Somewhere in there is a big financial gap that has to be met somehow - assuming that you do actually want these companies to stay in business and carry on entertaining you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDLC in its various incarnations, is just one of those ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, even assuming I\u0027m horribly misguided, or just plain wrong and\u00A0DLC really \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a cunning conspiracy\u00A0for eeeeevil publishers to screw money out of poor, long suffering - but dumb - gamers, then I respectfully suggest that the best solution is \u0027not be dumb\u0027. The average gamer\u00A0could start by selling off the AAA grade chips that a lot of them seem to carry on both shoulders - that should raise enough for a game or two - whether that\u0027s\u00A0at \u00A310.00 a pop or \u00A350.00 a pop.
