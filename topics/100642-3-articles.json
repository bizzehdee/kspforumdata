They\u0027re just not accounted for yet, and we\u0027re probably going to have to do some playtesting to figure out how (and if) the fairings would work in between two chunks of spacecraft. We might be able to adapt the current module to do both, or we might require a separate module to handle those cases.

You build fairings by placing cross-sections, one by one.

The devnote seems to indicate that \u0022build fairing\u0022 is a special mode you enter into (either right away or through tweakables), but in that mode do you place panels like building a mini rocket, or are the controls things like \u0022increase width to 1.5 m, add 1 m cylinder at that width\u0022? If the latter, can we build fairings with crazy shapes, or does it have to be circular cross-section and/or mostly cylindrical?\n\nEDIT: Actually, what\u0027d be really neat would be to have a video of the fairing editing.
