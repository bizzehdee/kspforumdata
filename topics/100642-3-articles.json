The devnote seems to indicate that \u0022build fairing\u0022 is a special mode you enter into (either right away or through tweakables), but in that mode do you place panels like building a mini rocket, or are the controls things like \u0022increase width to 1.5 m, add 1 m cylinder at that width\u0022? If the latter, can we build fairings with crazy shapes, or does it have to be circular cross-section and/or mostly cylindrical?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Actually, what\u0027d be really neat would be to have a video of the fairing editing. Maybe in a future Squadcast?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT EDIT: Also, thanks to the Squad employees for answering questions here -- from my point of view, shorter devnote \u002B answering questions \u0026gt;\u0026gt; just a longer devnote.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T07:01:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 07:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cpast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T06:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Harvester: Yes but with \u00221 part\u0022 you mean that is formed by an only one rigid part and will not cause 40 pieces decoupling at same time or that on the part count of vessel it will count 40 parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T07:13:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Daze: It seem pretty clear to me from what he wrote, that the overall fairing will count as one part in the editor, even if it is made up of a bunch of panel segments: \u0022Fairing \u003Cem\u003Epanels \u003C/em\u003Earen\u0027t independent parts,\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
