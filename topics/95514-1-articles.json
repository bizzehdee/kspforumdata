This effect is so extreme near black holes, due to their gravity, that an hour close to a black hole can be a thousand years on Earth. Now, as an observer falling into the black hole, as you looked out you would see, in the little disk that is the universe around you (gravitational lens effects) you would see it aging and dying, faster and faster, until you pass through the event horizon.. Once you passed the event horizon, you wouldn\u0027t notice anything different, you would just keep falling until you are spaghettified by the gravitational forces. However, at this point, you are closer to the singularity than the virtual particles around the event horizon. These are the particles that contribute to Hawking radiation, and eventually cause the black hole to be destroyed. As you are closer to the singularity of the black hole than the virtual particles at the event horizon, they will experience a faster time than you do. Thus, you would expect the black hole to be destroyed as the particles take away its mass faster and faster from your point of view, possibly even before you are spaghettified. Therefore, you would be witness to the death of the black hole, and would likely be killed in the final explosion, due to the effects of the black hole itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhew, that was an explosion of science. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E *NERD MODE DISENGAGE*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dedjal","CreatedById":57220,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T18:49:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime does not quite work like that, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture a rubberband.

This is a very interesting question. Large black holes evaporate very slowly. In fact, they are growing faster than they can evaporate from background radiation alone. It takes a very tiny black hole to evaporate. But that\u0027s now. As the universe expands, both matter and radiation are going to become less available for black hole to grow, while evaporation rate remains constant. Eventually, there should be a point that even large black holes start to evaporate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other point is that it takes a supermassive black hole for you to fall into intact. That spagettification starts to happen pretty early for smaller black holes. You\u0027ll be ripped into atoms before you cross the horizon. But supermassive black holes have quite reasonable tidal forces near the horizon. A ship can fall in intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf universe expands without limits, any black hole will evaporate in finite time. Mind, it\u0027s going to be absurdly long time, one which makes current age of the universe seem like a fraction of an instance. But finite nonetheless, and there is no indication that there is some sort of a grand time limit on the universe. Even if protons start decaying, black holes should be fine. So as you fall into the black hole, you must pass that threshold. You must reach time of that black hole\u0027s eventual end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut therein lies the paradox.

As you are falling towards the event horizon, the region of space that is closest to the horizon, the place where the virtual particles that matter would form, would appeared drastically slowed. This is because they are obviously closer than you are to the black hole. But does the time dilation of this region actually effect the formation of the particles from the vacuum energy? If it does, than to any observer outside of the event horizon, unless they are at it, would see the particles forming more slowly, and thus it would take \u003Cem\u003Eeven longer \u003C/em\u003Efor the black hole to evaporate. And, If you are, once again, an observer falling in, than the black hole would decay more slowly than usual until you pass beyond the tiny layer beyond it, and unless time dilation is significant over such small distances, you would fall into the black hole possibly before it decays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last part also brings in the question: Will the time dilation increasing as you get closer and closer to the black whole kill you anyway, as different parts of your body have different clocks?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T02:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a while.
