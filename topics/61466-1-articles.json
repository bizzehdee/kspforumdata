View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an extended mission report:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tests on Kerbin were successful, the Fatboy Mk IV turned out to be a very stable vehicle, despite its size. It didn\u0027t even flip over on full stop breaks from max speed, like Mk III sometimes did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first EVA was a big failure - no live Kerbals were harmed in the tests - merely a dummy, looking like Bill - was accidentally dropped from ~10m height to the grund - honestly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA movable strut part with ladders and an attached mobility enhancer solved this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VTOL tests were not the highlight of the mission and were delayed. Too many crashes and a pilot who needs to learn how to fly these things. It was decided that the Kethane flyer will be built and delivered to Bill and Bob in a seperate mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small kethane buggy was assembled instead, it fitted very well to the mobile launch pad. A crane was added to the base in order to release and recover it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far so good, but how on earth will this thing make it to orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a good range on its own, thanks to plenty of fuel and skippers attached all around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same rocket that launched Fatboy Mk III was used as well for Mk IV - as a 1st test launch at least. The test proved to be a full success, even though the rocket couldn\u0027t get it to orbit, but with the help of its own engines it managed to reach a stable 150km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to the interstellar stage: Bill and Bob always wanted to make something with the huge 200ton sphere tanks from the torodial tanks pack - so they added some nukes, some control elements and launched it right away. Again, the rocket was nowhere powerful enough to get it into orbit, but with the help of its own engines it was doable, with plenty of fuel left to refill the Fatboy Mk IV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second sphere tank was launched to refill the interplanetary stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote to self: transferring over 150 tons of fuel at once move the center of mass SIGNIFICANTLY - causing uncontrollable wobble, so I had to emergency-release the refill tank. Luckily, the rover and interplanetary stage were not harmed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo pic from this as I panicked \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI \u0022attempted\u0022 to create a waypoint to make a rendezvous with Eve, but due to my inexperiance with interplanetary travel - only been to Duna and back once so far - I could not plot an encounter. Instead, I did what I can do pretty well, thanks to my experiance with building my space station - docking. So I plotted a course to intercept Eve\u0027s orbit instead of the planet. After an endless burn to get out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, another endless burn to match the orbits and some years of waiting for Eve to catch up, I finally managed to get an encounter. Probably among the most ineffective ways to get there, but I dont like to do things the easy way - the solution is mostly: MORE BOOSTERS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting into Eve\u0027s orbit was easy from there, did a few scans for Kethane and plotted a landing in order to land in one. So much for theory, Eve\u0027s athmosphere is so dense that I missed the field by far. BUT the base landed safely, nothing broke (except some wheels that were fixed quickly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReleasing the small buggy worked like a charm, right now Bill and Bob are having fun cruising around on Eve. I will try to move it to the kethane field, where I intend to set up a small base next to a beach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more infos/lessons learned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - never again. Ingame burns of 15 mins took real life 45 mins. 500 parts of rover is too much for my comp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - so far I always attempted to build bigger and bigger - I guess everyone reaches this stage in KSP, from there its a turning point to try to build more effectively. I think I am right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - big rover wheels are insanely durable. They may bend, sometimes maybe break, but they keep the rover safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The rover, fully loaded has ~215 tons. Together with the interplanetary stage it had 495 tons. I used 12 nukes to move it, probably not enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Upon entry on Eve, I ditched the interplanetarystage with ~50 tons of fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I really need to look up launch windows for interplanetary travel... and learn how to plot encounters properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - KSP is awesome\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELordFjord \u0026lt;- very proud that the mission was a success and it all worked as I intended - at least mostly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-29T07:35:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2014 07:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LordFjord\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobnova","CreatedById":75385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T06:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut just the JeDZ5 inside [noparse]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
