Both were a huge step up from the Mun and Minmus missions I was getting to grips with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut almost in mockery, KSP has once again launched the difficulty upwards, with a contract to: \u0027Enter the atmosphere, Splash-Down on, and make land contact with\u0027 Eve. In a single mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCracking my knuckles in confidence, I launched a probe for this first landing on Eve, hoping that with enough ocean covering the surface, I\u0027d get lucky and land in water, rather than make landfall. All went perfectly, aside from a tense few minutes plummeting through Eve\u0027s atmosphere. But nothing exploded, and I got good chutes, over the ocean, and splashed down. Then the probe sank under the intense gravity and was lost.\u00A0Awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d hoped that \u0027make land contact\u0027 just meant landing - but it didn\u0027t. So the contract was a failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m struggling to come up with a design\u00A0that can reach Eve, enter the atmosphere, splash-down, and then move over to land.
