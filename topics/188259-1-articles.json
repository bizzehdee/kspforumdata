I don\u0027t think it would be terribly difficult to do if it was cosmetic only. AFAIK the planetary surface is just a depth map \u002B texture map with an underlying planet-filling ocean (if applicable).

Then add a texture to the deformation and if you\u0027re so inclined add cosmetics like ejecta, even modifying the spread depending on impact angle. Modelling the explosion\u0027s effect on nearby structures should be straightforward enough too. Of course this would mean that dropping a meteorite on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E might result in a Game Over condition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFootprints, tyre marks and similar would also probably be not too difficult, you\u0027d need to make surface interactions modify\u00A0a bump map and then\u00A0make\u00A0map persist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever if you wanted it to have meaningful gameplay value things would get more complicated fast.
