With this restriction, you need to be able to get onto a collision course, release it \u0026lt;500km above the solar surface, and then (here\u0027s the hard part) not crash into Kerbol. The delta-v required to make this course correction so low is probably somewhere at least 3 km/s and could be anywhere from 3 to 20 km/s (I have a little experience with sundive speeds cos I tried and failed to get to Ablate from PlanetFactory once.) Getting enough delta-v to sundive, \u003Cstrong\u003Emake that course correction\u003C/strong\u003E, and get a Kerbin intercept in a single stage without ion engines is probably just very very hard, but then getting a high enough thrust-to-weight ratio to perform that course correction before you hit the overheat line while maintaining enough delta-v to perform your maneuvers is, I am willing to say with absolute certainty, completely impossible in stock without resorting to Kraken drives or similar bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It just occurred to me that you could do it instead by getting into a 500 km circular orbit around Kerbol, making a small course correction to make your orbit a collision course, release the OKTO, and then get back into your circular orbit, and thus bypass the thrust-to-weight ratio problems. But getting enough delta-v (almost certainly around 40 km/s) in a single stage to do this is way more impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003EThis is possible.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E I repeat, this is possible. It just requires a ton of precision. This is because of the bit about the Alcubierre Drive. Someone uploaded a tutorial on youtube about transferring anywhere using those and expending 0 delta-v; the basic idea is to warp into various strategic orbits and let gravity do all the delta-v for you. Once you\u0027re in solar orbit, this is probably most quickly doable by warping to ~500 km above the surface of the sun, releasing (due to the velocity preservation you\u0027ll be on a collision course,) and warping the **** out of there. The only problem is that the most precision I can seem to get with the Alcubierre Drives is about 80 megameters, so you\u0027ll need to use some nuclear engines anyway. The first scheme I proposed is probably the \u003Cstrong\u003Eeasiest\u003C/strong\u003E; you\u0027ll have to do a warp instead of doing thrusting to get out of your collision course.

The two engines pointing in opposite directions on the same tank are a nice touch and solve a lot of problems that appear when using more than one Turbojet at high altitudes (if one of them flames out, the shuttle gets pulled to the side by the non-central thrust - impossible to fly...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission itself uses a Jool Slingshot to get a very high elliptical orbit around the sun. On the apoapsis breaking to a terminal course uses only 700 m/s delta-v, which means that the 4000 m/s I started with in low Kerbin Orbit are quite enough (basically the budget just consists a Jool transit, the breaking maneuver, the burn at Kerbol periapsis to avoid the crash and some minor course corrections. Way less than retrograde burns outside of Kerbin and speeding up again to get back home, which I estimate at about 20,000 m/s). Only downside is that this high orbit takes quite some time to run through, so the whole mission took about 90 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 500,000 m above Kerbol, the bomb goes away and I fire radial to get a safe periapsis and retrograde to reduce the orbit to about 3 years. After that, it\u0027s just some minor corrections to get back to Kerbin, although aerobreaking from 12.000 m/s has the nice effect of bouncing me off the atmosphere and pushing me back into a medium orbit. That turns out to be a good thing, because the landing strip is on the other side of the planet and I have to wait a few days for the position to synchronize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that it\u0027s smooth gliding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also watched the movie (what a turd), should have done that before because I could have killed one of my Kerbals for authenticity (and weight loss...). A reference to another movie this reminds me of: The pictures don\u0027t show it, but the mission was called \u0022Dark Star\u0022 and the bomb had the name \u0022Bomb 20\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T06:40:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood job, nice mission!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have recently found a way around problems with asymmetric flameout, the devil is in order in which intakes and engines are placed.
