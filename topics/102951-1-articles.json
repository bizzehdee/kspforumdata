The buildings upgrades - does it really take thousands of players to see how unbalanced they are? Same goes for the strategies. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s like the numbers were the result of die rolls. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the same thing with experiments when they came in first - their repitive nature was so obvious, that i dont quite understand how it ever got released to the public in that state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, too, love the game, dont get me wrong. But it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s like before every release they stop just one step short, when it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s basically just about tweaking some numbers. I do understand, that this is sort of paid-beta and that i agreed to it, when i bought the game early (and hell, did i get my money worth out of it!). But a little bit of testing in-house (and i assume they do this) should iron out the easy to fix but heavy on gameplay things before another release is made official. I mean, on my first upgrading the launch pad, i was like \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4wow - this is unbalanced!\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 - which was like 2 hours into the game - and i play really slow. On my first time doing science (back when it was first introduced) i was thinking: \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4uh - how grindy, maybe a bit too realistic, here?\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4... I have never implemented any strategy in my program, though i could use some extra funds over some REP or SCI, because by even just looking at it, i figured, they are, guess: inbalanced and simply not worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my guess for ORE is, it will either be too heavy to lift, too cheap to be worth it, or so valuable that you can upgrade your entire KSC after one go with it - something along these lines - on first release. Problem is (for the devs): If a new feature comes in a massively inbalanced state, as seems to be almost habitual at this point, you can hardly expect people to stick to vanilla for testing what is quite obviously flawed - and that for minor reasons, too, cause it cant be all that hard, after having gone through all the trouble of coding the feature, do get the numbers (parameters) for it at least roughly right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, but after such a harsh sounding post, i shall not miss to thank the devs none-the-less for one of my favorite games of all times (playing since 83).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T15:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not.
