I get it into Orbit and all that kind of stuff but somehow my spaceplane has a drag to the right at the very start of the flight. I built everything symetrically and it doesn\u0027t do this once it has taken off. I\u0027m using 0.21 Mechjeb and 0.21 B9 Aerospace Pack. The landing gear itself is stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an attempt that has a very low drag to the right:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://dc654.2shared.com/download/84Av2TXC/SSTO_2.jpg?tsid=20131016-143945-61f7b9a1\u0022 alt=\u0022SSTO_2.jpg?tsid=20131016-143945-61f7b9a1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the airintake, the wheel is mounted on, is not very durable during a rough landing. But if i don\u0027t mount the front wheel on the airintake like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://dc581.2shared.com/download/RG9sFgbN/SSTO_5.jpg?tsid=20131016-145217-22741af6\u0022 alt=\u0022SSTO_5.jpg?tsid=20131016-145217-22741af6\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe drag increases like crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two are as unstable as the 2nd one.

The only idea I\u0027have about this is, that the lights of the wheels are all facing to the right. So they aren\u0027t flipped like all the other parts. But I can\u0027t do anything about that without them facing to the wrong direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eregards Simon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T15:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I had this problem once a long time ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get rid of those pylons that your gear is attached to. I found that if I strut the back of the intakes to what ever they are connected to it will make them FAR more durable for gear work. I like to use 2 struts connected at the back sides of the intakes and then to the section it is connected to. I also use the Variable Geometry intakes for most of my intake work now. They create the least amount of drag and are most useful at higher speeds. And you really don\u0027t need that many intakes with a SABRE engine. The four variable geometry intakes you have under the wings will do fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pulp_user","CreatedById":88024,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T15:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought the more intake the higher I can fly without switching to oxidizer?

You will need to be going fast... REAL fast. Ideally over 1600m/s before you switch over to rockets. But if you just have one SABRE M you will need a minimum of 3 Variable Geometry intakes to make it to 24km. The SABRE M is a REALLY powerful engine and it sucks the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
