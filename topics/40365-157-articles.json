I thought he was asking for the ability to bring science experiments to the science lab and then be able to transmit them home without transmission losses. I see now he just wanted a button to transmit the science instead of automagically getting the science added as soon as you load the lab. I prefer the automatic method myself. Having to transmit would be a pain if you have a large number of labs. Had 12 labs in one save and that was a pain just swapping around to collect science. If I had to also transmit, that\u0027d take me twice as long, if not longer, to reap my science.

I\u0027m looking forward to Fractal expanding this line of engines. I\u0027d like to see a 1.25m flat lander-style methane engine so that I can make use of it for Duna missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlasma thrusters are in the ion engine range of performance with LF using a 1.25m fusion generator, but really take off as a great engine once you get to space and power it with antimatter. I have also had some success using plasma thrusters as upper stage engines on ships and space station modules equipped with 2.5m or 3.75m fission power systems using Argon as fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vista is indeed a nice launch engine, just keep in mind the radiation hazards if you have any crewed ground support vessels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal nozzles can be tricky. They work well in space, but with the severe performance reductions in atmo, I\u0027ve only had limited success with nuclear reactors. They can work decently as upper stage engines. Fusion reactors work fantastically for space plane. However, once you unlock antimatter power, and if you can fuel new ships on the launchpad with antimatter, thermal nozzles become VERY powerful engines for a wide variety of applications, not just launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option you have with thermal nozzles is to build a microwave transmission network in orbit and at KSC. Lob a bunch of 3.75m fission reactor/generator combos into orbit such that you get some power everywhere in orbit. A bunch of rovers with 3.75m fission reactor/generator pairs parked at the space center. Then instead of attaching a reactor to your thermal nozzle, you attach a microwave thermal receiver. Get enough power and you can indeed launch. Power transmitters on the ground will get you up and going and the transmitters in orbit will provide the power to circularize. Keep in mind that Fractal has some tweaking and fixing on the microwave system that hasn\u0027t come out in 0.8.2 yet, so you may want to wait until the next bugfix patch comes out before setting up a vast microwave power system.

The big one is that it\u0027s limited to SOI. Omni antenna only work within SOI (and subbodies) and have limited range, so you can quickly cull the list of craft to check. The dishes target individual craft (trivial) or a body, so you only need to consider craft within that body\u0027s SOI, and only those with a dish with sufficient range to reach back - again a way to quickly cull the list. And many of those properties only change when the ship attains focus, so the potential graph can be safely cached rather than constantly checked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were implementing this, I\u0027d simplify and constrain things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I\u0027d make the transmitter a transmitter/receiver and eliminate the receiver as a part.

You beam power up to a relay and you want to relay that out to some number of other destinations. You spread that out among your sat net around Kerbin (for constant LOS) and each of these has a transmitter for each destination - Mun, Minmus, Eve, Duna, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you can build a truly epic power network, but it\u0027s going to be expensive. It\u0027s a lot of transmitters to put up. Or you can limit it by only covering the SOI - a 3 sat network would need 1 for the ground link, 2 for each of the other sats (or 1 if you\u0027re willing to incur additional transmission loss), and 1 for active vessel. You can now power your outbound ship, carrying a new ground station for Mun, Duna, etc. and build a similar network there. It can also target active vessel and your active vessel, if armed with 2 transmitters can draw power from each of the networks. You can steadily build up and out this way, and it\u0027ll scale very nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT2 has the identical mechanic, but with some variation due to antenna range. It also has the ability to create new control points so you can have parts of your system disconnected from each other, etc. Very flexible, and not terribly expensive computationally because you only need to work out LOS between a handful of objects at any given time, regardless of the size of your network.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Myrten","CreatedById":92200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T20:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe bug you mentioned is fixed in my development version, as is point 2, also I\u0027ve fixed the calculation of distance losses via relays.\u003Cp\u003EChanging the system to add more relays is potentially problematic because the maximum number of calculations can become enormous with many relays.
