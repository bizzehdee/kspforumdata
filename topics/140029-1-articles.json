So, I have decided to go where no kerbal has gone before, to embrace the motto of the Kerpollo program, \u0022Failure is\u00A0always an option\u0022 and have created my own list, these mods are all for 1.1.2, and can be found on spacedock, these mods will all work together on the average computer as well. Here is the official Kerpollo program mod list:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0B9 Aerospace - I love this mod for all the parts it adds in, as well as how perfectly it blends with the stock parts. As well as this mod\u0027s cockpits have actually functioning buttons for sas, rcs, staging, and abort.

Plus, they are also fun to mess around with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOPT - Do you like cool ships? Do you like SSTOs?
