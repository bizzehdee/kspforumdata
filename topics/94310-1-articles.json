And updating to .90 didnt fix a damn thing. Thought it was SCANsat doing it, but you dont have it listed in your mods list. Its Remote Tech. Try shutting off the little transmission toggles (the connection lines). THat is if you can even get to the tracking station by luck. Once you shut off the toggles you will have like a 50% chance of the tracking station loading successful. However that is not good enough. I have the same satellite count you have. It looks as if Remote Tech 2 hogs massive resources to run such simple \u0022radio signals\u0022 . Post a tech ticket on the Remote Tech 2 thread and post logs as well. I hope the dev will fix the damn issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
