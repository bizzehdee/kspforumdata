It appears I moved about 40 km over all at a top speed of nearly 50 meters/second. I left it running for over 3 hours and yet Jeb is, as of this post, ABSOLUTELY MORTIFIED!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe is Right-side up, and has been sitting here for hours, nothing has exploded or broken off in the last 5 kilometers and yet he is gripped by mortal terror.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is JEB we are talking about. JEBEDIAH KERMAN! Supposedly the most \u0022badass\u0022 Kerbal in the world, and he is scared of a low-gravity nigh-indestructable carnival ride that he can FLY out of if he needed to (in all honesty the thing could probably protect him from a 70 m/s impact with the ground anyway, so that is unlikely). Not only that, he seems to be going into PTSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be like if Attila the Hun were terrified of an unarmed 6-year-old child... and after the child had been put behind bars and sent to another continent, Attila just sat there shaking in a corner for the next day...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, He didn\u0027t seem to be bugged by it when it was moving 100 miles an hour...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/37ak5eX.png\u0022 alt=\u002237ak5eX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the picture... nearly 3 hours after he stopped moving, of Jeb shaking in his spacesuit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NtP5ZGB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NtP5ZGB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy did this even happen?

Before someone asks why I needed hyperedit, look at the screen and notice FAR, then notice how-unaerodynamic and big that thing is. It has a terminal velocity at Kerbin ASL of something like 89 m/s... It weighs 170 tonnes and has more drag in FAR than it would in stock.
