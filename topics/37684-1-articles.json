On the cylindrical mechjeb pod there are also four panels but they don\u0027t pop off, they just open up. On both modules there are sparks they fly out when this happens. When it does happen, mechjeb loses control for a brief moment and the ship spins wildly out of control, but mechjeb does regain control after a couple seconds. This is an intened feature and not a bug as there are animations for it and everything, I just want to know if anyone knows what causes it because there isn\u0027t anything I can find on the MechJeb resources that says what causes sit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1103.photobucket.com/albums/g479/Kickass119/screenshot0_zps7a04bcf3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0_zps7a04bcf3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
