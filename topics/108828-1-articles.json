So please don\u0027t spaz on me and tell me i don\u0027t know how to fly etc. I have been having a lot of wobble lately on 1.0 build rockets(Previously Stable) as well as ones i have just built during 1.02. It is not just an atmosphere issue either it happens in space as well. They are all aerodynamically sound, symmetrical, i have interchanged parts for others stock and mod parts. Even if i don\u0027t do a gravity turn i will start to get wobble at about 150m/s in a small circle at first then it gets worse. Doesn\u0027t matter if i add fins or not either, i have tried everything i can think of to correct it. However if i use hold retrograde or prograde i have no such instability It honestly seems like a bug or instability.
