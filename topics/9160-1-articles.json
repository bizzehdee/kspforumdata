You can use subsurf. Just remember that it adds more polys when in use. When I started to model my shuttle. I only used a circle with 12 verts. because when I then use subsurf. It will get to the 24 verts that is the limit. Though as dt890 mentioned, there will be areas with where there is to many verts. But I usually clean them up, after I apply subsurf.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Currently I use the edge split, when I make my models. One other way you can do it, that seems to work with the collada exporter. Is to select those faces that need to be flat. When you have selected them, use the flat shading in mesh tools ( you can toggle it in 3d view with \u0027t\u0027 ) though, that is only if you have a side of a model that is need to be flat in shading,not and egde. The best way to do it. Is like what dt890 says. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Knife tools at this moment is not in any menu at all, of what I know. To use knife tools you press \u0027k\u0027 and left click mouse, you can then draw a line where you want to cut it. before that select the area of the model you need to cut. Also you can edit some parameters of the knife tool at the side menu ( the one you can toggle with \u0027t\u0027 ) But at this moment. It is mostly broken, compared to the old knife tool from 2.4x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The way I do to make different modules out of 1 object. Is to use the boolean. Where I take the model I want to cut to 2 object. duplicate the it and name the one after what is going to be ( like cockpit ) then you make a cube, or any model shape that you need to make the \u0027cut\u0027. When you have finished the model that will cut the cockpit out. Select the cockpit model. then go to object modifier tab ( the wrench logo ) it will have a drop menu where you can select the boolean. In the boolean menu, select the cube that will cut the cockpit. and use the intersect or difference, to make the new model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do the winglets. The easiest way is to select the wingtip of the wing and extrude it move it upward and then use the loop cut \u0027CTRL\u002Br\u0027 to make the transition between the wing and the winglet tip, smooth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice is to test all these on a simple model first. before you start using them on your model. Just to get to know how they work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehope that help some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn that is a really interesting shuttle design there.

And if you have the new blender 2.63 from graphicall. Try to test if the bmesh actually can be used by the collada exporter. And if so, can KSP handle it. The biggest problem I have been seen with the bmesh. Is that in many times it will only be a problem, than a solution. Thats why there have been a opposition in blender community about bmesh. If you are a freelancer. My advice about Bmesh. Is not to use it. For now. Think more and more will start to use the bmesh. So it will be a good thing to learn about at least.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dt890","CreatedById":8704,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-05T23:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei am not 100% sure but i think the scripts will work because the problem that appears when exporting from N-gon to polygon formats can be fixed just simply by making the n-gons to polygons through tesselation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei also found this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Data_System/Files/Import/COLLADA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Data_System/Files/Import/COLLADA\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Import\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupported geometry types are\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etris\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolylist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epolygons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Engons\u003C/span\u003E are triangulated automatically\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etrifans\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe reason i am not 100% sure is because i couldn\\\u0027t find some solid evidence that Bmesh is working with just Ngons (but its more than likely) \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tadeass","CreatedById":16874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-06T06:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for help a lot, I will test it all. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I forgot one question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Nuka: How did you create the cockpit windows on your shuttle model?
