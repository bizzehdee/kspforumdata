My rocket and plane building skills are decent at best, so it is unbalanced and pretty hard to fly. (Leave the SAS on!) I designed it to be able to reenter in the general area of the KSC and be able to land on the runway. Once the plane is on its own it works really well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a little bit unbalanced, but if you don\\\u0027t make any sudden movements it should get up into orbit. The second stage starts to turn uncontrollably around 40km, so I recommend getting rid of it then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last four stacks are the engines to put the shuttle back into the atmosphere. The plane cannot use its engines in orbit, so if you get rid of the stacks good luck getting back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flies well in the atmosphere and has plenty of fuel. And if I could land it on the runway, you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Naten","CreatedById":70923,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T16:30:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you try and rebuild it in the new version?
