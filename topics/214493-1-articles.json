I am having a hard time doing that in KSP 2. My AP keeps going into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022High Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003EHKO\u003C/abbr\u003E while PE is barely scraping the atmosphere. For you knowledgeable players out there what\u0027s going on here. Is the maneuver node buggy in this specific instance as well or is the calculation just more realistic than KSP 1. My current hypothesis, if this is not a bug, is that it\u0027s my current vertical velocity vector that is impacting my final result. I\u0027m burning prograde on the maneuver icon but do to my ascent I still have latent vertical velocity. Did KSP 1 not calculate the orbital circularization maneuver in this way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-05T20:33:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 seems to calculate the resultant orbit based on estimating the burn over time (which is much more realistic than stock KSP1, which assumes a simplistic instant acceleration applied at a point). So to get better circular orbits, you will have to add some radial component, either radial in or radial out, depending on your initial apoapsis altitude and whatever periapsis altitude you ended up with when you stopped your burn. The higher your initial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, the easier it is to get a good final orbit because it is likely to require less radial component to get close \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E values.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-05T20:33:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2023 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by LameLefty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thewhitemetroid","CreatedById":202561,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-05T20:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, Thanks. I have been adding a radial component to compensate, but have not tried a higher initial apoapsis.

You should aim to reach a speed of 2000m/s by the time your apopasis reaches the correct height and you cut your engines and coast. You can still circularize without a node with 1900m/s or even less than that, but the lower you go, the more difficult it becomes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe general approach: coast until you are about 10 seconds before apoapsis, then throttle up. I recommend using the mouse to click and drag the throttle for this, as it offers unparalleled precision control. Try to figure out how high you have to throttle so that the time to apoapsis neither decreases nor increases. Once you have found that point, start backing off the throttle slowly and gradually. You\u0027ll find that the closer you get to circularizing, the less thrust you need. If you feel comfortable in your control, let the apoapsis come even closer, to just a few seconds. Then just hold it there with your manual throttle control until the periapsis has climbed up to where you want it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are going too slow, and have a weak engine, you may find that even at full throttle, the apoapsis won\u0027t stop coming closer if you start the burn at 10 seconds off. In that case, you\u0027ll want to start burning earlier. Use your judgement; you\u0027ll soon get a feel for how well your rockets accelerate after you\u0027ve done this a few times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, of course, going faster sideways during ascent makes this easier. meaning, tip over a little sooner/harder. Just be careful not to go too flat. Each individual rocket will be slightly different with how flat a trajectory it can fly without falling out of the sky.

It also helps if you gradually throttle down the upper stage as your apoapsis climbs above 55km, thus delaying the point in time until you have to cut your engines entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224252569\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214493\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678032522\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022202561\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thewhitemetroid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, thewhitemetroid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m burning prograde on the maneuver icon\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, additional info: the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E Hold Maneuver mode is buggy, and tends to veer off the marker.
