To pool it all together under one umbrella, we\u0027re talking about a creator-user relationship. Modders create something for people to use, and companies create something for people to use. Bac9 can vanish without a trace just as well as any one company could, and have done before. No, you can\u0027t really imagine a big, well-known company to perform a vanishing act like that (though I\u0027m sure that such a thing is entirely in the realm of possibility.) I think the most applicable here would be indie companies; they vanish with no word all the time. In one moment of the year a game is being created and put up for Alpha release on Steam, in the very next moment no one can reach them, they don\u0027t post any reason for the long withdrawal, and the local forums become an unpleasant ghost town of lost dreams and perpetual anger--I\u0027ve seen it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBac9 has no standard to conform to, no obligation, no driving reason being forced upon them to say or do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because you aren\u0027t expected to do something doesn\u0027t mean you shouldn\u0027t do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said: barring tremendous bodily injury or sickness, circumstances beyond their control like being in prison or out of country, or as you have suggested: quitting cold-turkey, there\u0027s very little reason why a post can\u0027t and shouldn\u0027t be made (until someone explains to me why, which was my original question.) Ethically, I think it\u0027s a bad idea to quit something like this cold-turkey, but that\u0027s just my opinion. I attribute this to the consequences I\u0027ve seen other people quitting similar projects cold-turkey, and it generally won\u0027t end well. My personal opinion, mind you, is that I would have an obligation to tell people that I am humbly moving away form the project for good, not to return--ever. For myself as closure, and for my users as a sign of appreciation for their use of my creation (product, mod), I would consider that to be the preferred course of action. Of course, I still have no idea, nor would pry into, what the reason for this uninterrupted delay is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m simply making discussion for discussion\u0027s sake.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ModZero","CreatedById":89470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T14:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Crazierinzane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Crazierinzane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, I believe I addressed your type of response in one of the quoted parts of my post, generally something I would consider ignoring.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, you dimissed it.
