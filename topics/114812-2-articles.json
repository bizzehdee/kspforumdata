Why would you hide yourself then advertise yourself on a forum thread?\n\nHow is it hiding one\u0027s self? It\u0027s akin to wearing loose clothing. Just because someone wears loose clothing doesn\u0027t mean people aren\u0027t going to notice that person, though others may try to use tight fitting clothing to gain more attention, it\u0027s really just about providing details to things that aren\u0027t much of your business and existing above the societal influence to do so.\n\nNow, joining the light green group and the white bar group would create the dynamic you\u0027re searching for. This is akin to wearing loose fitting clothing and a shirt saying \u0022I have a great body... but I don\u0027t want you looking at it.\u0022\n\n\\*And yeah, this is a bit of a joke thread; but the attachment to social media always confuses me...
