No major news to report. A lot of the things broken in the recent KSP releases have been fixed. The round hatch shader still isn\u0027t working yet, and there are often errors that force you to restart the game, but there is progress.\n\nI\u0027ve also been working on a gravity/force system while in IVA. The goal is to allow you to walk around while in a gravity well or centrifuge for example, and float or grab handrails while under lower gravity. The camera system will be a normal FPS-style control while under acceleration, and a free look with no \u0022up\u0022 or \u0022down\u0022 in space, so you can build your stations in any direction you want, and risk getting disoriented when the ceiling is the floor.\n\nThe gravity system needs all IVA parts to have custom colliders added, otherwise you fall through the craft (and also everything else), so there is a lot of work to be done.\n\nIn the really long term, there\u0027s lots of cool stuff that could be done, like supplies that take up internal space, moving things around, customising IVA equipment and gauges in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, having to put on space suits, explosive decompression etc., but all that fun stuff is quite some time away.\n\nThose are my thoughts for where IVA could be brought.
