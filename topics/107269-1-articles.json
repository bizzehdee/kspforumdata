Valentina has brought something called a samovar to the Centre, and he thought it worked pretty well. \u0022Well, he got back, but neither of you do all that well at controlling a spacecraft. Some of Jebs orbits were all over the place.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina said nothing, but seemed to be looking for something in her teacup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Stratospheric wind,\u0022 said Bill, for the third time that day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Easy on the beans,\u0022 chorused Valentina and Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m no better.\u0022 Valentina could be ruthlessly honest about her talents. \u0022Bill, have they ever found out why my radio set blew up?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That wasn\u0027t your fault.\u0022 Bill shrugged. \u0022Carry signal flags?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob tried not to cough. \u0022We should have a pretty good idea of how to fly an ascent by now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And we don\u0027t,\u0022 said Valentina. \u0022Once we\u0027re in orbit, it seems to get easy.\u0022 She finished her tea. \u0022Our first stages have to be long and thin.
