We already know that money will be a factor concerning building space craft. So how will we get this money? Will it be strictly on the merits of scientific discovery? Or is it going to include using space to create something of a business... Say building several solar stations in high orbit to beam heaping tons of electricity back to Kerbin to solve the energy crisis? (if they have that.) Mining asteroids? Sifting Helium3 from the Mun\u0027s surface? Pumping fuel from the oceans of Eve and shipping it back home? Scooping heavy ions from Kerbol\u0027s chromosphere? ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027ve run out of ideas. What do you think?
