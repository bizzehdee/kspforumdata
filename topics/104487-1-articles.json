(He\u0027s a good liar isn\u0027t he?)\n\nAnyway i\u0027m a very long time forum dweller and just recently registered, please inform me if I do something wrong or something that you find offensive. I really love KSP because it combines my two favorite things, planes and rockets. I like doing historical recreations in RSS, or maybe I do kerbalized versions in stock KSP. \n\nAnyway I got KSP after watching Scott Manley\u0027s wonderful videos (I like saying anyways don\u0027t I?) and also after watching Chris P Bacon\u0027s RSS recreations. I understand alot of you people are very intelligent, far more than me, and far more superior in creating stuff in KSP ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif).\n\nAnyway please tell me if I seem rude, or such. I do get misunderstood alot. I\u0027m pretty sure lots of you understand because this forum is way more understanding than some others...\n\nOkay, thanks for reading peoples!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T00:34:22Z","Content":"Very humble introduction there, but welcome nonetheless.
