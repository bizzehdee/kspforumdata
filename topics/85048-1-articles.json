In stock, where you can easily exceed 2,000 m/s on jets alone, a laythe lander could have just jets, and either an ion engine for circularization, or even just some scoops that are shut and full of air?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E80% atmosphere and 80% gravity should mean that landing speeds are the same, no? but given the lower orbital velocity, the AoA needed to climb will be lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor stock, this is even more important due to linear vs squared lift/drag equations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*80% lower speed needed to supply the needed lift for a given air density\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Less needed lift as you get even closer to orbital velocity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if I wanted a reusable(SSTO) lander for laythe, I should be able to get away with no oxidizer at all, right? Jets-\u0026gt; above orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEffective ISPs in the range of 1200*16 to 2500*16 = 19,200 to 40,000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStored air or ions for circularization.... seems pretty sweet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor NEAR..

I am a decent lander (can land on the runway with no issue) but I found the uneven terrain on Laythe very tricky to touch down on. Even picking a teasonably flat plain I found lots of humps and bumps that made it very tricky. Go try landing 5-6 times in the wilderness away from the flat space center to see if your SSTO can accommodate rough landing situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my new Laythe mission om about to launch my SSTO has vertical landing capabilities. Basically after much testing the best method I have found are little engines midship pointed about 30 degrees down from forward (pointed down my usual glide path). As I am landing I can nose up to slow horizontal speed more or trim down to take out vertical. With a little practice and the brakes locked you can stick a landing without even rolling. 2 small tanks hold enough fuel for 3-4 landings as well so it doesn\u0027t add much to weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T17:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital speed for an object of relatively negligible mass is (GM/r)^.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that r is from the center of the object the orbit is centered upon, and the value of GM is given in the wiki for all planets/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that you\u0027ll need to go FASTER than orbital velocity within atmosphere to exit it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-20T17:02:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2014 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kryxal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T17:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe FAR specifically reduces the stock jets capabilities.
