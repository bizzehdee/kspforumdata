I don\u0027t understand why there are two folders for two separate crafts, like ok so the save vehicle button takes me to this menu area with other saved vehicles and that just adds clutter and like the title says the auto save vehicles instead of just making one and every now and then overwriting it it makes like 4 separate ones so then I gotta go back and delete those ones and ugh. Great game you guys have just this feture I find odd. Been playing it none stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
