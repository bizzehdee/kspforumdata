I have a few ideas that might give them more uses. First, there should be hunger and thirst. This should be optional. If it is on, Kerbals should gradually lose hunger and will need to resupply. There should also be buildings that can grow food and recycle water for space stations. There should also be gravity problems, also being optional. Overtime, kerbals in low gravity areas start getting weaker. Their skills weaken until gravity gets back to normal. This will allow practical use of gravity rings on the space ship. These changes, while making the game more difficult, allow space stations to have more uses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-10T22:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-13T11:23:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very far from what I\u0027d call useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMO tourist contracts should be one use for them.
