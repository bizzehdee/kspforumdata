I checked the parts I\u0027m using and they weren\u0027t modified from 0.9 to 1.0, except the LVN\u0027s weight.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nThanks.\n\n![cYWPjgy.png](http://i.imgur.com/cYWPjgy.png)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/zBa4c-YA3g8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T00:32:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by seyss**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T00:33:11Z","Content":"You\u0027re using even less than half the fuel before (since O is heavier than LF, and I assume you use the same fuel tank as 0.9).

On smaller craft you\u0027re better off with the terrier. Plus the LV-N is much heavier than the terrier, and more expensive (if that matters to you). The LV-N is more useful on much larger craft with large overall mass, where the mass of the engine isn\u0027t such a significant portion of the dry mass of the ship, and where Mk2 or Mk3 liquid fuel fuselages can be used (the Mk1 are pretty bad on spacecraft)."},{"CreatedByName":"seyss","CreatedById":137952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T19:55:11Z","Content":"I got fed up with what Squad did to LV-N in 1.0 and modified the config file to restore the original capabilities (2.25t weight, 4000\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BAC max temp, 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA gimbal, LF\u002BO fuel).\n\nIf you want it back up the original file in another folder first.
