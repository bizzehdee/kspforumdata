I\u0027ve used FASA since 23.5 in all sorts of installs (RSS/RO, KSPInterstellar, Kolonization, etc.), because this is such an amazing mod. The one problem I am running into at this time, however, is the amount of RAM all of the crafts end up taking up (I always ditch the ICBM and Gemini modules, yet it\u0027s still a ton of RAM usage). I was wondering; is there any way the engines from the FASA pack could be packaged separately (kind of like the launch clamps)? I\u0027ve done my utmost best at trimming out all of the non-engine parts to help cut down on RAM (I love using realistic rockets in my designs, which is why I use the Russian engine pack as well). The problem comes when some of the files are bundled together with blocks, seperators, fairings, and the like, which make it a tedious process to signal out the specific engines used for the Mercury and Apollo launch vehicles. If frizzank is unable or does not have the time to do such a thing, I was hoping someone in the community could lay out the specific files/models/etc,\u00A0I can cut out\u00A0in order to have the engine file\u0027s used in this pack without all the extra modules that are included (excluding the Mercury-Atlas booster-engine fairing). The biggest problem for me is that many of the folders that, at first glance, don\u0027t seem to include engine parts actually do, and it makes it difficult to determine which models to ditch without combing through the .cfg files.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HiredGun_98","CreatedById":155505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T00:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off,\u00A0thank you frizzank for all your hard work that you put into making and maintaining this wonderful mod.
