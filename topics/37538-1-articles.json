It astounded me that some can complain about such amazing artwork done to our lovely Space Centre and instead complain of of the lack of game changing features and pros. Considering KSP is still considerably early in its development and the Devs continual commitment to their community, I feel I must express my gratitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevs keep up the hard work, your efforts will not be forgotten by many.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T05:01:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m totally not predicting a thread lock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext update will own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T05:02:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUm... did the update just hit?

All the work you put on the development of a game cannot be all on stuff you will see directly in the game. A great deal of work needs to be done with the code and by optimizing your previous work as you add features. .19 and .20 were probably the update with the less in game content, but the most work under the hood. If you base off a \u0022good update\u0022 on .17 or .18, you\u0027re gonna be dissapointed. Especially since they decided to accelerate the update process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween .17 and .18, there has been nearly four months. .20 Took only two months and .21 is heading down this road.
