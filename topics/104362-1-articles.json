I had to patch the launcher etc to get it to Run but the game starts and it has all my mods. However when I play, the game suffers from Horrific stuttering which makes it unplayable. Every second it freezes up then moves a bit further, then freezes again. Constantly.\n\nThis is my first time using Ubuntu and I\u0027m not very familiar with it. I think I\u0027m running the Nvidia Proprietary Driver version 331.113 (this was the only option that said \u0022Proprietary\u0022 next to it.\n\nMy specs are:\n\nCore i7-4770K\n\nGeForce GTX780TI\n\n32GB RAM \n\nCan anyone help?
