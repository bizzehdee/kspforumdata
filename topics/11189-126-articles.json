I like to think people will be doing this for real one day, when SABRE becomes fully functional, if someone else doesn\u0027t get there first! I feel sure spaceplanes are going to become an important method for getting stuff into space. Which is why I feel the K-Prize is bigger than one challenge thread or curator.\n\nTBH my secret hope is that for this reason the K-Prize mission or equivalent, to fly a space plane to orbit, will be adopted by Intercept and added as a side mission in KSP2. \n\nSo for that reason I feel it is best to let go of the K-Prize and let it take on a life of its own, which it deserves.\n\nAlso I am not in a position to take it further, due to difficulties created by a longstanding medical condition involving immune dysfunction diagnosed as ME CFS, which has become worse after COVID, possibly due to longcovid plus ME.  I just dont have the boosters to take it on and would love to see someone else take the idea further in KSP2.\n\nWhat do you think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-19T18:31:13Z","Content":"Well, I appreciate that you\u0027ve kept it going so long.
