Lots of grand ideas and hand-waving, almost no tangible details. Heck, the cnet article was more informative. Concrete points for discussion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the cnet article - \u0022According to Parkin, who is an Escape Dynamics adviser and who wrote his own Ph.D. thesis on microwave thermal propulsion, a beamed energy propulsion system is capable of producing 2.5 times as much thrust as a traditional chemical-based system. He said that the standard system tops out at an energetic reaction of 16 megajoules per kilogram, while the beamed energy approach can reach 40 megajoules per kilogram.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s good but doesn\u0027t sound groundbreaking. A beam powered launch vehicle would still require a substantial amount of propellant, which takes you right back to the good old rocket equation. And at 1MW per Kg (as per the Wikipedia article) for the duration of the flight to orbit, that\u0027s a lot of power for any sort of reasonable payload. Put a cubesat in a light-as-possible disposable shell and it might work. Might. A spaceplane would be significantly more challenging. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso from the cnet article - \u0022Further, he said, there are those who are critical of the very concept of beamed energy propulsion, mainly because they worry that the technology is not really capable of producing enough of an increase in propulsion efficiency to make investing time and money in it worthwhile.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say that\u0027s an entirely justified concern if you\u0027re only looking at a 2.5 x better propulsion system.

Rapid advances in one field of technology don\u0027t necessarily have any sort of bearing on advances in another field. We have totally sci-fi phones, but we have a notable lack of flying cars for example. \u0022High technology\u0022 isn\u0027t some magic wand that automatically makes everything possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone could link to a more detailed paper on any of this, I\u0027d be grateful.

It\u0027s just a simple matter of putting in the 20-30 years of hard work to make it a mature, TRL8-9 technology, like chemical rockets already are...

The point was to whet your appetite to learn more. I can easily provide you with more links with more detailed information on Microwave Thermal Rockets. Despite your (arrogant) assumptions, lightcraft are actually much LESS practical experiments than Microwave Thermal Thrusters... Whereas a Microwave Thermal Rockets is really just an extension of the chemical rocket concept, and re-uses a LOT of the same technology (the only new components are the Heat Exchanger and the ground-based transmitters, actually), a Lightcraft is an ENTIRELY different class of vessel that is MUCH further from application than Microwave Thermal Rockets...

In this system, the expensive part is going to be the laser stations, not the vehicle. So why not just make it disposable, at least as a first step? Adding wings, wheels, hydraulics, and a large-surface heatshield is only going to make it heavier and more complicated for no good reason.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou clearly didn\u0027t read the articles or OP carefully enough (although I might not have done a good enough job explaining it). It\u0027s PRECISELY for the reason that the transmitters are the most expensive component that you want to use a spaceplane. A spaceplane can get off the ground with a lot LESS Thrust thanks to its wings (optimal rocket TWR is \u0026gt;2, optimal spaceplane runway TWR is between 0.8 and 0.4), and can rely on Microwave Thermal Turbojets for a large part of its ascent- which get a *MUCH* better Thrust:MW of beamed-power ratio than Microwave Thermal Rockets, due to their much higher working-mass and lower Exhaust Velocity... If you do a spaceplane-ascent right, you don\u0027t ever even need a TWR much higher than 1 (if ever)- and you can use Methane instead of Hydrogen as a short \u0022kicker\u0022 for a large amount of Thrust at a better Thrust:MW ratio (but a lower ISP) to get out of the atmosphere as quickly as possible once the L/D ratio declines to the point where atmospheric flight is no longer profitable... (you can also deploy a rocket on a suborbital-trajectory once you have kicked your spaceplane out of the atmosphere, if you want, and use most of the beamed-power to circularize that smaller and lighter craft, while the spaceplane glides back down to the surface using its wings and Thermal Turbojets to perform a descent with very little engine-power...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd again, you don\u0027t even know what shape a beam-powered vehicle would be. Giving it a spaceplane shape only adds a whole lot of engineering constraints that are simply unnecessary at this stage of the concept. Building a microwave thermal thruster that is capable of subsonic, supersonic, hypersonic atmospheric and exoatmospheric propulsion, combined with some sort of rectenna device or heat exchanger and a propellant tank, is going to be the major constraint before you even get into the aerodynamic problems.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerodynamic challenges aren\u0027t easy, and are by far the most involved part of the process- but it\u0027s not like we haven\u0027t solved for them before. The STS proposal that led to the Shuttle saw the proposal of a large number of saceplanes, some of them capable of relatively good hypersonic performance (even if they didn\u0027t make it to space that way- but instead mostly relied on drop-tanks of external tanks and a vertical ascent like the Shuttle...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe secret is, you DON\u0027T need a spaceplane that flies well at \u0022subsonic, supersonic, hypersonic, and exoatmospheric\u0022 conditions- you just need something that is capable of getting off the runway... You design for optimal-performance in hypersonic conditions, and as long as the plane is capable of ascending to the necessary speed\u002Baltitude at all, it really doesn\u0027t matter how long it takes or how efficiently it gets there. This is because you can use Microwave Thermal Turbojets (which should be designed with optimal hypersonic performance in mind) for your initial propulsion, and the time it takes you to get to the hypersonic regime comes at essentially no mass-penalty because the ATMOSPHERE is your propellant up through this point, and you don\u0027t have to carry extra fuel if your plane requires a slower initial ascent due to having highly-swept wings and a high wing-load...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the heat exchanger (you don\u0027t need, or use, rectenna devices, unless you want a small one for auxiliary electrical power- even though usable aircraft rectennas have been around since the 1960\u0027s, where their first demonstrated use was to fly around a toy Microwave-Powered RC helicopter more than 50 years ago...), it\u0027s not a particularly difficult engineering-challenge: a scientist was able to build one in his lab using surplus components, a small gyrotron built for laser research, and surplus *GARDENING* equipment from the local hardware store that had an ISP that nearly matched the Space Shuttle Main Engines- which actually isn\u0027t particularly good performance for a propulsion system than can achieve 800\u002B second ISP\u0027s (the story of this was in the CNET article I linked, I believe- although if it wasn\u0027t I\u0027ll definitely have to get you the correct article, as it\u0027s quite amusing...)

Alternatively they could be like the philae lander . . . . . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtending this logic one step further, the problem with ION drives as we know it is that their gases eventually expire and the charge grids eventually degrade (Or they are going to be huge things (like VASIMR) that consume lots of power.

We do not see ION drives on cars or launches yet so . . . . . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the third issue is this, the concept of IR spectrum and dispersed gases. Space is not devoid of inertia, for example solar winds have very diffuse gas but with high inertia/particle. Said particles have both absorption and emission spectrum. There is actually no particular need to go with complete em drive, one gets a bigger bang if one leverages the impulse against particles that that can be turned to move other directions, the efficiency over time may improve by finding mass for the massless drive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key relationship that I observe is that the more mass one ejects, the more thrust force that is available, and the more energy that can be derived from the ejecta (like LF and Ox). The less mass one ejects per unit of engine mass the less force that is available, the higher ISP one can potentially generate, and the higher need for \u0027arm-stretched out\u0027 electrical power. The observation I make is that there is a need for drive with ISP in the 5000s to 15000s range, but that uses power more efficiently. Beyond 15,000s and given both the lack of electrical power is not really necessary since it does not greatly reduce vehicle weight in fuel. Most of the targets are limited to the inner solar system until more reliable power can be obtained. If one can come up with a cheaper source of power - say converts 10% of an atoms weight into electrical energy, then very high ISPs will be more useful, in theory, but in practice, the ability to convert electrical energy into that high of a directional \u0027impulse\u0027 in a confined space may have issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The second observation is that without a more efficient solar panel of lower mass, the power equation starts to flatten out, when the weight of the craft exceeds 50% in solar cells, acceleration is reaching its saturation point. This is limiting anyway, so there needs to be a different power source.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duxwing","CreatedById":42282,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T15:36:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@KSK We \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E flying cars; we just \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E have densely-settled areas full of bad drivers with no autopilot.

The lower your Exhaust Velocity, the more Thrust/MW you will generate, as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThrust = Mass Flow Rate * Exhaust Velocity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnergy = Mass * Velocity^2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, for a fixed Mass Flow Rate (where Mass = Mass Flow Rate) and where your Exhaust Velocity = Spacecraft Velocity, you get...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThrust = (Energy/ Velocity^2) * Velocity --\u0026gt; Thrust = Energy/Velocity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich proves, when you are traveling lower in the atmosphere, you can get more Thrust/MW...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this actually looks like from a engine-design standpoint is that you concentrate the same amount of beamed-power into an increasingly small Working Mass by doing things like switching from high-bypass to low-bypass turbofans to turbojets to rockets, shutting down engines (and concentrating the available beamed-power into a smaller number of engines operating at higher temperature), and possibly even using Electric Propellers (operating off Microwave Beamed-Power via rectennas) to get off the runway in the first place...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the different optimal engine designs for different speeds/altitude, an argument could be made for a multiple-stage spaceplane design (such as a Microwave Thermal Tubojet lower-stage that releases an orbiter at max cruising altitude which operates entirely off Microwave Thermal Rockets), although for the smaller-scale payloads that will probably compose most of the launch-diet with this technology early on (until people trust it enough to use it to launch astronauts!) it probably just makes more sense to design for high altitudes and speeds, as you only *just barely* need to be able to make it off the Runway with your Thermal Turbojets...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, so you use a small transmitter-array near the runway due to the MUCH higher Thrust/MW you get from Thermal Turbojets than Thermal Rockets, and the complete lack of any need for internal reaction-mass when using them. You ascend in slow, lazy circles to stay in range of the transmitter, and then only head East when you\u0027re near maximum cruising altitude/speed using Thermal Turbojets... You then switch over to Thermal Rockets as you come in range of the second transmitter array, which should be located a good deal East of the runway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ascent-profile is actually the Escape Dynamics plan- although they just rely on a single transmitter-array instead of two!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kibble\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kibble\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo why has no one flown a microwave-thermal space vehicle \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E?

It would now cost only around $6000/kg to LEO using a purely ROCKET driven approach with expendable launch-vehicles, but with 1970\u0027s technology it could have EASILY cost $60,000/kg or more (for comparison, chemical rockets are about $10,000-$8,000/kg to LEO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrowave Thermal Spaceplanes are MUCH cheaper per kg of payload-capacity than Microwave Thermal Rockets, however, due to being reusable AND being able to carry *MUCH, MUCH* more payload to orbit per MW of beamed-power... The same relationship actually exists between MW of Thermal Energy and payload-capacity with chemical spaceplanes vs. rockets, at least in theory- but it\u0027s not really limits on the available MW of Thermal Energy that drives up the costs of chemical rockets...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ELong Answer:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E The technology behind Microwave Transmitters, in the form of gyrotrons, has only reached the appropriate stage of maturity (and cost-effectiveness) in the past 10 years or so to make it worthwhile (THIS is the main reason a Microwave Thermal Rocket would be $6,000/kg now, and perhaps $4,000/kg in 2030, but $60,000/kg in 1970). If the space program had started in 2010, it very well *MIGHT* have used Microwave Thermal Rocketry from the start. But the gyrotron technology simply wasn\u0027t mature enough back in 1960 to make it worthwhile to use Microwave Beamed-Power for things like the Apollo Program...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps not surprisingly, maturing gyrotron technology further is one of the TOP priorities for Escape Dynamics, as Microwave Transmitters represent something like 95% of the cost of a Microwave Thermal Rocket (this is also why a Microwave Thermal Spaceplane is worthwhile- even if it costs 10x as much as a Microwave Thermal Rocket per mission for the vehicle itself, it it gets to orbit on half the beamed-power it will actually by CHEAPER than a Microwave Thermal Rocket...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has reached the point where Escape Dynamics (which wants to build a SSTO Microwave Thermal Spaceplane!) has hardly even bothered messing around with Microwave Thermal Thrusters yet (which are, by comparison to Microwave Transmitters, relatively cheap and easy), and has instead focused on developing better gyrotrons and Microwave Transmitters- because this will save them more money in the long run... \u003Cstrong\u003ETheir most recent breakthrough, a 200 kW Microwave Transmitter with Side Lobe Suppression and a lower cost/kW than existing transmitters, is actually one of their most important\u003C/strong\u003E- because it means that they will be able to execute their entire launch-architecture \u003Cstrong\u003E*MUCH*\u003C/strong\u003E more inexpensively than if they had focused on developing better Microwave Thermal Thrusters right off the bat...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere *ARE* labs focusing on Microwave Thermal Thrusters, at *several* universities across the country, though (for instance, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://spase.stanford.edu/Microwave_Rockets.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echeck out the webpage\u003C/a\u003E of this PhD project at Stanford).
