The problem is that the most stuff I cram in, the less stable the rocket gets. For instance, if I say : let\u0027s go to one of the inner planets with maximum fuel if I screw up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d put a pod, then a buncha laboratories and instruments, then an ion engine to get back with several stacked xenon tanks, then an ascent stage, then a lander stage (I tend to break engines landing so I need ,both), then an ion engine with more xenon to maneuver around the solar system, then a gigantic mess of liquid fuel asparagus lower stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is this huge stack of crap wobbles back and forth during liftoff, and will fail catastrophically if I don\u0027t baby it on ascent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to be able to mount stuff parallel to each other, and reuse the same engine to go home that I used to land. Also, it would be nice to leave most of the laboratories in orbit and land with just 1 lab and a kerbonaut.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T21:32:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/EAS-4_Strut_Connector\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/EAS-4_Strut_Connector\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re the duct tape of KSP and were designed to be an anti-wobble.

Still efficient, but atleast they have some thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you are overdesigning your rocket. You really don\u0027t need more than 2 science parts for a landing, that\u0027ll net you most of the science. And it\u0027s pritty easy to max out the tree as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow your question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can construct the rocket in orbit. Just launch the different modules up seperatly, and dock them tougether. I\u0027d suggest you put the engines in the front though, rather than the back. This is because docking ports are not the strongest connections, and pulling the rocket will eliminate any stress put on them by wobble. (in atmosphere though, I\u0027d push the rocket. Just works out better)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T21:41:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible to make tall rockets less wobbly by placing struts between parts around their perimeter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in general in KSP it is better to build things wide than tall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the picture is my most successful design from career mode. It\u0027s just a no-return probe, it was doing experiments over and over again and transmitting them repeatedly to get all the science. This approach works best because you don\u0027t have to spend time sending another mission but Squad is going to nerf this approach in the next release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the bottom part is able to send the upper part to Duna or Eve and still have fuel left. And the upper part is able to land on a moon, perform science there and get back to orbit. I guess it\u0027d be strong enough even to return to Kerbin. But I used it rather to carry the probe at the very top around the system to perform all the science it could reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jrFkJpd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jrFkJpd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xNh1SlU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xNh1SlU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J6tgmW6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J6tgmW6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
