There\u0027s a few other considerations given the resulting force might not have a linear relation to the deflection, but in broad terms that\u0027s fine. If you\u0027re thinking of fixed surfaces you can just assume it\u0027s deflection is 1 and forget about it. Anyway the point is, if it\u0027s struggling for control in any particular direction then you don\u0027t have enough of that whole equation, so pick the least costly one to raise. Generally you don\u0027t want to raise maximum deflection if you can help it because that will cause more drag, but then so will increasing the area - it just may not increase it as much, but it will increase mass.
