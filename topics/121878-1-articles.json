As you can see from the altitude I\u0027ve just hit the top of the atmosphere. Dynamic pressure is almost 14 pascals. 1 pascal is 1 newton of force spread over 1 square meter. (or 1 kg per meter per second). That\u0027s the benchmark for dynamic pressure for a reentry from a standard orbit around the given planet. There\u0027s not much point in in having the atmosphere any higher. Look also at the amount of drag currently being generated. There\u0027s reasons why it\u0027s as low as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClarification: I mean reasons why the top of the atmosphere is where it is and it is because of expected dynamic pressure and drag at that altitude.
