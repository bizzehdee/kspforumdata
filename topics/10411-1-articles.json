I now discovered the Kosmos parts pack by Normak and combined with parts from BACE by Silisko I built a pretty big space station. Now, my problem here is that in total with the rockets and all it weighs 202,4 tons. I have never launched anything even close to that (yep, noob here!). Right now, with the help of Mechjeb, I can get to about 1 - 1,5 km and then the craft tips over and starts falling back again.
