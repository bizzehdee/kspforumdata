I now discovered the Kosmos parts pack by Normak and combined with parts from BACE by Silisko I built a pretty big space station. Now, my problem here is that in total with the rockets and all it weighs 202,4 tons. I have never launched anything even close to that (yep, noob here!). Right now, with the help of Mechjeb, I can get to about 1 - 1,5 km and then the craft tips over and starts falling back again. During liftoff it shakes as if it were to collapse any moment and it really doesn\\\u0027t feel good to fly it at the moment.\n\nI\\\u0027ve attached a picture below, any ideas how to improve my design?\n\n![nimet4a.png](http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/9730/nimet4a.png)\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T13:23:45Z","Content":"2 things: symmetry and thrust.\n\nYou want to make sure that your craft is perfectly symmetrical so it won\\\u0027t tip over.\n\nThen, you need a LOT of thrust to lift that thing, so you want to add boosters and liquid engines to get more thrust (SRBs are good for liftoff, as they have the hight thrust/weight ratio).\n\nYou may also need gimballed engines to help keep the attitude right, though they are less powerful.\n\nActually, with mods it shouldn\\\u0027t be too much of a problem, but a vanilla game offers too little possibilities for launchers, as you have to add several heavy engines, while a launcher like Saturn V can get many things into orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Tobu91","CreatedById":24654,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T13:32:14Z","Content":"Yeah, that space station is not very symmetrical... I already have 3 SRBs but I will try to add some more. The 9 engines at the bottom are gimballed, they are a part of the Kosmos parts pack.\n\nI\\\u0027ll see what I can do about it."},{"CreatedByName":"imnotacanadian","CreatedById":24403,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T13:51:29Z","Content":"The Nova pack has quite a few tools that would help you out, specifically stronger SRBs."},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T04:32:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The Nova pack has quite a few tools that would help you out, specifically stronger SRBs.\n\nYes the novapunch pack is what i recomend too."}]}
