At about that same time my copy of KSP 19 got corrupted/bugged somehow to the point of not being useable. Stupid thing already barely worked anyway. I had to ramp the graphics way back to get the SOB to load properly with all the mods. But since just before .20 came out it started crashing randomly every 20-30 minutes or so. And every time I even so much as approached something on landing, whatever was already on the ground was disappearing or exploding. I lost the SHADO base that way. I finally threw up my hands and deleted the whole damn folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd speaking of the mods, I\u0027m really just kind of waiting for there to be a comprehensive overall fix and guide to installation of everything. A simplified step by step procedure that will allow me to re-install all the up-to-date mods there are and confirm they\u0027re working without me having to reload the game over and over and over again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I\u0027m not coming off as temperamental. I\u0027m actually just being patient and waiting for things to get fixed to the point where I don\u0027t have to do a lot of the fixing myself. But KSP .20 Really did break an amazing amount of things that were my favorites. Wayland stuff, Bobcat stuff, Novapunch, B9. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of it is coming back already. LLL parts has some good stuff. And you\u0027re working on some good things too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut bottom line - the Eagle is my baby. And until there\u0027s an official fix for that, I have little enthusiasm for working on getting any of the above re-installed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut don\u0027t worry!
