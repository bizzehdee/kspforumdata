If you can make a stable orbit, try making a flyby of the mun.

Your orbit should cross the mun\u0027s and as long as your planes are aligned you should get an encounter. You can fine tune it until you\u0027re happy with everything then execute the node. You\u0027ll go flying off to the mun and pick up a ton of science if you play your cards right. Then once you escape the mun you can burn retrograde to drop your periaps into the atmosphere and boom!
