What you\u0027ve described would require a ton of programming to build a system to generate those suggestions. I really doubt Squad would pursue this suggestion due to the work that would need to start from scratch this \u0027close\u0027 to release. Second, there are tons of ways to make burns to get the same result. If the stock game started suggesting one, it\u0027d become the \u0022right\u0022 way to do something and would cause problems in the community about how the game is making suggestions. Finally, IMO \u0022suggesting nodes\u0022 is too similar to the game playing itself. There\u0027s little to no need for that function if the game has appropriate tutorials, while the information I\u0027ve listed desperately needed in the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to debate this further, since it goes way beyond what I\u0027ve suggested.
