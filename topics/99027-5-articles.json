Ive worked on games, its fun and hard work, and inevitably you have to construct things in a bit of a piecemeal manner, and you constantly have to go back over your work and all the rules and mechanics and make adjustments and revisions to get things right.

The question is where are the gaps? With so much going well, where are points where the experience becomes derailed?
