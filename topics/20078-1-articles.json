The number of parts required for this to happen is proportional to the speed (how many physics calculations per second) the computer\u0027s fastest processor core may achieve (KSP is single-threaded; it only uses one core at a time). In other words, slower processing cores will be able to handle fewer parts, before the engine starts dropping certain calculations in order to maintain frame-rate such that the game engine continues at 1x speed. The first (or one of the first) things to go are strut calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d imagine that time-dilation, similar to how EVE Online handles extreme loads server-side, would help alleviate the problem so that users (at least patient ones) with slower computers could still get large rockets off the ground (if they were patient enough). Though it\u0027s anyone\u0027s guess if Squad has such a thing planned, or if they even have ability to do it (limitations of the engine, excessive development time for such a feature, sheer difficulty of adding a throttle to your program, can all be limiting factors).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-24T06:12:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2012 06:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VGguy49","CreatedById":19257,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T00:46:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may be my computer, it is a mid 2009 Macbook Pro running Lion, with the RAM not upgraded, and it is like a snail.
