So for example:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe KE-1 engine:\u003Cbr\u003E\nMin Thrust: 0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMax Thrust: 1350\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeat Production: 175\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I was thinking for every percent, the heat goes up 3 percent with the override. Min thrust also gets replaced by the previous max thrust setting, a draw back to using override, so the over rides would look something like this(All overrides are based on base value times the percent of the override):\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKE-1 10% over ride:\u003Cbr\u003E\nMin Thrust: 1350\u003Cbr\u003E\nMax Thrust: 1485\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeat Production: 227.5(228)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n20%\u003Cbr\u003E\nMin Thrust: 1485\u003Cbr\u003E\nMax Thrust: 1620\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeat Production: 280\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n30%\u003Cbr\u003E\nMin Thrust: 1620\u003Cbr\u003E\nMax Thrust: 1755\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeat Production: 332.5(333)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n30% heat gets a little high, but I\u0027m sue it\u0027s a fair negative for the positives. If it\u0027s too much and the engines explode instantly, I\u0027m sure it could be lowered to more manageable levels.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, yeah that\u0027s my idea/request for a mod. Anyone feel up to it, or feel like this should be a thing?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease leave comments and suggestions!
