And learning an absolute truck load of information!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I must say, as with most everyone, I\u0027ve made my share of dumb mistakes through my journey of trial-and-error lol....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I came into this game during .20 and now have obviously updated to .21.1. Since permanent death to Kerbal\u0027s is now a reality, I must seek the help of the community at large to save our greatest pal, Jebediah!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy very first space craft I personally built (tried a few of the pre-installed builds first) I was very proud of and had big ambitions for. I was going to the moon! Once I got into orbit and plotted my path to the moon, I soon realized that I should have enough Delta-V to make it into Minmus orbit. Very, very exciting. Well, long story short: I was just shy of Dv to completely intercept and make orbit with Minmus. I thought to myself, that\u0027s okay I\u0027ve decoupled my final liquid fuel stage and have this very lightweight pod and my ion engine to get me around. Well, I\u0027ll let the picture below do the talking and let you notice my fatal flaw in this design.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/9377701620_66a454db88_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229377701620_66a454db88_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep.

Which, boy oh boy did I ever!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, by the time I realized my ion motor was upside down and I had the time to actually play some, .21 had come out and introduced perma-death to Kerbals. NOOOOOO! Lol I must save Jeb!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the ridiculous orbit my craft ended up in with absolutely no way of propelling myself what-so-ever (highlighted in yellow):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7401/9377687326_61ccaba8e3_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229377687326_61ccaba8e3_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing obviously doesn\u0027t have a docking ring or anything of the like because I built this thing like my second day of owning KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is this: What in the world is the best way of accomplishing a rescue mission for Jebediah? I could care less about the craft itself, I just want to get Jeb back so I can put him somewhere safe and keep him alive lol... I\u0027ve thought up a few different ideas craft-wise, but I guess I\u0027m not too sure of myself yet. I don\u0027t want to risk blowing either craft up in the process. I also don\u0027t want to end up in a ridiculous orbit with the rescue craft either. Also, I suppose maneuvering nodes would be my best bet? How do I work out when to exit Kerbin orbit headed towards Jeb?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to save good ol\u0027 Jebediah and I need your help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-27T13:30:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2013 01:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Blake Gates\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged to \u0026#039;Answered\u0026#039;\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pinkieseb","CreatedById":73027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T13:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne idea is you could build a rocket with enough DeltaV to get to Minmus and back, dont bother with a lander because all you\u0027ll do is open parachutes for reentry for Kerbin. Get as close as you can to the same orbit as Jeb, then once your within 1-10km of Jeb fire your engines Directly at the pink dot that should appear on your NavBall... Once close enough try to fly alongside and open up a ladder which will end up near the hatch of Jebs pod. Ten EVA jeb and hopefully he will float close enough to your ladder to grab. If not timewarp so his further away from his ship then swoop in and get the ladder super close.
