More dampener CAN provide a reaction to this push back, and therefore create more thrust, but too much will simply cause the leg to over stress and boom. The interesting thing about that is the dampener strength appears to\u00A0tied to the mass of the craft the legs are on (meaning that on anything of decent weight even that .5 \u00A0becomes too much dampener). My guess is to prevent heavy craft from becoming a Pogo stick, but i have no clue otherwise.\u00A0I also have found that the closer the leg is to the blade, the more thrust it gives, and i believe this is\u00A0due to more \u0022pushing\u0022 time and \u00A0also it seems like leg spring strength has a curve. (weakest at the bottom and strongest at the top) This would actually make sense because you would not want your suspension to be rock hard, or automatically max out. I personally have 2 guesses on your \u0022boom\u0022 zone though. First is that past that your blades are expanding with the spinning and hitting the legs. The other guess is based off of having recently installed the mod which provides a visible wire frame for hit boxes (the one azimech uses). From that you can see there is actually a part of the leg which goes slightly beyond where the piston part of it appears to start, and the blades once again might be hitting that. I have however done most of my testing with the large landing gear, so it might be true that the medium have a weirdness like this. From my tests I have not even been able to get the small ones to work AT ALL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry about the wall o\u0027 text, but I have been meaning to post about my more recent understanding and this seemed like a good enough place to do it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klond","CreatedById":38787,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-18T23:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Thanks for the reply. \u00A0Lots of great info there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I had some success with the tiny legs, but the power/weight wasn\u0027t there for me, and tricky finding the\u00A0sweet spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-19T02:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTried to land on the Diving Vessel but the Kraken would not allow it!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gvtHwcw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gvtHwcw.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gamingknight","CreatedById":175269,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-18T16:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncool idea but the kraken hates going on my aircratf carrier\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
