While it\u0027s true that drag at the rear of a vehicle can in some cases hold the rear end stable (such as with trains, in which we are referring to friction drag not aerodynamic drag), stabilizers actually work because of air pressure on either side. If the air pressure is equivalent on both sides of a flat symmetrical wing (i.e. not a airfoil) then the wing cannot move and therefore anything attached to it doesn\u0027t have anywhere to go. The pressure pushes inward in both directions equally and it prevents slip. Same principle on the vertical stabilizer of an airplane.
