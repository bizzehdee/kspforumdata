The idea being that your \u0022primary\u0022 axes on the stick are the X and Y joystick axes, with any rudder being a less-often-used tertiary axis. In planes, this means pitch and roll are on the stick, since these are the primary controls used for steering.

I have simply gotten used to using the pedals for steering rockets and rovers. But when I began using this hardware with KSP I did feel like it would have been easier to be able to switch axes in flight. This is particularly the case with rover acceleration and deceleration. I currently have those mapped to joystick pitch down and up (since KSP expects a \u0022centered\u0022 position for zero throttle on a rover). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not found a perfect solution, I think that would have to be implemented in the game itself. There are a few hacky workarounds, though. You can, for instance, use autohotkey to remap one axis to another based on a variable, and then you could use another autohotkey script to change the value of that variable based on a button press. I have a feeling this won\u0027t be very reliable with KSP, because KSP (or unity) seems to mess up axis detection in the first place. For example, when I go to settings \u0026gt; controls and map \u0022pitch up\u0022 to the input \u0022back on the stick\u0022, which is joystick axis zero, KSP actually displays the name of the detected input as rudder pedals, or throttle, or just about anything other than the one I actually used... but it still is in fact mapped to the stick. The problem is that this would make dynamic remapping frustratingly difficult, because you wouldn\u0027t really know what axis to tell KSP to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"caba111","CreatedById":39713,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T01:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allmhuran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allmhuran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI assume what you are looking for is a way to switch the axes used by yaw and roll.
