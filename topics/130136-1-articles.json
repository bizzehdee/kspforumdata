The delta v states didn\u0027t appear, the action groups mode didn\u0027t activate and it won\u0027t let me grab the capsule and move it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I am so glad you told me this about deleting the references. I really need that info. I appreciate helping me. I\u0027m glad I made a backup copy BTW. It\u0027s not a big deal now having to delete an embedded part, but in the future it\u0027ll be good to know how to fix it without having to delete the parent object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!!!!
