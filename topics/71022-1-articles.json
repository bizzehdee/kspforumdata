One way that I plan node positions in 3ds is to ensure that my part origin is at 0,0,0 and then make a small sphere and move it to where I want the node to be. Then it\u0027s global coordinates will give you the right distances for the cfg, you\u0027ll just have to remember that \u002Bz in 3ds is actually \u002By in the KSP configs, etc. You can do the same basic thing in unity using an empty gameobject, but it\u0027s easier for me inside 3ds max.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T14:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a break, I come back and with the help from Porkjet, I have fix the size issue (weird thing), big thanks to him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly the C part remain, I first started with 1m diameter cylinder as reference for engines, which was wrong, I\u0027m redoing it with 1.25m diameter cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LugFdXz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LugFdXz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/irln9wp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022irln9wp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WmNgVfQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WmNgVfQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qYfqj3o.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qYfqj3o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T15:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice, I\u0027m looking forward to this part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galacticruler","CreatedById":58398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T21:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENeeds to be a tail adapter for the special tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T21:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking on these parts let me goes a bit sideways as I have add also:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea battery bank,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea SAS module,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea stack decoupler,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand a stack separator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll models are almost ok, maybe some more work will be needed on UV, the big part is texture (only stock style for now, Porkjet\u0027s SP\u002B style is planned).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll 4 in the mk2 shape, see album on first post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LYZpGqT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LYZpGqT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also thinking of adding a SFB and at least one engine, maybe kind of futuristic one, making SSTO or MSTO would have never been so much fun ! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pondafarr","CreatedById":99169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T03:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, put this on my \u0022download immediately\u0022 list!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T12:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToday\u0027s update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lxUgL8O.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lxUgL8O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KngSo2O.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KngSo2O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a few alignment and texture issues to fix and... another bonus part to complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have decided to split parts, so this will not include other mk2 parts (SAS, battery, decoupler and separator), which will get their own release, I have also a mk2 engine on the workbench, I have decide to make one not realistic at all, an engine which use liquid fuel only (because it\u0027s the most common propellant in common mk2 tanks without plug-in like RF/MFT), and which will be most efficient in high altitude/vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone wants to help to make a good atmosphereCurve and maybe a velocityCurve, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is (there is another pic in the album on 1st post):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Rz9wUlZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Rz9wUlZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(it has almost the length of a mk2 fuselage, and the usual bell is made by the fuselage itself.
