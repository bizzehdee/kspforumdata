If you flip the .png upside down it *should* fix this. Also note that in my pack I took the shadow layer and offset it by one pixel to the side to make the layers look more separate from orbit. You could try fiddling with that yourself if you want."},{"CreatedByName":"optimusjamie","CreatedById":97759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T15:32:29Z","Content":"Is there a way to get this working with the EVE WIP?"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T18:46:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there a way to get this working with the EVE WIP?\n\nSadly no.

Because KSP is a 32 bit program it freezes and crashes at about 3.3 GB of RAM usage. If you pull up task manager and sort it by memory you should see that KSP is reaching this limit and crashing on start because of it. THERE IS a way to solve this however!
