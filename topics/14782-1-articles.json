I\\\u0027m considering making this mod myself, but first I thought I\\\u0027d gather some ideas (and buy some time to learn more about modding KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, there\\\u0027s not a huge amount of storyline in KSP. This isn\\\u0027t the dev team\\\u0027s fault; the game is still in the very early stages and there is much to do in terms of the engine before the actual plot needs to be added. However, I was thinking that in the meantime it might be cool to mod in some simple missions. These missions aren\\\u0027t meant to provide a full \u0027campaign mode\u0027 for KSP, or to have any relation or effect on whatever the devs end up adding in terms of progression and plot - it\\\u0027s mostly a set of challenges and fun things to do between now and whenever all that stuff gets added officially. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to add a few scientific instrument parts to the game - the list I have so far is an atmospheric sampler, a surface sampler, a radiation detector, and an object recorder. With these, you could fly some basic science missions. In theory, it should then be possible to have the various instruments record their progress in a file which the plugin could check, and use to modify the behaviour of parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmospheric sampler would gather samples of the different gases it passed through - Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere being the only real one at present, although I\\\u0027m guessing other planets will be added in due course. For now, I\\\u0027d have it take samples at three or four altitudes, and then also sample the corona of Kerbin\\\u0027s star if a ship passed close enough. It might also be possible to have an impactor part, which would throw off a plume of gas on impact so that you could sample the moons. Atmospheric data would improve the effectiveness of aerodynamic control surfaces, and reduce drag slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe surface sampler would sample soil and rock from bodies on which it came to rest - possibly different ones from different areas, if it\\\u0027s possible to tell what the vessel is sitting on. At the very least, that\\\u0027s three samples you could take; one from each of the bodies currently in the game. Surface samples would improve the speed and traction of rovers, and the strength of landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radiation detector could be placed into space and would record information about the conditions there. The type of information recorded would differ based on the body that the detector was orbiting at the time. The data would improve the effectiveness of solar panels, ion engines, or communications, depending on where the detector was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe object recorder would record information about objects and artefacts found on missions (such as the monoliths), and mark their positions. The effect of this data would depend on the object (assuming there\\\u0027s a way of telling what the object is from code), and might possibly include achievements and/or easter eggs. If possible, the discovery of various objects may also unlock parts such as more efficient engines, more effective SAS modules, or better communications systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would also be a communications device or two, similar to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9006\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis great mod\u003C/a\u003E, for relaying scientific data and for controlling the spacecraft. Craft without a communications system capable of reaching the KSC would have to return to within range for their data to count as \u0027collected\u0027. Craft with no antenna would have to get within a certain distance of the KSC. Craft that have collected samples would get a small score for transmitting data back, a larger score for returning to Kerbin with the samples, and the best score for getting those samples to within a certain distance of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do people think? Would anyone enjoy a mod like this? Any further suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazy95","CreatedById":30691,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-21T23:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou dont need mods for a mission now that 0.16 is out \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esimply send a rocket up without a parachute with a doomed kerbal and attempt to transport him to a safe rocket \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eim having fun trying to save a stranded kerbal (the famed jeb) on the mun \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewho i may add jump out of his rocket while it was falling to the ground and i saved him from going squish XD\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Divaglio3578","CreatedById":29719,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-22T02:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think itd make the game easier if someone coded a few objectives to complete, such as \\\u0027Put a satellite in geostationary orbit (2868.3-2868.5 km circular orbit)\\\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
