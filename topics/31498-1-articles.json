The plane could reach a maximum of 1300 m/s and a ceiling height of 31,000m before the engines flamed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERam jet MK1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a complete re-design and featured 2 ram jet intakes with jet air intakes on the back which still created an air stream even tho they were facing the wrong way:)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi44.tinypic.com/2u62ue1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222u62ue1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was also the first plane of mine to see the stars/galaxy! This was a massive achievement as it was able get very close to 1600m/s which is a casual 3,500 mph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi39.tinypic.com/2wgu7mc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222wgu7mc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERam Jet MK2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the latest and best ram jet aircraft i have. Its capable of not only achieving over 2,000 m/s, but can cruise at this speed while at 40,000m... enough to put it in an orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt features 14 ram air intakes with 7 jet air intakes, all powering one turbo jet engine. Its possible to cruise at 40,000m if you throttle down to 30% as this is much kinder on the available air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi39.tinypic.com/eiuvkl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eiuvkl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi41.tinypic.com/afkg10.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022afkg10.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi42.tinypic.com/67mb9i.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002267mb9i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop speed that i reached was around 2,400m/s!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aircraft also features a full ejection system which performs most of the time, flawlessly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ixolate industries","CreatedById":59366,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T19:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery functional I have only just been able to get a plane to orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosarium","CreatedById":51628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T20:02:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo search machinbirds youll learn a lot\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
