The counter-point that I\u0027m trying to make is that the forums are not the only official channel we have. Facebook, Twitter, KSP-TV and other places are also official channels we maintain. The form and depth of information often lead us to certain channels we can use: Maxmaps\u0027 dV announcement for example was a very short \u0022snippet\u0022 of information, by which I don\u0027t want to downplay its importance, but it was a very short update with no further detailed information. Twitter is perfect for this sort of thing, and like I pointed out earlier these snippets won\u0027t work well on the forums. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould we also post this to the forums? Yes, there\u0027s nothing technically stopping us from doing that, but why would the forums get all the information where other official channels don\u0027t? Well, as many people argued a lot of the \u0027hard core\u0027 fanbase resides here, but is that really enough of a reason to refrain from posting information exclusively elsewhere? We have a great community and this sort of information always finds its way onto the forums, where someone gets to have their 15 minutes of fame for discovering a new piece of the 1.0 puzzle, and I think that in itself is a good argument not to post everything here. I know many of you will disagree with me here (and in the past I probably would have disagreed with myself on this point), but the hunt for small bits of information regarding development is a great part of a community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO, yeah, they really are geared towards the multi-platform hype machine.

People posted a large number of threads here, asking what was going on, why their game wasn\u0027t working, etc. As far as I know, Squad has not yet addressed the issue on their own forum. Users located a post by a dev on the forum for Orbiter. How many Steam users were affected by this? How many of them would know to go to the other forum to find out that this was a deliberate action by the company, and not a bug?

Yes we get a daily blurb, a weekly dev note, and an occasional blog post. When such a thing happens the community jumps on it like a thirsty traveller in the desert.

They want to maximize audience numbers, but not the number of people in their audience. Say they make announcements only through twitter. That gets them lots of twitter followers. But by alternating between twitter and facebook they force fans to subscribe to both. So now they have twitter followers AND facebook followers, even though they know they are the same people. The end goal is to have all of us \u0027hooked in\u0027 though lots of different media platforms.

Why does twitter want people to use Twitter? So they can farm users for marketable data. As a gaming company Squad should not treat customers this way.
