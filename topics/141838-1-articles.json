Also I explored every planet back in 0.16 and they all feel a little too... familiar. I managed to figure out that such things exist, but I am really at a loss trying to understand how to make it happen. I\u0027d really appreciate if anyone would be so kind as to answer a few questions I have:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhere do I get Kopernicus? There seem to be a few different threads and I\u0027m not sure which is the \u0022official\u0022 up to date one.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow do I install this? Is it as simple as putting folders in Gamedata like all the other mods?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWill I have to start a new save? I\u0027ve already started over a few times due to discovering other mods, and I\u0027d like if all my existing flights could just transfer smoothly into the new universe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone can help me solve these things then I think I can figure the rest out on my own. Thanks to whoever can help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T08:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140580-112-kopernicus-105-may-28/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
