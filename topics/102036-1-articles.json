But only first step. Class E is heavy as great many potato, or even more. If RCS and reaction wheel is powerful enough to get Class E rotating, will break locking pivot on claw and tumble out of control. If ship survive, will be useless for stable orbital insertion burn. How you do, is bring along remotes tug. Just claw, cheap flight computer, reaction wheel, much RCS, power systems. Place one on opposite side of asteroid of main tug. Is ok, but even better place two to four more same kind, spaced evenly at 90 degrees to axis of towing. Then have much RCS to rotate Class E around itself, is very stable, will not stress pivot if done carefully.

Even then, you should keep the forces low: he has two large reaction wheels on his vessel and the mod engine he uses has 450kN of thrust (equalling 8 stock nukes or 2/3rds of a Skipper), and I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s truly possible to run them at full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burn times aren\u0027t even the worst.

Jsouder\u0027s vessel if perfectly up to that task: if I get the numbers right, one tank will apply 50m/s even to the heaviest asteroid and refueling it\u0027s tanks will take about twenty minutes.
