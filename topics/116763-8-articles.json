Basically, once space is independent of Earth, a space economy will start taking off. Otherwise, we\u0027re just relying on the planet for our needs. That isn\u0027t going to work in the long run. Once we actually have an independent space economy, I worry it will remain a space economy for a long time. It\u0027ll be\u00A0more profitable to have and sell resources in space to people who need them in space (i.e. water ice for rocket fuel, breathing air, water to drink, water to farm in, hydrogen for fusion reactors, yada yada yada) than it will be to bring stuff down to Earth (carry a hundred tons of quite dense metallic material inside a reentry module)\u00A0and from Earth to space (rocket launches for going up with really big expensive rockets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-24T02:10:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2016 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Findthepin1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T06:59:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still think propellent depot has an excellent commercial case. Yes, having a cheap source of fuel in orbit does not in itself provide a reason to go to space, but why does it need to?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SLS costs $35 billion to develop and $500 million a pop to launch, assuming NASA hit the forecast budgetary numbers which seems rather doubtful. NASA is supposed to launch a SLS every year. That is money on the table that could be in your pocket if you could provide LOX and LH2 on tap in LEO. Yes this would require technologies like zero g fluid transfer, zero boil off hydrogen storage and in orbit electrolysis of water if your feedstock is water, but propellant depot technology is currently under intense R\u0026amp;D effort and there\u0027s no reason to believe that these engineering issues wouldn\u0027t be resolved in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, assuming the technology exist to store and transfer LOX, LH2 and H2O in orbit and cracking H2O into LOX and LH2 is possible in space. That means you then have the business case to setup a private propellant depot in orbit to get that NASA money. Once your Orbital Gas n Go is opened you could easily sell oh say, LOX and LH2 at $4000 per kg, just below the price per kg of Falcon 9. The cost for SLS to lift LOX and LH2 to orbit would be many orders of magnitude higher than your price since it has to be a man-rated rocket. As a result NASA would be pressured to use smaller rockets (say something like a Delta-IV of some sort) to put their government manned payload into orbit with an empty upper stage, dock with your depot and buy your fuel, else they will be accused of wasting tax payer money on unnecessarily large rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that means you\u0027re going to make a lot of money, as long as you can refill your depot with water cheaper than $4000 per kg. But that\u0027s not your problem, you just put up ads saying \u0022Pure Water wanted at Orbital Gas n Go, $2000 per kg\u0022 and let the other companies work that out. Maybe they would build extremely cheap but not so reliable rockets to lift water from Earth (if 20% of the rocket blows up, who cares? It\u0027s just water), or maybe they will deploy ISRU operators at Lunar poles or NEO to drill for water ice. Whatever the solution is you don\u0027t care, you only pay them once they have delivered the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact you could probably charge higher than $4000 per kg or whatever the price is for the lowest cost rocket at that time. After all a NASA government payload might need a lot of fuel and the cheapest rocket on the market might need many trips to fill it up. But government payloads generally don\u0027t want to wait around as they have people on board and they don\u0027t want to miss transfer windows just because one of the cheap rockets failed to make orbit. So you stand to make that extra money by being the middle man and smooth out the Supply vs Demand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, NASA doesn\u0027t actually need to be forced into this by economic pressure - they have stated very publicly that\u0027s the future they hope for. They\u0027ve come up out and said they want to be customers for propellent depots, not operators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, there are laws in place to prevent NASA from working with say, the Chinese Space Agency. But they aren\u0027t no such law preventing Gas n Go from servicing both. You also get all the small fries from private companies now looking to put medium sized payload up for the cheap using refuel - say, Planetary Resource ISRU robot ship headed to NEO for that sweet sweet $2000 per kg ice - economic bootstrapping in action!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-24T07:06:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2016 07:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"55delta","CreatedById":101735,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T07:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s all good...well, except for thread necromancy.
