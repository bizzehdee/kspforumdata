I\u0027m unsure if I\u0027d even ever use the DSR bodies. They\u0027re a bit lacking in the modularity that you get when using parts that aren\u0027t necessarily build for rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, together or apart the plugin really doesn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E enough to really bog anything down on your system, and you\u0027re all free to remove parts you don\u0027t want from the installation. For this reason alone, asking someone to fix their mod so it doesn\u0027t crash your \u003Cem\u003Eindividual \u003C/em\u003Ecomputer because of an over-sized texture, one of which comes in an easily editable format is, in my opinion, absolutely ridiculous. Heck, I\u0027m dug in pretty deep with this mod and \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E don\u0027t even run everything in my game the way it comes. Every single freakin\u0027 texture and part config that goes into my Gamedata folder gets combed though to ensure that performance on my end is maximized. This includes resizing, often by hand, every texture that I download. \u003Cem\u003EHowever, \u003C/em\u003EI do not recommend you go nuts like that. I\u0027m just a bit over-sensitive about my mod installs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should see what I do when installing mods for games like Skyrim. Lets just say every single record in one of those mods, and every texture, model, and script gets a very fine sweep before it ever gets loaded into the game. That includes comparing changed records against every other mod currently installed and building compatibility patches if necessary. I\u0027m just a bit nuts that way. At least for KSP I can do half of the stuff I do with automated batch files.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T07:57:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rapturist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rapturist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MoHbuls.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/MoHbuls.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dYiijgG.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/dYiijgG.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5RZFAYe.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/5RZFAYe.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s some in-action shots, I still have some issues transferring from ocean to land, in some cases the hover isn\u0027t high enough and my treads get wrecked so I have to slowly move on to land or water, but as you can see in the last image at the island I had to speed up a bit to get up that sneaky hill but obviously had some tread issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are those propellers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T10:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s interesting.

I wonder if one of your WIP modules got trapped in there. Anyway... I agree that you probably should start separating things out into different files.
