However, it could have used a little more fast-paced content, a little more editing on the videos, and perhaps shorter video duration (even Scott Manley\u0027s videos push the boundaries of my attention span sometimes). In addition, while I didn\u0027t count anything against you for having non-KSP videos, some of the other judges might have. I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than becoming discouraged due to your less-than-optimal finish, I would recommend trying to channel your energy towards making your channel better, so that when/if another Oscar-B ever happens, you\u0027ll be ready to claim a top spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing was rigged here, either.

I, for one, really liked BaconSpaceProgram\u0027s content because it showcased some nice ideas and some beautiful craft in a way that was quite aesthetically appealing.
