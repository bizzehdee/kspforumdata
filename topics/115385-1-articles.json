Jets react to slow, rockets would use too much fuel.\n\nAlso, I discovered, when using FAR you are not likely going faster than mach 1. The surface mounted repulsors cause way to much trans-sonic drag to go faster. Even if you engines can push that hard, it will just rip the craft to pieces ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nDrag for my craft looks like this (red line):\n\n![uEVVldK.png](http://i.imgur.com/uEVVldK.png)\n\nAs you can see, drag more than triples between mach 0.8 and 1.0"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:07:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can.\n\nActually, after doing a practice run, I\u0027ve decided that I don\u0027t actually need it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I haven\u0027t played around with those mods, but given that you\u0027ve done some diligence, if there are no objections, I say go for it, and good luck! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nSure. I did some testing and it\u0027s top speed in a straight run is 240m/s or so (just beyond the point where the mach effects start), but moving around, it\u0027s speed is similar to yours. I\u0027ve since attached a jet engine in back though.\n\n\u003E MechJeb is fine. There\u0027s only so much auto-piloting it can effectively do here, and I\u0027m pretty positive you have to do some of the flying no matter what. (And besides, I want to see a kOS user prove me dead wrong and leave us all worshipful of their scripting skills.)\n\nYeah, it\u0027s mainly to assist in stability while going over land, it still has trouble when I REALLY go airborne. I\u0027ve also devised a way to make it highly maneuverable, possibly jet fighter level of maneuverability, while on the ground anyway, it flails while in the air.\n\nEdit: Oof, that first stage keeps getting me, dang slope transition.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T15:48:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 03:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**"},{"CreatedByName":"the_bT","CreatedById":3876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T16:51:58Z","Content":"I did some more testing and have found two things:\n\n**1.**\n\nI copied my craft into a stock install to compare FAR against stock aero. FAR does make a significant difference, however, it does not make you universally faster. In stock my time is over 9 minutes! ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)\n\nWith the engines on my design, I can go up to 280m/s (sea level) in FAR but only about half of that in stock. Normal sized turbojets (~5x stronger) on the other hand, get up to almost 500m/s top speed at sea level in stock. In FAR, engines of that size crash you into the sound barrier.\n\nSo In conclusion, FAR favors lighter designs with small engines which are easier to get through the land bit, but limit your top speed to 300 or so m/s\\*. Stock offers the possibility to go faster, but you need big engines and enough fuel to feed them. This will make the craft heavy. As the track is 60ish % over water without tight turns, I assume stock might be quicker than FAR, if you can get through the rough bit.\n\n\\*unless you can use repulsors inside fairings, didn\u0027t test that...\n\n**2.**\n\nCockpit view makes this challenge even better!

Works, is insanely fast in a straight line, breaks up due to aerodynamic stress a lot. As soon as you get airborne it tries to flip and if it does you are dead.\n\nLove it XD\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T18:27:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by the\\_bT**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:22:50Z","Content":"What\u0027s the maximum allowable time for being airborne?
