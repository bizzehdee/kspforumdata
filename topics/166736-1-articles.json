It\u0027s a much faster and more accurate way to dock and doesn\u0027t require any mods.\u00A0In 1.3.1 the near clipping plane was changed (though it seems like the camera just isn\u0027t allowed to zoom in as far), so this is no longer possible\u00A0as the back of the docking port just fills the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love to see the camera allowed to zoom in farther so that a player could view from directly inside a part. It allows for a first person view for piloting, or also for a more cinematic view from whatever part you choose to aim at. The change implemented in 1.3.1 obviously doesn\u0027t prevent docking, it just makes it a more tedious task, or means a player\u00A0would need to use a mod to have the same effect (something I prefer to avoid).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-21T21:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have actually never heard of using the camera that way. What a brilliant idea, and what a shame it can\u0027t be done anymore!
