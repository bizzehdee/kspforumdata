I do so because probability suggests so. True, the odds of any one star producing a planet that has all the perquisites for a long-lasting civilization to rise is astronomical, akin to any one national lottery ticket being the winner. But even if the odds of any one star \u0022winning\u0022 the lottery was one in a billion, that still leaves our galaxy holding 400 billion tickets. It would be very surprising if we did turn out to be the only ones alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I can\u0027t predict us winning the lottery one week, only for our next-door neighbors to win the next, with the same level of certainty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this scenario, two stars, both very close to each other (think Sol and Alpha Centauri, ~4 light years), produces life independently, eventually leading to two sapient species, that both organize into technology wielding civilizations. The two of them are extremely close to each other in progress, less than a century of difference (for example, one may achieve mastery of wireless radio as the other is building it\u0027s first nuclear reactor). Yes, I\u0027m aware it is very unlikely that evolutionary processes spanning billions of years will produce two societies so in \u0022lockstep\u0022 with eachother, but none of this is really that likely to begin with. \u0022A few sentences ago\u0022 would\u0027ve been an excellent time to start analyzing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, eventualy they both develop radio communications. One points their receivers towards the others star, and they pick up signals that are most certainly not natural. The thousands, millions of messages both planets have been leaking out into space reaches eachothers ears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do they both react to this? This is something that SETI has been trying to find for 50 years, but only more so. Whatever radio signals we receive would\u0027ve been traveling for at least decades, even centuries. Here, the round trip for a message, and a response is a mere 8 years. To sum it up, we have the makings for the ultimate long-distance relationship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould there be violence and fear, or rejoicing and acceptance? What sort of response would they both make? Would either of them make any long-term plans, from trying to assemble a starship to serve as a diplomatic envoy, to a missile designed to hit the other guy\u0027s planet as hard as possible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T23:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E4ly would probably be around the edge of possibility for receiving undirected radio broadcasts from one system or other. Beyond that, radio signals fade into the cosmic background noise, as the signal spreads out and becomes more disparate due to inverse square law.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the more technologically capable society would be more likely to detect the lesser society first, partly because of better detection technology, partly because their transmissions would not be as powerful due to that detection technology. When the lesser society starts broadcasting around the globe, they will need to send more powerful signals to be received clearly, whereas the greater society will have the benefit of advances and infrastructure. Thus it would be likely that the capable society makes contact first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFear vs acceptance will come down to culture and diplomacy, with violence and rejoicing coming much later if they come. Violence because sending weapons across the stars would be a major feat for either species if we\u0027re talking about a century of difference in human terms, rejoicing because sending any aid across the stars is going to be just as difficult, though rejoicing might be more likely if the local culture really likes the idea of aliens. And the less capable society is going to be more likely to feel fear, at first, due to the technology disparity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the long run, I think violence is a less likely outcome than ambivalence or rejoicing. Developing technology for interstellar travel will probably obviate any need one side will have for the other\u0027s resources, simply because if you have the technology to either survive for centuries-long journeys without issue (generation ship) or send military hardware across the stars in enough time that the enemy won\u0027t be able to see it and then build their own defense fleet (torchships bordering on fantasy, or FTL travel) then you don\u0027t need anything physical that the enemy could provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, a war of ideologies is possible given a very imperialistic society on one side or both. Whether or not this would happen would depend on how quickly one side advances with respect to the other, since developing technology, building, and targeting relativistic weapons could allow the other side ample time to build their own, and with a 4ly information delay, there\u0027s no telling whether if you launch yours, you\u0027ve just ensured your own destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility that could tie in with this is technology trade \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC for one, the two worlds could benefit from sharing scientific and engineering data. They could also choose to broadcast no technology-related information, to keep the other side from benefitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you all think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-04T23:39:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2014 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded more speculation on warfare and interaction\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T00:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to assume both have fairly human mentalities.

At first there will be widespread panic, faint radiosignals from a close star? Sounds like an invasion fleet. Once they realize what\u0027s going on they\u0027ll definitely start to send messages. If you only need to send the signal 4 LY\u0027s there are simply too many people with the required resources to keep quiet. I suspect that making mathematically encrypted messages will become a popular pastime for radio amateurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the lesser civilization actually detects the other, things will really get moving. At first there will be some panic, but not as badly as with the other civilization. After all, the signals are quite clearly encrypted messages meant specifically for them. Not the kind of thing you\u0027d expect as a prelude for a invasion. As soon as they decrypt some of the messages they\u0027ll start to send their own. Thanks to the short response time they should be able to communicate pretty quickly. Since communication is so easy I suspect all sorts of culture and technology will start to flow between the 2. The lesser Civ would be influenced the most by this, anyone with a big dish and a decryption algorithm can get a century ahead.

Followed by this, I would immediately increase funding for the space program with an massive \u0022black project\u0022 to research advanced technologies but keep the reason hidden to the Public. Then it would be a waiting game of listening and estimating their technology level, and slow adjustment as I use political influence to have a Senate hearing about alien life and give a couple speechs about life on other worlds, before revealling the whole truth to the public six years after.
