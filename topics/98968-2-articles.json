This tradeoff will occur whether or not the player chooses to timewarp to the completion or not.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like saying that the Mun should be moved to a 100km orbit around Kerbin, because otherwise a player will just timewarp until they reach their intercept point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.

Some of the most rewarding accomplishments is being able to take what may initially look to be a failed mission, improvise a solution and be able to complete at least some of your initial goals (or just completely repurpose the launched spacecraft for some other mission). From there, use it as a learning experience so you can improve mission planning later; failure is the best way to learn. When I first started playing, it took me several times to accomplish a manned mission to Moho with a Kerbin return with enough delta-v, but man did it feel good when I finally did it.

Information overload does not automatically make it a better game. Do what extremes should they go? Food and water? Hygiene? Mood? Loneliness? Bathroom? Maybe we need an exercise regiment (I\u0027ve actually seen that suggestion and there is even a mod for it) and instead of just \u0022unlocking\u0022 EVA, there should be a training program that takes time for every Kerbal to complete (I actually like that idea, but it is really superfluous for the games intentions.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as for the veteran players, just how many hours do you think the game should be required to entertain you for? 10? 20? 100?

That speaks volumes to just how solid the core game is on the \u0022fun\u0022 scale. Very few games manage to capture large audiences for that long, especially single-player ones, even with mods. (I think my next highest single player game for hours played is Fallout New Vegas, weighing in at 222 hours and that took some serious modding to do. I don\u0027t blame Bethesda for that.

You just replace the \u0022launch now\u0022 button with a \u0022launch now (but with the game clock advanced a bit)\u0022 button, and the game is no different to how it is now. If you want construction time to actually matter, then it has to be in a way that they are long relative to either contract completion deadlines or relative to the arrival of orbital transfer windows. In each of these cases, I can see no clear benefit from the system, just a way of making the already cliff like learning curve even steeper for newcomers. If you take the view, \u0022it should be in there but an option that only experience players will turn on\u0022, I would suggest the better option there is \u0022download the mod for it\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see a similar sort of situation with life support. At present, life support is something that is built in to any capsule that can support Kerbals. Where\u0027s the O2, CO2 scrubbers, H2O supply etc? it\u0027s in the capsule. Suggesting that it needs to be an extra part to contain it is like the old SAS system. Every craft needs it, so all it ends up being is one more part to forget that increases part count and adds no additional gameplay options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you make life support some sort of consumable resource, then you have the problem of resupply. Perhaps the first resupply mission to your cool space station is fun. Will it still be fun the 5th time? How about the 15th time? If it is consumed slowly enough for the resupply problem not to become game breaking, then it\u0027ll just be a matter of loading up your space craft with supplies and forget about it. Or just include loads in the capsules to begin with (which is pretty much where we are today).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course then there is the worst of all situation where you combine these two questionable ideas. Imagine a situation with long build times and quickly consumed life support. As your space outposts in various places get larger and more numerous, the build time consumed by one cycle of resupplying each of them grows. There will come a point that, having sent a supply mission to each of your LKO station, your Mun orbital station, your Minmus orbital station, your Mun surface base and your Minmus surface base, the time taken to build each of these supply missions is such that you have to immediately start work on the next round of supply missions.

They timewarp to the transfer window. This breaks immersion because my active space program (50 missions in one month remember) suddenly stops all activity for months or years until I get the window right.
