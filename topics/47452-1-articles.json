I\u0027ve managed to setup my com sat network in geostationary orbit but my one comm sat isn\u0027t exactly over KSC. KSC is at 74 degrees 34 min W Long and my sat is fluctuating between 73 50 and 75 10 with an eccentricity of .003. Is this acceptable or should I be able to get my sats exactly where they should be? Same with inclination, I\u0027ve got an inclination of 0.22 degrees. Should I be able to get it exactly at 0 degrees? How close is close enough but still possible in KSP? As a comparison, how precise are the satellites that NASA launches?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T16:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are mods that will give higher accuracy read outs.

Real satellites progress along the Geosync orbit and are tugged on by many different gravity sources at the same time. Orbits have to constantly be adjusted with thrusters or they\u0027ll degrade in rather short order even way up at Geosync.

All those orbits are accurate up to 5 significant digits. The problem is that the game has some issues translating between loaded physics and unloaded physics. I noticed the eccentricity and inclinations tend to vary a bit after time warping and reloading when you get really close to an accurate orbit. So that\u0027s the limiting factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen trying to do something like this it is almost essential that you have some sort of flight computer to point your craft in the relevant directions though. It is hard enough to get the orbits right without the period and eccentricity shifting while burning for an inclination change. I used the remotetech flight computer, but I imagine Mechjeb has the same functionality. And else you can always cook something up with kOS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T21:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell not always.
