If they\u0027re still on EVA when their time-to-starve counter runs out, they will go missing and eventually wind up back at the recruitment building (or die depending on your settings). Presumably, the kerbal will maintain that 3-days-to-starve countdown upon entering a new vessel with no access to supplies? Maybe go back to whatever their previous countdown value was, minus the time spent in EVA?
