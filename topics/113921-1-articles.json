The goal was to land on Tylo. My first attempts at aerocapture got me into Jool orbit and I easily transfered to Tylo. I came up short of fuel to land however, but that\u0027s beside the point. I built a new lander and was trying again today after the recent patches. My Periapsis entering Jool atmosphere was always between 185000 to 190000. Now, as soon as I hit the atltitude of about 198000m, My craft explodes. Ironically, I placed heat shields on the craft before the patch was released. I enter the atmosphere prograde leading with sheilds. How do we Aerocapture now?

You\u0027ll need some radiators to take some of the heat away from the fuel tanks. The design has all the fuel tanks bunched together and a heatshield is merging into one of those tanks. Convection will bring heat across to the already heated fuel tank (just behind the 3m heatshield) and cause your explosion. You could alter your course and get a gravity assist around Tylo into the Joolian system. From the Tylo assist, aerobrake around Laythe. It\u0027s atmosphere is much thinner and that craft has a much larger chance of surviving Laythe entry. From Laythe, go on with your normal plan.
