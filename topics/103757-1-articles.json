Major graphics glitch makes it so I can\u0027t see the menu items (Start, Credits, Quit, etc), large black and white angular glitches covering the screen and wandering around. Also no progress indicator while displaying witty loading hints, but game does eventually get to the glitched main screen.\n\nHistory: I\u0027ve been playing for months with no problems. Installed some mods, decided later to go back to a clean install. Fresh download from site today, new directory (no existing files). Install KSP, first startup goes normally. Second startup (now that there\u0027s a settings.cfg file) problem appears. Easy to recreate, happens every time.\n\nAll log and image files (including a KSP.log before and after glitch, DxDiag.txt, etc) available here: [http://bettermarineservices.com/ksp/](http://bettermarineservices.com/ksp/)\n\nSecond load in full glitch: ![Clipboard03.jpg](http://bettermarineservices.com/ksp/Clipboard03.jpg)\n\nFirst Startup (no problems): ![Clipboard01.jpg](http://bettermarineservices.com/ksp/Clipboard01.jpg)\n\nDuring second load, no load bar showing: ![Clipboard02.jpg](http://bettermarineservices.com/ksp/Clipboard02.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T16:31:14Z","Content":"Hello Jetski, your output\\_log.txt is flooded with this line:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E d3d: failed to lock vertex index buffer, offset 0 size 384 [internal driver error]\n\nI see your system reports a mobile Intel graphics card as well, do you have a built-in Nvidia or AMD card?\n\nIf you do my guess is you\u0027re on a power saving mode, and your main card is off, if so you\u0027ll need to make sure the laptop is plugged in, it wouldn\u0027t hurt to update your graphics drivers either ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T17:13:18Z","Content":"Laptop is plugged in always, also been playing on this same laptop for months with a variety of mods and pure stock .90 no problems. Also strange that there\u0027s no issue the first time I start with a clean install (before it generates the settings.cfg file). I can delete the settings.cfg file and it will start up and run normally, but it sucks to do that (and reconfigure graphics options in launcher) every time I want to play KSP. Only breaks on the second startup, after the settings.cfg file exists. Running no mods, no special graphics settings, no command line options. Graphics drivers are the same as worked previously, no changes made. Only weirdness that I can think of is I tried to install ATM mod (crashed and wouldn\u0027t run), then deleted it and wiped the directory and installed a fresh download. Is it possible for a mod to permanently mess with my graphics properties even after I delete everything and do a new KSP install in a new directory?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T17:18:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jetski**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T17:23:21Z","Content":"Okay this is a weird one, the settings.cfg shouldn\u0027t be able to cause something like this, it\u0027s writing so it can\u0027t be data execution prevention, and KSP isn\u0027t in a protected windows folder.\n\nYou have some graphics, but then it might be bugging out on a shader that is in one part of the menu and not the other, so it\u0027s still worth checking for any updated drivers for your laptop before proceeding too far, it\u0027s not unknown for Windows updates to change/break things, necessitating new drivers.\n\nI suggest you check your power save options as well in case it\u0027s still using them even while plugged in, just being on mains is not a guarantee, there\u0027s definitely something preventing the card from working properly, trouble is finding it."},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T22:08:55Z","Content":"Did a system restore point to roll back to 2 days ago (when I was playing KSP fine), still glitching. reinstalled graphics drivers, still no dice. I can play if I just delete the settings.cfg every time. Frustrating though.\n\nEdit: Now it crashes even if I delete the settings.cfg - a KSP low memory crash during startup. bummer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T08:54:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 08:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jetski**"}]}
