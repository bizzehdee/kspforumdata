Major graphics glitch makes it so I can\u0027t see the menu items (Start, Credits, Quit, etc), large black and white angular glitches covering the screen and wandering around. Also no progress indicator while displaying witty loading hints, but game does eventually get to the glitched main screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHistory: I\u0027ve been playing for months with no problems. Installed some mods, decided later to go back to a clean install. Fresh download from site today, new directory (no existing files). Install KSP, first startup goes normally.

Also strange that there\u0027s no issue the first time I start with a clean install (before it generates the settings.cfg file). I can delete the settings.cfg file and it will start up and run normally, but it sucks to do that (and reconfigure graphics options in launcher) every time I want to play KSP. Only breaks on the second startup, after the settings.cfg file exists. Running no mods, no special graphics settings, no command line options. Graphics drivers are the same as worked previously, no changes made. Only weirdness that I can think of is I tried to install ATM mod (crashed and wouldn\u0027t run), then deleted it and wiped the directory and installed a fresh download. Is it possible for a mod to permanently mess with my graphics properties even after I delete everything and do a new KSP install in a new directory?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T17:18:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jetski\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T17:23:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay this is a weird one, the settings.cfg shouldn\u0027t be able to cause something like this, it\u0027s writing so it can\u0027t be data execution prevention, and KSP isn\u0027t in a protected windows folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have some graphics, but then it might be bugging out on a shader that is in one part of the menu and not the other, so it\u0027s still worth checking for any updated drivers for your laptop before proceeding too far, it\u0027s not unknown for Windows updates to change/break things, necessitating new drivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you check your power save options as well in case it\u0027s still using them even while plugged in, just being on mains is not a guarantee, there\u0027s definitely something preventing the card from working properly, trouble is finding it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T22:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid a system restore point to roll back to 2 days ago (when I was playing KSP fine), still glitching. reinstalled graphics drivers, still no dice.
