I\u0027m having the same issue since 1.1.2. There has been a Toolbar update since, but still got the problem so I assume Mechjeb has an issue. Expect it will be fixed soon, but open to suggestions. I\u0027ve amended the Mechjeb config file so the menu is set to SHOW rather than HIDDEN, which I had before, but still no luck.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gamerscircle","CreatedById":151261,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T18:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are in Career mode, you have to add the part to your rocket which are unlocked via the Science R\u0026amp;D Building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BinaryBad","CreatedById":117229,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T20:11:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course. *slaps forehead*. I\u0027m using a mod to embed Mechjeb, so I had forgotten about the parts, but testing it with them, everything returns to normal. That\u0027s presumably the culprit as the 1.1.2 broke it.

After a whole day of trying to fix it,\u00A0 i removed the whole mod and then reinstalled the mechjeb mod according to the version of ksp i have (1.3.1). And to my surprise it worked really well.
