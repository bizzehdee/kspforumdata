Which includes a center and a flame. Basically I want to create a flame that is 10 meters away from the center of the object that I can then position in the VAB. It doesnt need to be on this part. there doesnt need to be any model at all. Just a flame that is going in a certain direction and is 10 meters away from the center of the object.. the direction the flame shoots isnt important because i can rotate it in the VAB.
