What actually happens is a super high frequency flickering of the on/off state. The engine tries to run at the preset throttle level, consumes all available power, discovers a lack of Ec, flames out, discovers that Ec is once again present (since there is active generation), and reactivates itself at the preset throttle level. All in the same physics frame. Then the game steps into the next frame, and the process repeats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere exist the following solutions to this problem:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Having a manned control pod maintains control even without Ec present. NOTE: Many modded control pods like to add probe features into manned control pods, so that even scientists and engineers can enjoy some computer-aided SAS. Unfortunately, for the purposes of KSP, what actually happens is the opposite. Such pods are not considered crew pods with SAS, but rather probe cores with crew capacity, and will behave exactly like probe cores when losing power, regardless of the amount of crew present. Which technically is realistic, since well, if your fly-by-wire system goes offline...\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Giving the engine a non-instant throttle response, like a jet engine has. Basically any non-instant value works; it can be really tiny. All it needs to do is ensure that the engine cannot fully throttle up in the span of the same physics frame in which it switched itself off and back on again. That will give you a tiny window of opportunity in which your Ec production potentially remains higher than the engine\u0027s consumption, since the engine is still spooling up. You might have control during that tiny window, and hammering x might let you zero out the throttle.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Installing MechJeb, which nowadays comes with the ability to auto-throttle electric engines when the craft\u0027s Ec storage approaches zero. It\u0027ll even throttle the engines back up for you if the Ec storage recovers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- And, of course, the old wisdom of having a deactivated backup battery that\u0027ll allow you to at least gain control for a second or two so you can zero out the throttle. Probe core batteries are great for this in stock KSP, though modded electric engines may have much higher Ec consumption than the Dawn ion engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the Alcubierre drive is probably not an engine, but rather a miscellaneous consumer. It doesn\u0027t have a throttle, so neither MechJeb nor throttle response tweaks will help you with it. The only solutions are providing enough Ec, or ensuring that your craft remains controllable even when bone dry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-16T08:32:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2016 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T10:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn most of my ship, I always lock the small batteries in pods and probe cores so I always have a safety.
