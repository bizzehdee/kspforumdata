I believe there were enough people reading them. Writing is a completely different matter. Without any suggestions about the required/wanted subjects only a few will even attempt to write something. If you want an audience that sends in articles, you at least should provide some hints on the preferred subjects.

There was a charity journey by land to the north pole, and two (soon to be three) people have circumnavigated the planet with boats. I\u0027m sure there have been other heroic journeys that I\u0027m not aware of.\n\nI propose that a number of terrain features be named after the forum members that have engaged in these endeavors. Having said that:\n\n![4KGSS.png](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-a7WjDoaxxGk/UjlRHjS88QI/AAAAAAAAGBs/ZLDQ2eGWLDQ/s800/4KGSS.png)\n\nThe following proposed names have to do with this thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25016-In-search-of-Ferdinand-Magellan/](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25016-In-search-of-Ferdinand-Magellan/)\n\nPoint of Thersis: The forum member Thersis crashed their naval ship after travelling 534km of KSP. This point is roughly that distance.\n\nWilliam\u0027s Point: William Kerbin was the pilot of the second naval vessel to circumnavigate Kerbin.\n\nIsthmus of Kamm: The forum member Kerbies\\_are\\_my\\_Minions (KAMM) was the first to circumnavigate Kerbin by boat as far as I know. He would have been the first to cross this isthmus to do so.\n\nStrait of Zakku: the forum member Ekku Zakku was the second person to circumnavigate Kerbin.\n\nRussell\u0027s reef: I noticed this area as I was attempting the 3rd circumnavigation. Named after one of Kerbies\\_are\\_my\\_minions\u0027 crew, Russel Kerbin\n\nKai\u0027s reef: I noticed this area as I was attempting the 3rd circumnavigation. Named after one of Kerbies\\_are\\_my\\_minions\u0027 crew, Kai Kerbin\n\nInattention Island: I nearly plowed full speed into this island when I got distracted and wasn\u0027t watching my boat.\n\nSo, in closing and summary, I propose the KGSS honor these and other ground and water based explorers."},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T10:52:25Z","Content":"I already have a revive made in the ISSO"},{"CreatedByName":"seanth","CreatedById":79989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T15:10:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I already have a revive made in the ISSO\n\nOk.
