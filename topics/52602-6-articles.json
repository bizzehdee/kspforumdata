This means you have to plan ahead a little, may be go on another flight with the parts you have.

Many (Please note, I don\u0027t think SQUAD has recently said anything on the following matter) expect costs and rewards in terms of money to be a logical next step. Seeing as Money and Time are closely related, I don\u0027t think it would be all unfair to include a Time aspect to the equation of what KSP\u0027s Career Mode will ultimately be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has drawn inspiration from both Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Race into Space and Orbiter. It shows! The Space Center screen has an awefully similar resemblance to BARIS\u0027 main screen, yet the gameplay is like Orbiter with Two-Body Orbits. The real genius of KSP is in the use of the Kerbals and the Construction of one\u0027s own space craft as far as I am concerned. If you feel that adding a time element might make the game a little bit more like BARIS, that is because the game for as long as I can recall, has been toted to be a bit like a BARIS/Orbiter/LEGO hybrid with little green men as protagonists. If you notice, each of those three games fall very neatly in each of the three areas of the graph. The issue is that KSP didn\u0027t develop them simultaneously but rather in parts. We are on the last leg of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the question of time? I\u0027m for it.

But KSP is about launching rockets, not dealing with space program bureaucracy. Such a detail is very niche, and would be a deterrent to many gamers who are attracted to making a rocket on a whim and launching it just to see if it won\u0027t explode. Having to employ timewarp or wait for it will get very old very quickly. As was stated, such a feature can be employed on your own by establishing your own timetable based on the size of the rocket, and just not putting out on the pad until the set time occurs.
