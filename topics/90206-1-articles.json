The Phoenix II is the product of an exhaustive round of design and testing. Philley Kerman, upon hearing words like \u0022Cost Effective\u0022 and \u0022Reuseable\u0022 thought they would look really neat in a brochure, so he designed a launch system around them. As of yet, his design is not completely tested.. but we are hopeful this will become the backbone of our reusable ship line.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBasic Stats: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The vessel is designed to carry jet fuel in the wings, to power its four Turbojet Engines. With no payload, the vessel has 2,610 Delta V potential with its twin Aerospike Engines, providing a TWR of approximately .78 - These numbers are for the ship sitting on the tarmac. Once in flight, her true potential is higher, due to having burned off excess liquid fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew capacity: 6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECruising altitude: Yes, have some, please!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 45.5 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost: Low low price of only 107k spesos!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAscent Profile: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Takeoff can occur around 105 m/s (a blistering 200\u002B knots)! Fly carefully to approximately 500 meters, then angle up to between 35 and 45 degrees. Once you hit 18 km, decrees angle to around 15-20. During this phase, you will begin to accelerate. Continue to do so until you reach approximately 30 km up. Cut jet engines and fire main engines at max, angling the nose once again to 45 degrees until apogee is 75km. From there, my fellow pilots and kosmonauts, you should be able to take it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDescent Profile:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Keep nose around 5-10 degrees in direction of flight once you hit atmosphere. If the craft becomes squirrely, decrease angle further. Depending on orbital maneuvers, you should have enough fuel to continue flight and maneuver for a safe landing on the tarmac at KSC. Fuel may need to be moved out to the wings while in space to allow all 4 engines to fire, however, even on 2 engines there is enough thrust to provide control for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/c7VnZ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Please, feel free to give me your reviews and test this baby out! I\u0027d really like to refine it a bit, but haven\u0027t had a TON of time to test it. She took a few unmanned flights up to LKO, and I have yet to test her with a payload. Also, I attempted to design this for NEAR... but ended up ripping NEAR out after frustration that I couldn\u0027t get ANYTHING to fly right with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: No longer requires MechJEB!
