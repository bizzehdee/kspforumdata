Look at the clean installs for both 0.25 and 0.90. Sure, it increased, but only by about 200 Mb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow look at the size RSS takes up on both installs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.25: 1804-878 = 926Mb for RSS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.90: 2960-1078 = 1882Mb for RSS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in 0.90 RSS suddenly uses more than twice the memory that it did in 0.25. Hence my earlier comments that I think its loading the textures twice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tmikesecrist3","CreatedById":99603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T06:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow would we check that though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T08:26:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tmikesecrist3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tmikesecrist3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow would we check that though\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exact way I checked it yesterday? The difference between stock 0.25 and stock 0.9 is 200 MB, the difference between RSS 0.25 and RSS 0.90 is 1.1Gb. So RSS adds 900Mb more than in the previous version. Since RSS is the only installed mod and we know that RSS has a mechanic that loads textures twice I think its rather likely that something about the unloading mechanic fails to work. I don\u0027t really understand how this can be ambiguous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thyriel","CreatedById":113679,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T10:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Ralathon is correct with his measurements of RAM usage. I repeated them with my actual texture folder (had to reduce it to 160MB meanwhile so KSP doesn\u0027t crash every 30 mins). The interesting thing is, with my 160MB texture folder RSS uses only ~150MB more in 0.90 then 0.25, if i replace that with 8k textures its about the same as Ralathons RAM usage. There just isn\u0027t any other explanation that RSS does something strange it doesn\u0027t do in 0.25 when 0.90 KSP\u002BRSS with 2k textures uses only 1,3 GB (slightly more then 0.25) but with 8k textures it needs 3 GB while in 0.25 it was only 2/3rd of that. - The bigger the textures the more RAM it uses compared to 0.25, and it\u0027s always about double the size of the textures currently used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other side, there seems to be some kind of memory leak, but i can\u0027t say yet it if it\u0027s in stock game or any of the mods, but even if i start with low res textures and an inital RAM usage of 2 GB (with all other mods), it gets more and more over time and somewhen crashes. I could therefor imagine that a bug in stock game prevents RSS textures to be unloaded when they should.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-29T10:39:19Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2014 10:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thyriel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
