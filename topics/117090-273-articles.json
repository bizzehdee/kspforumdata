Do I really need to make a Gemini pod model when it already exists in many other mods (several of them quite well done)? \n\n- The only technical reason I would need to make a new model is if the existing ones did not incorporate the transforms / setup for part-count reduction and feature integration (e.g. cannot integrate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports into a pod without thrust transforms existing in the model).\n- The main reason that I\u0027ve made my own models for the existing popular designs (Orion/Apollo/Engines/Tanks) is texturing.  The \u0027stock-alike\u0027 texture style makes my eyes bleed.  I\u0027m not saying my own texturing is anything special (because its really not), but the muddy colors and \u0027scratch-and-dent\u0027 style of \u0027stock-alike\u0027 textures is not appealing to me.  This one is much harder to work around, as most parts try to use the stock-alike texture style; the only exception that I can think of is KW rocketry (which doesn\u0027t have any pods...).\n    - Re-texturing of other mods\u0027 parts might be an option... but if I\u0027m going to go through the trouble of making new textures for something, I\u0027ll go ahead and make my own model for it first.\n\nJust some thoughts; I haven\u0027t even begun looking at other mods\u0027 models yet. First thing would be to find some other mod that has a well done non-stock-alike texture setup (do any exist?).\n\nAnyway, I\u0027m highly leaning towards the next big dev layout being a rework on the LC fuel tanks.  They were some of the first models I ever created, and while the parts were full of features when first released, the features have slowly been breaking/lost over the KSP updates.

Do I really need to make a Gemini pod model when it already exists in many other mods (several of them quite well done)? \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - The only technical reason I would need to make a new model is if the existing ones did not incorporate the transforms / setup for part-count reduction and feature integration (e.g. cannot integrate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports into a pod without thrust transforms existing in the model).\n\u003E - The main reason that I\u0027ve made my own models for the existing popular designs (Orion/Apollo/Engines/Tanks) is texturing.  The \u0027stock-alike\u0027 texture style makes my eyes bleed.  I\u0027m not saying my own texturing is anything special (because its really not), but the muddy colors and \u0027scratch-and-dent\u0027 style of \u0027stock-alike\u0027 textures is not appealing to me.  This one is much harder to work around, as most parts try to use the stock-alike texture style; the only exception that I can think of is KW rocketry (which doesn\u0027t have any pods...).\n\u003E     - Re-texturing of other mods\u0027 parts might be an option... but if I\u0027m going to go through the trouble of making new textures for something, I\u0027ll go ahead and make my own model for it first.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just some thoughts; I haven\u0027t even begun looking at other mods\u0027 models yet.
