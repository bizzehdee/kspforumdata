The player is encouraged (but not forced) to take on a challenge and learn a skill - always a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also important that very close to KSC there is no cost of recovery, otherwise refueling vehicles for aircraft and spaceplanes would have an associated cost that they shouldn\u0027t really have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also imagine that water recoveries could come with some additional premium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in my ideal world the game would take this one step further. Advanced warning: There\u0027s no mechanic like this in KSP yet... but there could be. In my ideal world, you could also choose to perform the recovery manually. That is to say, get a rover or an aircraft, head off to the craft you want to recover, pick it up (might require new crane style parts, but claws and docking ports *might* suffice), and bring it back to KSC. It\u0027s not hard to imagine that the game could keep track of how far you traveled to perform the recovery and how much it cost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that point forward, if your manual recovery was cheaper than the auto recovery, it should use the manual recovery cost when performing future auto-recoveries. This cost would, of course, *not* include the cost of the recovery craft itself, since that can be reused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case this is confusing, an example!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I land a pod 80km away from KSC. Let\u0027s just say the cost of auto-recovery is $1 per km, so from this position it is $80.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Instead of using auto-recovery, I build a craft to perform the recovery. The craft costs me $300 to construct, but further calculations will ignore this cost, since the craft is obviously reusable if it returns to KSC!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I recover the pod and bring it back to KSC. The cost of this (in fuel) turns out to be $30.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) From this point forward, the game should perform any auto recoveries up to 80km away based on the cost of my manual recovery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) I now land a craft 40km away. Instead of costing me $40 for auto recovery, it costs me $15.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) If I land a craft more than 80km away the original auto recovery cost factor of $1 per km should be used, since I\u0027ve yet to \u0022prove to the game\u0022 that I can manually recover from more than 80km away.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-01T13:38:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2014 01:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T16:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if someone puts rover wheels on their pod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T18:21:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think SSTO/\u0022true reusable\u0022 spaceplanes need any boosts.

I don\u0027t work in the aerospace industry so I\u0027m not sure what the relative cost of pre-flight (non construction) cost is for rockets vs aircraft. I suppose rockets have a high cost associated with keeping their fuels at such low temperature as the ship is readied for launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the easiest way to implement some kind of \u0022inspection cost\u0022 would be to make all launches cost some small non zero amount, or perhaps all recoveries. The reason why I don\u0027t really like that idea, though, is that it means support vehicles (fuel trucks, crew transfer rovers, etc) would have an operating cost that they shouldn\u0027t really have (yeh, you have to pay for the fuel in a fuel truck, but recovering and then relaunching the fuel truck in order to fill it up shouldn\u0027t cost more than the cost of the fuel). I understand where you\u0027re coming from, but without \u0022auto refuel on the runway\u0022 or something like that it could be difficult, I think, for the game to appropriately differentiate between \u0022vehicles that should have an inspection cost\u0022 and \u0022vehicles that should not have an inspection cost at launch\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf reusable planes come with financial advantage, people will make one and stick with it for long time, trying to milk as much money as possible from it instead of improving their designs with every launch\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really have a problem with this. For those who do like realism it would seem to be appropriate. As I said, I\u0027m not a big fan of realism for the sake of realism, but I think there are other mechanics that already balance this out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, as you unlock new parts you\u0027re probably going to want to build new craft that incorporate them. Certainly the case for science parts, but probably the case for other parts as well, since the higher tier parts are generally better in some way than the lower tier parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, an SSTOL craft that is good at one job is probably not the best for another job. If you intend to reuse the one craft for Kerbin orbit launches, Munar launches and Duna launches then it has to be built such that it can get a payload to Duna, which means it is over-engineered (ie, more expensive and less efficient) for getting a payload to LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we might end up seeing is reusable craft that specialize in a particular task. For example, once someone is half way up the tech tree they may end up with a reusable spaceplane that they use for launching satellites to LKO. Not that, once half way up the tree, you\u0027d really \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E to launch to LKO for any science-gathering reason in the current state of the game, but then that just goes back to point 1. And I think that would be fine. It\u0027s sensible to reuse a proven design for a common task, it\u0027s \u0022realistic\u0022 to do so, keeping realism fans happy, and there\u0027s not a huge amount of \u0022fun\u0022 to be had building fresh designs over and over for tasks that have become simple due to your tech level and experience. Might as well push out further, which would best be accomplished with a different design, negating the concern.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-01T21:44:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2014 09:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T19:42:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Joonatan1998\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Joonatan1998\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat if someone puts rover wheels on their pod?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen they endure a long drive back to KSC.
