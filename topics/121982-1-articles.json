This is a complete turn around from my previous experiences in engineering rockets. The Thud engine was ignored and I used to design around the LV-T45 Swivel. The restrictions of 18 tonne and 30 parts has made the idea of lifting a payload of fuel into LKO a challenge. Using twin Thuds has offered the best design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared with the LV-T45 the twin Mk-55 offer improved TWR and stability assist from the engine gimbal. If using a non pilot such as the Stayputnik Mk. 1 the extra stability is welcomed. Many booster designs were tried and no other performed as well. The average cost is around 40000 m/s Delta-V for circular orbit at 200 km and then the remainder is used for rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother vessel will dock with the fuel and use it for a kerbal Mun landing and return. Returning experiments from Mun under theses designs limitations was also challenging. The ability to lift a payload of a FL-T400 into LKO using limitations of 18t / 30 parts has now been accomplished and using twin Thuds was the right choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/RJnBA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
