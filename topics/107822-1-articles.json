You don\u0027t need those radial intakes. Air hogging is obsolete now thanks to the new aero, and that drag (and there is a lot!) is keeping the craft from keeping its velocity when you zoom climb to orbit. You just need a couple of intakes per TRJ.\n\n2. You\u0027re losing speed when you climb because the engines lose power with altitude. Air hogging won\u0027t fix it because it\u0027s about velocity. The TRJ doesn\u0027t come into its own until about 9000m when it will accelerate you to the point of destruction. You just need to pitch up to about 15 to 20 degrees and let the engines accelerate you into a low suborbital arc.\n\nThat said, the aerospike isn\u0027t providing enough thrust (175kN for 26ish tons = less than 1:1 TWR) to circularize before it goes back into the atmosphere. You should switch the jet engines to rapiers, which will do the trick without the aerospike (whose advantage is high thrust in the lower atmosphere, which we\u0027re not using on this craft since we have jet engines). You\u0027ll have to adjust your CoM and CoL again, but it\u0027ll simplify your fuel plumbing so it should be all right.\n\nAlso the craft is angled upwards for taxiing, which is great for launching, but causes hopping on landing which makes me overshoot, or I prang the front landing gear because I didn\u0027t flare enough. A neutral pitch would make landing much, much easier.\n\nAll in all a good replica and was fun to fly around with.

The idea is to be at 1000m/s at 20000\u002Bm before lighting the rockets... your craft might behave a little differently so the process will have to be fine tuned some (40 degree pitch maybe, depending on its final configuration), but the process is roughly the same for all
