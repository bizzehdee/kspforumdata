In the middle of the plane you could have a fuel tank on top with a small cargo bay underneath it, or a set of in-line landing gear, or even a VTOL engine. Crew cabins could be put above cargo holds, or bomb bays below a fuel tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I think this is a pretty solid idea that would benefit a lot of people if it were developed in a similar manner to the other mods I mentioned.

I\u0027m planning to add a collider mesh tonight though, and finish texturing.

Unfortunately, the docking port idea I feel would cause too much lag at launch and would be harder to implement than other options. Although the \u0027frame\u0027 idea is rather interesting, I think finding a way to do it with standard assembly nodes would be better. I was thinking the nodes could work where the top half would be placed and then the bottom half placed underneath it, and to counteract the spaghetti monster you are bound to create, short \u0027bulkheads\u0027 (think Mk2 Drone Core) could be used. I don\u0027t know whether these bulkheads should be included in the top half parts or included separately.
