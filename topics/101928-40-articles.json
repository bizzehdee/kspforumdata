I\u0027ve never used the explosives before, but I decided to manually get rid of an old Minmus science station prior to abandoning it. Dropped a charge on it and about half the station was erased, but a science lab covered in batteries and science goodies was left. Dropped another on it.. and blew up Minmus. Well, not really.. but basically I was left with a neverending explosion that lasted a good ten minutes before my game finally froze. It basically looked like the explosion just kept retriggering every half second. My EVA kerbal was sent flying as the entire moon was shaking and I think she eventually died from being shaken around too much. Hard to tell, the camera was shaking so much I couldn\u0027t do anything at all. I swapped over to my other ship that was about 2km away and it was shaking too, though about 1/10th as much. Took off (hilariously still shaking) and flew up to about 2.5k and the game finally froze. Apparently setting off an explosive charge in the presence of a large amount of electric charge and whatever the Minmus lesser flats are made of tears a hole in the fabric of the universe. Do I get any science points for that?"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T06:32:24Z","Content":"So I\u0027m running into a pretty nasty problem using KIS, though I\u0027m not 100% sure if KIS is directly the cause. I managed to launch 12 station science experiment modules without any way to return them to Kerbin (I normally use parachute docking rings, but put regular ones instead). I figured this would be a great time to test out KIS attachment so I launched a repair mission with a bunch of realChutes radial chutes in the KIS inventory with the intent of putting two on each group of experiments. I equipped the power screwdriver and then attempted to attach them, but they simply disappeared, apparently inside the modules. The chutes did appear in the staging list, so, after trying a couple more times to get them to stick to the surface, I attempted to return the modules to Kerbin as is, just using staging to activate the chutes. Unfortunately, when I activated the chutes, the whole screen went black except the UI, which went completely blank, forcing me to quit the game.\n\nDid I do something wrong here? Why did the chutes disappear and why is that fact killing my game? I do have KAS and KIS installed together, but according to the first post, that shouldn\u0027t cause any real conflicts...\n\nHere is what is happening when the chutes deploy:\n\n![G13mkx8.png](http://i.imgur.com/G13mkx8.png)\n\nAny help would be appreciated"},{"CreatedByName":"Horus","CreatedById":99705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T08:23:14Z","Content":"@SpacedInvader: just a screenshot doesn\u0027t tell anything.

What I\u0027d recommend is you try to reproduce the issue without RealChutes installed, if possible. It may be that KIS doesn\u0027t provide information to the modules that they are expecting, or even corrupts it somehow, and hence when you pop the cord the game freaks out. While it\u0027s possible you\u0027ve discovered a KIS-centric bug, the sheer number of mods on your install makes it difficult, even if you can prove KIS is the culprit, to show that KIS is totally at fault here. If you can narrow it down to an incompatibility between two mods, or show it happening on a stock install, that\u0027s more beneficial."},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T12:36:27Z","Content":"Well, it looks like the issue does indeed lie between KAS / KIS and realChutes.
