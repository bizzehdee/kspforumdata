It could also be gravity, but then you would have to move E = mc^2 in front. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the inflaton established that localized average space-time could expnd faster than the speed of light. The it is possible. But the inflaton was active when there was no light and no normal matter, so that while things were moving away at greater than C, actually nothing was moving away. It lack something a warp drive would need, modulation. A quantum bubble that is unstable invited a bizarre version of space time to pour in everywhere in the bubble and the a tiniest fraction of a second later stopped, all hell broke loose all kinds of wierd matter appeared and disappeared light built in then prtons and electrons and we have CMBR. Not the best way to treat normal matter you want to move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently there are ongoing studies of dark energy, the results are pardoxical. Either Einstiens cos. constant is real, and we are really inept at measuring it in local space, or dark energy is like a very shy virgin, she only would wants to reveal herself when noone else is looking, and it would appear that any matter (single cesium atoms are too big) disrupts the field. Basically unless we can build a very big vacuum capable of eliminating even hydrogen atoms, we can\u0027t be sure. If it turns out that she is really shy, then we can cause it to enter space where we want it to, it accelerates in the 10-3 range so it can get you to c in say 3000 to 30000 years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENegative energy, thats a much bigger problem. It does not exist except in relative terms. And you have to create energy in front of your ship faster, faster than the ship is traveling. There are tacheons, not known to exist, and other exotic fields not known to exist. And so that is why everyone says its bust.

The graviton is suspected to exist, but has never been proven. It likely existed as a particle at the beginning of the universe during the preinflation epoch, but is largely regarded to be a field now. If you look at the post that I made earlier, they are launching a satellite that they hope, if it works, that will tell them if it is even possible to detect gravitons, but not actually detect them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand matter and some forms of energy that gain inertia because of Higgs interation release gravitatinal waves that then warp space-time. Space-time is simply a four dimensional representation of an event parameters, and in the case a vacuum space the events typically are an object in enertial reference frames. Gravity warps space time, in order to contract such that it pulls, one really needs a black hole. The problem is that black holes are essentially frozen in time, once you cross the event horizon. So it will not collectively accelerate easily. What you need is something that is the opposite of non-inertial energy, and that is a problem because it implies it cannot be inertia, because then it is massive and carries momentum, there its energy aspect needs to be negated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand negative energy can exist on the quantum scale, for times 10^-43 second and for tiny tiny lengths, lengths smaller than the nucleus of a proton. It does not stack well, this is a problem with QM. see K2s comments on Cannae drive. There is a speculation that negative energy may exist under exotic conditions and there is speculation that completely empty space, devoid of any matter or light, well, theres alot of speculation, including a cause of the big bang. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will create another thread on space-time and there is a collection of about eight videos that explain all of this. not tonight though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T06:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWish I could remember her name; She gave a talk (last year?) on C-SPAN about multiverse theory and gravity... proposing that, perhaps, gravity being a weak force here in our universe, it may cross branes and be a strong(er) force elsewhere... her discussion related to string theory.

To explain our state The opaque epoch would have to end moments after inflaton to explain why currently we don\u0027t see the boundary between the two polarities. The exception is that these boundaries do exist but because of momentum from the opach epoch as a result of annihilation that they might exist but we cannot see them, redshifting is a bit of a statistical thing separations far from us could exist but we dont see it because of statical noise. This would mean that the first bias would cause selection of polarity that amplified to the end of the opaque. This would mean that no source of power in our polarity suffices to push us inot the opposite polarity. Caveots and blck swans allow for alot. Anyway we will never know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
