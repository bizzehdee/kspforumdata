Hey, I saw your pressure fed engine and immediately thought of something. That itself is a cool mod standalone, up in the caliber of things like RemoteTech and Deadly Reentry. I think that should be a standalone (that works with Kethane) rather than an integral part of kethane (if it is, I will be trying to figure out how to disable the pressure fed thing in the config, I don\u0027t want that level of realistic difficulty).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think it would be cool to have a pressure fed engines mod in use with both RemoteTech and Deadly Reentry (and FAR, talk about realism).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T22:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maackey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maackey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuick request: can you make the KSC spot start have deposits so we can easily test our designs to make sure they are working before sending them out to space?
