It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve played and I\u0027m wondering with these new updates if this kind of craft is viable? I\u0027m limited right now with what I can access because I\u0027m in career mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5Bw0dwM.png\u0022 alt=\u00225Bw0dwM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any feedback! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: It\u0027d probably help to explain it a little x) Basically you strap a smaller vehicle on top of a plane then punch out to a high altitude and release the rocket on top.
