If \u0022simulation\u0022 (and hence \u0022simulator\u0022) refers to any attempt to model something in real life at any level, then KSP is certainly simulation.

It\u0027s a simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, like everything else, there are levels of simulation.

It is a simulation, and even at that a low order one. A good test is does it teach you ANYTHING about the real world? In the case of Warbirds/Il-2/etc, it absolutely does. PLay a while, and you understand something in an internalized way about air combat that you did not before you played the game. I was an avid ww2 air war reader before I played combat flight sims. I can honestly say I had little real understanding before I flew sims. Afterwards, I \u0022get it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same can be said of KSP. The sometimes counterintuitive nature of orbital maneuvering is absolutely something someone unfamiliar with orbital mechanics can get a feel for in KSP, and that now intuitive understanding is applicable in the real world. Are there elements not in KSP that make this new knowledge imperfect? Certainly, but it\u0027s not entirely counter to reality (as a Star Wars \u0022sim\u0022 would be, even if it properly simulates bizarro-physics in the SW universe).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T18:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is most likely.. both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many games out there that are multi-genred.
