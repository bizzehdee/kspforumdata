I don\u0027t understand. Realistically, you would log all experiments. Am I missing something? Or is it one experiment per canister?

(This would make sense if you were to only have one canister with you, but wanted to log some of the data it gathered along the way from multiple exposures since you can only bring it back in a single state for analyzation.) It\u0027d also make sense to have a \u0022seal canister\u0022 button above the \u0022Reset Canister\u0022 button if you wanted to take one specific result back for full Science, because I was under the impression that pressing reset meant simply closing the lid, not erasing the data. If you want to preserve the goo in a specific state, the canister should close, not stay wide open like it is now. (There is an option to close the lid with Action Groups, but not by right clicking it mid-flight.) This is just some logic that should be considered, because it is important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile you do have the option to transmit crew reports for full Science, realistically, you should be able to keep multiple reports at once, unless Kerbals really are too lazy to write more than one down.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T19:41:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DannySwish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemoricus","CreatedById":4141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T19:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA databank part that let you store the results of multiple experiments would be nice...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T21:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK, it\u0027s made this way to prevent experiment abuse where you can recover 30\u002B experiments at once rather than having to transfer half of them at 50% or so of data transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MissStabby","CreatedById":31168,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T01:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love to have some kind of \u0022storage bay\u0022 item that lets my kerbins transfer experiments from their research apparatus to a safer place, including the samples from the goo containers or the material analysis pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way i wouldnt have to make crazy landers or rockets with like 6 of those science modules.
