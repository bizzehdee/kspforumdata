It had something that looked like blue-purple fire coming out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe realized it was going to crash, stepped back as it hit the ground with a small explosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal walked over to it. There was writing on the three parts of the ship \u0022LV-T4 Model 3\u0022 \u0022FL-T50 Model 1\u0022 and \u0022Manned Command Pod Mk1v2\u0022 He checked there was noone dead in the pod. There was noone there. There was also a small piston in the pod \u0022Backup Fuel\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe then realized something. This five-meter-tall thing wasn\u0027t alien technology...it was a space rocket!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis rocket, the XJ-T3000, was made by the Galactic Empire in 4222 BC (our time: 16888 BC), which had collapsed after a rebellion 1,500 years ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe realized it could be repaired. He took it to his house and started working on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay 28 1957 (our time: May 18, 1381).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship was ready to launch. He had learned how to make fuel, if in small amounts, and fix the damaged parts. Through this he had also experimented and made his own ship, the J1, which was a small unmanned ship using a replica LV-T4 and his own special fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was going to present this to the Kerbal Science Commission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay 29 1957 (our time: May 18, 1381 (later))\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello, Alec\u0022 the manager said. \u0022What have you got to present?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This. It crashed a couple of weeks ago and I fixed it and made a small unmanned variant, for safety.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why not manned?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I am working on a parachute; if there is no parachute, the ship is unsafe in the event of an emergency.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is the J1.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022J1?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe manager looked surprised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a space rocket, in theory. I have tested it, it has reached 6,000 meters and landed safely.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So with further development, the ship could reach, say, Jool, theoretically?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sold. Give me a demo...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlec explained the tech of the ship and how to make parts and fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here it is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe lifted the small, two-metre-high J1 onto it\u0027s pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It launches off this pad and lands roughly near it, about a 20 m accuracy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How does it launch and fly?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You send the command to launch with this little control panel here. You type \u0022launch-rocket\u0022 and the rocket will initate pre-launch proceedings. Type \u0022launch-rocket-actual\u0022 and it will launch. You tell it to change direction, etc. I\u0027m working on a autopilot setting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Great, can I see it fly?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Totally.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe typed in the commands and the rocket flew off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How do you know where it is?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You see this map and those numbers? The map is where the rocket is. The numbers are the altitude. You can lower or raise the rocket controls...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals started appearing in their hundreds and news reporters started to arrive after people heard the rocket take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Here, have the manual...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe handed him one of the two copies of the manual. There were thousands of Kerbals around now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022OK...7,000 meters, lets land...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe expertly piloted the controls until the ship was landed a couple of meters away from it\u0027s pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Semi-reusable, you get the engine and the pod back. The fuel tank can\u0027t be reused.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh. I need a couple of seconds to think about the proposal...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe manager exclaimed a couple of seconds later \u0022Your proposal is accepted! Let the Space Age begin!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTens of thousands of Kerbals were here now. ,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve made 8 J1s. Here\u0027s technical information and info to make your own rocket.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlec and the manager moved the three J1s into the office, the one that had already flew first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe manager then put a ring around the J1s. \u0022Don\u0027t want them to get damaged by the crowd.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlec replied \u0022Yep.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlec cut the rope and thousands streamed in. News cameras were everywhere taking pictures of the J1s. Some news programmes were airing to television early.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJun 7 1957 (our time: May 30, 1381)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy June 7th, news of the J1s reached the Maxina Central Government, and were met with excitement. On June 15, the Kerbal Space Development Association was created with a K$5 million (U$$ 7.5 million, UK\u00A3 6.5 million) per year budget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOct 31 1957 (our time: July 11, 1381)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy now, the formatory years of the Space Age had started. Alec in partnership with the KSA created the J2 rocket, which had an autopilot option and could fly up to 21,000 meters. The KSDA had created the X-1 rocket, which wasn\u0027t quite as successful as the J2, reaching only 14,000 meters, but still went higher than the highest J1 flight (8,500 meters). J2s were selling in the hundreds to eager Kerbals who wanted to create their own rocket and launch it. These J2s, being piloted by inexperienced pilots, had a setting that could only be turned off once you had done 3 successful landings: autoland. If the J2 was going to crash, it would take away from user control and land itself. Only 2 J2s crashed because of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe J2 had a more powerful LV-T7 engine, and the rocket community created the J2-3, J2.5 and J2X, more powerful variants of the J2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay 4 1958 (our time: September 6, 1381)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy now, Alec and the KSA had perfected their J2 design, creating the J3 and the manned J3-M. The KSDA had created the X-2, with a prototype solid-fuel booster, the T30. J3s were sold as kits, as J2s, but also as fully assembled rockets. The highest J3 flight was a modified J3, the J3-T, reaching 48,341 meters. The normal J3 reached 41,214 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMay 18 1958 (our time: September 11, 1381)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nvon Neumann at the KSDA was talking with some of his other colleagues when he had a idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why don\u0027t we, for Project XS-1, use pulse engines?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s a pulse engine?\u0022, Yoko, one of the colleagues, replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A engine that is like our current liquid engines, but it can be turned off during flight, instead of having a minimum thrust of 20, 30, 40%. And it can use more than one tank.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother colleague, Ishihara, replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And, why don\u0027t we develop a smaller engine, and then stack the small engine on top of the larger ones, so we can activate the small engine in space, and then get more longevity out of the rocket?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah...Would management agree though?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Make them watch the first launch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the eight colleagues developed in secret the XS-1, which they also surmised could be sold in kit form to compete with the then-under development J4, which only reached space after four months of release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMar 31 1959 (our time: Feb 22, 1382)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe XS1 prototype was complete. Ishihara looked at it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So much work...finally complete...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s ring the upper management.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey invited their upper management to a party and announced their project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManagement were angry, then surprised, then excited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Today...you will see XS1 launched. We plan to develop a orbit-capable XS1 in the very near future.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe XS1 had a LV-703 engine and FL-T100 as its first stage and a LV-Z10 engine (a derivative of the LV-T10) and 2x prototype FL-T200s as its second stage. It could be manned or unmanned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe XS1 had so much power when it lifted off that it caused a few dozen civilan Kerbals to arrive, despite the distance being over 800 m from the nearest street.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the upper management exclaimed \u0022We need to build a space centre...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithin about five minutes, hundreds of kerbals had arrived from the neighbouring city.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlec arrived, the J1-4 creator, and walked in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYoko said \u0022Hey Alec, what are you doing here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlec said \u0022To congratulate you guys on reaching space before us.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022What...?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYoko checked the altimeter. \u002272,194m. Second stage on 81% fuel. First stage disconnected at 58,444m. Estimated distance: 214,813m. \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYoko shouted. The crowd went insane, screaming and shouting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlec said \u0022Is that reusable completely?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYoko replied \u0022Only the top stage. The bottom stage, everything apart from the fuel tanks and decouplers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlec said \u0022You could get that thing into orbit...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYoko replied \u0022We are going to do that next launch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlec replied \u0022Oh...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd was bigger than the J1 one. Near the front, three teenage Kerbals stood, with their huge bottle rocket that failed a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Damn.\u0022 one of them went.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know what job I\u0027m getting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir names?
