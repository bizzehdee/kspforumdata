It doesn\u0027t seem to tell me the distance to approach or anything on the map before I get it in the SOI. Maybe I\u0027m not recalling correctly but I thought I saw the twitch players just looking at various impacts and seeing what was good before warping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso on an unrelated note I don\u0027t know how to get an avatar.
