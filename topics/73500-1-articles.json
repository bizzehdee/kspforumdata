(FYI, H.O.M.E.\u0027s powerplant seems to cause a hang during loading.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis simulator is amazing. I Love it. I can\u0027t wait for future updates and to see some modding tools come out. (I haven\u0027t searched enough to find any as of yet, if they exist.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also love how you can alter the scripts/files yourself, if you know what to look for. Having said that, I created a powerplant based on the Mk1FuselageStructural I call the MK1 FSPP (Fuselage Structural Power Plant). I only added the power generator parameters to it in the part file, and bumped up the power. It\u0027s great in that it already has a model in game and all I had to do was alter/create a part file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game is Great! It lets you Learn about Rocket Science and Create!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to getting into the forums more in the future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Landings!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbonium\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T23:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, welcome aboard \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, KSP is very addicting, since I began with it I haven\u0027t stopped.
