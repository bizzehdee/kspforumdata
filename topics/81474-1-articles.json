The cost includes getting from an aerobraking Jool orbit to the station orbit, then getting to a circular orbit around each target and returning to the station. No landing/takeoff was considered since it would be the same regardless of where the station was located.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the short answer is to put your station in a low Laythe orbit (55-60 km). This solution requires more dV to get to Vall and Tylo, but is worth it because coming back from Vall and Tylo is cheap with aerobraking. Also going to Laythe is very cheap when you are already there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore info on my \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~bnichols8/projects/kspstation/main.shtml\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eproject page\u003C/a\u003E.

DO NOT aerobrake around Jool to get into low Jool orbit. It costs way more to get to the moons than you will save aerobraking at Jool to return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Getting inside an SOI decreases the dV required to travel around. If you don\u0027t want to visit Laythe the next best place to be is inside Vall\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Being close to an atmosphere-less body is not good unless you plan on making many trips to that body.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T21:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood to know. I have a flotilla on the way to Jool and I\u0027m sending two tankers and one mobile lab along. One of the tankers is supposed to refuel a Tylo lander though, so I guess that one doesn\u0027t benefit from a Laythe station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T22:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn pure delta-V terms, wouldn\u0027t an elliptical Laythe orbit be even better, since it would require less delta-V to escape from? It would be a practical nuisance mind, since you\u0027d be limited in suitable ejection and entry angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while the landing doesn\u0027t matter for delta-V usage, it will for fuel usage. Say your station is at Laythe, then for the Laythe landing you just need to fuel to get the lander down and up, but for the Vall and Tylo landings you also need the fuel to ship the fully-laden lander to its target, and if desired to ship the empty lander back to the station. For a fixed on-the-ground payload, the Tylo lander\u0027s going to be the heaviest, not sure about Vall vs Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T23:12:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn pure delta-V terms, wouldn\u0027t an elliptical Laythe orbit be even better, since it would require less delta-V to escape from?

You\u0027ll waste a ton of fuel if you need to correct that. you\u0027d also have to wait till lathe moved into the correct position to eject on a prograde vector and depending on where your at in your orbit that may not line up very nicely with your destination. Probably more trouble than its worth IMO. Personaly I still favor tylo for my stations. bit more expensive if you go direct burn departures but tylo\u0027s an easy target to hit and really easy to set up a cheep departure that gets a gravity assist an orbit later to kick up/down to your desired orbit without useing as much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skaterzero807","CreatedById":118085,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T22:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I haven\u0027t run simulations for elliptical mainly because getting the longitude of periapsis lined up would probably be a pain, as well as timing the SOI exit to result in the correct transfer orbit at the right time to intercept the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, cantab, you bring up a good point about sending all that fuel to Tylo and back. I might look into optimizing this based on minimizing the amount of fuel required on each journey and back, or even to minimize the difference in fuel amounts so you can visit everywhere with the same craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
