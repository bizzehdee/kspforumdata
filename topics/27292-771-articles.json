Took screenies and everything; naturally I\u0027ve made it to work this morning without the screenies...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Friday night I designed a booster for the \u003Cem\u003EMidas 7\u003C/em\u003E IRSU lander and launched the craft successfully; it will arrive at Minmus in twelve days, full four days behind \u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E, which means that Jeb and his tour group aboard will have to wait a bit before they can head back to Kerbin - giving them plenty of time for a surface excursion. \u003Cem\u003EMidas\u003C/em\u003E turned out be one expensive bugger - at over \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1200k - so I\u0027m hoping I won\u0027t have to send up another one when my Mun operations get underway; on the other hand, she\u0027ll add a great deal of capabilities to the Wildcat drilling site on Minmus when she arrives in terms of storage and power production, not to mention fuel production. Meanwhile, I sent up a \u003Cem\u003EVulture 7\u003C/em\u003E refueling plane to rendezvous with \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E, which had ran out of gas over Kerbin in a stable orbit. The rendezvous and refueling was successful, and ultimately \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E arrived successfully back at Kerbinport to refuel and reload a new tour group. Cerxie and her tour group aboard \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E are now headed towards Mun, where they are scheduled to dock at Munport and make a surface excursion before returning to Kerbin. Finally, I sent Theogel back to Kerbin from Minmusport aboard the \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock\u003C/em\u003E craft docked there. Originally the idea was for him to head to Kerbinport and take a \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E flight back down to the surface with three tourists, but I\u0027m thinking about retiring the design of the original \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock\u003C/em\u003E at this point owing to later events that happened over the weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaturday was spent in a frustrating attempt to get a couple of plane designs working. I began designing the \u003Cem\u003EAlbatross 7\u003C/em\u003E, my first Mk3 sized aircraft. She was designed as a tanker, a scaled-up version of the \u003Cem\u003EVulture\u003C/em\u003E. I came to the conclusion during the test flights that I need to wait for some more tech before she can become operational; she\u0027s a heavy bird and I don\u0027t have the large gears unlocked yet, so almost all of the test flights all ended with the craft wheelbarrowing and crashing. The one time she rolled off the Runway to the left I was able to get her airborne, but she promptly lawn darted into the drink - too stable. Finally, she was designed with RAPIERs in mind, and I don\u0027t have RAPIERS unlocked. So yeah, a lot of work to be done there. I also began tweaking the \u003Cem\u003EMagpie 7\u003C/em\u003E ore carrier plane design in the hopes of alleviating her pitch-up tendencies. Pretty much I just increased the sweep on her main wing, which helped somewhat. She wasn\u0027t loaded with enough fuel to make orbit, and during the descent I accidentally sent all her excess oxidizer aft instead of forward like I\u0027d intended; by the time I realized my mistake, she was out of control and down she went into the drink. I also made the mistake on that one of hitting the \u0022space center\u0022 bar instead of the \u0022revert flight\u0022 bar, so that one wound up costing me some bux - which I was NOT happy about...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESunday was spent doing some more fun stuff. I began by designing the \u003Cem\u003ECarrier Pigeon 7\u003C/em\u003E, which was designed specifically to increase the range of \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock\u003C/em\u003E craft. I realized shortly after I put the first one into orbit and docked it at Kerbinport that the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E would have to be redesigned so that the \u003Cem\u003EPigeon\u003C/em\u003E wouldn\u0027t have its center of mass off-balance with a \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E attached. The \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E design was updated and a new capsule launched to Kerbinport, where the \u003Cem\u003EPigeon\u003C/em\u003E undocked from the station and docked with the \u003Cem\u003EPeacock\u003C/em\u003E; the combined craft is now en-route to Mun, where it will act as an emergency \u0022lifeboat\u0022 for any future rescue contracts over Mun. I also undocked \u003Cem\u003EBockscar\u003C/em\u003E from the station with Val as a passenger - she had lost her XP rating in the \u003Cem\u003ERaven\u003C/em\u003E accident two weeks ago, and I figured she could stand to do a Mun landing to get it back. I\u0027ll send her down with the tourists and pray she doesn\u0027t strand them on the Munar surface (which she has an annoying tendency to do); right now almost all of my engineers are deployed to Minmus. I also successfully launced a \u003Cem\u003EBeep-Beep 7\u003C/em\u003E probe to a polar orbit for contract (after two failed \u003Cem\u003EBallista\u003C/em\u003E flights), and launched another space station towards Kerbolar orbit for contract; that one will exit Kerbin\u0027s SOI in two days, and will make me \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1300k when it gets out there. That station might get picked up by Eve at some point as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of this morning, I\u0027ve got \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1170k, 69% rep and all buildings at KSC fully upgraded except for the Tracking Station at Level 2.
