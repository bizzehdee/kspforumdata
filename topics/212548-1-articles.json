I want to be able to use all my crew for as many missions as they don\u0027t die. Also is it just me or do Kerbals not have roles anymore? No pilots, engineers or scientists, they appear to be all the same. Hopefully later when the astronaut complex becomes functional, we can have Kerbal roles again as well as not losing your crew after every mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Profugo Barbatus","CreatedById":220450,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T02:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts unknown if roles are returning and what they might look like, but its most definitely a bug for the game to eat your crew, that will assuredly be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radioactiveness","CreatedById":226010,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T03:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also lost multiple Kerbals, be that from recovery of a successful mission or...one that was suboptimal.
