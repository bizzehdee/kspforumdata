I belive same can be used to kerbals it is esencialy them who are driving the rocket not you (well you are, but you could get my point) Also better pilot would use less RCS. I admit there is not that many non technical profesions availeble right now. But you could simiary argue it doesnt matter which rock you pick up if you are carring that rock back home for observation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T16:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with Axder. While all astronauts would\u0027ve had a good overall level of competency in all facets of a mission, some will be better at certain things than others are. The pilot will have more control of his vehicle, do things more efficiently. That translates into a small torque increase or a small Isp increase. Scientists would be better at finding worthwhile science. Engineers are less easy to implement into the game, since there\u0027s no damage or something. Maybe they\u0027d be better extracting those future resources.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T01:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tw1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tw1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAgreed- only non engineering related stats are fine to alter.

The back end is finished and has some nice little features which modders should enjoy. The Kerbal experience traits boost the ship/part they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re on and can have some very funky effects. Currently these include boosting thrust, reducing heat generation, increasing fuel efficiency and boosting science output. Obviously, the performance boosting effects have to be quite subtle to not make things too easy but will still provide a solid boost should you care for your Kerbals.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
