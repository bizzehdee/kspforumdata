Being determined to get as much science as possible from it, I wonder if there is a way to make those measures on a water biome? what if i manage to dive to the bottom of the sea?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-15T13:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think the atmowhatsit- forget it, I\u0027m calling it the AFSV- will work when in contact with water, but you can get seismic data from water biomes if you manage to touch the sea floor. Put a seismometer on a probe core, add an ore tank to the bottom and fill it with ore (better to do this with a small drill if you\u0027re trying it not on Kerbin, ore is heavy!); that should sink to the bottom, get the seismic readings then dump the ore to make it float to the surface again, retrieve and repeat if necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
