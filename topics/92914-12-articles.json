I had to do this. The KSC upgrade costs are very different in each difficulty. I\u0027ve also found myself staying on Kerbin a lot longer than I did in the past, so that I can make some money and gain better tech to do the more distant adventures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that stands out is how hard many of the contracts are in this new setting. With so many limits on techs, funds, part counts, and rocket mass, combined with the increased piloting and navigational difficulty, I think there should be some more easy contracts to do that don\u0027t require such pinpoint skill. Having to nail a specific altitude and speed to test a rocket part in flight is a lot harder now. Something like \u0022gather science from Kerbin\u0027s Highlands\u0022 would be a good entry-level contract for a new player. In fact, I think the contracts should do a lot more to direct you to the things you need to learn like biome hopping or achieving orbit with a certain amount of payload mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
