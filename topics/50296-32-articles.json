I\u0027m trying to re-enter a mk1 capsule (with the built-in heatshield) in Real Solar System from orbit (So just under 8km/s). I haven\u0027t modified any heating setting (left it as is) and am attempting a shallow entry trajectory (PE of about 75km). What I\u0027m observing is that the shield gradually heats up until about 1400 degrees and slowly starts ablating. However the pod behind it heats up by the same amount and explodes around 1500-1600 degrees (as it should when it gets that hot). It\u0027s the built-in heatshield so it can\u0027t be upside down (right?) and I\u0027ve no idea what\u0027s going on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RSS thread and the DREC threads both mention using \u0027RSS class heatshields\u0027, but the realism overhaul thread mentions \u0027Deadly Reentry v4.2\u002B (for the heatshields)\u0027, so I\u0027ve assumed that from v4.2 and up the DREC heatshields can be used with RSS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something somewhere?
