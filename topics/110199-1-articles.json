Projected against a virtual plane (and ignoring parts like launch clamps and others the aero model ignores) the outline shape would be generated by all rays NOT blocked by the rocket.\n\nThen on that outline do the math for finding the centroid of an irregular shape. Quite a bit of work for KSP to do to display a small sphere on the screen but it would be a big help for building rockets that are stable without having to do fin spamming to force them to keep the nose pointed the right way.\n\nFor rockets that are not symmetric in the X and Y axes, the COP would be a different heights. Might want to have a way to test for and display that."},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T06:25:14Z","Content":"I\u0027ll express my greatest agreement before mods move this to the suggestions forum.

It represents a \u0022worst case\u0022 situation - where your CoP will (approximately) be if the rocket is perpendicular to the airstream. The distance between that and the CoM represents how hard the rocket will try to right itself when pointing away from the prograde direction.\n\nIf you threw in another point obtained with the Barrowman equations, you\u0027d get the range between where the CoP (approximately) will be at any time. The distance between the Barrowman CoP and CoM represents how hard the rocket will resist turning away from prograde direction.\n\nOf course both methods were developed to predict rocket flight behavior inside Earth atmosphere and using our local physics rules. They might not apply very well to KSP physics in the end. It would take some experimentation to actually determine how well they would fit."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:20:41Z","Content":"Suggestion moved to the suggestions section."}]}
