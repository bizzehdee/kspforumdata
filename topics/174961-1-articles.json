It didn\u0027t have this issue. I compared copies and saw the earlier copy didn\u0027t have the Missing History mod in it.\u00A0 I deleted it and started the game again and the shroud was gone from the Terrier engine. The other issue I had was some of my saved crafts were displaying with big gaps between the stages. This issue also was fixed by taking out the mod. I posted on their forum section of my experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
