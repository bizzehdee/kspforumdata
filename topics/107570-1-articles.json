I recently installed my Operating System (Windows 7) Again, and I went to install KSP. I have tried so many times to install it, and every time, it gives me an error unzipping on the same file, which is Sharedasset0.asset. It is driving me nuts! If anybody has a solution to this problem, it would be much appreciated! Thank you!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:56:35Z","Content":"Hi ExplorerOfSpace, are you using winRAR?

I was using the KSPInstaller.exe. When I activate the .exe it would go through unzipping for me and always hung on teh above file. I tried redownloading it several times with the same results each time. I\u0027ve downloaded 7zip from your link and am downloading the ksp-win-1-0-2.zip to try that. I wish there was just a way I cold convert my license to just use it via Steam and let it to the work for me. Much easier.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It might also be a bad download, redownloading could fix it.\n\nThank you for the reply. I\u0027ve tried downloading it a few times and get the same result on the same file each time. I\u0027ll try the zipped one instead of the installer and unzip it myself."}]}
