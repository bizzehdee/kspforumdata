It is a similar size to Kerbin, so the gravity is roughly the same. However, due to it\u0027s atmosphere being composed of different gases than Kerbin\u0027s, it has a much denser and larger atmosphere, which makes it very easy to land on, as there is a very significant amount of air resistance, however, it also makes it excruciatingly difficult to take off from, as the atmosphere is 5 times as dense as Kerbin\u0027s which means it takes 5 times the fuel to lift off of Eve as it does to lift off of Kerbin. So, my question is, can anybody make a ship (without mods) that can go orbit around Kerbin a few times, then leave for Eve, land on Eve, and get into orbit around Eve, only to return back to and land on Kerbin? If yes, please post pics here, because it would be amazing to see. So yeah! If anybody\u0027s up to the challenge, then post here and attempt it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nukesnipe","CreatedById":50350,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T02:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMate...

Getting up into space, SRBs are probably the key. Have that trust to make your initial punch. The nukes in atmo are the worst for efficiency so must be avoided at all costs. Probably the best return module would be the single nuka on a large tank with lander. I wonder if that has the fuel to get a pod home. It should, anyways, that final stage should just capture kerbin.

On kerbin I made a pretty decent jet that got to the 16km and then used srbs and shed wings to get an easy orbit leaving only a small jet plane, was awesome to work. While these jets don\u0027t work, has anybody tried seeing what horizontal can be generated using the small liquid fuels on Eve?
