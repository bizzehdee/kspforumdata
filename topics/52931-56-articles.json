As soon as the physics load on the launch pad, everything above the chute disconnects, falls through the middle of the ship, hits the ground and explodes. The explosion then sends the rocket into the air, but very slowly (almost like in a vacuum with no gravity). I take the stack chute out and the problem stops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on what might be the issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot without logs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skbernard","CreatedById":67569,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T18:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sumghai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sumghai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for SDHI:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I simply could not replicate your issue, and so I have no idea whether it\u0027s a mod conflict\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - SDHI chutes were designed NOT to be tweakable, such that they only work on Kerbin, which is their intended purpose\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027m running into the same thing as well, cant figure it out for the life of me...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-05T18:28:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2014 06:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by skbernard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar-ishnish\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ctbram","CreatedById":99635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T01:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just installed the update and launched my crew transfer vehicle - what is with the \u0022awaiting negative vertical velocity\u0022. it\u0027s kind of distracting. what is it for and can I please turn it off?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-06T01:34:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2014 01:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ctbram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T01:39:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt means the parachutes are armed but they\u0027re waiting for you to actually start falling before they deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ctbram","CreatedById":99635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T01:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022phoenix_ca\u0022 data-cite=\u0022phoenix_ca\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt means the parachutes are armed but they\u0027re waiting for you to actually start falling before they deploy.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eummm, okay next silly question.
