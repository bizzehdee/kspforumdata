If I need to make a change to an upper stage of my craft, it (as far as I know) requires detaching and setting aside the entire lower part of the rocket. Sometimes when I re-attach it, some of the strut connectors and fuel lines will be disconnected. It\\\u0027s a huge pain when they\\\u0027re in the center of a big cluster where I can\\\u0027t get a good camera angle. Is there a known \u0027best practice\u0027 for avoiding this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Whenever I try to do multiple symmetries (radial decouplers -\u0026gt; stack tricouplers), there\\\u0027s a good chance that it will get horribly glitched. Sometimes it seems to forget that certain parts are included in a symmetry, sometimes it will only allow me to edit a part at 2x symmetry when I originally used 3x, and sometimes it breaks entirely and I end up with floating blue circles where they don\\\u0027t belong. I\\\u0027ve had some success with building just a single branch, using 3x symmetry below the tricoupler, then reattaching the whole thing to the trunk with some symmetry, but it doesn\\\u0027t always work out, and I\\\u0027m not sure why. I also end up with a LOT of issues trying to use strut connectors in these setups. Any best practice here, or is it just something to avoid entirely?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesus KerBeard","CreatedById":4176,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-31T23:11:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zarakon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zarakon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes it seems to forget that certain parts are included in a symmetry, sometimes it will only allow me to edit a part at 2x symmetry when I originally used 3x,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s fairly common, and it seems the only work around is to make sure you\\\u0027re building on the actual part you placed, not the symmetrical copies.
