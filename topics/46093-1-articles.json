I made this error myself and ended up going the wrong way even though I thought I was going to end up prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom lower-to-higher orbits with Hohmann transfer (i.e. intersect is tangent to target\u0027s orbit), you are going slow and the target is going fast, so the target is approaching you from behind. Prograde and retrograde can both potentially sling you forward, but prograde will sling you outward while retrograde will sling you inward. Look to see which way your orbit is going after the encounter, if it has bent to the left or bent to the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor higher-to-lower orbits like Kerbin to Eve, the situation is reversed because you are going fast and the target is going slow. You are approaching the target from behind. Prograde or retrograde can both slow you, but prograde will sling you inward while retrograde will sling you outward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your intersection is not tangent to the target\u0027s orbit, then you have some radial velocity which makes it more complicated because you very likely have both radial and tangential velocity. For the radial component alone, if you are moving radially outward relative to your target, then prograde around your target (say Mun) will send you prograde around the parent body (Kerbin), meaning higher Kerbin orbit around after the encounter. Retrograde around your target will send you retrograde around the parent body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut again if you are going from a higher to lower orbit, moving radially inward, then the situation is reversed. Prograde around the target will send you retrograde around the parent body, and retrograde around the target will send you prograde around the parent body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe there is also a way to see directly using settings to change how conics are rendered, but I haven\u0027t ever used it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T07:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/48342-How-to-warp-into-Eve-Gravity-Influence-in-the-correct-angle/?page=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/48342-How-to-warp-into-Eve-Gravity-Influence-in-the-correct-angle/?page=1\u003C/a\u003E check this out.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T08:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I believe that KSP now lets you focus on the intercept point by double clicking it.
