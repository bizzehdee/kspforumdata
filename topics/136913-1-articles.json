attachment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNode attachment is when you connect one green ball to another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurface attachment is when you take a part that has no node, and still stick it to something else. A battery, or a RCS thruster, or a thermometer... Oh, and when you attach a SRB to a radial decoupler, that\u0027s surface attachment too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, not all things can be surface attached. To make it work, you need the part you want to attach to support surface attachment, and you also need the part you want to attach to to allow it. Only when both parts allow it, you can surface attach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0 thing about the interstage adapters with only one single node is that they allow surface attaching. So if you have an engine that supports it, you can attach a large group of engines to that adapter, without using any nodes at all! Mind you, stock KSP\u0027s engines are almost all not surface attachable, save for the radial ones. But a lot of modded engines are. Some mods even tweak stock engines to be surface attachable, where it makes sense. Like, why does the Ant engine even need a node? That thing is predestined for clustering, if only Squad would set the flag to enabled \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even if you don\u0027t use surface attachable engines, the single-node interstage can still make sense. For instance, you can build a great Mun lander with a Rockomax X200-8 fuel tank and a Terrier engine. That\u0027s a 1.25m engine under a 2.5m tank. On the Mun, it has more than enough thrust. However, if you put that on top of a 2.5m rocket, you have 2.5m nodes all the way through that stack... except where the Terrier attaches to the decoupler below. That\u0027s a 1.25m node, which is significantly weaker, but still needs to support heavy 2.5m parts above it. The result is a \u0022wet noodle rocket\u0022. Not to mention that it looks super dumb when you suddenly have a gap in the side of your rocket because the Terrier is so much smaller. It causes extra drag too, because of the highly unaerodynamic shape of that gap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the interstage adapter lets you attach a Terrier to it... but the 2.5m stack of the rest of the rocket attaches to the 2.5m node of the interstage, not to the Terrier. What you get is a stiff, stable rocket, and the gap around the Terrier is covered by an interstage fairing, which makes the rocket look smooth and ensures good aerodynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother common use of 1.25m engines under much larger tanks is the LV-N nuclear rocket. People often put it under long stacks of Mk3 fuselages, which are even larger and heavier than 2.5m. Having the much larger, stronger node of the interstage is even more important there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, you can attach something like a stock bicoupler to the interstage adapter to get multiple attachment nodes inside the interstage, provided that your engines are not too long. Some mods also add things like 1.25m-\u0026gt;0.625m multicouplers, which further increases your versatility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-17T22:22:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2016 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
