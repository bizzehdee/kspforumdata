That said, the default work on the game should in fact be as realistic as possible, then if they need to simplify, do so afterwards. Why? Because reality is a known entity they can compare with.

You can build one for fun, but they have zero utility. There are countless other examples possible. Other games have done this in different genres, always dumbing it down (how\u0027d that work for PotBS?).
