I\u0027m not familiar with Mac OS, but if you can\u0027t get the client to run, make sure you\u0027ve got Mono installed. I would assume the client can be started the same way as in Linux, and that is by opening the command line, going to the KLF folder and running \u0022sudo mono KLFClient.exe\u0022 (without quotes). Seems like shell scripts work on Mac OS as well, so you could do something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#!/bin/sh\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esudo mono *path to KLF client location*/KLFClient.exe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd save that as a .sh file. You could then either place the script directly on your desktop and run the client from it, or you could leave it in the KLF folder and make a shortcut that points to it. You could try it without sudo first, it might work if you have sufficient user privileges. If not, sudo it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo note, however, that all of this may be wrong. I can\u0027t go and check because I accidentally formatted my entire HDD while trying to bring an external drive back to life. And, again, I have not done any of this stuff on Mac OS, I just quickly googled whether it works or not, but I can\u0027t be absolutely certain. Mac OS is Unix based, so most things *should* work just like on Linux. You won\u0027t mess anything up if you try though.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-01T13:39:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2013 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WalterBlockland","CreatedById":81512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T22:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI cant find an \u0022install\u0022 folder in my Kerbal Space Program folder. :cry:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxion12345","CreatedById":81515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T22:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have tried this, can you help me fix?
