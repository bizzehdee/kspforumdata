I\u0026#39;m interested in maybe even making a few little mods, or at least working on some. Would be most interested in stock-alike type stuff or anything that adds to the game play. I have experience with 3d stuff, programming, the usual stuff. Let me know if anyone wants to maybe collaborate a bit and see what we can come up with. Thanks!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T18:40:38Z","Content":"\nWelcome to KSP, you may find the [url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/37-Add-on-Development[/url] forum of particular interest.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T21:53:28Z","Content":"\nHello CatmanFS, and welcome to the forum!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are lots of talented people around here to collaborate with.
