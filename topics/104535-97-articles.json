IR searches for all parts that use the plugin and puts them under the Robotics tab, but cannot remove them from their existing tab, hence them intentionally not being assigned a category.

And please ask for help.  \n\nI\u0027m building an orbital station in KSP and I joined it with an IR-folding shuttle. At the end of my shoulder I have a small docking port from Contares (Graple fixture). Can I use this docking port to transfer / move modules from one port to another station port on the other? (I use the Clamp O-tron docking port to connect the modules). For now, I have a problem with the fact that if I do this, I can not save or leave the game using the standard menu - just Alt \u002B F4 and then everything from over again, but it can not save again. Otherwise, to capture the satellite (I did a mission with the Hubble telescope) in the space with the shoulder port it works normally.
