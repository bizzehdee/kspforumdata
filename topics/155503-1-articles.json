That said, if you want three \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(note: you could use two and use Kerbin as your third \u0022relay\u0022)\u003C/span\u003E satellites in orbit around the sun, the easiest way to do it is to use some form of tool like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E to tell you your orbital period around the sun. What you do is launch your three relays and drop their orbital periods down to two thirds of Kerbin\u0027s orbital period: 284 days. This is best accomplished by doing an escape burn from Kerbin at dawn. The rest is fine-tuning your orbit until whatever tool or calculation you\u0027ve made confirms that your satellites are on an orbit around the sun that takes 284 days. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(You could always look in-game at your time left to apoapsis just after\u00A0passing it, if it says roughly 284 days, then you\u0027ve done it successfully)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve done that, you need to circularize \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eone\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E satellite\u0027s orbit back to 426 days at apoapsis. Assuming you leave one satellite on the same orbit as Kerbin or use Kerbin itself as a relay, it should take at most two orbits or 568 days until you have a perfect triangle of relays around the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, you don\u0027t really need to worry so much about the sun eclipsing your network. Assuming you place an interplanetary relay near each planet you are going to visit, you should have plenty of hops to get around the sun without a network dedicated to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: My approach to interplanetary relays is to put a relay with RA-100s on the trail of every planet I plan on visiting and use a local network with satellites equipped with a couple of RA-2s to avoid interruptions from local satellites.\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(I mean natural satellites here, like the Mun\u00A0or Ike, etc.)\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe easiest way to achieve this is similar to what I mentioned above: you perform a fly-by or do an escape burn at dawn that leaves you on a smaller orbit than the target celestial body. Soon after that, you burn radially to match that celestial body\u0027s height around the sun and prograde to match its orbital period.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(you probably want a longer orbital period by a margin of a few seconds to avoid catching up to the planet and falling inside its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThis leaves you with a strong signal that always comes from that planet\u0027s trail and is at virtually no risk of being eclipsed locally.
