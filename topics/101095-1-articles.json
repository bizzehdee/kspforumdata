Hopefully Steven Canfield\u0027s and Kirk Sorenson\u0027s wonderfully practical (and surprisingly effective) xGRF concept will be recognized and flown!\n\nYou misunderstand me. By \u0022rebuilding\u0022, I\u0027m not referring to winches and gantries - rather, it\u0027s about how the underlying plugin works.\n\nIn KSP, the parts of a vessel are defined using relative coordinates for location and rotation, which in the stock game can **never** **ever** change (barring rapid unplanned disassembly). So while a simple animated extendable boom might be very easy to make using the stock animation module, it won\u0027t actually push connected parts outwards (because as far as KSP is concerned, none of the other parts need to move).\n\nIR basically looks at, say, a piston, and says \u0022Ok, what other parts are connected to this piston? What are their current positions right now? If I move this piston by X amount in Y direction, I should change the position of part A and B so that they look like they\u0027re also moving with the piston\u0022. By constantly updating the relative positions of all connected parts, IR effectively \u0022rebuilds\u0022 the vessel in real time.\n\nThe stock game has an undocumented moving joint PartModule, and there\u0027s a good reason it hasn\u0027t been made into an actual part right now: SQUAD hasn\u0027t figured out how to rebuild relative part positions properly just yet, resulting in situations where the connected parts float free from the joint in weird directions. OTOH, through years of iterative development, IR has solved this relative part re-positioning issue.\n\nThe other advantage of IR is that it handles a wide range of joint types, so that you only need one plugin for all your robotics needs. Contrast this with your proposal for a plugin that \\*only\\* handles extendable booms: one day you might decide you also want rotational joints - do you write a totally separate plugin to handle rotational joints (and therefore duplicate code unnecessarily), or do you add that feature to your existing extendable boom plugin, and thereby effectively \u0022reinvent\u0022 IR?\n\nSo basically, if you hate IR and want someone to write a different plugin for an extendable boom that moves parts connected to it, the new plugin **WILL** end up having the same underlying code as IR.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T22:07:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai**"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T21:43:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t want many of the parts, in short.\n\nThen why don\u0027t you simply delete the unwanted parts?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T21:53:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t want many of the parts, in short.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Then why don\u0027t you simply delete the unwanted parts?\n\nPruning part packs is definitely a valid alternative."},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T22:08:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The other advantage of IR is that it handles a wide range of joint types, so that you only need one plugin for all your robotics needs.
