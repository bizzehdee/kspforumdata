By \u0022rebuilding\u0022, I\u0027m not referring to winches and gantries - rather, it\u0027s about how the underlying plugin works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, the parts of a vessel are defined using relative coordinates for location and rotation, which in the stock game can \u003Cstrong\u003Enever\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eever\u003C/strong\u003E change (barring rapid unplanned disassembly). So while a simple animated extendable boom might be very easy to make using the stock animation module, it won\u0027t actually push connected parts outwards (because as far as KSP is concerned, none of the other parts need to move).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIR basically looks at, say, a piston, and says \u0022Ok, what other parts are connected to this piston? What are their current positions right now? If I move this piston by X amount in Y direction, I should change the position of part A and B so that they look like they\u0027re also moving with the piston\u0022. By constantly updating the relative positions of all connected parts, IR effectively \u0022rebuilds\u0022 the vessel in real time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock game has an undocumented moving joint PartModule, and there\u0027s a good reason it hasn\u0027t been made into an actual part right now: SQUAD hasn\u0027t figured out how to rebuild relative part positions properly just yet, resulting in situations where the connected parts float free from the joint in weird directions. OTOH, through years of iterative development, IR has solved this relative part re-positioning issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other advantage of IR is that it handles a wide range of joint types, so that you only need one plugin for all your robotics needs.
