I\u0027m in love with the 1.04 atmosphere, and even 1.0 seemed like a major improvement. Things designed like the game is meant to be (using nodes and such), flying now feels like a much more \u0022like the real thing\u0022 experience, once you take into account the scaling (because heating is way more brutal than in RL... still, a fair decent model, just amped to 11 so you can kill yourself like on RL). And I tell you this will all my aerodynamic baggage behind, which includes more than a bit of real world design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention that diriculously low part counts are now, not only possible, but encouraged by the game mechanics in multiple and subtle ways, and I\u0027ve always been the champion of computer-friendly builds...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it was buggy, and it probably shouldn\u0027t have been called 1.0. But it\u0027s the best KSP yet, IMO, once you get over the fact that it\u0027s changed a lot. I mean, I think it would be if it \u003Cem\u003Ehadn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E changed, that we should get pissed off about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
