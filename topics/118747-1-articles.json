For a while now I\u0027ve been feeling like we\u0027re repeatedly hitting our heads on a cosmic \u0022ceiling\u0022 in our attempts to climb higher up civilization\u0027s developmental ladder. In the case of things like space travel, or simply a better world where \u0022want\u0022 can be mostly done away with, it seems like we reached a plateau. The dreams of the future that people in decades\u0027 past had, have all been catastrophically shot down. Our formulas for how the universe works paint a much bleaker picture than what our imaginations saw coming after humans walked on the moon. Energy is much more difficult to harness than we thought it would be. I read somewhere that even if money weren\u0027t an option, and we could build the ultimate warp ship, it would probably have to consume all of the energy in our sun just for a merry jaunt to the next star system. \u0022Reality\u0022 has begun to feel like a cage to me, with bars made of equations that are far too limiting. If reality is that cruel, then there\u0027s just nothing we can do and our fate is in all likelihood, sealed. It has felt like the only way we can move forward, is if some new discovery proves that we\u0027re wrong about a WHOLE lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjectively, in the case of the EMdrive, it\u0027s probably a fluke that doesn\u0027t actually do anything amazing. But more subjectively, it \u0022needs to work.\u0022 Humanity needs it. Ever since science became more about math than about trial and error, we\u0027ve gotten a pretty good idea of what to expect. There\u0027s almost no room left for surprises. But a HUGE surprise seems like the only thing that can save us from being trapped in our current technological incarnation. Maybe I\u0027m just too pessimistic, but for example it seems the LHC (and think for a moment about how much that cost to build and the cost of running it), while its discoveries are awesome, isn\u0027t likely to yield anything that we can use as a breakthrough to catapult civilization forward into the future that our parents and grandparents were promised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust a Cold War.

People can use high-end CAD software for fee, have parts manufactured for a minor free, design and program electronics and share that knowledge with previously inaccessible people around the world. People build all sorts of useful or even game changing bits of hardware and software. People build advanced laboratories in their basements to do their own research, create programs to do distributed research on ad hoc super computers and run advanced simulations. People are even funding ideas they like with their own money, breaking the traditional mould of banks loaning big companies money, but doing nothing for the small guy.
