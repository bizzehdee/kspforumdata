Therefore, you can probably just simply define the resource as Argon. You can even extend this out to different phases of the same element. It would be redundant in my opinion to have a mod that defines an ice and a water and steam resources. If you require the resource to exist in a specific phase, you can probably just sim the process to include the energy needed to phase shift the base resource to whatever phase is needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exception to this would be different phases being used for very different applications. An example of this would be TACLS oxygen for breathing and oxidizer in KSPI which is generally considered to be liquid oxygen (if I remember correctly).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheTom","CreatedById":99271,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T08:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat mods does that integrate with?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay sound like a funny question but I just started a career game with Kethane mod installed and am surprised to see that I can use Kethane as fuel for the Thermal Rocket Nozzle (which I unlocked yesterday).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I start to wonder whether the KSP Interstellar Tech Tree sensibly integrates with other mods, too, so I can install them.

Not complaining - I know they get better with research. Just asking whether there is an initial use case. Higher ISP than the nerva nuclear rocket? Yes, but is that efficient with the weight and cooling requirements? Power - well, without the lab and higher stuff - I am quite happy with solar panels.\u003Cp\u003EIf the answer is \u0022no\u0022 that is totally ok - really not complaining, just wondering whether I overlooked something before I am shipping a 2.5 meter reactor as the power core for a kethane mining operation on mun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I have found that for Kethane mining rigs, if that\u0027s the only power draw on the ship, a 0.625m reactor and generator set is enough to power about 4 small drills, probably a couple big ones. If you want a KSPI science lab as well, go for a 1.25m set. Those are about the only things I\u0027ve found you can do with the un-upgraded stuff. I\u0027ve read and seen that you can get a working spaceplane with the thermal turbojets but it has to be pretty minimal until you get the upgrades, personally I haven\u0027t had much luck with that but I\u0027m useless at planes anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger 2.5m and 3.75m stuff, I\u0027ve found it\u0027s only worth putting up a 2.5m set for a large space station (2 ISRU refineries, KSPI science lab, large and small Kethane converters, stock science lab \u0026amp; loads of comms), as that provides around 90MW, which allows for everything going full whack and a bit to spare. 3.75m I\u0027ve only used a lot of em for beaming power out of Kerbin via the microwave transceivers, but by that point you are pretty close to getting the upgrades anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are my experiences, though I am sure others have found much more use for them - a lot to play with, experiment!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther experiences:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big reactors are mondo heavy (rightly so), I tend to launch them and the rads separately (disabling reactor before launch, love tweakables!) then dock together and switch on with an EVA Kerbal. That way you can have just 2 of the massive foldout rads and that should cover you for WasteHeat, lowering part count and making launches easier. Also, Microwave Transceivers skyrocket your WasteHeat, so if you plan to add that later, make provisions for about 4/5 massive rads per 3.75m reactor/generator/transceiver combo, in my experience. That may have changed since WasteHeat now finds it\u0027s own balance while dissipating, but I think Fractal has sorted it so its about the same amount of rads you used to need. I haven\u0027t changed designs and nothing has overheated yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you plan to deliver UF4/THF4 resupplies to the reactor for really long-term use, don\u0027t bother sticking the tanks to the side of your ship: you can\u0027t transfer UF4/THF4 fuel between tanks with right click, only between a reactor and tank using an EVA Kerbal, after manually shutting down the reactor and waiting for it\u0027s DecayHeat to drop to 0%. I use a separate UF4 tank with it\u0027s own probe core and docking port to swap fuel, then de-orbit that when empty/filled with DepletedFuel from a Refinery. For Tritium production, make sure to put a Deuterium/Tritium tank on the ship with the reactor, it doesn\u0027t seem to be able to generate Tritium without it on the same vessel (docking doesn\u0027t count), same thing that happens with Kethane converters I believe and the way it has to handle Resources. Took me a few attempts to get all that right but my SpaceStation and mining monstrosity work excellently with these methods!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal ProTip: If you have RemoteTech2, put batteries on nuke ships you plan to use high time-warp with, whether you bother with solar panels or not. I\u0027ve found that at high warps (10,000x \u002B) my ElectricCharge goes crazy if I don\u0027t have extra battery buffers to allow for the large but brief drops, and RT2 (I think its RT2 that does it?) will kill warp due to low power. I think this would occur in stock as well, but there isn\u0027t anything that uses loads of power in stock, so unless you build something with like 20 probe cores/loads of comms you wouldn\u0027t see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is tons of fun, it adds some slightly-more-serious-but-still-Kerbal contraptions based off real science, and gives you a lot more to do in the mid-end game.

This is where the magnetometer comes in. Give the player a mission to map the magnetic field and antimatter flux around Kerbin and Jool, hunting for the best orbits. The magnetic fields are all quite symmetrical and simplified, and the best orbits are all (correctly) equatorial. The best mapping mission then is to get into a highly eccentric orbit so that you can measure the flux at every altitude, or a good range of them. (At the poles the magnetic fields all point down into the atmosphere, so any antiprotons there get lost.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fission reactors are fueled with Uranium or Thorium, and come fully fueled.

Therefore, you can probably just simply define the resource as Argon. You can even extend this out to different phases of the same element. It would be redundant in my opinion to have a mod that defines an ice and a water and steam resources.
