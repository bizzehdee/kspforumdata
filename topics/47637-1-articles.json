To get them back to Kerbin without using up the station\u0027s escape capsule, which the rest of the station crew very much wanted to keep, I sent over a spare crew module from my Kerbin station (Bill had already damaged one of its solar panels during an EVA so I was looking for an excuse to get rid of it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I screwed up the Mun approach and ended up being in an orbit opposite to the station. I looked into flipping the orbit by progressively changing the inclination until it turned over on itself but half way through it seemed like it would use up too much of my delta V so I changed it to a crash course with the Mun and started from scratch, sending up a brand new crew module, fueling it at Kerbin station and flying it to Mun station and back to a Kerbin landing with Jeb and Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn hindsight I wonder, based on how Mun landings go, if I couldn\u0027t have just literally burned about 600m/s to kill my orbital velocity then kept burning with some altitude adjustment to reset it to the other direction. Essentially land and take off in the correct direction, but skip most of the landing part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wonder if this kind of orbital correction is practical (or if there is a better way) on bigger planets with an atmosphere like Duna. When my ion probe first arrived at Duna it was also orbiting the wrong way. Fortunately that probe had tons of delta V and also a planned Ike observation period, so I pulled into orbit around Ike and then when I exited back to Duna I just exited backwards so that I got into the correct Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T13:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbit reversal is really only practical in Minmus or Gilly Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T13:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I\u0027m no expert, but the landing \u0022without landing\u0022 to change direction seems a waste.

Or if you\u0027re in a very wide elliptical orbit, because the trick relies on you having a clear line of sight from your current position to your periapsis without the planet in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you do is simple burn anti-radial, lowering your periapsis right through the planet and out the other side. Voila, orbit direction changed. The closer you are to the planet, the more fuel it costs because you\u0027re having to move the periapsis across a wider angle, but this is still usually cheaper on delta-V than rotating the whole orbit around the poles after capturing into a long elliptical orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, one time I had a ship arriving at Duna with a retrograde orbit. I used the above method but Ike was in the way so I had to wait until I was inside Ike to do the burn. It still only cost about 60m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
