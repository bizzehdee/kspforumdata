If your pitch control surfaces are right above the rear landing gear, you won\\\u0027t get anywhere because the surfaces are fighting the force of the landing gear against the ground. Best solution is to move the gear away from the pitch control surfaces (elevators). Otherwise you could try putting control canards near the nose of the aircraft so it lifts from the front, although that only works to a certain extent in my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do you actually have enough lift to take off at the speed you can get to along the runway? Best way to test this is to roll out near the edge of the KSC area and hop off the cliff towards the water, aircraft carrier-style. If you have enough lift, you won\\\u0027t go on a death fall into the sea. Gotta be going at a fair speed though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Sorry Bill! :\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BillWiskins","CreatedById":12285,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T11:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I believe this is known as being \\\u0027ninja\\\u0027d\\\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have control surfaces attached?

Stability is helped by having the wings further back, behind the centre of gravity.

You\u003Cem\u003E know\u003C/em\u003E it\\\u0027s possible, but the challenge is in figuring out how.

Landing gear location. This is surprisingly important. Think of your aircraft as one big sea-saw. If you put your rear wheels at the very back, it\\\u0027s going to be near impossible for the elevators to \\\u0027lever\\\u0027 the nose up. The best location for your rear wheels is just behind your aircraft centre of lift (just behind the wings). It DOES mean you have a risk of destroying your tail if you get over excited with your take off, but that\\\u0027s an issue with real world aircraft too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Keep your aircraft balanced. Unfortunately while burning fuel your weight will shift. As a rule of thumb, it\\\u0027s better to be nose heavy than tail heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Don\\\u0027t bother with ailerons! but do put rudders and elevators on your aircraft. Your command module will roll fine without ailerons anyway and thanks to the code in KSP your \\\u0027elevators\\\u0027 will also do the work of the ailerons for your...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one last thing... Have a free jet fighter/stunt plane!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might need a joystick or be really good with a keyboard to fly this jet, but it\\\u0027s a lot of fun \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(SAS and hitting capslock is recommended!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
