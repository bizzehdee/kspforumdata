Your \u003Cstrong\u003Escore\u003C/strong\u003E is a record of the highest mass you have reached during the current play session.

If you\u0027re smaller than them (generally less than ~100 mass) you can hide behind them. If you\u0027re much bigger, they\u0027ll pop you into smaller cells if you overlap them too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGrazing vs. Hunting:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Eating pellets, which I refer to as \u003Cstrong\u003Egrazing\u003C/strong\u003E, tends to be most effective when you first start out, up until you reach between 300-400 mass. After that, the rate at which your cell loses mass becomes too great and outpaces your grazing gains. After this point, you will need to hunt other cells in order to grow larger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to consume a cell you are \u003Cstrong\u003Ehunting\u003C/strong\u003E, you should generally have a radius at least somewhere (at a rough guesstimate) between 1/10 to 1/4 larger than the enemy cell. If you are significantly larger than the other cell, you can \u003Cem\u003Esplit\u003C/em\u003E (press SPACEBAR) to divide your cell into two halves and throw one half toward your cursor. If you are being chased and/or have been cornered by another cell, you can also split to try and save yourself from total destruction. As you grow larger, you become much slower, so it is easiest to run away from other cells when your components are small. Being very large also reduces your split-kill range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressing W \u003Cem\u003Eejects\u003C/em\u003E a small pellet of your mass. You can eject as much mass as you want, as fast as you want, until you reach your base mass. This is useful to increase your speed somewhat, but the mass you eject can be consumed by other players before you manage to reach it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also eject mass into a Virus to make it grow larger. If you grow a virus large enough, it will divide, launching another virus in the same direction that you shot the last pellet into it. The new virus will travel around 5 unenlarged viral diameters before slowing to a stop. This can be used to attack other cells, or to build a barrier against large cells, but be careful that they can do the same to you. It takes around ~8 to 10 pellets to grow a new Virus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EHunting tactics\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince your prey usually moves faster than you do, you have to trick them in some way to negate their speed advantage if you can\u0027t split-kill them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou usually want your prey to be crossing your path diagonally, instead of trying to chase them in a straight line. This is because when they\u0027re moving diagonally against your path, some of their speed is used in lateral motion instead of escaping you, allowing you to close in on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always best to try and chase your prey into a corner or at least against a wall, so they\u0027ll have the least directions to run. If your prey has a significant lead on you, you should try to stay somewhat away from the wall yourself, so your prey won\u0027t be able to dodge away from the wall without running through your path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChasing your prey toward other large cells (especially other potential prey) can also be helpful. Getting multiple cells into a corner is very good, but beware that one cell doesn\u0027t consume the rest before you get there and get big enough to eat you back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also hunt larger cells, using your speed advantage to bait them toward a Virus and pop them. Once you pop the enemy cell, a cluster of varying-size components will explode from them, mostly small cells. In my experience it\u0027s best to be at least around 1/2 to 3/4 as big as your target in order to successfully hunt a larger cell, since you\u0027ll need to catch up with the smaller cells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EPrey tactics\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can reasonably outrun most threats until you reach size 100 and become as big as a standard Virus. If you overlap a Virus too much after this point, it will pop you (but you can still overlap a significant amount).
