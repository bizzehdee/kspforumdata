They\u0027re called Viruses, so far as I know.\n\nPerhaps we should preface our names with the tag [KSP] so we can identify each other and team up. I\u0027m usually on as \u0022VIRUS FARMER\u0022\n\nI did a little writeup of Agar.io tactics for y\u0027all:\n\n**Gameplay**\n\n**Mass and Score:** Your cell starts out with an (invisible) **mass** number of 10. Every little pellet you eat increases your mass by 1, and you lose mass over time at a rate which increases with your size, until you return to the base mass of 10. Your **score** is a record of the highest mass you have reached during the current play session. You can use score to keep track of your mass initially, but as you grow bigger/play longer it becomes less useful.\n\nThe leaderboards display which players have the most mass, not the highest scorers.\n\n**Viruses** are the green spiky star-things. If you\u0027re smaller than them (generally less than ~100 mass) you can hide behind them. If you\u0027re much bigger, they\u0027ll pop you into smaller cells if you overlap them too much.\n\n**Grazing vs. Hunting:** Eating pellets, which I refer to as **grazing**, tends to be most effective when you first start out, up until you reach between 300-400 mass. After that, the rate at which your cell loses mass becomes too great and outpaces your grazing gains. After this point, you will need to hunt other cells in order to grow larger.\n\nIn order to consume a cell you are **hunting**, you should generally have a radius at least somewhere (at a rough guesstimate) between 1/10 to 1/4 larger than the enemy cell. If you are significantly larger than the other cell, you can *split* (press SPACEBAR) to divide your cell into two halves and throw one half toward your cursor. If you are being chased and/or have been cornered by another cell, you can also split to try and save yourself from total destruction. As you grow larger, you become much slower, so it is easiest to run away from other cells when your components are small. Being very large also reduces your split-kill range.\n\nPressing W *ejects* a small pellet of your mass. You can eject as much mass as you want, as fast as you want, until you reach your base mass. This is useful to increase your speed somewhat, but the mass you eject can be consumed by other players before you manage to reach it.\n\nYou can also eject mass into a Virus to make it grow larger. If you grow a virus large enough, it will divide, launching another virus in the same direction that you shot the last pellet into it. The new virus will travel around 5 unenlarged viral diameters before slowing to a stop. This can be used to attack other cells, or to build a barrier against large cells, but be careful that they can do the same to you. It takes around ~8 to 10 pellets to grow a new Virus.\n\n**Hunting tactics**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Since your prey usually moves faster than you do, you have to trick them in some way to negate their speed advantage if you can\u0027t split-kill them.\n\u003E \n\u003E You usually want your prey to be crossing your path diagonally, instead of trying to chase them in a straight line. This is because when they\u0027re moving diagonally against your path, some of their speed is used in lateral motion instead of escaping you, allowing you to close in on them.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s always best to try and chase your prey into a corner or at least against a wall, so they\u0027ll have the least directions to run. If your prey has a significant lead on you, you should try to stay somewhat away from the wall yourself, so your prey won\u0027t be able to dodge away from the wall without running through your path.\n\u003E \n\u003E Chasing your prey toward other large cells (especially other potential prey) can also be helpful. Getting multiple cells into a corner is very good, but beware that one cell doesn\u0027t consume the rest before you get there and get big enough to eat you back.\n\u003E \n\u003E You can also hunt larger cells, using your speed advantage to bait them toward a Virus and pop them. Once you pop the enemy cell, a cluster of varying-size components will explode from them, mostly small cells. In my experience it\u0027s best to be at least around 1/2 to 3/4 as big as your target in order to successfully hunt a larger cell, since you\u0027ll need to catch up with the smaller cells.\n\n**Prey tactics**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You can reasonably outrun most threats until you reach size 100 and become as big as a standard Virus. If you overlap a Virus too much after this point, it will pop you (but you can still overlap a significant amount). If you\u0027re being chased, you can also try eating fast enough that you\u0027ll grow too big to be eaten.\n\u003E \n\u003E Viruses are your only \u0022tool\u0022 in the game, serving as both weapons and a shield, so they are the only way to defend against hunters. It\u0027s useful to stay close to them if you think you\u0027re in danger; when you\u0027re small you can hide under them, and when you\u0027re large you can attack cells with them. If you\u0027re being chased, try to lure your attacker toward a virus; if they continue chasing you, you can \u0022seed\u0022 the virus by feeding it with W, so you won\u0027t have to spend as much time making it split.\n\u003E \n\u003E Once you have a clear shot into your enemy\u0027s cell(s), you can split the virus and pop your attacker. If you can\u0027t make a clear shot, you can still use the split virus as another barrier.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re a large cell being attacked with a Virus, try to stay around 5 viral diameters away from any viruses.\n\nIf we all teamed together, maybe we can fill an entire server with viruses so nobody can get big anymore, haha.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T02:48:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 02:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Accelerando**"},{"CreatedByName":"bigyihsuan","CreatedById":29291,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:22:45Z","Content":"Note that if you click on the gear on the home screen, you can open up the settings, and you CA see your mass via that."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:26:33Z","Content":"Another prey tactic is to change directions frequently and in 90 degrees.
