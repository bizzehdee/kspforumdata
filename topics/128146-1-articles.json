Particularily, i love looking at people\u0027s sstos, massive cruisers and sci-fi ships and seeing them go on wonderful adventures. Before now i always looked to the spacecraft exchange for my fix, but often found myself unsatisfied. It seems that the spacecraft exchange is 75% replicas (which i\u0027m uninterested in), 5% lifters and space stations (still not interested), 10% craft so heavily modded they don\u0027t even look like they belong in ksp, and only about 10% of what i actually like to see. And of these, only about half actually have pictures to go along with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now, NOW i can see people\u0027s interplanetary adventures, their glorious eye candy, their futuristic craft so massive and capable as to push the very limits of ksp! Thank you fan works, thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
