At the same time, you\u0027ve eliminated the fins at the bottom that would\u0027ve moved the center of aerodynamic forces back down. For a rocket of that size the capsule would provide entirely adequate steering otherwise. The heat shield\u0027s probably also unnecessary for an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E machine like this appears to be, but if it\u0027s in the stack it \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be causing aero issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion would be to eliminate the radiator -- I don\u0027t see anything on the rocket that would require it -- and, if that\u0027s not enough, putting the smallest fins on the second of the solid stages. First one won\u0027t get you going fast enough for aero instability to be an issue, but the first Hammer will.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: The above is trying to work \u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E your extant rocket. My own preference for using solids for launchpad kick is to radially mount them and co-fire them with a gimballing liquid engine; the liquid will give you a bunch of control authority and with its likely higher efficiency is better at sustaining your flight, but the solids will shove you up to working speed much faster and cut back on your gravity losses significantly since you don\u0027t have to painfully crawl up at 1.1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E or what not. By the time they fall off you\u0027ll have burned enough liquid fuel, and gained thrust by getting into thinner air, that the liquid engine can now propel you just fine on its own. In addition, because they\u0027re a radial attachment at the \u003Cem\u003Ebottom\u003C/em\u003E of a rocket, they can -- it depends on the weight distribution of the rest of the rocket -- act to stabilize you aerodynamically as they burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vv3k70r","CreatedById":208078,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-08T17:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223889806\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198528\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221607129520\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208501\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ikkjot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/5/2020 at 1:52 AM, Ikkjot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nflipped near 20,000-25,000m in the air.

The heaviest part of any moving object will naturally try to get to the \u2018front\u2019 and unless you can correct that with other forces e.g. aerodynamics, that\u2019s what will happen. Set your fuel tanks to drain from bottom to top in each stage, drop spent boosters as soon as possible and avoid using big, heavy engines when you don\u2019t need to. Solid boosters are fairly powerful for their size and cost, but are also heavy and so you shouldn\u2019t use those in your core stages; stick them on radially to give the rocket an extra kick off the launchpad then drop them once they\u2019re spent.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWatch your aerodynamics. A big blunt fairing on the front of your rocket can add a lot of drag and make it unstable, so try and keep your payload sizes in line with the size of the booster and add fins on the bottom of your first stage if necessary to keep it pointing towards space. You shouldn\u2019t\u00A0need controllable fins unless you have a really huge rocket, and avoid adding fins to upper stages as they\u2019re dead weight in space.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEngine gimballing. Many of KSP\u2019s liquid fuelled engines have some degree of gimbal (exceptions include the Reliant and Terrier) which means they can point their thrust to one side and correct their course while the engine is running., however these don\u2019t provide roll control unless you have more than one engine nozzle e.g. the Mammoth, or the Making History Bobcat.\u00A0Radially mounted engines such as the Thud, Twitch and the Making History Cub tend to have particularly high gimballing angles to be used as vernier engines, providing less thrust but a lot of control; verniers were used on the Atlas and Soyuz rockets as the main engines were fixed, whereas the engines on the Black Arrow and Space Shuttle had a high gimbal angle to provide control. Most real rockets didn\u2019t need fins at all as the gimbals or verniers provided enough control.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"}]}
