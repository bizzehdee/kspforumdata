This is because they simply quickloaded without actually knowing when the last quicksave was. In some cases, it was in excess of 10 or 20 hours of real-time work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, solution to this? Simple. Upon mission start, set a flag to say \u0022a quicksave has not yet been made\u0022 \u003Cem\u003Eon the vessel itself\u003C/em\u003E. Leave this flag unchanged until a quicksave has been made (naturally), and store it with the ship\u0027s information in the persistence file. Then, if a user attempts to quickload, the game can check whether or not a quicksave has been made during that mission. If not, the game can pop up a confirmation window with a warning telling them they might inadvertently load a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E old save, and the options to \u003Cstrong\u003ECancel \u003C/strong\u003Eand \u003Cstrong\u003EQuickload Anyway\u003C/strong\u003E, as well as the two \u003Cstrong\u003ERevert\u003C/strong\u003E options as an alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother good way to avoid this (I would think it best to be done in addition to the former) would be to have multiple quicksaves. Only a limited number should ever really be necessary (say, around 5 is plenty). Then, quicksaves can be made by pressing (for example only; this should be \u003Cstrong\u003Econfigurable\u003C/strong\u003E) \u003Cstrong\u003EF5\u002B1\u003C/strong\u003E through \u003Cstrong\u003EF5\u002B5\u003C/strong\u003E. Quickloads would be done in much the same manner; simply hold \u003Cstrong\u003EF9\u002B1\u003C/strong\u003E through \u003Cstrong\u003EF9\u002B5\u003C/strong\u003E. In addition, when loading, the timestamp (in real-time \u003Cem\u003Eas well as\u003C/em\u003E game-time) on the save to be loaded should be displayed in the few seconds before the save is actually loaded, so that the user can abort the operation if they realise it\u0027s the wrong file. In addition, the previous suggestion (popup a warning if no save had yet been made for that mission) should also apply for maximum idiot-proofing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, by extending both previous suggestions, one could set a flag on each quicksave file that records which ship was active when the quicksave was made. This information could be displayed along with timestamps to further idiot-proof the features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese should allow users to be very conscious of how much work they stand to lose as a result of loading up a save which may have been made a long time ago, and should effectively prevent anyone from inadvertently losing a great deal of work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T17:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as all that can be turned off, cause all I see is an extra step in quickloading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be good for the idiots though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T18:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, but that\u0027s just it -- as long as you \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E saved during that mission, it\u0027s pretty much the same as usual.
