KSP doesn\u2019t have enough players of the people to do so. Unless KSP becomes like the top 10 games of simulations it won\u2019t have a PS5 probably. But KSP2 has a higher chance in getting to PS5 but that\u2019s kinda like a 50 50. And KSP2 would have to be really popular among the gaming world. But it isn\u2019t yet. So. Unless KSP2 get popular enough. Actually I take that back. KSP2 would have to be on PS5 to catch up the th market. And so ther you have it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
