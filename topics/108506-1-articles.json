Now I am confused about Reputation. When I am in the admin bldg., I can spend a certain number of points to buy things, so it seems reputation is measured in terms of POINTS, but when I start a saved game, it shows if I start this particular game, I have a Reputation of \u00224%,\u0022 so it seems Reputation is measured in PERCENTS. To make matters more confusing, there is a bar at the top of my screen which shows my money, reputation and science, but the reputation portion is a meter, and I can\u0027t read the numbers on it. All I can see is that it is in the low green section. The wiki says that max rep is \u00221000.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe confusion comes when I think about spending reputation. If I spend 37 points on a strategy in the admin bldg., is that a large portion of my current total or a small portion? I don\u0027t want to spend too much, cuz I want to keep getting good contracts. I\u0027m so confuzzled!

High rep seems to give you more contracts with more stars.
