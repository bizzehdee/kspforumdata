Now I am confused about Reputation. When I am in the admin bldg., I can spend a certain number of points to buy things, so it seems reputation is measured in terms of POINTS, but when I start a saved game, it shows if I start this particular game, I have a Reputation of \u00224%,\u0022 so it seems Reputation is measured in PERCENTS. To make matters more confusing, there is a bar at the top of my screen which shows my money, reputation and science, but the reputation portion is a meter, and I can\u0027t read the numbers on it. All I can see is that it is in the low green section. The wiki says that max rep is \u00221000.\u0022\n\nThe confusion comes when I think about spending reputation. If I spend 37 points on a strategy in the admin bldg., is that a large portion of my current total or a small portion? I don\u0027t want to spend too much, cuz I want to keep getting good contracts. I\u0027m so confuzzled! Help!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T00:48:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 12:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T01:59:17Z","Content":"Internal value is still 1000 max. When you load, it says x%, it merely says the internal value is 10\\*x, and I don\u0027t think it has anything to do with contracts.\n\nThe rep you earned from contract doesn\u0027t add directly to your career number - it\u0027s weighted in a long-tail fashion to make sure it doesn\u0027t exceed 1000.\n\nPercent in admin building should be percentage relative to contract earning. You can try use the strategy, and then go to contracts, see the parenthesis with (\u002Bn) or (-n) - that\u0027s the effect of strategy.\n\n37 doesn\u0027t sound too much to me as long as your rep is not over 700 or 800 or so"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T03:59:29Z","Content":"Keeping your rep high does affect the type of contracts you are offered, though, yes?

High rep seems to give you more contracts with more stars. Types are probably not that different, but parameters are probably harder (something like regular satellite on normal Kerbin orbit v.s. satellite with all bunch of equipments on polar orbit of Mun) and of course more rewarding."},{"CreatedByName":"g.koster","CreatedById":115794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T13:03:47Z","Content":"Ad higher levels you get more and more difficults (stars). \n\nAs you gain more and more reputaion you gain will be less and less. here there are seemingly some hard levels ad about 5000 you get the 3 star contracts.\n\neach star level of contracts circulates though a certain set of possible contract. these are also dependend on science level and what you have reached.\n\nAd 0 you get all that is given in the contracts ad 500 i got about half."}]}
