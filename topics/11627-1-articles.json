Better than anything I have made so far.\n\nIt sure can take a beating, I took a turn too fast in the main plane and lost the right engine and a large chunk of wing, but I was able to regain control and launch the smaller plane.\n\nThen another time when I lost control and was about to crash into the ocean, so I launched the smaller plane while the big one was exploding and jumping about. Its wings got sheared off and I lost several parachutes, but enough was left for me to splash down. \n\nAll in all, very nice indeed!"}]}
