Wouldn\u0027t you know now we have surface base contracts? Yeah, they are dirt simple to fulfil, but what if you wanted to do them \u003Cem\u003Ethe right way\u003C/em\u003E? Well look no further! This here is the fully 0.90 compatible, tested to kingdom come and then some, polished in every last detail, much awaited update to my best selling product in the history of ever: the Base-In-A-Box!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/urL8fe0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/urL8fe0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022urL8fe0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course since it\u0027s in a box, you can\u0027t see anything. Actually, the box is a lander capable of dropping the pieces anywhere but Tylo. On top of a booster that can get it anywhere*. But we\u0027ll get to that. In the meantime, suffice it to say some assembly is required. But what is it that you are buying with this? Well, something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/eiqE06L\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eiqE06L.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eiqE06L.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is one Base Pack, plus the lander that dropped it there. But you know, if you take the time, you are not limited to using one pack alone...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/VO4OZJj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VO4OZJj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VO4OZJj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course that is a very tweaked, difficult build with pieces from six different packs, from all over the development phase across several game versions, and a custom part to make that awesome central escape shuttle (also a custom job) dock with the base. In fact, what you get out of a single pack is much more modest, albeit a still fully functional base, with a Hab module, a Lab module, a Fuel Dump, a Node module connecting everything and giving communications capability, plus the construction rover that moves all the pieces around. And now, my kerbs, I suppose it\u0027s time to get to the user instruction manual... which is much more simple now than it used to be. I\u0027m going to assume form now on that you either use the Deluxe or Deluxe\u002B versions, meaning you deploy with the Shroud/Lander. We will get to the alternative, complicated deploy methods later (because they are hugely fun to do! Plus, it allows you to build the non-standard bases much more cheaply, if you care about that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, we are basically launching one ginormous rocket. No big pointers there, get it to LKO and if you are any good, you will do so using the upper stage only for the last tens of m/s of the circularization. Now we get to the main difference between the Deluxe and the Deluxe\u002B version of the pack: the legs. Basically, the Deluxe\u002B version has more than twice the deltaV, or 5km/s, without tapping into the fuel of the lander. That means this is indeed capable of launching to any planet in the system... if you have patience. And I mean \u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E of patience. It has a tiny 0.75m/s^2 of acceleration at the start of the burn, so be prepared to read a book while it\u0027s performed or something... Or you could use the Deluxe version\u0027s chemical stage with TWR of 1.1 to get to anywhere between Jool and Eve, because it still has 2.3km/s and is much less tedious to get there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, if we know out navigation stuff, you will have the pack inside it\u0027s lander/shroud, orbiting your target planet/moon. EDL time! It\u0027s dirt simple since you have chutes and everything, but just in case, make sure you are controlling from the top docking port so the navball makes sense, and remember that \u0022Abort\u0022 drops the nosecone and transfer stage, drops the gear, and deploys the chutes. 1.8km/s and TWR of 0.8 under kerbin gravity means that you can comfortably set it down \u003Cem\u003Eanywhere\u003C/em\u003E. Afterwards, it\u0027s time to open the presents!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does look indeed like Santa dropped by... of did we drop by Santa?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/MboAWFx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MboAWFx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MboAWFx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this group picture you can (almost) see them all. Three corridors still on the ground, the Hab and the Fuel Dump already up, and still together are the Lab and the Node module, with the rover on the other side of the lander. The position is no accident, because I have to warn you: deploying the rover\u002Bcorridors package is best done in the upwards direction to avoid explosions and give room to the pieces to short themselves out. It should work, but follow this procedure: with the rover under control, set the throttle to about 50% (for kerbin\u0027s gravity), and hit stage: all corridors will unravel under you, as you gently \u003Cem\u003Efly away\u003C/em\u003E to a safe distance... (yes the rover is a rocket VTOL too) with maybe a few explosions of the decouplers. Nothing major hopefully. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Come to think of it, you might want to quicksave before starting this whole operation, the kraken preys on those who don\u0027t. Anyhow, let\u0027s get to the individual modules and how they do their thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/5u3RXN7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5u3RXN7.png\u0022 alt=\u00225u3RXN7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis here is the cornerstone of the whole modularity thing, the module that is not good for anything in itself, but that makes it possible to build \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E different bases with this pack and still have each of them look nothing like the others. And it is not pure eye candy, it is also a stock way of having all your base modules docked together in a single unit, sharing resources among them and simplifying both gameplay and you flight list (which in my case, never falls below 40). Make sure to put a pilot in there to operate it before you drop it, because it is the only one without a built-in probe to take care of deploying the landing gear and making sure it stays upright when doing so. It kind of shares form factor with the Hab module (vertical cylinder), and like it, it is positioned sideways on the bay, so be very careful when you drop it so that it ends up the right way up, or you will have to do some crazy thing with the rover and other modules pushing and such to flip it over. Needless to say warranty will be voided at that point (though if you are in some low gravity moon the problem is mostly non-existent). The Hab, though can right itself from any position thanks to a hidden reaction wheel and the legs, so don\u0027t worry about that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/SRUpjtF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SRUpjtF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SRUpjtF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis here is the other form factor, the one shared by the Lab module and the Fuel Dump. Very easy to drop and assemble, and you can actually also dock them with the lander (and with my Eagle shuttle, BTW), so you can refuel between those. All it takes to do those dockings, BTW, is some fiddling with the suspension depending on the local gravity: lock it for high gravity fields so the rover can slide under the modules to pick them up, and maybe do a little hop with RCS on the low-gravity moons if the rover doesn\u0027t want to connect because the gap is a hair too big. It is tested to work both in kerbin and on Minmus, so you should have no troubles there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gymDEag\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gymDEag.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gymDEag.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last but not least, the construction rover. This useful little bugger will not only put all of the other modules in place by docking itself to their ventral nodes, it is equipped with seats so it can serve the base as a joyride when it\u0027s done building it, and it carries one of each of every scientific instrument. It even carries monopropellant rockets to do short hops! And you know, with some ingenuity, I\u0027m sure you can figure out some way of putting a whole base on wheels, and rove your base all over the planet/moon to get to the juicy places. Sky\u0027s the limit!

Plus, it would do a more than decent job at hauling them the long distances. That is pretty much the way you get all those modules to where you want to set up the base. Don\u0027t worry about landing them ultra close to each other, but it saves time if you don\u0027t have to rove too far to get the pieces, since you don\u0027t have the most stability when you are carrying the big, tall modules in the tiny rover. Make sure you maximize the load you bring down on each trip by putting the corridors and the rover on the top docking port while you bring down other payloads, saves you a few flights and they can right themselves from pretty much any position in almost any gravity field (not actually tested on Laythe!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there is the part of actually getting the modules on orbit.

You can notice pretty easy if you look closely that the corridors got more than a few versions over the development cycle, for example. The one where you can see the actual base you get with all the details as they are right now is the one in the album built near the munar Arch, and even that one has a slightly wider rover and node modules than the one I give. What can I say, setting them up takes a lot of time and effort, and I wasn\u0027t going to throw all those out the window if I could help it. They are 90% accurate though, because the changes are truly minimal form one version to the next, and don\u0027t affect the Lab, Dump, or Hab in any way. It took a while to get corridors that were efficient in parts and could right themselves to be picked up in any gravity field, that\u0027s all, and the Node could be prettified and made to fit a MkIII bay (it was a hair too wide) with a slight touch of the offset gizmo.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

You can notice pretty easy if you look closely that the corridors got more than a few versions over the development cycle, for example. The one where you can see the actual base you get with all the details as they are right now is the one in the album built near the munar Arch, and even that one has a slightly wider rover and node modules than the one I give. What can I say, setting them up takes a lot of time and effort, and I wasn\u0027t going to throw all those out the window if I could help it. They are 90% accurate though, because the changes are truly minimal form one version to the next, and don\u0027t affect the Lab, Dump, or Hab in any way.
