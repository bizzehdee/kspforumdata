Everyone likes them, RCS is just there to help if the wheels are not enough, or for translation. How close is this to real life? I understand that satellites such as Kepler or Hubble use reaction wheels, so do stations, such as ISS. As far as I understand it these things don\u0027t use RCS, because that would mean carrying a lot of propelant with it and they have plenty of power for the SAS ... oops, reaction wheels ... anyway.

Seemed natural enough to describe what attitude control systems do -- create changes (delta) in angular momentum (L). It\u0027s not delta-v, because wheels don\u0027t change the craft\u0027s velocity. The \u0022unlimited\u0022 thing I was talking about was meant to refer to maneuvering, which involves changing the craft\u0027s angular momentum (from zero to something, to start rotating), then changing it back (to stop). RCS would have to burn propellant to start rotating, then burn more to stop, and you\u0027ll run out if you do it enough. Reaction wheels can keep on doing that almost forever, limited only by the availability of electricity and the lifetime of their bearings (which \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E finite, as Kepler has so recently demonstrated).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor permanent changes in angular momentum, like counteracting external torques, you have to interact with something external to the spacecraft -- expelled RCS propellant mass and the Earth\u0027s magnetic field being the favorites, and RCS tends to be the practical option for manned craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I thought of a good metaphor: Wheels let you borrow angular momentum for a while, over and over, but with a rather low credit limit. RCS makes you buy it every time. So if you only need it for a little while (say, to change which star your telescope is pointing at, which you\u0027re going to want to do a hell of lot of times), you borrow it from a wheel. But if you need to keep it (because your solar panels are asymmetric and you need to keep that antenna pointed at Earth), you won\u0027t be able to pay it back, so you buy it through RCS and pay with propellant. If you won\u0027t be operating for long, it can be simpler to just bring a fatter wallet full of propellant than to set up a credit account with the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T02:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s nothing wrong with calling it delta-L.
