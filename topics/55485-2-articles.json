I\u0027ve decided that I don\u0027t like the toolbar plugin, so I\u0027ve removed it completely from my directory. However, since doing that, there is now no Crew Manifest button showing up anywhere. Is the toolbar a REQUIREMENT? The OP seems to indicate that it\u0027s optional, but if it\u0027s now required, that would suck because I REALLY don\u0027t like Toolbar. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, ever since updating to 0.23, as well as trying and then removing toolbar, I can\u0027t save anything in the VAB or SPH. Well I can save, the save button works, but at the top center of the screen where you type the name of the vehicle, and can also write a description, there is no black text area, and no text within it, not even \u0027Untitled Space Craft\u0027. If I click on the area it \u0027pulls down\u0027 the gray text entry window, but I still can\u0027t type anything. The only reason I bring this up here is that I had this same problem a few weeks ago, BEFORE KSP v0.23, and it seemed to be caused by the version of the Toolbar plugin combined with CrewManifest that I tried then. At least, it stopped doing that when I removed Toolbar. But that was before. As I said, this time the problem persists even when I\u0027ve removed Toolbar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould there be something in CrewManifest that\u0027s causing this? I mean, maybe there\u0027s something about the way it interacts with 0.23.
