it can take some time but the jetpack is not necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, if you\u0027re in space, rescuing your Kerbal is less of a maths-intensive issue and more a matter of fine docking control.\u00A0 Since you\u0027ve managed to expend an entire jetpack\u0027s worth of fuel, I\u0027ll also guess that you have not yet learned the finer points of rendezvous and docking ... which means that most likely, the ship you exited for your EVA is not equipped to perform the rescue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s okay; it just means that you have a new mission.\u00A0 Before you go much farther, it would be a good idea to go into the map view and see whether your Kerbal is going to fall into something\u0027s atmosphere.\u00A0 If so, then it may not be possible to effect a rescue in time, and you may need to accept that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, I\u0027m going to assume the worst case that your Kerbal came out of a single-seat command pod and\u00A0the ship is now uncontrollable, but that both are in a stable orbit.\u00A0 That\u0027s okay, too:\u00A0 it means that you can do two rescue missions.\u00A0 In the meantime, it gives you the time to learn how to complete those missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I\u0027m going to give you a list of places to look for rendezvous and docking help.\u00A0 You may need to build new ships in order to work on this--and if you need to do so, there\u0027s nothing wrong with starting a new sandbox save so that you don\u0027t also have to worry about funding your own training.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St515zjUZHY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScott Manley\u0027s 2014 Docking and Rendezvous Video\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arsC-_RPD54\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOrb8ter\u0027s 2017 (version 1.2) Rendezvous and Docking Tutorial Video\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq0xL3uM6cQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELithobreaking Works\u0027s 2018 Rendezvous and Docking Tutorial Video\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are all YouTube videos;
