Shooting a small space station in orbit of Kerbin about 200km up isn\u0027t one either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on the moon however, has proven to be very fuel consuming.

It certainly helps, but there is something very inefficient in my current design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage consists of a bunch of boosters (liquid and solids). The solids burn faster than the liquids, so I want to dump them as soon as they\u0027re out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it won\u0027t cut loose the solids till the liquids are out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong in the staging?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final objective is putting a small self-sustaining base on the moon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T22:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome back : )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make sure you have a stage (stages) that separate(s) boosters.

All the engines of the stage that can start, should start right away, that means BOTH boosters AND the stage they are boosting (the engine(s) in the middle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Make sure that after you separate the boosters (and the core keeps working), the core had exhausted its fuel enough (ie is already light enough) to keep accelerating your craft well when you jettison the boosters. The starting stage core must not work much longer than its boosters, ie you drop the boosters, another 30 sec to 1 min, you ditch that stage too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Forget the solid boosters. The best booster is a tank and an engine. When you are at the end of the tech tree, the best \u0022booster\u0022 is an orange tank with a Mainsail feeding off it. Earlier on, it is a stack of a couple of medium tanks, with the most powerful engine you can stick at the bottom of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep on asking, that\u0027s how you get to boldly go where you have never gone before : )\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
