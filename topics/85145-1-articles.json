Its clunky, slow (pages rather than a scroll... ick), and the shear number of parts makes a visual labyrinth that is easy to get lost in. I find myself looking over the part I want two and three times even though I have played the game for a little over a year now and am more or less acquainted to where each should appear in the menus. The current organization scheme of Pods, Control, Structure, etc I feel doesn\u0027t go far enough. There doesn\u0027t seem to be a particular order that the parts appear in the menu other than parts that are similar in function will appear in the same tab. Also some parts are not classified correctly, such as the ion engine or Hitchhiker Storage Container. Seems to me those should be in Propulsion and Pods respectively, not Utility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I would personally like to see. In each tab, group each part by its exact function (and part size for those that are particularly numerous like fuel tanks) into a labelled sub-menu.
