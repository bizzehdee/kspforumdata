First, because each scanner masses 0.1 or 0.2 tons, and secondly because you need power generation and storage to handle those scanners\u0027 operation.

Every time a \u0022get science from X\u0022 mission comes up, I can complete them for no additional cost. I\u0027ve even got a pair (satellite\u002Blander) on the way to Duna right now, which\u0027ll make the money come in even more quickly. And instead of hiring kerbonauts, I\u0027ve got a fleet of tiny recovery vessels orbiting Kerbin\u0027s equator to rescue any stranded folks (which also pays nicely).
