And textures are the actual resource hogs in the mods for KSP, not the models themselves.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is true. In actuality, each tank will have several different textures (LFO/Monoprop/Kethane/etc..) associated with it. I\u0027m most certainly an amateur at this, but it was my understanding that one of the major benefits of the loading system introduces in 0.20 was that when used this way, KSP would only have to load each model once and could use several different cfgs to apply different stats/textures. I suppose that someone (way better at UV Mapping than I am) could create a texture map that would work on all 3 tanks, but that is way beyond my skill level. The only other way I see to accomplish what I believe you are asking is to only have one model and rescale it to the other 2 sizes. Then it would be one texture for all 3 tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027m a complete novice, so I could be completely wrong about this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Audiopulse","CreatedById":8838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T15:41:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this pack compatible with .21 now?
