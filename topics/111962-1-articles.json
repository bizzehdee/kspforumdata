Widespread use of the klaw, in ways that are clearly not intended, is clearly cheating. Cheat if you want to, however, cheating isn\u0027t actually wrong in a single player, non-competitive, open ended sandbox game. Denying that it is cheating, on the other hand, that\u0027s either/both delusional and wrong. In this type of game, it is not the game\u0027s responsibility to prevent you from cheating, or even make it difficult to cheat; it is entirely the player\u0027s responsibility to avoid cheating if they want to honestly claim that they achieved something without the use of cheats. The simple test for me, is that if it\u0027s completely unrealistic, or using parts in highly unreasonable ways, then it\u0027s clearly cheating (and using the klaw for anything other than debris and asteroids is both unrealistic and unreasonable, with very few exceptions, although exceptions to that are possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny attempt by Squad to prevent cheating, other than as an incidental thing that happens as part of fixing real bugs or enhancing intended functionality, would be a very bad thing for the game, as the lack of restrictions are a major positive feature. If you use the klaw because docking ports are \u0022too hard\u0022, or you\u0027re too lazy to do it right, I\u0027ll always view 100% of your progress/achievements/success while using it in that way as fundamentally devalued, or even worthless and invalid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, docking ports really are not that hard at all, even with just stock controls and indicators, as long as you go slow during docking and have RCS available.
