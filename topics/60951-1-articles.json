If you transfer your purchase to Steam, you will no longer be able to download or update the game from the KSPStore, but also nobody\u0027s forcing you to go to Steam, if you opt not to transfer, you can still download and update the game as usual. To move to Steam, log in to your KSPStore profile and you will find the button to start the process next to your download link. Again please note that you will only be eligible for a transfer if you purchased the game before it was on Steam, no exceptions, please don\u0027t insist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T19:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe you could only get a steam key if you purchased the game before a certain date: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, only customers who bought the game before it was available on Steam, the deadline is March 20th 2013 at 1:00 pm GMT -6:00\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EAfter that point you should buy the game on steam if you want it through steam.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven2099","CreatedById":78661,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T18:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks... i might purchase the KPS for steam separately that way i can has it either way... it\u0027s worth it\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
