You might have Smokescreen installed and that is claimed to be 1.1 updated but it is not. If your crafts have custom\u00A0engine effects they will go bonkers inside the VAB and also they might not fire real thrust on the pad. \u00A0This should be addressed due to many mods using moduleEnginesFX and this gets effected. What parts packs do you have?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
