Or you could use whack-a-kerbal to knock that part off, and just pretend your brave kerbals MacGyver\u0027ed it off using a spare oxygen tank and a bobby pin. Also, if you try launching with the rocket turned off, move the fuel in that tank into the others, to keep the centre of mass as close to the centre as you can. With the lower fuel and thrust you may not be able to get all the way back to Kerbin, but if your lucky you\u0027ll make orbit, which will simplify any rescue missions, as long as you can rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bit_reaper","CreatedById":107184,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T15:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts duna meaning its very low grav so it not like you need a lot of thrust to get the thing in orbit.

It looks like you could still have a high enough TWR if you used just the two engines.

Right click the engine that is unbalanced and click shutdown. Then alt-right click the main center tank followed by alt-right clicking the fuel tank with the shutdown engine. Transfer whatever fuel you can out of the tank we aren\u0027t using. This will help with the center of mass problem, and give you more available fuel to the remaining engines. Now you can trim the pitch/yaw a bit to counter for the extra weight of the now dead tank/engine by holding down ALT and using AWSD depending on which side is dead. It looks like the rear engine is dead? If that\u0027s correct then I would hold ALT-W until the pitch is trimmed about halfway , to the next full line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour craft is now flyable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziff","CreatedById":27566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T15:59:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMight be better balanced to tweak the odd engines thrust way down rather than disabling it completely.

Once that main center tank is empty the one pair of engines at full thrust will use fuel quicker, causing yet another weight imbalance.
