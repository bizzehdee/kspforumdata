I remember him from playing the old micro-boardgame \u003Cem\u003EOgre\u003C/em\u003E back in high school in the late 70s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut later, after the internet had been invented, I found myself accidentally bumping into \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehis web presence\u003C/a\u003E, again and again, following the most random paths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. First, of course, I wanted to see his \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/ogre.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOgre artwork\u003C/a\u003E I remembered so fondly from decades ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Later, I was looking for some 3D starmaps. Yep, he has \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/starmaps/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esome of those too\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Another time I went looking for a web-based slide-rule simulator. Oh hey, Chung has \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/antique.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elinks to those\u003C/a\u003E, and other antique instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. As a kid I had a model of the USS Leif Ericsen, a spaceship designed by Matt Jeffries, who also designed Star Trek\u0027s Enterprise. I went web-hunting for pictures of it, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/leifstub.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EChung had that, too.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I am into constructed languages, and one of those that caught my interest was \u003Cstrong\u003ELojban\u003C/strong\u003E, which appeared in Heinlein\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EThe Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\u003C/em\u003E. Went looking for info on that and....I found myself on a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/lojban.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWinchell Chung page\u003C/a\u003E devoted to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.

I\u0027ve been there plenty of times before, but I actually didn\u0027t realize that was Chung until now. Doh!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. I recall running into another of his pages when I searched for information on Celtic knots...but I can\u0027t find that page any more, so maybe I\u0027m misremembering this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the take-away is that I find my tastes curiously similar to Chung\u0027s.
