Requiring an entirely separate texture for the tanks.\n\nAlso pretty sure black paint isn\u0027t magical heat resistant material, or that any engineer in their right mind would cover spacecraft with heavy foam to protect against crashing. Mainly because the solution is to simply not crash.

The max takeoff weight of a 747 is around 440,000kg (970,000Lb), which is only 0.1% of the weight of a fully loaded aircraft.\n\nI was writing a post of how several coatings could be used to assist in the thermal and structural performance of parts; but I was failing at finding a problem that would justify their inclusion. Unless some other feature is included as a substantial problem to be worked around, I doubt that adding coatings and configurable reinforcement of parts would add much to the game."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T22:05:04Z","Content":"Thermal protection comes from *slabs* of ablative materials, ceramic/metal tiles, or actively cooled structures. A mere coating of paint is essentially worthless for such applications.\n\nAs for foam insulation, that\u0027s only used to reduce boiloff of cyrogenically-cooled fuel from the tanks, and given the typical impact velocities of falling/discarded parts, foam insulation offers next-to-no additional crash protection."},{"CreatedByName":"Dooz","CreatedById":74263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T23:37:10Z","Content":"I changed somethings around to make much more sense, Now \u0027black paint\u0027 called thermal tiles and added a new type of foam and removed the protection foam. now called Different types of protection for defined Parts"}]}
