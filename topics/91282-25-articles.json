Produced by fractionation, the exact end composition depends on the source of the crude/heavier fraction. It is impossible to boil off single substances, small proportions of other substances will always be present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo help illustrate - you know how when sometimes you cook with alcohol - like with wine or something? And someone will say something like \u0022The alcohol boils off.\u0022 Well, this isn\u0027t really true. If you boil wine, or some other alcohol/water solution, the boiling points are so close together that you essentially boil them both off at the same time with the proportionally smaller components boiling off proportionally slower - in other words you *are* boiling off the alcohol, but the rate at which water boils off too pretty much cancels it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilar thing happens in a fractionating column when manufacturing petrol - the idea is that you seperate out things that are pretty much similar to octane, what you end up with is something that is mostly octane, but is in fact a mixture of a range of similar chain lengths and branching arrangements, cyclics etc..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelated note - this goes some way to explain why petrol comes with an \u0022octane rating\u0022, a measure of how easily the fluid will ignite, as compared to a sample of pure octane.\u00A0Petrol is not pure octane, but it is useful to know how close to octane it will behave. An octane rating is quite closely related to the percentage of octane present, but due to the varying nature of the mix, not an exact match. But it is more than enough to know that it will ignite under such-and-such conditions and liberate X-amount of joules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-11T13:21:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2016 01:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by p1t1o\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T13:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s even more complex than that, because product of simple fractional distillation (usually called naptha)\u00A0won\u0027t run a modern engine, the octane rating is too low.

Most of the red-shifted stuff can only be seen by telescopes built after the 1920s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis that appear redder in the deep field, such as Hubble Deep Field, appear redder because they are moving, specifically, away from us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore importantly we are moving away from them those stars are emitting light of one frequency, similar to our sun and we are observing another frequency. If you take an absorption line from hydrogen in the corona of a star, it means you have frequencies of light above and below.\u00A0 But light can only travel one speed independent of the observer, what happens is that the wavelength we observe, moving away from that star, increases. More importantly its frequency decreases, this makes sense because light is an energy delivery system, if we move away we get less energy per unit time. But this is distorted by quantum mechanics, we observe E = hv. So what we see is the frequencies above and below the absorption line decrease, they have less energy. That is the wave quality of light, but since when we detect light we only detect photons, thus the individual photons have less energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings get redder with distance, at least for a while, if the universe is accelerating or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me explain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a thing called the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. The radiation resulted when protons and electrons combined, it was one of the most powerful light events the universe puts forth, had you been there you would have been instantly blinded and cooked by the light, but from our point of view all the sources have moved to the edge of the visible universe and because it has spread so far its now really dim. In fact the CMBR defines the edge of the visible universe. This is important because the Universe is tremendously bigger than the observable universe at least 5 times probably much more, but the sphere defined by the CMBR when it was emitted was tremendously small, it was about a 100th of the size we perceive it to be now, this is because space has expanded. Expanded is the key word, because the expansion implies some aspect of momentum of the massive objects within, the stuff inbetween space-time is expanding. Not an explosion or bang, just material drift and the workings of space-time. The bang part of space is that which preceded the CMBR\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese proton-electron couplings emitted ultraviolet light, but this happened at points along a radiating surface (the virtual object that is the shell of our visible universe) at such an radial angular displacement from us that as they are moving outward such as to move away from us. They are moving outward and we are moving outward; everything is embedded in space-time moving outward, even supermassive black holes and this the landmarks of the universe, galaxies, are generally moving away from each other. By the time the high frequency radiation reaches us, from our perspective, it is red shifted so much so that its in the microwave part of the spectrum. These photons have been traveling through different comoving space-times for 13.8 billion of our years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully that was not too confusing. That CMBR is relatively uniform across all the observable sky. And if the universe exploded, then this radiation would not be uniform, it would be shaped like a\u00A0 edge of the head of a cauliflower propagated to cover an entire surface. So prior to expansion scientist have inserted a thing called Cosmic Inflation, this occurred from the central point (they replace this word because it implies something, distance, that may not have existed, with a word called a singularity, to imply its quantum nature and lack of space-time) in fact the only point, of all mass momentum in the universe, a place we cannot either detect or our travel relative to it. The reason we cannot detect it is that during inflation every point moves away from every other point at a rate consistent with distance and time (space-time), it is in fact the point in the evolution when space-time formed (quantum gravity that held the singularity, held being a faux because it implies time, which did not exist), before that our measures of distance and time cease to help us. As a consequence every perspective in \u003Cem\u003Eour visible universe\u003C/em\u003E seems to see itself as the center of that universe, the center of the expansion. From this perspective we are not accelerating from each other or are we?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo according to classical/relativistic physics, such a universe has mass and mass energy equivalents, its rate of expansion should slow dependent on the mass of the entire universe, massive objects attract each other. But the Hubble Deep Field observations revealed that when you get away from the Milky Way about 5 billion light years, deductions of star sizes in galaxies shows that more distance stars are moving away faster than an inflation drift model would predict. The apparent force or faux tensor in the drift model is that energy equivalents(mass and energy) in space time causes it to try to contract, just as the pulse from two merging black holes cause a measurable flex in space-time observed recently. Some other tensor, dark energy, is superseding that force, as a consequence there is a faster acceleration seen. The idea is about 8 billion years after expansion started, the universe started ever so slowly inflating, space-time between galaxies started to move apart at a faster rate. Its not really clear if this is uniform, or only occurs in the most evacuated parts of space, but it was a major game changer in the last 15 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in summary, what we \u0027see\u0027 when you turn the Hubble on the deepest objects in space, and rf antennas looking at the background radiation is a shell first of early galaxies, and then early hydrogen of a sphere that is inside a sphere of unknown size that is our Universe which the \u0027big-bang\u0027 formed. The only thing we can really say, is that the sphere that we can see was once very much smaller, initially expanded outward at a rate consistent with the laws regarding space-time but then, much later, began to accelerate outward. There is a common belief that because space-time is expanding because of two unknown processes, inflation and \u003Cem\u003Edark energy (infusion),\u00A0 \u003C/em\u003Ethe only thing that we can know is that things \u0027currently\u0027 many billions of light years away (the future generations of stars whose galaxies we see in the deepest of the deep-field) were once so close that from a physical point of view they and us were virtually superimposed. But that belief has to be tempered against the basic fact that we cannot observe anything earlier than the CMBR, and that occurred several hundred thousand years after inflation ended, and many models have all kinds of bizarre, exotic things happening in between.*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Some scientist suggest, that with proper experiments we can see neutrinos from before CMBR, and it might be possible to say something about the exotic material that came into our universe at our earlier time. The general believe is that exotic material eventually decayed into a prolonged dance between matter anti-matter annihilations and high energy gamma formation. At some point our visible universe became filled with matter (not anti-matter), protons, electrons, a few neutrons. These later combined to form atoms and molecules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-26T16:34:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2016 04:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T21:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found a thing\u00A0on Google Earth and I don\u0027t know what it is.
