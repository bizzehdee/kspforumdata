Okay, long list of answers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@cardgame:\u003C/strong\u003E Nose cones have done that since the drag fix was first implemented. Currently (because it\u0027s really simple) the parts add a fixed amount of drag based on the number of open stack nodes. Try building a plane with two fuel tanks on the wings. Now put nose cones on one, and none on the other. Start forward, and it\u0027ll start to yaw towards the one with nose cones (mass offset) until it gets up to speed, at which point it\u0027ll yaw the other way (more drag). Or try building a plane with no nose cones, and then add them and compare. If I remember correctly, the large nose cone is better for slower speeds, the combination of smaller nose cone with the adapter is better for supersonic stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@theflyingfish:\u003C/strong\u003E Request granted retroactively through all versions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Volt and Mariner:\u003C/strong\u003E It doesn\u0027t automatically take effect because there are a large number of static quantities the need to be known about the wing before the lift can be properly calculated. There is a part.cfg template in the readme. You can look at the existing part.cfgs and try to extend that, it uses Prandtl\u0027s Lifting Line theory for most of the calculations, or you can read below at my answer to Xune, since he asked something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@requimar:\u003C/strong\u003E There is a large button at the top of the main control panel that should minimize it all.

Found that it was very sensitive and I didn\u0027t think it was all that fun. So my suggestion here to make things more interesting is adding overheating as a element. Basically trying to take of at 100% will blow your plane up, so you have to dial it back a bit and beware of the temperature and wait for some more speed for cooling. Only when in the correct altitude/speed range can you really floor it! But then if you are going too fast (over 3.5 or something) you start to heat up again, so that the speed limit isn\u0027t really how much thrust you have but your cooling capacity. In my mind, this will make pushing ever greater speeds more exiting because if you\u0027re not on top of it, the plane will blow to bits. Of course this is mostly only relevant to the ramjet category and perhaps a bit for the \u0022normal\u0022 engines. The turbofans should be easy to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway just my 2 cents, and I\u0027m no jet engine expert anyhow so I might just be plain wrong \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CAPFlyer","CreatedById":8575,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T19:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Boojah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Boojah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI see!\u003Cp\u003EHowever my opinion is still that they are too weak.

This bug was probably due to the optimization of nonlinear supersonic flow, which probably needs some more tweaking. That said, if anyone else happens to like bringing space shuttles or winged missiles down from orbit, I would greatly appreciate any and all data that anyone can come up with this.

Just one thing for now: you say that there isn\u0027t much room for ramjets or similar engines because the mach range is a bit constrained on Kerbin, and this is true. But, have you considered just lowering the speed of sound to, say, 250 m/s? Everything is \u0022scaled\u0022 on Kerbin anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
