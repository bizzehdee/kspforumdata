Am\u00A0i wrong in my assumption that this should show no lift?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then, it does other strange thing,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShot:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221XO3czq.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1XO3czq.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere, i just rotated the whole ring, going by the previous shot, lift should point down, but It now point to the side, at the root part.So, if i place it \u0022lying down\u0022 like the first shots, and then upright, i get different lift vector. Could well be me missing something obvious, but i do not get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i decided to try and place back my lift vector where i wanted it with wings inside the ring, got there:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShot:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022faKXRjm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/faKXRjm.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLift looks pretty straight up. with a backward angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact is, the craft does not fly like the vector is there at all, as soon as it get a bit of speed, it push hard toward the direction opposite the root part, like the lift is now offset to a side it never show in the editor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, am i wrong in assuming that the ring should produce neutral lift vector?

And i placed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters evenly over the fuselage in the hope of getting enough attitude control to offset the problems, did not worked.Then i attached elevon on the backside, they helped a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get it that this will be a really really draggy thing and that it maybe should not really fly, but it is so close too doing it i\u0027m sure i can get there with a bit of help.
