It works up to 1.10.1 but have tried it in 1.11.2 and something has happened now that the Kerbals have the new system that allows them to remove the things on their backs. Sinking and rising are much slower and now instead of swimming flat at a neutral buoyancy, they instead stay at whatever height they are above land. Which means that they will follow a slope down if it is going down, maintaining height above land but going deeper underwater or vice versa if going up. Is there any way that it could be patched so that they react in water the way they did in 1.10.1 please?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dientus","CreatedById":209823,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-15T13:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tested in 1.11.2 yet but this is something I can agree with.
