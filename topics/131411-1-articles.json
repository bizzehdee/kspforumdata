I was thinking Mk0 with 3 wing connector d\u0027s angled into each other\u00A0on each side and offset slightly into Mk0 fuselage. They\u00A0could possibly fit into normal Mk2 cargo bays, but I cannot try it now. Tell me what you think about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THE NARWHAL","CreatedById":138145,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T02:04:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTweakscale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spacemandude10","CreatedById":158085,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T15:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno, stock game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...cause, I dunno...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSCIENCE\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spacemandude10","CreatedById":158085,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T19:19:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand\u00A0using tweakscale kinda takes the fun out of it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
