You can see Bill and Lisa in the background of Val\u0027s and Jeb\u0027s shots. This is a really cool detail... and a continuity headache for me, for example if I want to use a shot where Jeb has the perfect reaction face, but we can see Lisa behind him and she\u0027s not in the cockpit for that scene. \n\nAnd yes, of course I pasted in the fourth portrait for this image.
