I add controll surfaces...I try different engines. I ain\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t gettig them off. I played Il-2, I played Lock on...it has to be a design problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I hit a mun orbit by pure accident. I wanted to try how fast I can get my nuke-engine stage, but oh hey mun comes in the way, let\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s just go there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I tried an interplanetary design I saw on this page. I built it as closeto the picture as I could. However the lower stages always blew up at 40000m. Then came the descent. Fun thing is that in all my 10 attempts I could get the nuke-stage to strafe perfectly vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven when I seperated and deployed the chute that thing would slowly sail down, perfectly erect......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hillstache","CreatedById":47444,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T14:37:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn .16 there was a bug with the way the fuel flow rate was calculated, so if you were not at full thrust it was underflowing the fuel. That could be one of your issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the planes, have you tried loading any of the supplied planes? Maybe work on flying them, then modifying them to suit your ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen your rocket explodes during launch the most likely culprit is too much thrust. As the rocket burns it\u0027s fuel off the thrust to weight ratio goes up. One way you can keep an eye on how hard it\u0027s thrusting is to check the G meter to the right of the nav ball. I try to keep it under 3 and thus avoid pretty explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying, and welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coldfinger008","CreatedById":51164,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T15:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried the Aeris3. I can fly it, but it of course can\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t get outside of the atmosphere. So I exactly replaced the main engine with a vector rocket and 800 fuel units.

Let\u0027s assume you have a plane that has a total of 10 lift points, is going down the runway at 100 m/s and the wings are angled at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Therefore, as far as I\u0027ve been able to tell, it is a product of total lift (10) velocity (100 m/s) and your angle of attack vs your velocity vector (which at runway is 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore: 10*100*(141) = 141,000 lift ability. I don\u0027t really know if that is the exact number, or if there is a constant I need to be applying somewhere. All I know is that the angle of attack vs. your velocity vector is what produces lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coldfinger008","CreatedById":51164,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T13:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs that the number of weight units being neutralized?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what exactly is meant, the angle of the forward edge of the wing, or really the horizontal angle in which the wing profile is situated?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tauge","CreatedById":39280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T14:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d suggest taking your question to either How to or General Forums, simply because you\u0027ll get far more eyeballs there than here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
