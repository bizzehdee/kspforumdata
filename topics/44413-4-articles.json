I think though it shows how to use an engine for multiple purposes (as the author stated in his post) it might also encourage the newbie pilot to use the LV-N for everything. This is of course the pilot\u0027s choice, but I prefer a design that highlights the strengths of different engines. Furthermore, this has fuel tanks below the engine flowing upward to the craft. The craft is built around the LV-N which is unconventional. The root part is the docking port and I doubt newbies will even be able to realize this. I find that if this craft were in an \u0022Advanced Stock Craft\u0022 Challenge, I might rate it higher generally. For these purposes though, I rate it very low.

It is my favorite because it uses serial staging, hides the engine and fuel tanks, and makes it all look pretty. This is actually more difficult than one might think to do with stock parts and I like that it went the unconventional way. Giggle was very close to second IMO for much the same reasons. In the end Karacoma won because I think designing size 2 vehicles to require a little more skill to pull of right and therefore the Newbie would benefit more from a nicely done 2-stage, size 2 lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022antbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022antbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only cast one vote, it would have to be for \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EAmpsterMan\u003C/span\u003E.
