Well, it\u0027s been two weeks since this:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ho70DT1Fvdw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSo far I haven\u0027t noticed much of any change, which led me to another question. Who here on the forums joined due to seeing KSP on a popular Youtube channel, and which channel? I didn\u0027t, though probably would have if I had discovered KSP that way. I think it\u0027s really been a blessing for squad, I\u0027d like to think they have a big impact and spread the word quite a lot.I would think the channels with the biggest impact would be ones that already have a good fan base from playing other-games, as they introduce a lot of people to it. Compared to channels that are more KSP exclusive, and as a result likely have a fan base that is mostly already comprised of KSP players. Though likely have a big impact in keeping those viewers active in playing the game/contributing to the community."},{"CreatedByName":"ekim98","CreatedById":82180,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T19:17:12Z","Content":"Macey dean got me in.
