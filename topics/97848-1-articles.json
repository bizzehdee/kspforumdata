I limited the thrust to 40% on the engine, then went full speed 0/45/0 (after rotating the craft in the vicinity of the right direction. I never had to touch the throttle as it never went over terminal velocity. I jetted up to about 15K, then turned to 20 degrees AoA, then at 19K I dropped it to 10 degrees AoA. After that I just left, baked a bread and occasionally hit F5 whenever I passed the screen. 40 minutes in I had to change my direction 355 degrees because I ran out of land. I could\u0027ve done better if I changed direction earlier. That way I wouldn\u0027t run out of land before reaching the north pole. Though I don\u0027t think I can get quite that far, not within the rules limitations anyway. Using more wing surface and maybe 1 or 2 extra intakes I could make it all the way out to the pole with just 40 fuel, simply by flying higher and faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Groot","CreatedById":136191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T22:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll just leave this here, 3000 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gxYWmxn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gxYWmxn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ihtoit","CreatedById":78942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T22:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Einteresting, but why do you have oxidizer space and why can\u0027t we see your aircraft design?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoioh","CreatedById":118116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T22:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention the lack of a safe landing. and 48K altitude with the one intake is never going to cut it.

It is kind of strange that Jeb gets killed at 00:00:00 though. But drag minimization is really the key here. In stock atmosphere that means flying as high as possible, using ram intakes (most intake area per unit drag), and lowering the weight. Only one intake, as per the rules. If I\u0027m reading between the lines correctly, the cockpit is mandatory but the wings are optional? I didn\u0027t use the maximum number of wings. Only the two delta winglets and one small control surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my entry. 8294 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst picture is on the runway after bleeding off fuel.
