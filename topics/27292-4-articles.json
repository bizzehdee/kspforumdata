I was trying to decide whether to do Bop, Tylo or Pol yesterday and suddenly thought, why not all three! So I\u0027ve launched three craft one after the other into orbit then done the transfer burns one at a time.\u003Cp\u003EIt was actually a fascinating experiment - they all left LKO within about 6 hours of each other. They all tried to get their burn point at the same position, yet small variations in when I started my burn have led to dramatically different transfers. One managed to get a near perfect transfer with an encounter at the apoapsis immediately, and when I corrected the normal/anti normal later it dropped into an awesome 300,000m approach with no extra work - my best transfer ever I think. The other two I somehow messed up a bit and had to spend 400 and 550 delta v fixing the approach - amazing considering they craft all had basically the same start. The arrival times also differ dramatically, with the \u0027worst\u0027 transfer arriving first, the other bad one about 8 days later and the best one nearly 2 weeks after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway when I left it last night, the first one had arrived (least fuel left), aerobraked at Jool and encountered Pol and is now sitting in orbit waiting to land. The second arrived in the middle of all this so I had to juggle the two (middle fuel). The second has just reached Bop orbit and is ready to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight the third will arrive (most fuel) and head for Tylo then I\u0027ll land all three. I\u0027m 100% confident in the Bop/Pol landings (infact I should be able to land some 20 times over) but the Tylo one worries me. Not 100% convinced it will land at all. If it can but doesn\u0027t have the fuel I have some tanks around Laythe, so will be able to top it up first, we\u0027ll see. It\u0027s TWR is a bit low for Tylo though so I\u0027ll just have to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t have much time last night, but I landed on Pol and had a nice drive around... fell down a mountain for about 6 km without touching land which was fun. Then landed on Bop, but as I keep all but my mapping satellites stock I have to try and figure out anomalies by the terrain. Think I got it totally wrong and have landed some 60km away on a similar terrain feature so started the drive. Tylo craft is now a day or two from arrival so tonight I\u0027ll see if it can land. Still not convinced it\u0027ll be able to on its current fuel, so a refuel from my Laythe station may be necessary. Only 80% sure it\u0027ll be able to land even on full tanks mind you :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T07:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis evening I launched three collections of hardware into Kerbin orbit, then launched three nuclear tugs into orbit to dock with them.
