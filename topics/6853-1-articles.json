Not sure what exactly caused it because i didnt read the mission log. Either an engine broke but didnt fall off, or i shouldnt throttle full speed when leaving the mun \u0026gt;_\u0026gt; (the lander did go straight until i disabled SAS to steer it if i remember right...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTAGES:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.Start all engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.Separate Outta-atmosphere stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Separate orbiting stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.Fire parachutes (for landing back to kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.Separate command module (in case you didnt have fuel to slow down the mun lander by about 20 m/s to land on kerbin.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOW TO FLY:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.Fire engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Fly up until apoapsis (the higher one if i remember right -.-) is at 60-70k, you might want to tilt the craft to 45 dergees around 25-40k or something\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.When apoapsis is at 60-70k, go horizontal (separate the outta-atmosphere-stage when it runs out of fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.Make an orbit like normally\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.TMI or watever acronym takes you to the mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.10k orbit around mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.Slow down to full stop over a nice flat crater in sunlight (at this point the orbiting stage should be out of fuel already... (make sure its an almost perfectly straight drop unless you want to fix dem horizontal velocity and spend half of the fuel doing that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.Fall until around 2-3k meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.Full throttle until you go slowly enough to not crash\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.Land slowly, stop all horizontal velocity using RCS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.Land rly slowly (The wings shouldnt break that easily, but im not sure if the engines get hit or something)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12.When you touch the ground press X T and R to shut everything down so it wont start bouncing or something :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13.Leave for kerbin (i think you should accelerate slowly so the craft wont go crazy like it did with me. Could the winglets cause it going nuts?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14.Hit kerbin atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15.Activate parachutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16.When near to ground slow down until its less than 10 m/s or so (for water, for ground a lot slower, like you were landing on mun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E17.If something goes wrong separate command module from lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ek?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and there is plenty of space for another stage or 2 if you stick it in the spaces (maybe 1 more stage fits on the sides, might need to move it a bit so it wont crash to launch tower) and you could add vertical stages too :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dannyboy1238","CreatedById":13488,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-20T23:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eawesome thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
