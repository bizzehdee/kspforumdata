The other thing about the greenhouse-only strategy is that it is falls exactly into the \u0022put a part on it\u0022 pitfall. You don\u0027t have to think about weight or logistical trade-offs or optimizing your ship design or\u00A0mission profile to make it work, you just put a greenhouse on it.\u00A0There\u0027s also the matter of creating a huge tech-tree bottleneck with\u00A0no middle step.

When I was first thinking about this last year I was thinking along the lines of TAC with multiple resources and using converters to make water and O2 and yada yada yada and things got crazy complicated fast. The only way I think it works gameplay wise\u00A0is if things are kept really simple and abstract. With USI there are no resources on board, Kerbals just have a 15 day \u0027hungry\u0027 state before they \u0027go on strike\u0027 and won\u0027t eva or do anything\u00A0until you resupply them. It works, and gives a softer consequence than permadeath, but Im not 100% sure its more intuitive than adding a small amount of life support to each module by default. Hard to say. To my mind its nice if new players have a sensible way of being introduced to life support requirements without getting overwhelmed or frustrated. Its nice if they have some leeway to get into orbit for a while or go to the Mun without having to worry too much about it. Once they are going to Minmus or looking for asteroids they should have a sense of\u00A0\u0022Okay I need to pack more food\u0022, and once they\u0027re putting up permanent stations and heading for Duna its time to get real and think about recyclers and greenhouses. There\u0027s more to it than all that, and all of this should really follow some better mission planning tools and mission time estimators, but I really do think it could add a lot to the game someday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T03:11:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do realize in tac recyclers don\u0027t pay for them selves until you have 9 kerbals for more then 8 years.

My point is that to preserve the fun factor, we don\u0027t need to be carrying around 50 tons of food and water on our 2 year journeys, there are ways of implementing life support in this game without being frustrating.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion, I think life support can add tons of little immersion features into the game such as waste dumps that we can see every few minutes coming out of crew pods that crystallize and become dust in the vacuum of space. Maybe even show kerbals eating in the crew pods once and a while or even drinking liquids floating in the crew pods. Going to the toilet. Exercising. Sleeping.

Given that vessels aren\u0027t bogging down until they get above a few hundred parts and Unity 5 is likely to double that 2 or 3 parts doesn\u0027t really seem like a huge worry to me.
