I took a copy of the Muna 2 craft and copied it into a sandbox game I have. Rocket came up normal in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and flew normal when launched. Staging occurred correctly. I added a part to the rocket and saved the file, then removed it and re-saved. I did this so it was saved under my current 1.7.whatever version I run now - the latest one, in other words. Changed the name of the rocket in the mission folder to Muna 2a and then copied the new save from the sandbox back to the mission folder. Same problem upon load.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext, I tried to edit the mission file. I noticed that Muna 2 had a field checked labeled \u0027Focus on Vessel\u0027 upon spawn that Muna 1 did not have. Unfortunately, I created a new copy of the mission in User Creations instead of overwriting the stock mission file. The \u0027new\u0027 user mission has no progress recorded for it. Getting to Phase 2 of the mission takes awhile, so I\u0027ll save testing that for another day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI placed a copy of the folder on my desktop, altered it\u0027s name and deleted the folder from the Making History/Missions/ folder. Upon verifying my files, it was restored to my install. The rocket still came up discombobulated, so I\u0027m still trying workarounds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TK421","CreatedById":127722,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-08T05:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know anything about this? I\u0027m having the same issue.
