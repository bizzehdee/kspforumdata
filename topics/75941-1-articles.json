It should load faster and physics should work better with it. Internal parts of the model (near the central hub) have almost all been converted to convex hulls. It is still not possible to roll the torus like a gigantic wheel but it should be able to contact the ground without going through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Station habitat model has been converted to a convex hull. This means you can\u0027t put things inside the \u0022courtyard\u0022 anymore but it should not bug a torus build if you build one with Extraplanetary Launchpads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- New 3 meter solid rocket booster (shown above)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The large fuel storage container now has a collider (so you can click it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- New small station fuel cell in the same model as the small station cargo bay.

I feel this keeps the challenge without making it too tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stanford Torus Hull now has a structural integrity field. All ships within 2km of it are forced off rails (including kerbals) to prevent rail collisions from destroying the station.

Switching from Kethane to Karbonite makes building the torus easier. I also focused on adding properly sized solar panels for the torus and the ground base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar panels: New large sized panels. They come in moderately large and colossal. These panels were created to produce the same power output as a similarly sized unfolding panel but to remove the polygon and collision mesh count associated with those. With these you can power your base without slowing time down. These panels are heavier than normal panels though. The colossal size is 42 tons. That won\u0027t matter much on a stanford torus though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UkGs6Bo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UkGs6Bo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3j8LCCn.png\u0022 alt=\u00223j8LCCn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaser smelters: There\u0027s one for ore and one for Karbonite. The laser smelters I created purely out of the desire for a processor to look cool while doing something mundane. They may also make processes for getting ore converted to metal slightly easier. The Karbonite smelter has the same package but different color of laser output. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/So3Kmy5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022So3Kmy5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass accelerator: The mass accelerator continues the exploration of a stanford torus build. In real life it would probably be difficult to find a fuel source on the moon that could be readily converted to rocket fuel. An alternative would be a magnetic accelerator gun. It would be possible to launch a payload with an iron outer shell through such a device and catch it in orbit for processing. The mass accelerator replicates just such a device. There are 2 pieces: the master accelerator and the network accelerator (named as \u0022network\u0022 ingame). The master accelerator can arm all of the network accelerators when it picks up its payload. The network is formed into a chain of accelerators which can extend the thrust on the payload. The accelerator included has a 3 meter aperture so trying to launch anything bigger than 3 meters will likely destroy the accelerator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LE5ybhx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LE5ybhx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.2 of this mod is available now!
