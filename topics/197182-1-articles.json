A basic Kerbin Version is covered in detail, then a more advanced Duna version is briefly covered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis design uses four legs each pointing at diagonal angles. This allows each leg\u0027s walking animation to be the same (aside from flipping the directions of some things), meaning you only have to animate one step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach leg gets its own controller, and then multiple master controllers synchronize those stepping animations to create walking and turning movements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis video allows you to build a specific rover, but once you get the idea you could probably modify the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-29T18:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still have trouble just getting rotors to turn on and off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
