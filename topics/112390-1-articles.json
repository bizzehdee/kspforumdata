I call it \u0022THE JETPACK\u0022.\n\nOkay so now that we\u0027ve got that intro out of the way here is the challenge:\n\n**Rules:**\n\n**- Mods:**\n\n**You have to use the**\nhttps://kerbalstuff.com/mod/344\n[**tweakscale**](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/344)\nhttps://kerbalstuff.com/mod/344\n**mod to participate in this challenge**\n\nOther mods are allowed as long as they don\u0027t involve anti-gravity or (unrealistically) extra amounts of fuel\n\n(I\u0027m using the\nhttps://kerbalstuff.com/mod/612/QuizTech%20Aero%20Pack\n[Quiz tech aerodynamics pack](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/612/QuizTech%20Aero%20Pack)\nhttps://kerbalstuff.com/mod/612/QuizTech%20Aero%20Pack\nfor the rcs thrusters)\n\n-\n\n**Other:**\n\n- No cheating(obviously)\n\n- Your jetpack has to contain an\n\n***EAS-1 External Command Seat***\n\n.\n\n- A kerbal is required to sit in your Command Seat.\n\n- The jetpack must be able to take off and land again.\n\n- The starting capsule that you build the jetpack on top of must be an\n\n***M***\n\n***k1 Lander Can***\n\nwith an upside down\n\n***Rockomax Brand Decoupler***\n\non top. Like this:\n\n![VS4gePA.png](http://i.imgur.com/VS4gePA.png)\n\n(If you want to launch just EVA your kerbal, let it board the command seat, decouple and take off!)\n\n**Points system:**\n\n**- Size(height)**\n\n*To calculate the size of your jetpack: craftheight - 1.7*\n\n0.5- = 4 points\n\n0.5 - 0.8 = 3 points\n\n0.81 - 1.2 = 2 points\n\n1.21\u002B = 1 point\n\n**- landing**\n\n*Your jetpack must be able to land precisely*\n\nLanding on the VAB roof = 1 point\n\nLanding on the SPH control tower = 2 points\n\nLanding without any landing gear and taken damage earns you an extra point!\n\n**- speed**\n\n*To calculate your speed points you have to take your topspeed (round it as an integer!), devide it by 5 and add 3.*\n\n*So if your topspeed is 50 then you have 50/5\u002B3 = 13 points.*\n\n**- engines**\n\n*If you have multiple engines you have to take you total points and devide them by the amount of engines you have.*\n\n*So if you have 1 jet engine and 1 rocket engine, you have 12 total points, devided by the number of engines(2). So 6 points.*\n\nJet engine = 8 points per engine\n\nR.A.P.I.E.R. engine (hybrid engines) = 6 points per engine\n\nRocket engine = 4 points per engine\n\n**- control**\n\n*To calculate your control points you have to devide 8 by the number of rcs ports you have, if you have linear rcs ports you can multiply this by 4.*\n\n**Recap:**\n\nSo to recap, if you want to participate you have to submit the following screenshots (\n\nred = optional\n\n):\n\n- A screenshot of your jetpack with the engineers report opened\n\n(The following five screenshots have to be taken in the same flight)\n\n- A screenshot of your jetpack at the starting point\n\n- A screenshot of your kerbal flying over the KSC (probably screaming in terror)\n\n- A screenshot of your jetpack landed on the VAB roof\n\n- A screenshot of your jetpack landed on the SPH control tower\n\n- A screenshot of your jetpack next to the startingpoint (no landing requiered\n![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n)\n\n- A screenshot of your jetpack achieving its speed record (can be done in another flight)\n\n- A screenshot with a\n\n*clear*\n\nview on the amount and type of engines/rcs-ports.(can be done in multiple screenshots)\n\n- A\n\ncraft file so other people can play with your abomination!\n\n**My Submission:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/TaHrX)\n\nAs you can see I\u0027ve earned the following points:\n\nSize(0.8) = 3 points\n\nLanding(VAB\u0026SPH) = 3 points\n\nSpeed(20/5\u002B3) = 7 points\n\nEngines(16/2) = 8 points\n\nControl(8/8\\*4) = 4 points\n\nSo in total I\u0027ve earned 25 points\n\n**Scoreboard:**\n\n1. Noahkra(OP) - 25 points - \\*craftfile comming soon\\*\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\nGood luck everyone!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T09:23:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 09:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by noahkra**"}]}
