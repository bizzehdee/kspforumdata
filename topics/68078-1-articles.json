As others have said, you\u0027ll need to find an efficient window to launch and then fly it flawlessly. Next time you go up there, you should have enough science for legs and radial decouplers. If you don\u0027t stray far from this design, use them. Put the legs on decouplers so that you can jettison them during your ascent. Also, an LV-909 would be a better engine choice. You can afford to gain the weight of that engine if you lose the weight of the modular beams acting as legs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T19:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Major\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Major\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf it were me, I\u0027d wait until (depending on your location) until you were pointed retrograde to the mun\u0027s orbit around kerbin, then blast straight out.\u003Cp\u003EHoly crap batman, I am facing perfectly towards kerbin so I can view it, so I can wait some and be in perfect line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I am gonna actualy use quick load for the first time ever if this crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy bad, forgot mun is tidal locked \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T20:08:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you do, you would just have to wait for the opportune time to burn and go directly retrograde in relation to the Mun\u0027s orbit.

Either circularize so you can take your time setting up the next burn or go straight into that burn if position is good (which will be roughly 30 degrees onto the near side from the near/far border) and set up a node there to break Mun orbit and drop your Kerbin periapsis into atmosphere (30 km or so is good).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T23:35:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI quickly reproduced your lander in the VAB and let KER do the maths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t quite see your engine.
