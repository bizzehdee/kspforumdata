Engines that run purely off ElectricCharge are not allowed, nor are any warpdrive-style engines. Any other forces, such as decoupler force, control surface force and push by engine exhaust must be limited to regular use.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Obvious \u0022exploits\u0022 are strictly forbidden.

You are allowed to use Kerbal Engineer Redux or similar for delta-V calculations prior to start, but your chips must be disconnected before you enter the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be in the Limited mods category, your craft may contain parts from any mods with over 500 downloads, excluding the FAR mod. What i\u0027m trying to do with this 500 is to allow people to use mods as they normally would, while keeping it a fair challenge. When i think of using mods, i think of stuff like KW rocketry, KSPX, Novapunch, Mechjeb, Kerbal Engineer, B9, and similar. In general, just adhere to the rules of fair play. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods i\u0027d prefer not to see are mods like KSP Interstellar which allow for warp drives, and other mods one would generally consider overpowered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a bit of a weird line here, so just go with what you think is fair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELimited Mods: FAR is exactly the same as Limited mods, only with FAR installed. I\u0027m making this a seperate category because of the drastic way FAR changes aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoints are very simple: your score is equal to the number of metres you can get below 138km, as registered on the altimeter at the top of your screen. You are allowed to enter Jool any way you wish, and you may use parachutes while descending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse of any mods, Hyperedit, and anything else, is allowed to get your ship into a Jool orbit or near Jool, even in the Stock category. None of the rules apply untill the moment you enter Jool\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are NOT required to get back to orbit - all i need is that your altitude be over 138km again after you\u0027ve been at your deepest point. If you fall back in afterwards thats OK by me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, and may you return safely :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent leader (and only entry) is Tommy99534, going down to 26547 metres and making it back to space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-02T14:34:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2013 02:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spyritdragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot a part limit.
