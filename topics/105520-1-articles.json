I can\u0027t play this game at all at the moment. I\u0027ve tried the 0.90 version on this machine and it seems fine (however i have had the same issue here as well, just not as often). When launching 1.0 from steam, the image will freeze on the screen but the game keeps running. Happens at different times, once i managed to get to the space academy! for a clear description this is what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example. I click on the space academy, it loads fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI click back to go back to the space center. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt loads, the sounds load but the image on the screen stays as the space academy image with the pilot listings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can click on the screen where the other building would be in the space center and it loads into them however the image again stays on the same space academy screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is frustrating as hell. the same issue happened with the initial load screen as well where the game switched to the title menu and the image on the screen didn\u0027t update at all.
