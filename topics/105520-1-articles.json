I can\u0027t play this game at all at the moment. I\u0027ve tried the 0.90 version on this machine and it seems fine (however i have had the same issue here as well, just not as often). When launching 1.0 from steam, the image will freeze on the screen but the game keeps running. Happens at different times, once i managed to get to the space academy! for a clear description this is what happens.\n\nFor example. I click on the space academy, it loads fine. \n\nI click back to go back to the space center. \n\nIt loads, the sounds load but the image on the screen stays as the space academy image with the pilot listings.\n\nI can click on the screen where the other building would be in the space center and it loads into them however the image again stays on the same space academy screen.\n\nthis is frustrating as hell. the same issue happened with the initial load screen as well where the game switched to the title menu and the image on the screen didn\u0027t update at all. I hope there is a quick easy fix for this.\n\nMy specs are as follows:\n\nCPU: I5 4690k\n\nRam: 8gb 2133mhz ram\n\nMobo: Asus Z97-A\n\nHDD: WD Blue 1 TB\n\nGPU: EVGA GTX 970 SSC (with latest drivers)\n\nOS: Windows 7 Professional 64 bit\n\nhelp plox, i wants to play my ksp again ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nlooking in my log file i find this....\n\n[WRN 00:36:26.375] HighlightingSystem : Framebuffer depth data is not available and can\u0027t be used to occlude highlighting.
