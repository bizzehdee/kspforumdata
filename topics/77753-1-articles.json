As a stand alone installation, as an optional patch or will they merge it with the 32 bit one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can i upgrade KSP? Will it be automatically upgraded to 0.24 @ 64 bit, or will it still be @ 32 bit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if it will still be 32 bit, how can I upgrade to the 64bit one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill there be a new game on my steam library, kerbal 64 bit, avaiable to install? Or maybe the installation process will ask us if we want it in 32 or 64 bit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other word... to have the 64 bit version can i just let steam upgrade it automatically, or do I have to unistall it and reinstall the 64bit one? Can i have at the same time the 32 and 64 bit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qromodynmc","CreatedById":87139,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T21:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsually 64bit games come in same package,With two executable,One for 32bit,one for 64bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T21:15:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d prefer two separate distributions, with two separate entries in Steam library.
