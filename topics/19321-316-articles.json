Is this intended or a bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested it with the FAR airstats window opened, and the values for BC and Cd didnt changed at all (I guess Reference Area didnt changed too). The speed or acceleration didnt changed too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that someone make a comparison with air intakes/speeds open/closed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, can\u0027t recall which thread it was. Could be this one or AJE(Advanced Jet Engines), not absoulutely sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint is that it should matter if air intakes are closed/open and type of air intake. Don\u0027t know how much is of influence and how notable it is for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAJE mode will provide you for additional info on air intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, while I was testing MK2 B9PW plane, found that one B9 sabre intake per engine was not enough to reach 27km in airbreathing mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried with another set B9 air intake, but that was drag overkill. I couldn\u0027t get enough speed to reach higher altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have added only one small stock structural air intake. It does not provide much air, but it is small sized with low profile/wight and drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt didn\u0027t cause overkill drag and it is provided that small amount of air needed for higher altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oktav","CreatedById":96645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T21:49:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to have an analysis if there is going to be enough air intake to fly at a speed/altitude?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eknowing that the plane is stable at some altitudes and speeds is useful, but when reaching very thin atmosphere I don\u0027t know if the engine wold be able to keep up with it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matrix Aran","CreatedById":59037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T22:21:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kcs123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kcs123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, in latest update B9 procedural wing CAN hold fuel.
