Since it was only a test, I didn\u0027t make screenshots. Nevertheless, today I slightly modified the design and did two Spaceplane flights with it. It\u0027s stock parts only, and I don\u0027t use FAR (yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;iframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/9U3t1/embed\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The first flight was planned to be a Minmus landing, yet I managed to obstruct the crew hatch with a thermometer, so the objective was changed and the mission ended doing both, a Minmus and a Mun flyby. Both moons were aligned in such a way, that both flybys and the final reentry could be done without burning any fuel, so there was still about 1000 dV left, which I had to burn in Kerbins atmosphere in order to get rid of the weight of the fuel, which would have made landing much more difficult. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;iframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/hNuSQ/embed\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second mission also had the landing on Minmus as its objective, this time with a usable crew hatch. Nevertheless I messed up something and ended up with about 170 dV left in low minmus orbit, not enough to land or even think of returning to orbit from the surface. Luckily the moons were still aligned in such a way, that a gravity assist at the Mun was hard, but doable, and so also the second mission could safely return to Kerbin. I needed to load a quicksave which I made right before the burn though, since on my first attempt the fuel ran out about 20 m/s early, and the thrusters were misaligned so I didn\u0027t manage to finish the manoeuvre with thrusters only... The second attempt worked, since I found a slightly better angle, leaving a few droplets of fuel in the tanks. For this mission I also had to do the landing on Kerbin twice, since I descended too fast on the first attempt and crashed into the ground with 10 m/s vertical speed - what, together with that crafts weight is a too large momentum for the gears to withstand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;iframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/tuTGf/embed\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are curious on how bad this thing flies, I uploaded the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/JH6mkw2V\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecraft file\u003C/a\u003E to pastebin.
