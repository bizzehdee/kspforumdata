KCT is actually quite a solid foundation (for the reasons outlined above), so I\u0027d start there. For those that haven\u0027t used it, KCT lets you earn science by building rockets. I would make that the main progression loop that drives technology progression. Build spacecraft, earn Engineering experience points and use them to unlock better parts for building better spacecraft.

Instead a spacecraft needs a certain level of crew training before you can launch it.

Thanks to the coding polish the flying part of the game most of the community focuses on is fun stats don\u0027t matter that much in sandbox\u00A0so they see no problem, but thanks to the sloppy inconsistencies with\u00A0the part stats and progression the building, engineering, and managment parts of the feels like you are just using the top 10 most exploity\u00A0parts over and over.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI shouldn\u0027t need to crunch all the numbers and do squads job for them to prove this. Nobody had to find all the bugs in the code before squad would be convinced they needed a bug squash update so I shouldn\u0027t have to write the whole gameplay side of things for them to prove that ksp was built on a pile of placeholders assets that they procrastinated returning to\u00A0that still need to refined and polished they were the ones that implemented these parts they know hat they have done, (and to be clear again the individual parts are of good individual quality nothing against roverdude, nova skilo, porkjet, or any other part,cfg author\u0027s individual examples of work.\u00A0The sloppiness stems from how the parts fit together and just like there is a disparity and clash with the different art styles there is a disparity and clash with the different balance styles that needs to be sorted out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, I think I am getting a handle on one of your

Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tank holds the same number of units/ton, the Mk0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tank can hold 2000 units per ton of tank.\u00A0 While the Mk2 and Mk3 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks are all heavier than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket tanks(1300-1400 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/ton).\u00A0 I have heard explanations that the Mk2 and 3 tanks have improvements in other stats(like max temp and collision tolerance), but that does not explain the Mk0 tank.\u00A0 And this is after the rocket tanks got a balance overhaul to give them all the same mass/capacity ratio.\u00A0 So this would support your conjecture that the parts are not yet fully balanced(wow, the NCS adapter only holds 800LF/ton).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestion: If you list the specific parts or categories

another reason I was against specific examples is that one needs only to look at thier own copy of the game to quickly find thier own examples so I think it\u0027s fair to save time and not bother listing all the problems.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for categories I feel in need of balancing I\u0027d honestly say all of them. Each small pattern of consistency only extends to a handful of other parts sometimes with overlap between categories and even if we limited this down to a few offending categories any fix could potentially render the untouched categories inconsistent with those fixes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem has to be tackled as a whole by the devs basically and I\u0027d respect what decisions the devs make concerning balance if they actually did try to balance the game but since it\u0027s apparent the part stats is still essentially a cobbling of individually well made but mis matched\u00A0placeholders that have barely been touched since I\u00A0feel compelled to put pressure on this issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-08T21:38:18Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2017 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by passinglurker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
