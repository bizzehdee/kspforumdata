We wish to give our customers only the greatest and most fashionable ways to ride their reusable ICBMs. Our engineers are ready and eager to work on any project that can get them close to the liquid oxygen again. Here at Instell we have only the best of experimental technologies, because finished products are just too mainstream. Why spend precious funds on testing when the customer can do it for you?\n\nAt Instell we believe in shooting for the moon, and even if we miss, our craft melted on the way up.\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESCRAMJET ENGINES!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nNew from Instell, the ***Semi Combustible Ramjet***.\n\nHave you ever thought that stuffing air and fuel into a tube until it exploded was a bad idea? We did, but we kept trying anyway until we figured out that shoving more air in makes it explode out the back of the tube! [WARNING - Sharp edges, high temperatures, and ludicrous G forces may cause death, dismemberment, and or hallucination]\n\nWe at instell incorporated are proud to offer a selection of two wonderful scramjets: XE-101 and the XE-202. Both are scramjets and are built to propel your spaceplane to hypersonic speeds. They become more powerful and efficient the higher they are and the faster they go.\n\n![eK7cXGJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/eK7cXGJ.png)![bHJ1S9X.png](http://i.imgur.com/bHJ1S9X.png)\n\nAdvantages of scramjets:\n\n- Very efficient at high speeds/altitudes\n- Very light\n- Can function at very high altutudes\n- Is the physical representation of acceleration\n- Does not require intake hogging\n\nHowever it poses a couple of challenges:\n\n- Must be going past mach 3 to function\n- Engines have a tendency to cause other parts to overheat due to atmospheric heating.\n- Engines are more efficient in the upper atmosphere\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EELECTRIC ENGINES!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nIntroducing the ***XE-303/E electronic turbofan engine***!\n\n![Pjb7Thn.png](http://i.imgur.com/Pjb7Thn.png)\n\nThis engine is considerably more simple to use than our Scramjets. This engine is excellent for subsonic crafts, especially those on other planets. Since it doesn\u0027t rely on combustion to power its turbine, it will run in any atmosphere. It\u0027s perfect for aircraft transports on other planets!\n\nAdvantages:\n\n- Can run in any atmosphere\n- Small onboard battery supply\n- Cheaper than a traditional basic jet\n- Very quiet\n- Makes for a great air conditioner in a pinch\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n- Cannot go above Mach 1\n- Can only be radially attached\n- A bit bulky\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Arial Black\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPULSE DETONATION ENGINES!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nIntroducing Instell\u0027s latest work of mad science: The ***XE-404 Pulse Detonation Engine***!\n\n![jF5s1qn.png](http://i.imgur.com/jF5s1qn.png)\n\nThis engine is the perfect companion to the XE-101 and 202. It has a maximum speed of mach 6 and sounds like a mosquito screwing a dragon. Despite using the most advanced coolant systems that Jeb could find in his junkyard, this engine still has a tendency to overheat, so watch out!\n\n\u003Cu\u003EAdvantages:\u003C/u\u003E\n\n- Can easily take a SCRAMjet up to the required speed.\n- Has a speed ceiling of mach 6.\n- Operates well in the same flight conditions as a TurboRamJet.\n- Can cook a burger in 6 seconds flat.\n\n\u003Cu\u003EDisadvantages:\u003C/u\u003E\n\n- **LOUD!!**\n- Cannot reach as high of an altitude as the XE-101 and 202\n- Can overheat easily\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**\u003Cu\u003ETo-do list:\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n- Get G.O.N.A.D.S. working properly\n- Cool fuselage parts\n- Better model for Casper\n- better (stockalike?) textures\n- better models in general\n- more engines, the more experimental the better\n\n**\u003Cu\u003EChangelog:\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n\u003Cu\u003Ev1.6.1\u003C/u\u003E\n\nRepackaged for 1.0.5\n\n\u003Cu\u003Ev1.6\u003C/u\u003E\n\nAdded XE-404 \u0022Jackhammer\u0022 Pulse Detonation Engine\n\nAdded XF-35B SuperBullShark to demonstrate XE-404\n\nAdded F-38 Mako just for fun\n\n\u003Cu\u003Ev1.5\u003C/u\u003E\n\nAdded RI-01 Hypersonic Intake\n\nAdded Mk.1 Battery Fuselage\n\nRemodeled XE-303/E\n\nXE-303/E no longer needs IntakeAir to function, but does need to be in an atmosphere.\n\nXE-303/E takes way less electricity to run.\n\nRemoved G.O.H.N.A.D.S. until I can get the damn thing to work.\n\nAdded new parts onto IX-102 and IX-201\n\n\u003Cu\u003Ev1.4\u003C/u\u003E\n\nRETEXTURED ALL THE THINGS!\n\nTweaked G.O.H.N.A.D.S. to actually do the thing that it was made to do.\n\nAdded XE-303/E Electric Turbofan engine (Thank you firespitter for your wonderful plugin)\n\nAdded IX-201 to showcase the new engine\n\nAdded fairings to XE-101\n\n\u003Cu\u003Ev1.3\u003C/u\u003E\n\nAdded G.O.H.N.A.D.S.
