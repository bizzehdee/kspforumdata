Also, on a similar topic, it doesn\u0027t look like the aerodynamic model handles them being partially occluded by other parts, which also amplifies their usefulness. Simply making it so an airbreak that doesn\u0027t have full airflow only gives a very small portion of its breaking potential would go a long way to fixing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, keep that gif.
