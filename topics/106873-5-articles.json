Alternatively, try aerobraking with bigger ships with mostly full fuel tanks, and the heat shields might become necessary.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly, I was aerobraking on Jool okay at 195K periapsis, but 190K would cause me to explode.

You will find that between 10k - 20k altitude the turbojets will loose thrust just at the same time as the wings don\u0027t provide enough lift for you to gain any speed or altitude, so there is absolutely no way to get high enough to jettison them and get into orbit.
