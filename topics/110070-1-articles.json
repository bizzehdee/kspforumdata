First off the line is the TOAD; a design that mates a lightweight chassis with a very big engine for obscene amounts of thrust. I really thought this design was just too silly to be useful but it has proved me wrong by hauling some very heavy mining equipment down to the surface of Tylo! It\u0027s got so much grunt you can even use it as an interplanetary stage or heavy tug. The large gimbal range of the Poodle also gives it excellent maneuverability under thrust. It puts out around 4k of Delta V (with the standard droptanks). \n\n![wT0Wx3k.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wT0Wx3k.jpg)\n\nAlso built on the same chassis is Tadpole Mk2 which swaps the Poodle for a less powerful (but more practical) LV-909. Like it\u0027s predecessor it combines excellent endurance with very pleasant handling. It\u0027s a great choice for anyone looking for a good, solid, dependable, general purpose lander, and can be used on every planetary body apart from Kerbin, Laythe, Tylo and Eve. The Tadpole Mk2 puts out close to 4,800 m/s of Delta V using the standard droptanks.\n\n![myrJMLE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/myrJMLE.jpg)\n\nBoth landers come with a powerful, general purpose launch vehicles which have plenty of spare DV for taking up cargo or extra fuel.\n\n![dp6Ct6t.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dp6Ct6t.jpg)\n\n**OWNERS MANUAL:**\n\nLike my previous designs the Tadpole and Toad feature horizontal cockpits for suborbital flying/landing and vertically mounted docking ports for orbital piloting. When performing burns with the navball the top docking port must be selected, this also applies if using Mechjeb. If you\u0027re not used to VTOLs and would rather fly the vessels like a regular rocket the top docking port can be used for whole missions if need be. A joystick is highly reccomended and SAS should be left on at all times. Both vessels are designed for continuous deep space use so would need to be adapted to land on Kerbin. This can be achieved by mounting parachutes to the side ports and using a single drop tank on the top port or vice verse. Alternatively you could create a special \u0022re-entry pack\u0022 consisting of chutes/speed breaks that the lander could dock to at the end of a missions.\n\n**CONTROLS:**\n\n1 - Toggle Rocket Engine\n\n3 - Toggle Nav Light\n\n5 - Undock Top Docking Port\n\n9 - Toggle Ladder\n\nABORT - Detach Drop Tanks\n\nC - Toggle Cockpit Orientation (Press Twice)\n\n**LV NOTES:**\n\nThe Launch Vehicles are pretty easy to use, just select \u0022control from here\u0022 on the top docking port above the launncher. The LVs have plenty of spare DV so your launch profile doesn\u0027t have to be perfect. The center tank above the craft contains a probe core allowing you to undock and re-dock to the tank multiple times for extended mission times. \n\n**FUEL ROUTING:**\n\nI\u0027ve spent quite a lot of time ensuring that the fuel is routed properly in these craft. Firstly any tank above the top docking port will empty, followed by the drop tanks and finnaly the landers internal fuel stores. Due to KSP glitchiness it\u0027s possible to corrupt the fuel routing on the lander through the design of the launch vehicle. \n\nWhere possible you should ensure that there is only a single tank (or stack of tanks) mounted above the craft.\n\n![HU09wbv.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HU09wbv.jpg)\n\nMultiple tanks running into a center tank that feed back to the multiple tanks on the lander will corrupt the fuel system. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n![J52mdV9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/J52mdV9.jpg)\n\nIf you do wish to use multiple tanks in a LV stage just ensure that the landers fuel system is isolated by including a steel plate or de-coupler above the docking port. Alternatively you can disconnect the fuel line that runs from the top docking port to the engine. **!!IF IN DOUBT ISOLATE!!!** \n\n![EG9pvPs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EG9pvPs.jpg)\n\nWith both method\u0027s you\u0027ll have to transfer fuel to the lander manually. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the crafts. All the best. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCupcake...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T07:12:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 07:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cupcake...**"},{"CreatedByName":"CitizenAerospace","CreatedById":107486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T07:53:17Z","Content":":OO Awesome work!
