I\u0027m not talking about anything crazy, like Space-time warping or hyperspace, just some of the more exotic forms we don\u0027t have yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFusion\u003C/strong\u003E - Fusion is a step up from the kind of fission rockets that we see in NERVA, it achieves a high level thrust with a similar level of efficency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERamjet\u003C/strong\u003E - If you can build an intake big enough, it\u0027s possible to power nuclear rockets with the interstellar exosphere. That so very thin level of hydrogen that permeates through all of space. Through this, you would be able to fire your engines indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolar Sails\u003C/strong\u003E - The idea of a solar sail is that you can build a surface to get pushed by the light waves from the sun as a means of propulsion. This, obviously, requires a very large sail, about the size of Texas, to get reasonable thrust, because the impact caused by photons is almost negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAntimatter\u003C/strong\u003E - This is kind of the penultimate thruster. Neutrons, Protons, and other hadrons are made up of smaller particles called quarks. Quarks are elementary particles, like photons and electrons, which means they are not made up of smaller parts. There are many different kinds of quarks, and for every one, there is an antimatter version. Most atoms are actually made up partly of antimatter. When an antimatter particle is separated from the rest, it will annihilate with whatever regular matter it comes into contact with. This vaporizes them both into pure energy in the form of two highly charged photons. This produces massive amounts of thrust with literally atoms of fuel. NASA calculates that, should we be able to create and store antimatter, their antimatter engines could fuel an expedition to Mars with 10 milligrams of fuel. In addition, it\u0027s possible to assemble the opposite version of regular atoms. Anti-Hydrogen, albeit briefly, has been created. Another form of storing it is in positronium. Basically getting an electron to enter binary orbit with its antimatter equivalent, a positron in a kind of pseudoatom. Its very hard to assemble a stable pair, but if you do, it\u0027s much easier to store than pure antimatter. You simply destabilize it to get it to annihilate, the regular matter would be self contained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there are other propulsion types that I don\u0027t know enough about to write down here, and also ones that aren\u0027t mainstream that we already have in real life, such as magnetoplasma and SABRE. Do you guys think adding these kind of endgame technologies would harm the game? Or maybe just don\u0027t fit the overall theme?
