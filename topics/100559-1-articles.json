They had no time to be bored. They were kept very busy with the operation of the very exotic machine that was an Apollo CSM. They had to monitor the systems that kept them alive, navigate and care for their inertial plateform by regularly sighting on the stars, engaged in scientific experiments, took pictures and much more. The computers couldn\u0027t take care of but a few systems, all related to guidance and control. All the other systems like comms, environmental control and power were all managed more or less manually. Also the mission planners made a point of keeping them busy. Each launch was an expensive affair and there was no point in keeping these guys idle.\n\nif you want to know more have a look at the Apollo flight journal [http://history.nasa.gov/afj/](http://history.nasa.gov/afj/)\n\nVery interesting stuff to be learned about these flights.\n\nFrank"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T01:19:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E At first but latter interest in moon mission faded out and form what i know American tv station stopped to show live from transmission from Apollo mission because they \n\u003E *\u0022going*\n\u003E \n\u003E *to the Moon about as exciting as taking a trip to*\n\u003E \n\u003E *Pittsburgh\u0022* \n\u003E \n\u003E That was before Apollo 13 accident of course.\n\u003E \n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E I wonder why no one of Apollo 13 doesn\u0027t return to space flight\n\nFirst of all, Lovell made it quite clear that he was retiring after 13, Fred Haise actually helped test the space shuttle and was supposed to go back to the moon on Apollo 18, but it was cancelled. and poor old Swigert, he died of cancer."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T01:32:29Z","Content":"The Apollo missions were packed with activities.
