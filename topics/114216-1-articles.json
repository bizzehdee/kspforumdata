Anyone know how to connect the vertices of these two objects logically? I can\u0027t find a good tutorial. Could I export to Blender and have an easier time of it?\n\u003E \n\u003E The part will be surface attachable, and should complement the Tantares Soyuz fairly nicely.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m also thinking about putting a shutter on the window, and having it act as a science experiment, like an observation window. Thoughts?\n\nDon\u0027t need to join them, just combine the objects - IIRC when combined they are not rendered in separate draw calls and therefore no or (undetectable) performance loss.\n\nAnd, Wings3D *can* do boolean operations, via plugins (though yeah it is a shame it doesn\u0027t do them by default), look up Wings3D MLAB version if you want to do those ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![78c72bc105.png](http://puu.sh/iECZG/78c72bc105.png)\n\n![2fd168af75.png](http://puu.sh/iED0m/2fd168af75.png)\n\nThere are other ways of connecting those two vertex to vertex without using boolean operations, but it\u0027s a long and slightly awkward process (It\u0027s how I do IVA windows), PM and I\u0027ll explain it if you need.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T14:51:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beale**"},{"CreatedByName":"curtquarquesso","CreatedById":42872,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:24:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Don\u0027t need to join them, just combine the objects - IIRC when combined they are not rendered in separate draw calls and therefore no or (undetectable) performance loss.\n\u003E And, Wings3D *can* do boolean operations, via plugins (though yeah it is a shame it doesn\u0027t do them by default), look up Wings3D MLAB version if you want to do those ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://puu.sh/iECZG/78c72bc105.png](http://puu.sh/iECZG/78c72bc105.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://puu.sh/iED0m/2fd168af75.png](http://puu.sh/iED0m/2fd168af75.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E There are other ways of connecting those two vertex to vertex without using boolean operations, but it\u0027s a long and slightly awkward process (It\u0027s how I do IVA windows), PM and I\u0027ll explain it if you need.\n\nWell, I thought I had the right plugin, but I didn\u0027t.

It\u0027ll serve as an observation window. Taking an observation from it will yield a little bit of science. The window will also illuminate. Not sure whether it\u0027ll just be emissive, or function as a docking light. Suggestions?\n\nNext step will be reworking the Bernoulli module. I\u0027ll be making it fit the nice docking ports from CxAerospace. The style will hopefully be compatible with both his parts, stock, and Tantares. I think the next part for it could be a truss attachment for it that will turn it into an ESA Columbus module. It\u0027ll attach to the aft node. \n\n![148762main_exterior.jpg](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/148762main_exterior.jpg)\n\nI think I may put some nodes on that to attach KIS storage containers to.
