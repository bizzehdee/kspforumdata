One is for an equatorial satellite, the other at a 13 deg. inclination. Both orbit direction indicators show eastwards orbit BUT one of them have the descending node where the ascending node should have been. Did something change with 1.3 so that only the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E markers will tell the actual direction, with the indicator always going east, even for a westwards orbit? That would make for loads of fun with the zero inclination contract... Anyone have some insight?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-05T23:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you show some screenshots?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-05T23:15:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222rvxxxe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022403\u0022 src=\u0022http://i64.tinypic.com/2rvxxxe.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022992\u0022\u003EHere\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-05T23:16:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2017 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-06T01:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s showing\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E relative to the target orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-06T02:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore specifically: An and Dn on satellite orbits are calculated relative to the ship that currently has focus.
