Turning Landing Guidance on at that point usually ended up with MechJeb slamming the ship into the planet surface. You need to enable Landing Guidance from a stable orbit for best results. I\u0027ve used \u0022land somewhere\u0022 as low as 20 meters off the ground and never had an issue. It\u0027s great for those \u0022uh oh\u0022 moments when you\u0027ve botched a manual landing, or are moving a ship short distances across the planet surface. The main thing to remember is that MechJeb can\u0027t perform miracles. If your descent speed is greater than your available thrust, nothing can save your ship. Lastly - always, \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E F5 before deorbiting. Use \u0022pick a spot to land\u0022, \u0022enter coordinates\u0022, or \u0022land somewhere\u0022 from a stable orbit and report back the results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmcr70","CreatedById":106717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T19:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks..
