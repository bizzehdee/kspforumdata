Good job dev team \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u00C2\u00A5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking that it might be better if instead of always having to click click click click to constantly get new science reports, it would be nice if we could just toggle ON certain experiments once, and it would automatically send datas to the spaceStation to earn science points continuously instead, just like the system works now, you\u0027ll have to deal with large amount of electricity gattering and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike, maybe you have to assign a kerbans to each experiments, which would be an advantage to have more than 1 on your spacecraft. One would monitor the goo, the other takes care of the chemistry kit module while you have the other go EVA a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouple experiments would work a bit the same way it is now like the soil gattering and such, although I think it might be better if the inphasis for such experiment was more the gattering of different types of soil rather than the constant repetition of the same experiment. Maybe you have to collect the soil, and then bring it to the craft to analyse it, which takes time like the other experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it feels a bit, almost like cheating how I just constantly repeat repeat repeat the same things over and over again as fast as possible to gatter science and it does get redundant when you have to do this for all the science stuff you brought with you =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAnd before anyone accuses me of trying to make the game too easy\u003C/span\u003E, not at all, obviously with this system the data and science earnt /seconds would be much smaller, so instead of constantly clicking to repeat the experiments, you would have to wait a certain time until your science is done, or hey, just let it be while you work on a new spaceship and more missions. It would also make it much more challenging to gatter all the science in the atmosphere of a planet compared to orbiting and would make the actual sciency process more realistic as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats all I got!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
