The buttons do, however. I\u0027ve tried multiple game versions with identical results. I have also tried mapping the controls with the official Logitech driver installed, and not installed, with identical results.\u00A0 I have also tried the suggested Advanced Fly-By-Wire mod, which does appear to recognize the input, but still will not map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease tell me I am just really bad at google and that there is a simple fix for this somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
