Probe cores permitted, but you better have a Kerbal in an armchair if you do.\n\n- MUST use a liquid fuel rocket (no nukes though unless you\u0027re entering a Gatecrasher) as your primary method of thrust.\n\n- MUST NOT at any point leave the runway surface. The instant it does, your run is over.\n\n- MUST NOT go off the end of the runway - your speed run must leave enough runway to slow to a stop while still on the tarmac. You may use retro rockets, however these MUST be the solid fuel rockets that burn until they run out.\n\n- Your speed run MUST finish with your car fully intact: no jettisoning parts, no clamps.\n\n- NO welding, unbreakable joints, or any other anti-vehicle-shattering mod. Bits falling off is a run-ender.\n\n- NO infinite fuel.\n\n- NO procedural fairings. Mach 4.stupid dragsters is not the idea here, unless you can achieve this without artificially zeroing parts drag.\n\n- Please indicate if you use MechJeb or any other active flight control system.\n\n- I am aware that FAR drastically alters drag characteristics, I am also aware that it alters lift characteristics to a similar degree. Both advantages in flight, total disadvantages on wheels. Or skids. I am also going to count adjusted atmospheric heating effects in sandbox prep as \u0022FAR\u0022. Be honest, did you dial it down?\n\nScoring:\n\nPost-run F3 screenshot and a shot of your vehicle at the start and end of its run. Video would be nice, especially if you have a spectacular run.\n\nBonus 100 points if you make an immediate turnaround and successful return run of at least 75% of your West/East (outward) run speed.\n\nSpeed in m/s.\n\nScoreboards:\n\nNON-FAR:\n\n1.[Claw](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126815-REBOOT-MOD-Thrust-KSC-Land-Speed-Challenge-1-0-x?p=2076111\u0026viewfull=1#post2076111) with a new record (assuming this is stock aero as well, please correct me if I\u0027m wrong): 700m/s!
