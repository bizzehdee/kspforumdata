Th-232 is not in itself a fissile material but when bombarded with a neutron it will (after a decay from Protactinium-233) transmute into Uranium-233, which is fissile and this is the dominant power producing element in a thorium reactor. Thorium has many advantages over Uranium, notably:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThorium is more abudant and thus easier to obtain than Uranium\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThorium is more energy dense than Uranium\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThorium is a lighter element than Uranium, meaning far more neutron absorptions are needed to produce those nasty transuranic elements and thus far less likely to occur.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThorium absorbs thermal neutrons much more readily than U-238 making it more efficient for breeding fissile elements\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, hurray for Thorium right? Not quite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that Protactinium-233 I mentioned earlier? Well, that is a very effective neutron absorber and it has a not-insignificant half-life, meaning it will tend to build up in the fuel during reactor operation and degrade the delicate neutron balance of your reactor. As such, thorium reactors should never be far from reprocessing equipment because they are going to need regular maintenance to keep them operating, especially at 100% output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, what does this mean in game?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, expect your thorium reactors to produce more power and consume less fuel but don\u0027t expect them to keep operating for long periods without oversight. If you don\u0027t perform regular reprocessing, even when you have plenty of fuel left, expect your power output to start falling away until the reactor just shuts down. This power drop will happen very smoothly so you will see it occuring over time and you can decide when you want to step in with some reprocessing to arrest the slide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practise, this means you\u0027re probably going to want to operate thorium vessels where they can either make regular dockings with a science lab or carry a science lab on board.

When I went deep enough to get any flow rate I couldn\u0027t get back out again. So after a re-load that plan was abandoned. I also didn\u0027t know that you could only reprocess the DUF so many times. By the end on my return trip it would only allow me to reprocess a tiny fraction of the DUF. I also didn\u0027t head the warning on the antimatter containers that they would explode when un-powered.

I prefer to think of the Kerbals as a bit more forward thinking race who know what to do with their nuclear waste, namely: reprocess it and stick it back in the reactor (over and over again) until it\u0027s less dangerous. You also cannot simply refuel as an alternative to reprocressing those actinides, while they are in your reactor, they are clogging it up with unwanted elements that hinder proper functioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis system also helps avoid parts that contains ludicrous numbers of resource types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe depleted fuels consists of non-fissile elements and fission products that might be very high activity but don\u0027t have these huge many-thousand year half-lives.
