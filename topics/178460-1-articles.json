I\u2019m attempting to land using Mech Jeb, and the approach\u00A0is fine, however at 10,000 m the space craft flips out of control.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe design uses procedural fuel tanks for the fuel, raptor (alcentar mod) Engines, 3 delta wings for the landing legs / wings, and I put quite a few reaction wheels in the payload bay above the tanks. Above the payload bay is a passanger module and then an M3 capsule. Above the capsule is an M3 aerodynamic nose cone with a ring of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters around it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats the gist of it.
