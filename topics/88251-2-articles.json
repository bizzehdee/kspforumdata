Good luck. If you accomplish that then....well....KSP explodes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Distance Scalar: Add that to your seed. Lock out people (us) from modifying the system seed, and use Fibonacci sequence or something as the seed to generate your systems. Then, add a distance scalar to the different systems. Remove the seed input from your warp engines, instead enter coordinates for the system. If your warp drive can reach the system, you go there and Fibonacci(for example) generates the system for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make your mod, and KSP in general, into a Star Control type map. Would work online, since everyone would have the same seed generators. The distance scalar, to determine \u0027location\u0027, can be based off different things. You can use another procedural seed to populate the universe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPolar coordinates for the system\u0027s location relative to each other, with Kerbol in the center, would be most realistic, but would have laaaaarge coordinates eventually, unless you capped the maximums initially. And you would have to make sure you can reach the different systems some how, and we don\u0027t hit dead ends and are unable to jump further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn X-Y-Z coordinates would work, but would make the universe look like a giant rubic\u0027s cube, with Kerbol being in the center, and each system being a different cube radiating outward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr a vector system, with lines branching off from Kerbol SOI. Kinda like a starfish (Kerbol) with the lines radiating out to other starfishes(systems). Would work but overlap and the connection of nodes might be a problem with different systems that generate close to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...now we have a galaxy map! By just adding a distance scalar to your seed generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eother things for flavor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Different warp drives that can be unlocked for different distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Put the warp activation tied to a maneuver node, so an intrepid modder can add a \u0027black hole\u0027 effect for your ship to fly into lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Make activation of warp be outside the soi of the systems sun. For multiplayer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Make warp drives use a resource that is a pain to refine(He3 or whatever). But have a few systems that have it in abundance...which leads to supply routes and commerce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Make the distance/connection information available in a raster form, to make maps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Include a way to find out information about the systems we explore. For instance, you enter a new system, launch probes, and they give information(atmosphere/gravity/delta-v requirements/etc) on the different planets so you can decide which ones look interesting to explore...or exploit for resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Multiplayer. Man, if you could transfer funds for different resources, it would create a crazy thing. People would be heading out to different systems for 3 main reason: Explore, Exploit, or Exterminate.

I have no clue if this will actually work or not, as it was just an idea I had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you jump away from a system, I take the current persistence file and rename it to \u0026lt;seed\u0026gt;_persistence.sfs. I then look for a persistence file named \u0026lt;new seed\u0026gt;_persistence.sfs -- if it exists, I rename it to persistence.sfs and load it. If not, I\u0027ll allow the game to make a new \u0022blank\u0022 persistence file. Since the current craft is loaded into physics, I \u003Cem\u003Ebelieve\u003C/em\u003E the only thing in the new file will be the current craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the file itself is renamed, I\u0027ll be able to tell if you exited the game without going back to Kerbin, say due to the game crashing. There would be a file named 0_persistence.sfs (Kerbol\u0027s persistence file) if you didn\u0027t go back to Kerbol before the game ended, while 0_persistence.sfs would not exist if you did (because I would rename it to persistence.sfs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example. Say I boot up the warp drive in orbit around Kerbol and go to coordinates 123. Before anything gets randomized at all, the game takes the current persistence file and renames it to 0_persistence.sfs. It then looks for a file named 123_persistence.sfs -- if none exists, it will do nothing and allow the game to create a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you explore a bit, you decide you want to go home to Kerbin. The game will first rename the current persistence.sfs file to 123_persistence.sfs. Next, it will look for a file named 0_persistence.sfs. It should find the one we renamed before we ever jumped in the first place and rename it to persistence.sfs. This makes Kerbol the \u0022primary\u0022 persistence file once more, and restores all your other vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, say you want to jump to the coordinates qwerty. You make the jump, Kerbol\u0027s persistence file is renamed to 0_persistence.sfs, a new persistence file is generated, and then the power goes out and your computer powers down (or your laptop\u0027s battery dies). Now the persistence file is set to the \u0022wrong\u0022 system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reboot KSP and load your save, first the mod makes sure that 0_persistence.sfs \u003Cem\u003Edoes not exist\u003C/em\u003E. If it exists, that means something went horribly wrong and we never got to go back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to keep the current seed somewhere on file (it may not be the persistence file) -- from here, the game can work out what was the seed of the last system we visited, before the game closed. It\u0027s just a matter of renaming the current persistence file to that seed\u0027s name and restoring the \u0022default\u0022 persistence file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I have no clue if this will work.

If you visit 1,000 systems, you would have 1,000 persistents lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The time would be static, so if you left for a couple years, when you went back, the planets would of been frozen in place the whole time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. When you leave a system, and the mod creates a new \u0027snapshot\u0027 persistent, will your current vessel be in the FLIGHTSTATE data? If so, when you return back and the mod loads up the persistent for the system you just left, there will be two of you now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When KSP initializes a save game, it first loads the planets data, at time \u0027zero\u0027, right? Then, it syncs with the time in your quicksave file, FLIGHTSTATE -- UT (which I \u0027assume\u0027 is universal time?), and since the planets are \u0027on rails\u0027, all you need is a specific time to move them to. So, it essentially time warps to the UT time, then, it loads all the position data from your current vessels from the rest of the FLIGHTSTATE? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is right...then \u0027theoretically\u0027 you wouldn\u0027t need a persistent file for each system you enter/leave, you just need the UT time from where you left to sync to. You could make a \u0027master\u0027 persistent file that is created whenever you leave a system, that has the FLIGHTSTATE data from just the \u0027current\u0027 vessel, and the current UT. Your seed generator generates the system data. All it needs is the UT time to sync on rails to the current master time, and the current vessels FLIGHTSTATE to load in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless there is a way to pull the information you needed from the running memory, instead. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, having the same location loaded each time for your vessel could cause problems. Might be better to have the master have a location that is hardcoded to be well away from any possible issues, such as outside sun\u0027s soi, or even opposite, in a low orbit next to the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you visit a hundred systems, but only leave satellites in ten of the, then that would be ten seperate persistents created. But I don\u0027t know if you can create a master persistent, with time and current vessel, by being able to go into the standard persistent and delete all the \u0027other\u0027 FLIGHTSTATE data automatically. Or perhaps go in and edit the UT instead. Dunno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: Player leaves a system, but with no vessels or objects left behind (he was just passing through). Wouldn\u0027t need a persistent, since when he re-enters, the seed re-generates the world at time zero, which is then re-synced to the \u0027master\u0027 persistent to get the current time, for when the game loads it. Or perhaps there is a call for the UT at KSC that it can sync with. Dunno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: Player leaves a system with a satellite in orbit. A persistent is created, with the UT and FLIGHTSTATE for that satellite. Player goes back to original Kerbin system. A couple years later, they decide to return to the system where the satellite has been orbiting by itself. So....if this is right...the game loads the planetary information from the seed generator at time \u0027zero\u0027, then it looks at the saved persistent for the UT, and syncs planets orbits to reach that, then it load the FLIGHTSTATE data for the satellite (and maybe a mirror image of you lol), and viola! Your\u0027re in. What would be cool, is that after it load the FLIGHTSTATE data, it could then sync -again- with the current time, since the UT it is using is from years ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is where I was wondering if Dark Multiplayer\u0027s sync function could work. He figured out how to make current vessels that are loaded to be able to sync forward/backward in time. You could skip a lot of this nonsense, just load a persistent for each system, then sync to current time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr perhaps the \u0027master\u0027 could be used to...errr...ugh....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egah, lot of guessing here haha\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-25T02:46:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2014 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by bigbadben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BFGfreak","CreatedById":57395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T04:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI might have to download this to see what results from typing 1123 6536 5321\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asdfCYBER","CreatedById":94319,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T16:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProcedural?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo one day the game may look like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ltheory.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELimit Theory\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"English Mobster","CreatedById":92865,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T17:10:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ExtremeTrader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ExtremeTrader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EProcedural?\u003Cp\u003ESo one day the game may look like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ltheory.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELimit Theory\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TonyC","CreatedById":95836,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T21:18:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo..my lot of suggestions :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I also used Kepler\u0027s Third Law to calculate orbital periods, and wound up with planets moving either very quickly or very slowly. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s probably just some bugginess in what numbers I\u0027m sending into the calulations, but for the time being I reverted back to my old approach just to have something stable again. I haven\u0027t released anything yet, but I wanted to give you an update on what was happening to the main branch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo days ago, I began work on making persistent systems, since the feature has been the most popular request so far. I created a new branch for it (meaning I\u0027m not modifying the \u0022stable\u0022 branch) and wrote something which seems like it would work in theory, but in reality KSP crashes to the desktop. I\u0027m going to keep playing around with it until I at least nail what\u0027s causing the CTD issues. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m writing to the persistence file while KSP is reading from it (or something), so I may have to rethink my approach. Does anyone know of any mods that directly write to the persistence.sfs file while the game is running using System.IO?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday was my 21st birthday, so I spent half the day having a party and the other half at my job.
