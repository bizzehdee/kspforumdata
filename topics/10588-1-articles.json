But I guess I kind of drifted away the past few years, because I just now realized that Civilization V is out. I was wondering what you guys think of the game before I buy it. It looks really cool from the screenshots, and I\\\u0027ve read a few reviews, but I\\\u0027d really appreciate your opinions on the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome details I know I like so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2 Less micromanagement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2 Being happy in one city makes you happy in others\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2 Pretty amazing graphics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00E2\u20AC\u00A2 Long-range fighting\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I was wondering if there was any way to get the map maker off Steam without getting the game from a box or from Steam itself; my parents are really untrustworthy about giving their credit card information, so I have to download it off Amazon, which we already have an account on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T12:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually i hate the new combat system like the plague, but otherwise than that, there isn\\\u0027t much wrong with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like the game has been made \\\u0027\\\u0027child-friendly\\\u0027\\\u0027 and i am a micromanagement loving person.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T20:10:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, you\\\u0027re in luck! I got this game last year, and just recently (2 days ago) started playing again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have less than 8Gb of RAM, do not buy it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I got it last year, I had 4Gb of RAM. The start of the games were fine, but the longer a game went on AI turns turned into crippled turtle races.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach AI turn took about 1 minute or longer. It doesn\\\u0027t sound bad, but it really is and makes it annoying to play/finish games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I have 8 Gb, I\\\u0027ve noticed the game is MUCH more bearable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve noticed the AI turns are still slowing down a bit (I\\\u0027m on turn 400 or so, 1920\\\u0027s), but nothing like before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy RAM usage is around 6.2 - 7Gb (I turned my system PageFile off though, so about 2Gb is just Windows, not the game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGraphics are really great. Things get jumpy while the AI take their turns, but I really think that\\\u0027s just a processing slowdown. During my turn, everything is pretty smooth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombat:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe grid is a Hexagrid, not Octagonal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is better? Eh, I don\\\u0027t really think one is better than the other, but I prefer Hexagrid. It just makes things more interesting, and a little graphically smoother in some regard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot stack units anymore. (Except when you have 1 unit guarding a city, and that city produces a new unit, then it will be stacked until you move 1. I\\\u0027m not sure how fighting works in that situation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I like this. It makes warefaring much more lengthy and require planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\\\u0027t just create one super army that wipes through an entire nation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to build many units, arrange them to encompass the city (without grid-locking them!) and have them all attack then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERanged units are great for this type of warefare\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have a Melee unit next to the city and ranged units several hexagons away shelling the city.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the occasional grid-lock sometimes gets annoying, but not game breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou units can pass \u003Cem\u003Ethrough\u003C/em\u003E other units, they just can\\\u0027t land on top of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason though, I couldn\\\u0027t pass through one of my allied City-States units. I\\\u0027m not sure why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECity-States are kinda eh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never really found them useful. This past game I specifically designed my nation to utilize them (lots of bonuses to make City-State relationships more efficient).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey do give you units occasionally (which is very nice), but they don\\\u0027t really do too much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically they\\\u0027re like allies that can\\\u0027t backstab you (more or less), so if you are an ally with them, then they\\\u0027ll go to war with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut they don\\\u0027t really do much :l\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey most I\\\u0027ve seen them do during a war is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.) Give me a unit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB.) Serve as a distraction against my enemy. The enemy will attack the City-State instead of me (the States do a great job of defending).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only other complaint would be Denouncing and Multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers can denounce each other, which basically just means you\\\u0027re publicly declaring so-and-so is evil and should not be trusted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAI throw these things around like a hot potato. Even your allies, which is annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a great relationship with America, when suddenly he denounced me. Which caused all my other allies to denounce me ._.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreaking Peace Treaties, or randomly declaring war does seem to cause Denouncements to fly (as I\\\u0027d expect, this is good. It makes sense). I like that, I just wish the random ones would stop, although I have to admit that it \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E add a little twist to the game here and there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve only played on low difficulty too, so maybe this goes away on higher levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer I haven\\\u0027t tried, but it sounds god awful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s asynchronous turned RTS. Meaning everyone is playing at their own pace, and if they operate fast enough they can play the game/advance/attack/move before you make your click.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds terribly frustrating. I think it MIGHT be okay if you\\\u0027re playing with a friend though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\\\u0027t played anything past Civ2, so I don\\\u0027t know what\\\u0027s real different from Civ4 and Civ5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are lots of combat bonuses that help/hinder you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee.g. attacking across a river takes a heavy toll on your unit\\\u0027s effectiveness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve played about 3.8 games and I\\\u0027ve almost put 50 hours into the game ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the large maps, making for really long games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmaller games/maps would encounter less lag I\\\u0027m sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m on steam often, so I could describe it a bit there or if you do get it we could try multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the game a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\\\u0027ve only played 3.8 games (and the .8 is the only one so far I\\\u0027m truly satisfied with due to the RAM issue), I feel like I got my money out of this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 hours is quite a bit. I didn\\\u0027t HATE those first 40 hours I played, it was just that the games ended with disappointment because of the severe AI turn lag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
