The ability to get up close and maneuver is just an afterthought really. That said, provided i do have to fight up close and personal, id much rather be in a AKS ship then in a drek or one of the super massive vessels many players here have that have very sluggish acceleration and turning capability.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/V8DKg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/V8DKg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was a little test run vs a drek i did, not only does my armor let me take some hits from popper-Hs, but the weapons i have just vaporize dreks. There was some luck as i have had tests where the 1st shot cut the SK-CRV-I in two, but not once has it been completely distroyed with a single shot, either the rear survives with usually engines and 2 torpedoes left, or the front survives with ibeams and 2 torpedoes left. The drek as you can see does survive, but if we go with logic, that is a dead ship as it cant move or do anything but be used to rearm someone else as the entire rear was obliterated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to the kenji drek, the SK-CRV-I fairly balanced actually. It has less armor and is way more vulnurable to being tickled to death by fighters (engines are basically exposed and only wing covered, and weapons are completely exposed). That said, it is (from my experiences) a bit harder to wipe out with heavier weapons, due to both a lack of clipping and weakspots per say, and very small size making it hard to get your shots to connect. if you fire at low enough velocity to be accurate and guarantee a hit where you want, teh armor will usually stop the round before it hist anything critical, whereas if you fire at very high velocity to guarantee damage, you either phase through the entire craft, or miss altogether since its quite hard to hit a target of this size at 500\u002B m/s. Now there are angles where the odds of splitting it in half increase exponentially, but only shots from the front or rear at an angle stand a good chance of being particularly deadly, firing from teh side (it was originally intended to broadside targets), even the best werapons need a perfect phasing hit to connect with teh central girder, onlky then can you split it. If you think about it, the drek has better all around armor against most weapons, so it gets advantage there, but i have the edge in maneuverability and acceleration letting me get into a more favorable position and to some degree evade unguided weapons at anything but point blank range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff to the drawing board I go, to upgrade and innovate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: There\u0027s something fishy going on with your battleships, Arvin.

Yes it can and still will die to a solid hit, but way less of that instant rear part vaporized when hit by a Tripedo-M or popper knockoff. If you are willing to give up some range, dont clip a single fuel tank with another fuel tank, and if you must clip to fit them, be absolutely sure they are nowhere near or worse clipped into the root girder that is your spine. Ohh, and swap the mk1 LF tanks for FLT-400s (i have a mod that lets me swap fuel ratios and even remove all of one type of fuel from tank, but you ca alwasy edit the OXY to 0 and the LF to 400 in the .craft file without mods, myself i do not call this cheating, but if you do then i guess ull have to sacrifice some armor and use the MK1 LF tanks).
