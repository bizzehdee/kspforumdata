I see tons of new but mundane and useless parts. simplistic parts. stuff that is basically a mixed around combination of only a couple basic shapes. there\u0027s very little fine details, solid color texturing, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know everyone wants to make something, and old mods get forgotten, but I think it has kind of de-evolved KSP into a stream of mediocrity. It seems that many people are soo eager to make some type of mod, that they essentially just go into a modeling program, stretch a little here on a shape, maybe cut a little there, etc. all in all, 5 minutes of work if you know what you\u0027re doing and want to achieve. but that\u0027s not the type of modding we need, I don\u0027t need some mono colored 3 pronged triangular shunt that serves no purpose. I understand the need for simplicity for slower computers....but all I\u0027m basically seeing is combinations of simple basic shapes cobbled together and stretch along whatever axis, that primarily serve no purpose, not even aesthetically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow of course, no one has to use these parts....but people will. and with the influx of these types of parts, people will more likely come across these parts and load them up just because of their prevalence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewe\u0027ve still got some good modders floating around, but the majority of mods I\u0027m seeing over the last few months just aren\u0027t good at all....infact, many are more simplistic than the very early days of KSP modding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWant proof? look at the \u0022show us your pictures\u0022 thread. that thread USED to be filled with some pretty awesome and unique screenshots, I even added quite a few of my own to it. Now it\u0027s just filled with uninteresting, boring and basic images that anyone can achieve without even trying with simple basic images you might be able to take on your first playthrough of ksp ever. In essence, it\u0027s like how instagram de-evolved to pictures of extremely plain things. people instagramming their foot, a chair, a wall, their food, etc. just stuff that isn\u0027t picture worthy in general. much like many of these mods, which too aren\u0027t picture worthy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there\u0027s a distinct difference between \u0027stockalikes\u0027 and stuff that claims to be stockalike but are generally more simplistic than the stock parts themselves, while also being completely without aesthetics. I think these types of mods severely degrade the quality of KSP and defund it of innovation. There\u0027s only a small handful of new mods I can see that are on par with some of the long time popular mods. Kind of sad really. I came back expecting to see something worthwhile, and I\u0027m just not really seeing much of that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T18:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConfirming that KSP is dying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T18:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESturgeon\u0027s Law: 90% of everything is crap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre we seeing more mods being put out? Certainly, that comes with the increase in users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would posit however that while the fact that more mods are being put out means there are more of the \u0027simplistic\u0027 mods out there, there is also an increase in \u0027complex/polished\u0027 mods being released.

It has to expand my game somehow.
