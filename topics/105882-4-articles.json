I had to use the *Terrier*s to do it though. On the other hand, I had no problems at all with overheating this time.\n\n![PVRwK8X.png](http://imgur.com/PVRwK8X.png)\n\nI used a 45\\* ascent with four turbojets, and activated the NERVA at 7000m for a speed boost. This gives an apoapsis of around 60Km. I shut down the engines and closed the intakes when they got down to 20Kn each, then activated the *Terrier* engines. Those occupy the same space as two of the jets, which I guess makes it a hybrid engine. I shut those down once I\u0027d gotten a 75Km apoaspsis, and let the NERVA engine hold the apoapsis up while the craft left the atmosphere. Once it had, I activated them again and left them running until they ran out of oxidiser at about 2000m/s. The NERVA got it the rest of the way into an 80/81Km orbit with plenty of fuel for a deorbit burn, or possibly something even more ambitious. That part did require some very high angles to keep the apoapsis near the craft, but it wasn\u0027t too weak to do it.\n\n... Now I need to work out how to get it down without speedbrakes. Something to add next I think.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T16:10:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RedDwarfIV**"},{"CreatedByName":"Destroyer713","CreatedById":136956,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:35:32Z","Content":"The only problem I have with 1.0 SSTO\u0027s is that I have no idea what the proper accent profile is now.

After you have built enough you realize that some planes have better low or high altitude performance when they pile on speed. In past versions I would normally shoot for a plane with a flat acceleration curve through all altitudes, but in the new model that is causing my planes to blow up. Basically what it means is I want a slower plane at takeoff. So if I was to leave my ascent profile somewhere between 20 and 30 degrees the same as I did in .90 I would have to do compensate doing the following: Since jets have mountains of power at lower altitudes I build the plane with less jet engines leaving the plane slightly underpowered so it does not blow up in the thicker atmosphere all the while it is slowly trucking the majority of my fuel to a higher altitude before lighting the secondary engines. My lesson is use the jets for moving heavy weight to altitude and not so much for acceleration. In real terms that means you have to depend less on jets for speed and more for heavy lifting, switching modes on my rapiers faster, closing intakes etc etc. If you have a plane saved from an older version of KSP that dragged butt at low altitudes but quickly accelerated higher than 20k I would load it up and use that as a test bed. What I think a lot of players are running into is they throttle back to keep the plane from blowing up at max Q (pressure) but when they exit on the other side they hit the jet altitude limits if they are flying a straight ascent profile."},{"CreatedByName":"raygundan","CreatedById":78300,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:52:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Or two or three..

I still need to tweak it (it lacks airbrakes of any sort).\n\nIts difficult to pilot though... it can\u0027t break mach 1 in a climb, or even level flight... my flight profile was to ascend to 7km, then enter a shallow dive, as it exceeds mach one, the engine power increases, and I slowly pull out of the dive, reach level flight and speed up (which increases engine output), and then start climbing again... i was able to reach 1,300 m/s before switching to rockets (closed cycle on the rapiers wasn\u0027t used.. the TWR wasn\u0027t really needed, and they have a lower Isp).\n\nAn earlier verion had 24 instead of 28 engines, and could still break mach 1 and get to at least 1,200 m/s before switching to rockets, but I decided to give it more power to make the ascent easier.\n\nIt has some OX-stat panels in the forward cargobay (where the reaction wheels, probe core, batteries, and extendable solar panels are kept)... nothing vaporized during the ascent... but heat transfer slowly did its work, and at 64 km, long after engines were cut, I lost 2x OX-stats...\n\nIt was 487 tons on the runway, and I think it was 337 tons in orbit.... but ... dat payload capacity....\n\nLets summarize:\n\n3x orange tanks (well 2 \u002B 2 half orange tanks): 3\\*36 = 108 tons\n\n8018 Liquid fuel left: 8018/6400\\*32 = 40 tons of Liquid Fuel remaining\n\n10868 Oxidizer left: 10868/6400\\*32 = 54 tons of OX\n\n54\u002B40\u002B108 = 202 tons of payload \u002B usable resources delivered to orbit\n\n **202 tons to orbit!**\n\nInside a large aeroshell.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t count as a useful payload... I don\u0027t know what would. \n\nNote, as the aeroshell base is still attached, you can get 100% recovery - fuel costs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T22:22:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:09:22Z","Content":"You should post that in stock payload challenge!"},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:42:01Z","Content":"What annoys me personally is that the new aero system does not like planes with lots of wing parts, and does not consider the actual layout of the wings. For me, aesthetics are almost more important than the actual practicality of the craft, and the problem with restricted wing usage is that I can\u0027t really build what I want. Instead everything becomes a tube with engines and two efficient swept wings along the sides. That\u0027s ugly, nobody wants to fly that kind of plane and it limits creativity.
