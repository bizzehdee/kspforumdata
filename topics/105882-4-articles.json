I had to use the \u003Cem\u003ETerrier\u003C/em\u003Es to do it though. On the other hand, I had no problems at all with overheating this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/PVRwK8X.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PVRwK8X.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used a 45* ascent with four turbojets, and activated the NERVA at 7000m for a speed boost. This gives an apoapsis of around 60Km. I shut down the engines and closed the intakes when they got down to 20Kn each, then activated the \u003Cem\u003ETerrier\u003C/em\u003E engines. Those occupy the same space as two of the jets, which I guess makes it a hybrid engine. I shut those down once I\u0027d gotten a 75Km apoaspsis, and let the NERVA engine hold the apoapsis up while the craft left the atmosphere. Once it had, I activated them again and left them running until they ran out of oxidiser at about 2000m/s. The NERVA got it the rest of the way into an 80/81Km orbit with plenty of fuel for a deorbit burn, or possibly something even more ambitious. That part did require some very high angles to keep the apoapsis near the craft, but it wasn\u0027t too weak to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...

After you have built enough you realize that some planes have better low or high altitude performance when they pile on speed. In past versions I would normally shoot for a plane with a flat acceleration curve through all altitudes, but in the new model that is causing my planes to blow up. Basically what it means is I want a slower plane at takeoff. So if I was to leave my ascent profile somewhere between 20 and 30 degrees the same as I did in .90 I would have to do compensate doing the following: Since jets have mountains of power at lower altitudes I build the plane with less jet engines leaving the plane slightly underpowered so it does not blow up in the thicker atmosphere all the while it is slowly trucking the majority of my fuel to a higher altitude before lighting the secondary engines. My lesson is use the jets for moving heavy weight to altitude and not so much for acceleration. In real terms that means you have to depend less on jets for speed and more for heavy lifting, switching modes on my rapiers faster, closing intakes etc etc. If you have a plane saved from an older version of KSP that dragged butt at low altitudes but quickly accelerated higher than 20k I would load it up and use that as a test bed. What I think a lot of players are running into is they throttle back to keep the plane from blowing up at max Q (pressure) but when they exit on the other side they hit the jet altitude limits if they are flying a straight ascent profile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raygundan","CreatedById":78300,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Renegrade\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Renegrade\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr two or three..
