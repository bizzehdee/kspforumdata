However I do have one concern. To what extent is CMES not supported with career? If its just balancing issues with node placement i can live with. But if theres parts that wont even show up at all in the tech tree then maybe ill hold off for the time being in that particular save.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m kind of curious about that myslef.

Is this an original mod, with parts and plugins exclusive to this mod? Or, is this just a collection of other mods/pieces of mods bundled together as a sort of \u0027modpack\u0027 deal to create a specific gameplay experience?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a rather large pack, I\u0027m not so inclined to load up a new install just to find out what it is. If it is original, I\u0027ll certainly give it a go...it looks cool from the couple screens you\u0027ve shown. If it\u0027s just a large modpack, though, I\u0027ll pass for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ok, I see the line that says it\u0027s modified parts and original parts. That line might be better suited at the very top of the thread, and in a font size that stands out more than the rest. I passed it right up the first 2 times I looked it over.
