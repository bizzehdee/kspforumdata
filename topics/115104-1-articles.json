From your shown stats, the SSTO can make it. What i can tell from the picture is, you have too many intakes. 2 per engine is by far enough (i have a 12 engine SSTO that uses only 8 intakes). This will reduce weight and drag, giving you even more delta V and better acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i can\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t tell from the picture is, how the center of weight is in relation to the center of lift. If you switch on both markers, the center of lift should be inside the center of mass, just a little bit to the back and a bit more up for optimum stability. If you empty all your tanks, the center of lift MUST stay behind the center of mass, otherwise your SSTO will flip when it is almost dry.

At higher altitudes you will noticeably accelerate much faster. If you notice, reduce your ascent angle and get all the speed you can before nosing back up and switching to rocket power. Do not coast to apoapsis until you have reached space. Otherwise you will loose part of your precious speed to gravity and drag, so keep your engines running on low thrust until you leave atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:33:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn topic: can\u0027t see your CoL and CoM pics but you appear to have active control surfaces in front and in the back( I assume the from are pitch control and the back are roll) but you don\u0027t have yaw control.

I\u0027ve enjoyed the thread. The most difficult spaceplane I ever made in terms of getting to orbit (and back) was a rocket-only plane. This was several KSP versions ago and was before we got the Rapier. After much experimentation I ended up using IIRC 3 aerospikes. Obviously adding air breathers to a spaceplane makes it much easier to get into orbit. Version 1.0.4 ensures good results with the Rapier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI comparison tested all engines and graphed the results (see sig line). However, these are vertically launched and not piloted in order to keep results more consistent. The Rapier Mix flight required that the mode change automatically. I\u0027m sure that the already good altitude result would have been better by manual switching. I recall the ship flamed out and coasted several seconds before auto-switching to closed cycle, so manual switching is best, per earlier posts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T02:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh long day felt better knowing I got that puppy into orbit earlier.
