When I dragged to my KSP folder I noticed two distinct things from the tutorial videos I have seen, first no plugins folder, secondly I do not have a \u0022plugindata\u0022 folder, nor a \u0022Patcher_data\u0022 folder. So I went ahead and made a \u0022plugins\u0022 folder and dropped in the .dll plug in. I then went to the parts folder (in the recently downloaded zip) and dragged all of the parts (folders) into the \u0022Parts\u0022 folder on KSP. All looks well, the \u0022mumech_mech....\u0022 folders all show up in the parts folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when I start the game I see in the loading bar all the mumech_..... parts flash as they load and as the bar goes by, yet when I build a rocket none of the parts show up.
