I compared the performance of Win x32 version versus Linux x64 (xubuntu 14.04) with NVidia drivers and tested exactly the same save with exactly the same number of mods. Then tested a clean install without mods just to be sure. Then I tested Win x32 with forced open gl rendering and finally I tested Linux x32 version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, from what I saw, Windows x32 version (DirectX) won in terms of FPS. In some cases it was like 25 fps on Windows vs 12 fps on Linux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is - is there anything I could do to raise the fps rate on Linux? I would really like the benefits of 64-bit version but not at the cost of FPS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T10:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnnoy software and driver developers so they invest as much time and effort in Linux performance as they do in Windows.
