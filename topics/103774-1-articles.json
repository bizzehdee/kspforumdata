I\u0027ve tested this in sandbox and science mode and no difference in either"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T01:53:43Z","Content":"This sounds like an install issue. A pic of your GameData folder would be helpful. \n\nAlso, not all of the KAS parts are storable. The winches I know aren\u0027t.
