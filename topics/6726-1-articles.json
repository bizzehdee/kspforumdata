The Tricoupled Boosters (12 engines) get me to the stratosphere straight up. Then, the 4-sided enhanced design of your craft gets me almost to orbit. With four full tanks and one engine.

Those poor guys found themselves stuck there forever. My second landing hit a bug in the game or something. I landed with zero velocity in good working order, minus two broken wings. Then, I positioned the camera to see Kerbal and hit time compression so I could watch it go through phases. I did this on the first flight with no problems.

First, you can\\\u0027t see the CM until jettisoning the boosters unless you move the camera, no big deal. The second however is more serious, but not a problem if you fly it correctly. My design does not like changing direction under power until after the seperation of the four booster stacks. I lose all control if I attempt pitch-over under power. It\\\u0027s not intuitive, but also not a problem. The thing climbs like a bat out of hell! Going straight up at launch, I can achieve apoasis of 70K when I\\\u0027m at 40K altitude.
