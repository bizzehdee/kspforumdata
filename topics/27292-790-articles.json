Friday I installed the Action Group Manager mod to try and fix a few outstanding issues with Bob\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EFireball 7c \u003C/em\u003Ecraft (namely to add a group that would allow me to fire off the gravioli detector without having to actually push the button on the part everytime - some of those Mun biomes are pretty small from 60k up). I landed Theogel and Verise in their \u003Cem\u003EWildcat 7\u003C/em\u003E craft on Mun and began drilling operations in earnest there, though for some reason their mission wouldn\u0027t continue when I went away to do things with Bob (you know, the drills are supposed to continue going in the background - theirs didn\u0027t work for some reason). Ultimately I had to stay with the craft while it filled up - I was ultimately able to fill up and refuel the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E successfully, though that was the last thing I did on Sunday...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, I was able to fill up the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat 7\u003C/em\u003E craft assigned to Minmus fully with fuel and ore, so it was sent up for a successful rendezvous with the Minmusport space station. On arrival, the craft was able to deliver sufficient fuel to \u003Cem\u003EEnola Gay\u003C/em\u003E - Cerxie\u0027s craft with a group of tourists that had been parked at the station for the past few days - so that the ship was able to finally head for home. The Minmus Wildcat is still awaiting the arrival of the station\u0027s Refinery module; when it arrives, she\u0027ll have a full load of ore ready and waiting. I\u0027m really happy with the Minmus mining operation, but it\u0027s pretty clear that where it\u0027s really need right now is at Mun - and that\u0027s one\u0027s not doing so well.

At least I have the money for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob\u0027s science mission was going fairly well - he had collected high space gravioli readings from all fifteen of Mun\u0027s biomes and successfully collected all surface and low-space experiment readings from the Polar Crater, Poles and Polar Lowlands. However, he decided to try for a fourth landing at the Northern Basin. The landing went well and he did get the low-space and surface readings for the biomes, but he only has 400 m/s of delta-V left in his craft, not enough to return to orbit - and I sure as hell ain\u0027t transmitting all that science back to Kerbin (I wouldn\u0027t even if Bob had an antenna, which he doesn\u0027t). The Fireball does not have refueling capabilities - at least not yet.
