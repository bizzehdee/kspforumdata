I think I was less than half the efficiency\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAttempt 4: I half emptied the second fuel tank and still couldn\u0027t come close to matching the performance of the first flight. Those tanks are heavy\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAttempt 5: I swapped out the half full PB-X150 for the PB-X50R, swapped out the OKTO prode core I was using for the OKTO2 and, with touch of inflight fuel re-balancing at the halfway point, I comfortably made it to orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, based on those tests concluding in a successful result I can pretty accurately state that a TWR of less than 0.35 is going to result in two problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELack of sunlight because your ascent is too shallow\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHeavy empty fuel tanks you have to haul upward\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything higher the a TWR of 0.4 is probably going to mean that you won\u0027t have enough fuel to get to orbit. As you can see on my craft, I used only what was absolutely essential. I don\u0027t even trust the weightless batteries enough to not even use them. I took off at just before noon a flew east flavouring climbing over speed until 30km altitude. I would say that I may be able to go back and use the PB-X150 with the OKTO2 and make and attempt at a Munshot with return. I wouldn\u0027t count that out but, you will have to get pretty tricky with your flight. One idea would be to fly north and hang the panels in a sail arrangement like you do with interplanetary probes. But, I never really thought that plan through as the amount of daylight flying east should always be enough based on issue two of the underpowered craft design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an afterthought. I\u0027m seeing a lot of designs with big-ass wings getting close but never quite getting there even though they have a lot of fuel left. The problem with wings at altitude is drag which means that you don\u0027t get a good high speed high altitude run at the top of your ascent. That means that you get caught out trying to reach orbital speed with the sun sliding past the horizon. It\u0027s best to only take just enough lift that you need and not more. Hey, just like everything else in the design!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Is Nedal using droptanks? I was describing an SSTO.

Take-off at 10-15 degrees and keep adjusting your pitch upwards as long as you have 10\u002Bm/s vertical. Find the angles that give you the best vertical speed. At about 15km you should be at 30 degrees and your vertical will start increasing. At about 20km you are going to have to re-balance the craft by taking the remaining gas in the X50 and moving it to the X150 to keep you nose up. You want to get to a target vertical of at least 50m/s but 100m/s is better. At about 25km you are going to start losing lift from your wings and so start pitching down gradually making sure your vertical speed is not too high that you will start losing lift. This maneuver will continue to 35km whereby you should be over 1.5km/s and getting to space is trivial at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should point out that even at late morning you have to balance your AoA precisely because too shallow and you waste energy on horizontal drag. Too steep and you lose sunlight and power. That was part of the fun for me. Most of my flights had the power bar either growing or shrinking at all times! You could throw some more solar panels on it to have a more forgiving ascent corridor.
