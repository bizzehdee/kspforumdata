After few RCS maneuvers, I opened the doors, catched the container and closed the doors.

Physics is disabled when time warp is started, which means ships which are not connected to each other pass right through each other. If you have a few days to pass, you could do it this way in 4x physics warp but it would take a LONG time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vicwarrior","CreatedById":120410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T18:52:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewithout a docking port connection or a claw grab the game will calculate the two ships as diferent entities, since time warp has to ignore physic calculations in order to be able to speed up the game the two ships will start ignoring eachother, effectively making it so the hitchiker pod separates from your rescue vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BluetoothThePirate","CreatedById":75760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T01:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe missions rely on the claw, those contracts only unlock once the claw is researched.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaliPotter","CreatedById":77587,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T02:18:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s another problem. I tryed the claw technique and it worked fine. But when I returned to Kerbin\u0027s orbit, I left to Space Center and made a Savegame. When I returned to the ship later to complete the mission, when I burned retrograde, then tryed to warp time a little bit, everything stopped turning. The ship is accelerating at its own, I can\u0027t maneuver it, I can\u0027t time warp anymore, it says \u0022ship under acceleration\u0022, and I tryed this with other satellites in orbit, same thing, even with several other savegames, the game is ruined!!!!! Tell me it has a solution, because I searched on google, a lot of people talk about this bug but no answers!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
