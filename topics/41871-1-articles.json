XD\u003Cp\u003EOkay yeah, the Ion Engine\u0027s TWR sucks. It\u0027s quite a ways below 1, whereas the NERVA can lift its own mass... almost three times over, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine doesn\u0027t fly on its own though, and the LV-N needs fuel. It needs at least its own mass in fuel to really get anywhere when already in orbit, and that\u0027s with nothing else weighing it down. It also kinda needs to carry all of its fuel with itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ion Engine also needs fuel. It also needs that pesky electricity, in rather large amounts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the thing: Electricity comes from the Sun, via solar panels. In unlimited quantities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, the Ion Engine only needs to carry the Xenon, which is 1/120th of the thing that propels it. Yeah, there\u0027s the solar panels, but the amount of mass you save in Xenon is massive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line: A NERVA probe will need 20 tons of mass to have the same delta-V as an Ion probe of 2 tons. Sure, it\u0027ll get there faster, and likely with less hassle, but I still think it\u0027s quite indicative. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T06:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022astropapi1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022astropapi1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey should be nerfed if anything.\u003Cp\u003EReally, they\u0027re like mainsails compared to the real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever in real world you don\u0027t mind doing week long burns with the ion engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be pretty boring in KSP.
