But next time when loading a save game which have various vessels built with such parts lead to crash (the VAB/SPH scene is very very very slow, so slow that sometime unity engine is stuck and windows claim the game doesn\u0027t respond), in the log, there are plenty of line like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cp\u003E at Part.OnTriggerStay (UnityEngine.Collider other) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(more than spamming in fact)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd many time games just decide to crash without such slowdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, such crashes appears when I use multiple convex colliders on a part created with many meshes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the choice we\u0027ve got for now is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-using 1 single damned convex collider and having ridiculous parts which work \u0022well\u0022,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-using more convex colliders or not convex ones and suffer from random crashes, but with nicer parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, stock parts colliders are really bad (when they exists, z400 battery is weird when trying to put a small solar panel on it) and have to be improve (flat parts are \u0022inside\u0022 the tank for example without mentioning the weird angle with symmetry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T17:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThing is, non-convex collisions are hard.
