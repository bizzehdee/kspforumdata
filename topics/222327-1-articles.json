I\u0027m Kimera Industries, and I have been playing KSP for at least... um... a year, I think? Steam has done a horrible job of keeping track of how many hours I\u0027ve logged, but if I had to guess, it\u0027d be around a thousand. Maybe more. My computer is far from the best, but I make do. To make the game playable, I made a lot of sacrifices in my graphics, which is why all my screenshots look like they are from pre-alpha KSP. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0My most impressive mission is my Jool 5, and I\u0027ll finish my mission report for it in a bit.

In theory, I could load it up again just fine, but career mode has fallen out of favor for me a lot. I just don\u0027t like the way it handles... everything. I like science mode a lot more. I enjoy seaplanes, *a lot,* but KSP\u0027s water physics makes for some sad ends to potentially awesome projects. My best seaplane was my recreation of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Mayo_Composite\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMayo Composite. \u003C/a\u003EDon\u0027t know why I ever gave up on that...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003ELike many players, I went into KSP not knowing anything about anything and immediately killed Jeb and Val. After learning how to use dark magic to revive them, I took the time to play through the tutorials and actually began playing the game. It\u0027s all been uphill from there, I guess.
