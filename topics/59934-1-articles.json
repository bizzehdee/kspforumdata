If however, like myself, you find manual docking more satisfying, do like Kasuha said and aim for a contact velocity of about 0.1-0.2 m/s. I think once they are in range they pull toward each other at about 0.2 m/s anyway, so you might notice a slight increase in speed at the very end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T10:58:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd sometimes once you get within 0.2m, the magnets kick in, and pull the spacecraft towards each other, but they don\u0027t quite dock properly.
