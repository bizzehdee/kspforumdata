I started at the launch pad, headed East and never looked back. Now I just got a contract to rescue a dude from high Kerbin orbit, out by Minimus. First step, get my rescue ship into orbit. Second step, visit the tanker to fuel up. Third step: realize the dude in distress is travelling backwards in his orbit. So I revert to launch and head West this time. First stop: the tanker. Oh wait, the tanker is now heading in the wrong direction. I can\u0027t get to it! (you know what I mean)\n\nAre there enough times you need a tanker orbiting in the anhedrical direction to warrant putting two tankers in orbit? If not, is there any way to tell before you accept a contract what direction the dude in distress is heading? What\u0027s the best direction for stations orbiting the Mun ? Thanks in advance.\n\np.s. I just made up the word \u0022anhedrical.\u0022 What is the language to specify the direction of the orbit?

Other than that you can meet with your tanker and reach minmus as you always do then change your minmus orbit inclanation right when you enter its soi. It should\u0027t cost you more than 150dV if you do it right when you enter its soi and don\u0027t wait to get into an orbit.

Prograde orbits are rotating the same way as the parent, retrograde orbits are in the opposite direction.\n\nIf you intend to accept a lot of rescue contracts and your rescue craft need top-ups, then it sounds like a retrograde tanker could work for you.

Well think it this way then the higher your orbit gets your orbital speed will get slower. Minmus is moving at 270m/s velocity which means to get into a retrograde orbit at that hight you would need to spend 270 \u002B 270= 540m/s. You are allready going up there to meet with the kerbal anyways. Well still 540m/s could be a big number indeed and launching into the right inclanation to meet would be more effective for sure. If you think you can spare that much dV for the inclanation change then go with your usual launch, if not your only solution is to have another fueling tanker at retrograde orbit. \n\nNow that i think about it again here is another thing you can do. After you meet with your tanker get your Apoapsis up to the point where you need to meet with the kerbal that needs to be rescued. When you reach your apoapsis your speed will probably be really slow since you will start falling after you pass that point. Right at that time do a retrograde burn while you are still moving horizontal to Kerbin. You will probably need only a bit more than half the dV to change your inclanation then changing it at a circle orbit at that height. After that you will need to burn a bit more and create a circle orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T11:06:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 11:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T10:31:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m sure some people could do it without stopping at a tanker.

This game makes my head spin sometimes!\n\nEven better than switching your orbital direction once you reach Minmus is performing a mid-course adjustment to make sure you cross the correct side of Minmus on your way there; if you need a prograde orbit, stay to the right of Minmus (or whatever side is turning away from you) and for a retrograde orbit stay to the left. You can change your direction, inclination, and altitude of your orbit by making a tiny burn (as in 10m/s tiny) a little while after you finish your transit burn; I usually do it once I\u0027m about a quarter of the way there. Burning normal or anti-normal will put you in a polar orbit or change your inclination up or down; radial and anti-radial will determine which side of the object you cross."},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T10:49:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As far as changing direction when I am far away from Kerbin being more efficient, are you sure about that?

So cheap that I doubt it would be any advantage to launch retrograde at Kerbin (since then it takes more dV to get into orbit, you fight kerbin\u0027s rotation).\n\nOberth effect is about the change in energy for a given burn.\n\nPlane changes should always be done as slowly as possible.\n\nConsider a highly eliptical orbit, at perapsis, you\u0027re doing ~3,100 m/s\n\nAt apoapsis, you are doing ~150 m/s\n\nTo reverese direction at perapsis, you have to cancel 3,100 m/s of forward velocity, and accelerate 3,100 m/s in the other direction... a dV of 6,200 m/s to accomplish a 180 degree plane change.\n\nAt apoapsis... its 150 \u002B 150... a mere 300 m/s to do a 180 degree plane change.\n\nDon\u0027t fight your KE (kinetic energy), store it up as PE (potential energy) as your craft heads towards apoapsis... then when your velocity is really low, you can change your direction easily, and the velocity comes back as your craft falls back down from apoapsis, and PE goes to KE again.\n\nOf course, in a Hohmann transfer, you match orbits at PE, rather than dropping back down to PE... but you end in a higher energy orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T12:23:04Z","Content":"Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T15:17:16Z","Content":"If your tanker is situated to accommodate vessels leaving the launch pad, then leave it there. Vehicles can be engineered to meet the needs of specific missions. You can calculate what will be needed for any mission using your tanker as your baseline. Plot a course from the tanker itself and you will find how much delta V is required.\n\nEven if you have a rather eccentric orbit to hit, starting from the tanker will work. The simplest way is to plot your maneuver to intersect your Apoapsis with an ascending or descending node of the intended orbit and another maneuver at that point to match the orbit (this takes a bit of \u0022eyeballing\u0022 your maneuver to get an intersection of your Apo and the intended orbit track). \n\nThis may not be the most efficient as it often will include radial burns to match the orbit. If you are attempting a rendezvous (like OP\u0027s example), you will want to plot the course at a time when the target will also be at the AN or DN (when you arrive!). Since your target is in a high orbit you may have to wait a bit to gain the proper intersection, but also will save delta V as you are performing the maneuver at the slowest point of your orbit. (For more efficiency, rendezvous at the node which is farther from Kerbin)\n\nLike others have offered, you may decide to bypass your tanker depending on the pros and cons of the mission, but I don\u0027t think having a tanker in a retrograde orbit will add much future benefit for your program."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T17:54:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Vehicles can be engineered to meet the needs of specific missions.

The Isp listed for each engine gives a fair approximation as far as efficiency, but you will have to do your own work to figure out delta V on your vessel.\n\nThe mod community steps in where Squad leaves off, and there are a few mods that will calculate for you.
