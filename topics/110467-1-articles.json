Well think it this way then the higher your orbit gets your orbital speed will get slower. Minmus is moving at 270m/s velocity which means to get into a retrograde orbit at that hight you would need to spend 270 \u002B 270= 540m/s. You are allready going up there to meet with the kerbal anyways. Well still 540m/s could be a big number indeed and launching into the right inclanation to meet would be more effective for sure. If you think you can spare that much dV for the inclanation change then go with your usual launch, if not your only solution is to have another fueling tanker at retrograde orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that i think about it again here is another thing you can do. After you meet with your tanker get your Apoapsis up to the point where you need to meet with the kerbal that needs to be rescued. When you reach your apoapsis your speed will probably be really slow since you will start falling after you pass that point. Right at that time do a retrograde burn while you are still moving horizontal to Kerbin. You will probably need only a bit more than half the dV to change your inclanation then changing it at a circle orbit at that height. After that you will need to burn a bit more and create a circle orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T11:06:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 11:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T10:31:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarkGravity\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DarkGravity\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m sure some people could do it without stopping at a tanker.
