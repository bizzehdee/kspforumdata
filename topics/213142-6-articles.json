I don\u0027t want the downfall of Intercept Games, or Take-Two Interactive, or Private Division.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo. I want this game to become a case study in how to make a bad release of a game, so that the whole video game industry can finally learn that it\u0027s been doing things the wrong, stupid way for over 10 years now (or at least the AAA gaming industry has), and finally start releasing games that are FULL GAMES ON RELEASE again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDay one DLC doesn\u0027t matter to me. Neither does day one patches.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat matters, is that the game is playable upon release. KSP 2 is not currently in a state I would call playable. I keep playing it for a short time here and there to check if anything\u0027s changed, and every time I do that, I encounter some kind of bug (often the same \u0022rocket is too wobbly, build smaller and don\u0027t go anywhere other than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 bug) that just frustrates me so much I stop playing for at least that day if not more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really mind having the game run at 5 FPS with my RTX 3070 Ti GPU and i7-9700k CPU running at 4.6 Ghz (overclocked from the stock speed of 3.6 Ghz), with my 32 GB of DDR4-3200mhz ram.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can make the game lag that much with a rocket that has only 50 parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes that level of performance is unacceptable, considering that it took over 500 parts to get that level of lag in KSP1, on my previous system that wasn\u0027t even close to as good as the one I\u0027m using now.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut I\u0027ve played KSP (and other famously low FPS and/or unoptimized games) for so long that 5 FPS is something I can still play in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now I\u0027m looking at KSP 2 like a disappointed father looks at their kid.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s the \u0022I\u0027m not angry, but this is unacceptable, and you need to do better, now take a moment to think about what you\u0027ve done that got you here\u0022 look.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m sure you know the feelings that look gives you. I know I do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s true. Given the circumstances, I\u0027m not angry at Intercept Games.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut it is undeniable that they need to do better.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn fact, once they iron out a lot of the bugs, they need to basically do a second launch campaign for this game, because everyone saw the state the game is in right now and went \u0022Nope, not playing that until it gets better\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLike I said, they should only do that 2nd launch campaign once they get it into a state where it\u0027s performing adequately and rockets aren\u0027t falling apart for no reason or turning into noodles because you used the \u0022wrong\u0022 part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and about those noodle rockets:\u003Cbr\u003E\nWobbly rockets need to be exterminated. It\u0027s no longer \u0022cute\u0022 and \u0022oh lol kerbal\u0022 when you have an interplanetary mission to Jool sitting on the pad, you go to launch it, and it folds in half and explodes on the way up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022You just need to use more struts\u0022 you say.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGuess what, tried that, no change. Well, OK, this time it folded 90 degrees and then exploded. So it bent less, but it still exploded.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve made rockets that have literally half the part count made up by struts and only struts (no other structural parts), and they STILL bend and explode.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn fact, sometimes putting more struts on them makes them explode SOONER.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere have to be other ways of introducing a structural consideration into the design requirements that don\u0027t involve the rocket flexing like it\u0027s made of a pool noodle and not \u003Cstrong\u003ESOLID METAL TANKS AND BEAMS AND THINGS THAT GENERALLY DON\u0027T BEND\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe don\u0027t even have the ability to control what auto-strutting is happening, if there is even any of that happening at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat ever happened to that Physics LOD thing I was hearing about? That made it sound like it would make rockets LESS wobbly, not more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother feature that couldn\u0027t make it to release day?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-15T19:51:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2023 07:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMore detail on why I\u0026#039;m disappointed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"didkodidko","CreatedById":226055,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T19:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrankly All I wanted is well behaving rovers (new physics) aaaaand L1 and L2 points \u002B some simplified n-body interactions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got none, I got less than before, but it\u0027s broken...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T20:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224259599\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678909853\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022226055\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022didkodidko\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n51 minutes ago, didkodidko said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrankly All I wanted is well behaving rovers (new physics) aaaaand L1 and L2 points \u002B some simplified n-body interactions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got none, I got less than before, but it\u0027s broken...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut none of that was ever promised!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketRockington","CreatedById":223189,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T21:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224259627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678913009\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225622\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Periple\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Periple said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut none of that was ever promised!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/226055-didkodidko/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022226055\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/226055-didkodidko/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@didkodidko\u003C/a\u003Edidn\u0027t say they were promised just that\u0027s what they wanted\u00A0 \u00A0And KSP2 did set a lot of expectations\u00A0 with respect to\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/tz41a6/kraken_is_dead_maybe/?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=android_app\u0026amp;utm_name=androidcss\u0026amp;utm_term=1\u0026amp;utm_content=share_button\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eslaying the kraken\u003C/a\u003E,\u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200602-developer-insights-4-%E2%80%93-ksp2-engineering/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethat physics would be enhanced beyond KSP1\u003C/a\u003E, that there would be\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/n-xM_e5x6oc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E n-body physics\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 Did they make an iron clad legal promise?
