Even holding those fixed the optimal launch trajectory is a hard problem (people write PhD dissertations on that sort of thing). Further, the most optimal ascent may not be possible for you (it may exceed aerodynamic or thermal limits).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general you want to minimize gravity losses while also holding down drag losses and steering losses. That involves getting as much horizontal velocity as you can as quickly as possible (in effect gravity losses are a function of how much you don\u0027t burn level with the horizon) while also making sure you get out of the atmosphere acceptably. Don\u0027t be tempted to over-enigne your launch vehicles, however--you may get to orbit with less delta V expended but you\u0027ll have paid more per tonne of payload in funds and mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SorryDave","CreatedById":119474,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-14T13:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccent profile is best determined by trial and error, along with the sometimes conflicting advice from experienced players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach rocket has a different optimum profile based mostly from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and drag.
