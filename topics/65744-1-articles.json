Most efficient overall is a small deorbit burn, a descent that goes halfway round Minmus, then a big landing burn to kill the horizontal speed. But also perfectly viable is a big deorbit burn and a near-vertical descent, then a smaller landing burn to kill the vertical speed. In that case, you need about 100 m/s of dV if you fall from 10km up. (I assumed constant gravity, so that\u0027ll be a slight overestimate, but then you want a safety margin anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Something I noticed on safety margins. Delta-v maps give about 3.2 to 3.4 km/s needed to go from (real world) lunar orbit to the Moon\u0027s surface and back. The Apollo LM had 4.7 km/s, around 40% extra. And remember that Neil landed with less than 30 seconds worth of fuel left on board Apollo 11.
