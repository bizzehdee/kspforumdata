It occurred to me that some of KSP fans might be interested in getting paid to do space simulation software work, so at the risk of being too commercial for this forum, let me pitch the job opening in my group:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceX is a US based advanced technology company founded by residing CEO and CTO, Elon Musk. SpaceX builds rockets and spacecraft from the ground up including cutting edge electronics, software, vehicle structures, and engine systems. The Falcon Launch Vehicle and Dragon Spacecraft programs are some of the most ambitious engineering systems in the world, designed to support our ultimate goals of aviation-like spaceflight capability and making humanity a multi-planet species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are actively seeking the brightest minds from all industries and technologies to continue building our world class team. Specifically, and relevant to this forum, we are seeking rock-star software engineers to join our simulation software team, where we develop complex physics-based simulations. Please note that an aerospace background is not required. In fact, we encourage fresh perspectives to problems by looking outside the typical industries. The main requirements are to have Jedi-like C\u002B\u002B skills and a keen eye for high-quality, high-performance software design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a Simulation Software Engineer, you will be uniquely involved with space vehicle development all the way from pre-design exploratory analysis to pre-flight checkouts and mission operations. You will directly support a variety of other groups such as Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC), Structures, Propulsion, Aerodynamics, Avionics, Flight Software, Software Test, Launch Operations, and Mission Operations. You will help develop the software framework that makes it easier for other groups to develop, test, and maintain simulation models. You will also develop simulation models that are not covered by other groups. The simulation group will be working on the Mars mission long before most of the company!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re interested, more details for the position and a link to apply are here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spacex.com/careers/position/3858\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.spacex.com/careers/position/3858\u003C/a\u003E.

I also plan on applying for 3 more tonight that I looked at yesterday so its kind of funny how you guys popped up today. How often do you guys look at positions and do you send out notifications if you don\u0027t select someone? I find that 90% of the companies I apply to don\u0027t tell me if I wasn\u0027t chosen which I could understand and deal with. I actually got an email last month from I believe it was Boeing for a position I applied to when I was in college back in 2010 saying they had selected someone else or closed the position...after 3 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am an Aerospace and Ocean Engineering double major from Virginia Tech 2011 class and currently work as a Mechanical Engineer for an antenna research company.
