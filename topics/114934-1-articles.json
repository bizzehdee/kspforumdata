You would have to plan a mission in which you change the asteroids orbit enough so that it will not strike Kerbin. This would of course require transporting enough DeltaV capability far away in the solar system and then meeting with the space rock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploding the rock might be fine too (like in Armageddon/Deep Impact), but changing the course over a long time and many orbits around the Kerbol would be exciting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this currently possible via some mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T10:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPossible most likely, maybe put this question in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604-1-0-4-Contract-Configurator-v1-5-0-2015-06-23\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EContractConfigurator\u003C/a\u003E thread, someone might pick up the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T20:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMod question moved to the mod subforums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
