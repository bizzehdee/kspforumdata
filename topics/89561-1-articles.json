Are emergency chutes an option?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy #1 method is to use the pontoons provided in the Firespitter mod. This is by far the best solution because they were specifically designed for this purpose. Not only do they work great but are also capable of steering on the water, which is next to impossible otherwise. Plus, you can optionally fit them with retractable, powered, steerable wheels to make the plane amphibious. Just be sure to right-click and jack the buoyancy setting up to make for each and every section of pontoon you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SXT mod also has some pontoons in it but these so far aren\u0027t very useful. Keep an eye on them for future development, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe USI Survivability Pack and SXT both have inflatable airbags. These work for landing but taking off again can be tricky, although it\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, there\u0027s stock. As mentioned above, radial intakes are probably the best floats. Build some girder structure below the plane\u0027s fuselage and attach however many stock radial intakes you want to it. It really doesn\u0027t take that many. You can also attach the Small Gear Bay to this same structure to make the plane amphibious, because the Small Gear Bay can survive the water. Another option is to build a boat hull out of structural panels but that makes it difficult to mount the wheels. Steering is a bit of a problem with stock boats/seaplanes, however. In general, you can only pivot in place using torque or RCS but can\u0027t do much about your direction of travel while moving, no matter how many rudders you have both above and below the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final thing. Be sure your rescue plane has a ladder that extends into the water. Otherwise, it will be next to impossible for the stranded Kerbals to get into the plane. They have great difficulty climing onto things from out of the water.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T15:14:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason water is so hard to land on is that you can sink through it. Your normal plane has wheels which can withstand fairly strong impacts (50 m/s), maybe a jet cockpit (45 m/s), but most the other parts are comparatively flimsy (8-12 m/s). On land, only the wheels hit, so the rest does fine. On water, the wheels hit, but they don\u0027t stop the plane. That means the flimsy bits hit. If your landing speed is slow enough you\u0027ll do fine, but that\u0027s painfully slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exception to parts being flimsy is the radial intakes. They can take 80 m/s impact speed for some reason. Trusses work well too, at 85 m/s, but they\u0027re much heavier and they don\u0027t have the side benefit of providing airflow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T15:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91066-The-Dukes-of-Kazzard-Buggy-Jump-Challenge%21?p=1525959\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1525959\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E this link\u003C/a\u003E for a video of someone who built a boat that appears to have long pontoons made of nothing but landing gear.
