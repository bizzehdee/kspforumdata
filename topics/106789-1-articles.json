It could be simply calculated by how much torque is being applied to a vessel in each axis, which would mean that any time the craft is tries to pint to a different heading than you, you would feel it. This would give the effect to a joystick from hard turns, g-force shaking, aerodynamic forces taking you off heading, and of course your craft being effected by \u0022lithobraking\u0022. \n\nI dont think there is much more to say, and I think it should be kept simple like this, but if anyone has feedback or suggestions let me know."}]}
