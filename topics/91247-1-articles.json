I had a xenon driven satellite out there. While the ion drive used a bit more electricity then was powered through solar panels and i wasn\u0027t super concentrated, i reached the point it went offline. Ion drive was still active, as electricity was slowly generated, but there was no way to make it react again, or go to spacecenter without abandoning the satellite (no loading allowed, it was still under accelleration because without the power to balance it, it began spinning around).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what i could still control was the xenon tank. Clicked the symbol to lock the tank, this powered off the ion drive and solars could start again loading batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if that\u0027s a feature to have a little chance or if its a bug and offline ships should stay offline.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T20:43:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOffline craft shouldn\u0027t stay offline, but the power was being consumed by the drive before the probe could react, mixed up priorities there :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thyriel","CreatedById":113679,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T11:55:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei know, but its strange that i can still lock / unlock resources while it\u0027s not reacting to anything else\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T11:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh that, no that\u0027s deliberate, if you really need to justify it, think of it as a low voltage wake-up circuit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
