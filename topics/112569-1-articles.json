(well, my wife tells me I\u0027m not funny, but what does she know?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I have so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 0: If MM will recognise Contract Packs as a mod for the :NEEDS flag - you\u0027d find the UFO using Anomaly Surveyor (completely optional, hence why this is Mission 0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 1: \u0022Mulder Kerman\u0022 is investigating the crashed UFO near the North Pole - go and pick him up and bring him back to KSC for debriefing. Possibly take \u0022Scully Kerman\u0022 to investigate the one on Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 2: The alien craft is emitting some kind of signal, it seems to be coming from Duna - go and investigate (would lead the player to the SSTV signal - or the Face of Duna if the SSTV signal can\u0027t be heard any more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissions 3 - ?: Bunch of stuff I haven\u0027t thought of yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Mission: You find a colony of \u0022aliens\u0022 living on - well I haven\u0027t decided. I\u0027m thinking it should be Laythe, but I also like the idea of making the player go all the way out to Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously there is the potential for a lot of overlap with Anomaly Surveyor here, so I\u0027ll have to work out how to keep it different to that pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said very high level, I might hash out the first couple of missions tonight, any input/suggestions/thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T18:06:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by severedsolo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astrofox","CreatedById":135785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T16:45:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks interesting, however, I am not so sure that Duna\u0027s SSTV signal can be heard now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I would like to rove/fly around collecting science for such missions on Duna, but it would probably be more of \u0022you land at specific coordinates and you collect science\u0022 just to complete the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, you could simply modify the recover module missions so that you have to go to land on Duna and collect science data within the radius of 40 meters of the part, or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:02:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Astrofox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Astrofox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks interesting, however, I am not so sure that Duna\u0027s SSTV signal can be heard now.\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I would like to rove/fly around collecting science for such missions on Duna, but it would probably be more of \u0022you land at specific coordinates and you collect science\u0022 just to complete the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, you could simply modify the recover module missions so that you have to go to land on Duna and collect science data within the radius of 40 meters of the part, or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats a shame if SSTV isn\u0027t there any more.
