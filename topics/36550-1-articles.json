Climb slowly from 15k, preferrably within 10 degrees over the horizon, so that you can push the plane to the fastest possible speed without losing air. As you go faster, you get more air intake, allowing yourself to climb even higher without flameouts, allowing yourself to speed up more due to lesser drag. When air intake gets into 15-10% area, cut the throttle of the engine to 75% and continue to climb, that will cut air intake requirements significantly and will delay the flameout further. Cut the throttle further just before the switch if you can sustain the vertical speed with it. Also, don\u0027t forget to watch your prograde vector on the navball and pitch upwards: at high altitudes, nothing ever flies horizontally oriented as there is too little air to hold you. If you want to fly horizontally, find an angle of attack that will keep you there, which will be noticeably higher than horizon. When I\u0027m saying \u0022climb within 10 degrees\u0022 , that\u0027s your prograde marker, not your spaceplane orientation, which could be 30 degrees up even.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you should be going no slower than 1200-1500m/s and no lower than 25km at the point of switching to oxidizer. Return to full throttle upon switching to it, keep going almost horizontally while stabilizing yourself with RCS. It\u0027s best not to burn upwards, keep burning almost horizontally, maybe 20 degrees upwards if you insist on reducing little drag that is left at this point even faster. Getting extremely long trajectory to AP is better than getting up there with a steep trajectory as it will be a lot easier to circularize when you already have most of the orbital velocity needed. Ideally, you will only need a quite short push at AP to raise your PE over the surface and into low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E===\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tidus Klein","CreatedById":72277,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T14:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECloudx the best way I can say it with out pics is this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the B9 hyper sonic front stick the S2 sas wheel the S2 wide body intake adapter on it 4 or 5 wide body LFO tanks wide body 3.25 adapter then hook up two HL 2 M cargo bays and the wide tail ramp.

There are two basic types: Pure rocket SSTO\u0027s, and hybrid jet/rocket SSTO\u0027s. In both cases, Mechjeb helps a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume that you\u0027re trying to build a hybrid jet/rocket spaceplane. I have built such a spaceplane with a jet TWR of only 2.40, and a rocket TWR of only 1.07, and it flies like a dream. In theory, I could probably go lower and still get to orbit. Your spaceplane has extra TWR, which is always a good position to be in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines are like SRB\u0027s, except they have controllable thrust and wickedly awesome specific impulse. The specific impulse is so amazingly high, in almost all cases, you need not worry about \u0027wasting\u0027 fuel with an inefficient ascent trajectory in the low atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommended ascent trajectory:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo 8 Km - 10-20 degree ascent (If you are really hardcore and need to save jet fuel for some reason, fly it like a rocket at 70-80 degree ascent)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo 12 Km - Level out ascent slowly, to ~5 degree ascent. Make absolutely sure your green velocity indicator is near the horizon, but just slightly ascending. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo 20 Km - Maintain ~5 degree ascent and build crazy velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo 25 Km - Begin shutting down your outermost jet engines to prevent asymmetric flameout. VERY carefully begin climbing again. Use the Mechjeb ascent guidance to slowly raise the nose of your aircraft. Do not fly manually. If you pitch up too violently, your aircraft will spin and likely fly apart. Try and go for 10-15 degree ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo 35 Km - Your velocity should be nearing 2 Km/sec. If it is not, you needed to build more velocity from 12-25 Km. Your TWR will drop as you shut off engines; as soon as it drops below 1, fire your rockets. As you exit the (flyable) atmosphere, pitch up to 45 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to go this high on turbojets alone, use a stack bicoupler on the front of every engine assembly, with two ram air intakes per engine. If you can put more on elsewhere, even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally aim for an apoapsis around 180 Km. If all goes well, your rocket burn to establish apoapsis will last only a few seconds. Another short burn ( \u0026lt;400 Delta-V) as you reach Apoapsis will circularize your orbit, leaving you with thousands of additional delta-V for your exo-orbital mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not tried putting LV-N Atomic Rocket Motors on an SSTO spaceplane in lieu of ordinary liquid-fuel rockets, but they also have specific impulse analogous to that of jet engines. If you have a large enough spaceplane with a high enough rocket-fire altitude, the amount of fuel you require in order to do things goes WAY down, and the heaviest component of the plane would be the LV-N\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother word of advice - use a liquid fuel rocket with thrust-vectoring. Toroidal Aerospike Rockets are really only useful for pure rocket SSTO\u0027s, which need good specific impulse on the runway as well as during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
