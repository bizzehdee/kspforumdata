Also related to this, whenever I\u0027m setting a maneuver point that\u0027s really far away from anywhere, I have to zoom in or out and rotate just enough so that the maneuver point is right in front of my view. So basically 2 suggestions here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Give the zoom feature of the map screen a preset. Something like 1st level zoom is the whole planet/moon, 2nd level zoom is the planet to the farthest moon, 3rd level zoom is whole planet SOI, 4th and 5th level is for the Sun SOI (because it\u0027s so damn big). This will save time and hassle of 5 seconds of scrolling in and out, and make interplanetary travels much more comfortable. Of course, you can use something like fine controls to zoom in the traditional way, if you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A \u0027click and drag\u0027 mode in map view. This will make setting and adjusting maneuver node much easier because you don\u0027t have to guess how much zoom you need to do from a center point and rotate the camera until the maneuver node is right in front of your face. Once you\u0027re done, you can double-click on something to revert back to the old mode of view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T18:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a complete fix but you can press tab to scroll through the different planets/moons and any maneuver nodes you have set up.
