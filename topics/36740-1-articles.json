A tip(s) for you, you NEED ASAS to go ANYWHERE (unless you are that cool) you want to stay straight 90 degrees into the sky, wait until about 10km (10,000) meters, then bank towards the ocean nearest the KSC at about 45 degrees until you get an apoapsis of about 80 km from there burn pro-grade till you have a complete orbit. add a maneuver node and play with it until you get a intercept from the mun or minmus. close the gap go to the intercept point and then burn retro grade until orbit. (I would quicksave F5) then burn retro grade again until it is lower, or onto the object, keep a good control of your speed and you should land just fine!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T17:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
