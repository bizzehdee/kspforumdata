It might not even be possible. Getting the textures right would be tough. Getting the doors and ladders to line up would be really tough. Creating custom IVAs for each possible size? that would be a lot of work. Even if you could solve all that, in the end I don\u0027t think you\u0027d end up with something that looks as good as a bespoke part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are tons of alternative pods out there from BDB, FASA, Tantares, Contares, Near Future spacecraft, K2, ReDirect....the list goes on an on!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way to look at it is that real rocket designers also have to work within design limits for the available parts.
