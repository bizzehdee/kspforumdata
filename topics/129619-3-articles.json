And they pretty much all do. So we\u0027re really talking about a deep-space habitat in proximity of some asteroids. And probably not just one, because it\u0027s very unlikely to find just one that will have everything you need. Of course, you want your colony pretty close to asteroid for mining, so you\u0027ll really end up needing a whole bunch of colonies next to a whole bunch of asteroids, mining different resources and exchanging them. Long term, I think that\u0027s the way forward for a civilization.

They will rely on constant shipments of resources they can\u0027t mine locally, but it will be worth it for the resources they can mine. And it\u0027s all good for the march forward. But there is also value in establishing a fully self-sufficient outpost somewhere as soon as possible, because life on Earth is somewhat fragile. We can establish a colony on Venus that can survive the end of Earth faster than any other location. Yeah, it will still take a very long time, but we can do a lot of useful atmospheric science while we get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to reiterate, very long term, yes, gravity wells aren\u0027t the way forward.
