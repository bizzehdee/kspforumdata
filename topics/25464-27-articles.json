And even an extra one, in the form of the tsunamis the impacts must cause. Laythe must get hammered on a regular basis, no doubt intercepting rocks wanting to impact Jool the way it intercepts ships bound for other moons.

That looks like the artist concept of the Kerbodyne Big Asteroid Redirect Rocket.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMartin: \u0022No, Bill. Look closer. They\u0027ve added landing legs and parachutes and they are calling it the \u0027Big Advanced Reusable Rocket.\u0027 Those Kerbodyne punks are going after our deep space launch market. Don\u0027t tell me you guys are going to let them launch payloads for Laythe and other deep space missions.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Oh...er...yeah, I guess I did hear something about that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMartin: \u0022Damn it, Bill. When Kerbodyne won the contract for the Asteroid Redirect mission hardware, we were assured that this was NOT going to cut into our Reusable Rocket contracts. The Rockomax boys are going to go spare when they get wind of this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022OK, Martin, I\u0027ll level with you. Kerbodyne has offered us some launches on their test rockets for essentially free. We couldn\u0027t pass that up...so some Laythe hardware will be sent up on the BARR.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMartin: \u0022Well of course they can offer you a free ride...they are being subsidized to develop those big boosters by the Astroid Intercept program. If the government was going to bankroll our R\u0026amp;D, we\u0027d give you better cheaper stuff, too. Anyway, do you think it\u0027s wise to risk your payloads on untested rockets?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022It\u0027s just the new Fueling hardware for Laythe....that stuff\u0027s easily replaceable. Besides, have you looked at the stats on the new Kerbodyne OP engines? Those things are amazing!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMartin: \u0022Well sure they are. That\u0027s because they have two and a half decades of rocket engine technology advances to call upon. Hell, you saw how good Rockomax was able to do with their newer 48-7S engines compared to their older engines.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Then maybe Rockomax needs to upgrade their Mainsails with newer technology. Anyway, we are only talking about one Laythe mission on the Kerbodyne hardware. For now, anyway.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMartin: \u0022OK, Bill...But you need to talk to the Bigwigs. We had an understanding. The Rockomax boys are not going to like this at all. Look, Bill...I just don\u0027t want to see anybody ending up with a horse\u0027s head in their bed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022What?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMartin: \u0022Nothing. Well, I guess I better go see Rocco Kerman about this. It\u0027s better he hears it from me than from somebody else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yes indeed, the next batch of hardware to be sent out to Laythe is going to be launched on the new Kerbodyne BARR. Below, we see the BARR lifting off with a \u0022B.A.Tug\u0022 (Big Advanced Tug), which is essentially equivalent to a double regular Nuclear Tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p0XfD7Q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022p0XfD7Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that when I built the BARR, I was not trying to see how big of a booster I could build with the new Asteroid Redirect Patch hardware. I wanted an incremental increase. So it\u0027s not all size-3 hardware, but instead is a size-3 core with size-2 side boosters. Whereas my regular Reusable Rocket can put about 39 tons into a 96 km orbit, the BARR can do about 96 tons -- more, if you didn\u0027t want to re-use the launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, note below that I have also installed the newer version of the Visual Enhancements: Clouds \u0026amp; City Lights mod that includes volumetric clouds. So instead of just 2D layers of cloud patterns at different altitudes, the new version has big, fluffy 3D clouds that you can fly into. It looks very nice, and doesn\u0027t seem to cause any huge slow-down of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PL9BVoj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PL9BVoj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause this is a new version of the Reusable Rocket, I did some tests where I followed the separated side boosters down to see if they would land properly (if the game didn\u0027t automatically de-spawn them). Below you can see the boosters separating. The G key was pressed just before separation, so the gear is starting to deploy. The parachutes came out immediately -- it would be nice if there was a simple control language in KSP where we could specify a delay for such things to happen. These side boosters did not use sepatrons, since the rocket is still going vertical at this point, and the boosters seemed to be able to slide away just fine without hitting the sustainer core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bGoGgzV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bGoGgzV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of sepatrons left the boosters very close together, so there was a danger of them banging together (which you don\u0027t really want if you intend to re-use your boosters). With the regular Reusable Rocket, the side boosters separate at an altitude of around 17.5 km, so the rocket can\u0027t begin turnover until about 18 km. For the BARR, the side boosters separate at about 13.5 km, and turnover can begin at 14 km. As always, the reusable rocket is flying a less-efficient trajectory in order to allow straight-down recovery of the boosters (theoretically), at the expense of how much payload it can put in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jW1ItrD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jW1ItrD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the booster chutes were good, with some pretty volumetric clouds and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lfBVUel.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lfBVUel.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the lack of sepatron push, and the lower altitude of separation, caused the BARR\u0027s side boosters to come down in a rather tight cluster close to where the KSC landscape has lots of inclined terrain...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qFhP3V8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qFhP3V8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...so while three of the boosters were lucky enough to land on level terrain, one of them landed on inclined terrain and fell over, exploding the front tank and other forward hardware. The base with the more expensive rocket engines/lower tank and landing gear survived, so it was not a total loss. But simulations revealed that one could easily end up with half of the boosters falling over. This was unacceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RJDh5DF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RJDh5DF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, back at the sustainer (assuming you followed that, as you normally would), the initial turnover was completed, and the aerodynamic cone was jettisoned using four sepatrons. Note that one of the four sepatrons had been tweaked to have 90% thrust level, so the cove veered out of the path of the sustainer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bmssFyU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bmssFyU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s take a closer look at the B.A.Tug as it rides the sustainer to orbit. This Big Tug uses two of the Kerbodyne S3-7200 tanks. The new tanks don\u0027t follow the \u0027size doubling rule\u0027 that previous tanks did, but it just so happens that two of the S3-7200 tanks hold exactly the same amount of propellant that the old-style Double Tug held (four X-200-32 tanks, plus four FL-T400 tanks in the nuke nacelles). The four nuclear engine nacelles of the Kerbodyne Big Advanced Tug don\u0027t carry fuel and oxidizer -- they each have one nuclear engine, two monopropellant tanks, and two parachutes (for emergency recovery of the nukes), all attached to a 1x1 structural plate that is attached to the radial decoupler. So the B.A.Tug has almost the same mass as an old Double-Tug combo (about 100 tons total). It has the same TWR and performance of the old Double-Tug combo, so it can be used in exactly the same way. The B.A.Tug has a Senior Docking Port on the front, but also has a Claw off to the side that can grab other targets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2wmsKwA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222wmsKwA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike the standard Reusable Rocket/Tug launch that requires help from the Tug\u0027s nuclear engines to get the sustainer to orbit with enough fuel left in the sustainer for it to land later, the BARR can loft the B.A.Tug into orbit without help from the Tug\u0027s nukes, and still have enough fuel in the sustainer for it to return it to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X3gpnWT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022X3gpnWT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the BARR sustainer performs its retro burn and reenters toward KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/20vp5bg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220vp5bg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t include any parachutes on the sustainer just because I always have MechJeb take care of returning the sustainer to KSC. If you prefer doing the return manually, and don\u0027t want to try to land the sustainer on its rocket engines, you can add parachutes to the top of the sustainer to make it easy to land manually. The four landing legs were plenty strong for the nearly empty sustainer. Also, the shorter engines at the base of the BARR allow the landing legs to be attached without the need for girder extensions, decreasing part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/11UrMk2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211UrMk2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second BARR launch was delayed for a while until sepatrons could be fitted to the side boosters. At the \u0022suggestion\u0022 of KSC officials, Kerbodyne subcontracted that installation to the Rockomax Launch Alliance. Note that the sepatrons are mounted at very shallow angles to minimize the possibility of causing exhaust damage to the sustainer core and other boosters during separation (such damage has been noticed during standard Reusable Rocket launches...and while it wouldn\u0027t be important during an expendable rocket flight, it\u0027s a good idea to minimize this for a reusable rocket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload for the second BARR launch consisted of the new Refueler hardware bound for Laythe. This includes a Refueler Fido rover and three Refueler stations, all bunched together and strutted up so they will make one solid payload (and will therefore hopefully be less wobbly than the equivalent payload assembled in orbit). Note all those fun Claws sticking out the sides (two each for the rover and three stations). These will hopefully make it easier to do surface docking to refuel planes and other vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the Refueler payloads did not mass what the BARR could lift, Kerbodyne included a \u0022Big Gas Tank\u0022 that would be left in Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IQOSdg5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IQOSdg5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see a top view of the Refueler payloads as the side boosters separate. It\u0027s difficult to see the sepatron exhaust flames because of the parachutes, but the sepatrons are firing. They are positioned to move the side boosters away from the sustainer without imparting much rotation to the boosters. Also note that the landing legs on the Refueler payloads and sustainer are opening -- this is because the G key must be pressed just before separation to start the opening of the side booster legs. So the G key must be pressed again to close the legs on the payload and sustainer as they continue upward. I suppose I should make an action group that opens only the landing legs on the side boosters -- but I\u0027d really like that to be controlled by timer after separation (maybe someday we will get that capability, as well as the ability to specify that these dropped parts should not de-spawn and will be followed to landing off camera).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1z8iXPb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221z8iXPb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you follow the side boosters down (as I did for the picture below), you can see that the push from the sepatrons results in a much wider spread of the booster landing locations, making it less likely that they will land on an incline. All four boosters survived landing intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RvIVShW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RvIVShW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the sustainer... I really like the Saturn V look of the sustainer. I would prefer it if the engines were arranged in a square (so that I could clip another engine into the center to make a pretty Saturn V look-alike)... but I won\u0027t whine about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qF3qNYc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qF3qNYc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit, the Big Gas Tank and the Refueler payloads separated from the sustainer (which was sent back to a soft landing at KSC). The payload uses the four Rockomax 24-77 engines on the Big Gas Tank to do orbital maneuvers. This was a bit slow, so I also enabled some of the 24-77 motors on one of the Refueler landers to increase thrust (later replacing the fuel used by the Refueler lander from the Big Gas Tank). The payload used these engines to rendezvous with the B.A.Tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mcxiqV8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mcxiqV8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the payload got to the B.A.Tug (which is out of sight off the bottom of the first part of the image below), the payload was lined up to North, then the Big Gas Tank was separated. The Big Gas Tank then flipped around and docked to the waiting B.A.Tug so that the Tug\u0027s tanks and RCS could be topped off (they were nearly full anyway), and then the Big Gas Tank undocked and moved off to the side so that the B.A.Tug could dock with the Refueler payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DONzmz2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DONzmz2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, we see the Big Gas Tank drifting toward us, with the Refueler payloads plus B.A.Tug in the background, ready to send off to Laythe. So with two launches, I had the vehicle ready to go. This would have taken FIVE standard Reusable Rocket launches and a lot more rendezvous and docking to accomplish. I can see where I might be tempted to use this option in the future, even if it displeases Rocco Kerman and his Rockomax gang.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/r5pVBdE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r5pVBdE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next order of business, of course, was to boost this ship off to Jool when the transfer window opened. Because the B.A.Tug is the same mass and thrust as a standard Double-Tug combo, the maneuvers were exactly like my normal Jool insertions: About 1900 m/s delta-V, done in two burns for efficiency. Below is the first part of the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ruM7XP3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ruM7XP3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter heading out most of the way to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, the ship dropped back for the second part of its burn at periapsis. Just as the second part of the burn was starting, Kerbol was coming out of eclipse from behind the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Pretty. Unfortunately, the hoped-for lack of wobbliness of the solidly-strutted payload did not occur -- the B.A.Tug with payload could only tolerate 2x physical timewarp (and even had to be dropped back to 1x at times when wobble built up). It was the docking port connection that was wobbling. I guess we need some nice, sturdy size-3 docking rings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lB5grQp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lB5grQp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascending node of the Jool transfer orbit was very close to Kerbin, so the plane shift maneuver to match the plane of Jool\u0027s orbit (which took about 273 m/s) was done first (the rear tank was expended and dropped right near the start of that burn). Then the fine-targeting burn was done to aim the ship to a tangential-Laythe-intercept (which took 5.4 m/s). I know that it\u0027s more efficient to combine those two burns into one, but I find it much easier to set up the fine-targeting burn if I have already done the plane adjustment. Besides, the fine-targeting burn is small, so I\u0027m not losing too much efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qDPJbG3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qDPJbG3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is the flower of my interplanetary transfers at this point: Three Double-Tugs returning to Kerbin; three Tylo-related payloads nearly to Jool; the Pol ship and Bop ship partway to Jool; and the Refueler payload just sent off to Jool. If you compare this to my previus plot like this, you\u0027ll see that two of the trajectories of Double-Tugs returning to Kerbin have shifted a little. When I updated my save to 0.23.5, those two orbits were no longer intercepting Kerbin (for whatever reason), so I had to tweak them with a couple small burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CMW9rwU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CMW9rwU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso notice above that I have a full dance card in Kerbal Alarm Clock to warn me before any of my ships undergo a Sphere of Influence change. I have these alarms set with some margin so that I can jump to each ship before it crosses the S.O.I. boundary, and then ease it across the boundary at 1x speed. This prevents my hard work targeting my orbits from going to waste (since the trajectories can shift quite a bit if you let the ship cross an S.O.I. boundary at a timewarp greater than 1x).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ETylo Things\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAldner: \u0022Hey, Nelemy!

Then its periapsis was adjusted to allow an aerobraking pass to lower its apoapsis to 500 km. Then its periapsis was raised to allow an aerobraking pass to lower its apoapsis to 250 km. Lather, rinse, repeat until it is in a 90 km orbit. These multiple passes are used to save fuel. One deep pass could bring the apoapsis to 90 km on the first pass...but that would also lower the periapsis very low into the atmosphere, and then it would take a moderately large burn at apoapsis to circularize the orbit. Using several passes, the ship ends up with its low apoapsis, and has a periapsis that is pretty high in the atmosphere, so the final circularization burn is relatively small. But: tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: Aldner and Nelemy\u0027s ride to Tylo, parked safely in low equatorial Laythe orbit (with Manley Crater in the background). The Hitchhiker module that is the main habitat of the ship is surrounded by FL-T400 tanks that are full of fuel to act as anti-radiation shielding, just in case Kerbol acts up again. The ship also has two full Rockomax X200-32 fuel tanks, and another X200-32 tank that is over 45% full (plus the full nuke nacelle tanks). This should be plenty of fuel to get them to Tylo, and then later on out of the Jool system and back to Kerbin (assuming they don\u0027t smash themselves on the surface of Tylo trying to land).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rnA6x33.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rnA6x33.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDouble Tug Distraction Time\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight in the middle of the fun with the Tylo payloads arriving at Jool, the three Double Tug ships were returning to Kerbin.

The the ship was pointed retrograde, and the nose cone was fired away using two sepatrons, which deorbited it. The nose cone was necessary on Refurb A until docking because it also has a probe body that was used to orient the tanks for docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Z4fLZSI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Z4fLZSI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep four: Refurb B/A rendezvoused and docked with a pair of nearly empty Double Tugs (they had enough fuel left to get them down to low orbit for refurbishment). Then one of the Tugs was to be undocked and flipped and redocked so that the Refurb B and one tank could be separated and docked to its rear end (so that the two Tugs would each have a main tank and rear drop tank). But...oops...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a stupid mistake here. The two tanks of Refurb A were fit together with only ONE Senior docking port...not two (that\u0027s because this Refurb A was originally built to refurbish a Double-Tug \u0022Train\u0022 configuration). So there was no port on the end of that tank to be able to dock it to the other Tug. Grrr.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vKx1D7c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vKx1D7c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I had to separate the stack into four parts, including the lone uncontrolled tank, and then bring the rear-tankless-Tug over to dock with it. But, of course, I BUMPED the uncontrolled tank and sent it tumbling. So I had to chase it for quite a while, trying to nudge it a little to stop its rotation (since using timewarp to do that would have been cheating). But I finally got it docked. Arrgh, such a waste of monopropellant. And then the Tugs were redocked for temporary storage. Each of those Tugs now had a main tank and a rear drop tank, but the main tanks were still empty. Also, I did not re-dock Refurb B because it was going to have to chase down the next payload launched...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fZWqjNn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fZWqjNn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...which was another Refurb A (two tanks).

Then I decided to suck all the propellant out of the offensive Senior-port-less tank that caused such problems before and dump it as space junk. A little undock, flip around, and redock now left me with two mostly-fueled (except for the side nacelle tanks) Tugs attached to Refurb B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o41ALmT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o41ALmT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep eight: I needed one more Tug for the triple-Tug lineup, so I brought another of the recently-returned Double Tugs to dock with the Big Gas Tank (I knew that thing would come in useful). They barely had enough fuel to do this. Then the end Tug sucked all the remaining fuel out of the Big Gas Tank, and sucked out its fill of monopropellant, then separated and headed off to meet up with the stack of Tugs. The other nearly empty Tug would remain attached to the mostly empty Big Gas Tank (well...it still has lots of monopropellant) for refurbishment at some future date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OKh78kH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OKh78kH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep nine: The third Tug docks to the stack. Then the Refurb B undocks with one tank, and the rest of the stack rotates so that Refurb B can dock that tank to the rear end of the third Tug. Click. Voila!

Four of those kerbals were scheduled to ride up to Kerbin orbit inside the Laythe Base 5 ship. I set up the deorbit engines of the Base to act as (a rather anemic) launch escape separation system...after which the Base has plenty of parachutes to make a safe abort landing if needed. The Reusable Rockets have been working so reliably for me (since we got the upgraded SAS) that I didn\u0027t expect any problems, so this seemed safe enough for kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s meet the crew:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECorfrey Kerman --\u003C/strong\u003E (piloting the ship).

He also did a stint on Minmus Moonbase when Thompbles was in command there. He was the first kerbal to fly an SSTO spaceplane into orbit and back.

Then Dansen was the first kerbal to land on Laythe (Dansen Island where the Laythe Base is located is named after him). Later, Dansen spent a few years in Kerbin orbit studying the effects of zero-G. After that mission, Dansen took up the offer from the KSC officials to go back to college and get a Ph.D. in Biology. He has returned to active astronaut duty now and will conduct biological research on Laythe.

It\u0027s rather crowded at the moment with all those boxes of consumables and equipment stored in any available open space, but the crew will primarily ride in the Laythe Transfer modules (to be sent up soon).

The crew would spend most of their time on the trip out to Laythe living in these modules, and they would serve as the return ships to bring those kerbals (or other kerbals) back to Kerbin later. The interplanetary transfer module has two Hitchhiker modules as living quarters. The lower Hitchhiker module is surrounded by eight FL-T400 propellant tanks for radiation shielding to serve as a \u0027storm cellar\u0027 in case of Kerbol-flares (but which also serves as the sleeping quarters). There is a two-kerbal lander-can on top as a control center. There is also a command chair on top of one of the side tanks just in case one of the crew feels like sitting around outside to view the wonders of the universe...or just to get away from all those other annoying kerbals during the year-long flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was originally going to send up the rest of the crew in the Transfer modules until I realized that there were no launch escape and recovery possibilities there.

There was some concern at first whether these would contain enough propellants to fully top-off the ship, but it turned out to be just enough (there was even an excess of monopropellant because of the last-minute decision to add some additional monopropellant tanks to the Toppers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Toppers and Refurb B were separated and returned to KSC. On the way, the Refurb B rendezvoused and docked with the empty fuel tank (the one that annoyingly had only one docking port) so that it could be deorbited as well (but that tank was separated prior to the end of the deorbit maneuvers so that it would crash separately).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VIOQW2H.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VIOQW2H.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the ship assembled and fueled, it was time to send up the rest of the crew. One of the new RAPIER-powered Crew Carrier 5d SSTO rockets was used. The 5d can hold eight kerbals, so four kerbals went along just for the ride and to get some more space-hours logged: Jebediah, Bobgan, Fredoly, and Rodgan.
