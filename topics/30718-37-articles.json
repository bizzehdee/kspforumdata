He looked up at the mesh of ropes suspending each level from the ring of branches above it and the ropeways winding round the trunk between them, and shuddered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat third storey is new,\u201D said Cal happily. \u201CWonder if they\u2019ll let us up there afterwards? I bet the view is just sathy from that height.\u201D He noticed Enely\u2019s fixed expression. \u201CDon\u2019t worry - plenty of bunks in the main hut and there\u2019s almost no queue yet. With a bit of luck we may even snag a bunk in Jonton\u2019s room and you\u2019ll get to meet him!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely fingered the square of cardboard in this pocket. \u201CI hope so,\u201D he said. \u201CBut if we don\u2019t, perhaps I can meet him anyway whilst you\u2019re enjoying the view from upstairs.\u201D He and Cal reached the top of the hill and stopped to wait for Tivie and the rest of their group to catch up.\u00A0 Cal checked his watch, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet. The others strolled up the hill in ones and twos, talking amongst themselves and enjoying the relative cool of the early morning. Enely suppressed a smile as Cal grabbed Tivie by the hand and trotted off along the winding path leading to the hut, before following them both at a more sedate pace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCloser to, he noticed that the irregularly interlocking planks making up the hut walls were peppered with odd whorled designs between a more regular pattern of knots. Puzzled, he traced one of them with a finger, the tightly wound spirals a rich dark black, stained by layer upon layer of varnish. Then he started in sudden understanding. \u003Cem\u003EKerm wood - the whole\u003C/em\u003E thing \u003Cem\u003Eis built from Kerm wood. But nobody\u2019s done that for\u2026 How old is this place?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 The hut door opened and for a fleeting instant Enely found himself face to face with a tired looking kermol. Her eyes swept the gathering crowd in front of her, tiredness banished behind a warm smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGreetings, good kerbals and welcome. My name is Gerselle - please come in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely braced himself and followed the queue inside, looking around curiously at the plainly decorated kitchen and eating room. The kerm wood walls were polished to a soft glow and colourful homespun rugs littered the toy strewn floor. A brightly painted and, so far as Enely could see, empty chest stood in one corner. Cinnamon tickled the back of his throat and he frowned.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis way please - excuse the mess.\u201D Gerselle opened another door and the tickle became an insistent rasp agains the roof of his mouth, making him cough. Embarrassed, he covered his mouth with one hand and followed Gerselle into what was very obviously a sleep room. He looked up from another muffled cough and clamped his hand to his face in shock. Jonton? \u003Cem\u003EMust be - but what\u2026?\u003C/em\u003E Surreptitiously he stared at the figure leaning against the trunk, trying to make out where Kerm ended and kerbal began. \u003Cem\u003EAll the leaves around his head - he must be Communing already but he\u2019s still watching us. How on\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, love. Welcome everybody, and for anyone who\u2019s visited before, welcome back.\u201D Jonton smiled. \u201CPlease - take a bunk and join me. We don\u2019t have too many guests this morning so Gerselle and I won\u2019t need to keep you waiting long.\u201D Jonton gestured at the nearest bunk. \u201CEach bunk has two pillows but if you need another one, do let me know. For now, just make yourselves comfortable so that the leaf clusters are just resting against your forehead. The leaves will tickle a bit to start with but that shouldn\u2019t last long.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely sat down on the nearest bunk and removed his shoes. Across the room he saw Cal doing the same. He flashed Enely a quick thumbs up before lying back and wedging a pillow under his head. Enely looked around the room as more kerbals took their places and the enormity of the situation finally struck home. \u003Cem\u003EWe\u0027re going to do this. All of us - Communing with one Kerm.\u003C/em\u003E He flicked a glance at Jonton. \u003Cem\u003EOr so Cal said but he\u0027s not a Keeper. And something about that Keeper doesn\u0027t look right to me.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a mental shrug, Enely lay back on his own mattress and propped his head lightly against the overhanging leaves. There was a brief pause followed by a familiar tickling against his scalp and then a soothing white light. He barely had time to wonder at the unfamiliar sensation before the expected rush of images, emotions and then, shockingly, mental voices, rolled over him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWell that... explains... explains everything.\u003C/em\u003E Tears trickled down Enely\u0027s cheeks but whether they were from the emotional backwash from his brother and sister kerbals, the story he\u0027d just witnessed or the raw-edged memories of Communing with his own Kerm slicing their way to the surface, he couldn\u0027t tell. Automatically, he ran his fingers gently through his hair, checking that the Kerm leaves had properly disengaged. \u003Cem\u003EAnd Pillars preserve me, I can understand why Cal and Tivie came back to see that again.\u003C/em\u003E He sat up and swung his feet off the bunk, relieved to see that his weren\u0027t the only moist eyes in the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal walked over to him, eyes red-rimmed, sniffling against the back of his hand. \u0022That was even better second time around.\u0022 he mumbled thickly. \u0022Our story...sharing it with Jonton and everyone else. Worth every step of the walk and everything we put aside to get here again.\u0022 He cleared his throat. \u0022Think me and Tivie\u0027ll get some fresh air - along with everyone else I\u0027d expect. You still wanting to talk to Jonton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely nodded. \u0022If he\u0027ll speak to me. I think I might be some time - shall I meet you back at the marquee.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That would be lovely,\u0022 said Tivie, draping her arm over Cal\u0027s shoulders. \u0022Good luck, Enely \u00A0- I hope Jonton can help you with whatever you were looking for.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Me too,\u0022 said Cal, \u0022He\u0027d better not go malka on you, Sage or no Sage.\u0022 He clapped Enely on the back and joined the small queue of kerbals still filtering out of the sleep room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely waited patiently on his bunk, eyes downcast. He fished Donman\u0027s token out of his pocket and sat quietly, rubbing his thumb over the gold embossed seal. He heard the faint click of the door closing behind the last pilgrim and then a soft, enquiring cough. He looked up to find Jonton staring at him curiously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can I help you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m not sure,\u0022 said Enely, \u0022but I was told you could.\u0022 He stood up and proffered the token to Jonton. \u0022And sent to find you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u0027s eyebrows rose and he looked at Enely more speculatively. \u0022This looks official,\u0022 he said. \u0022Who sent you, if you don\u0027t mind me asking?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Chief Ambassador Donman,\u0022 said Enely. \u0022It is a long story I\u0027m afraid.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They always are somehow,\u0022 remarked Jonton, half to himself. \u0022but a strange kerbal sent on a mysterious errand from Donman is the longest one yet, I\u0027m thinking.\u0022 He peered at the square of embossed card. \u0022Even if you weren\u0027t carrying this, I\u0027d be curious. Did Donman give you any kind of message to bring?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t think so,\u0022 said Enely slowly. \u0022He just said that if there was one person on Kerbin who could understand what I\u0027d been through, it would be you. Then he told me that he\u0027d communed with you.\u0022 He paused, eyes roaming over the top of Jonton\u0027s head. \u0022At the time I thought he was just talking about communing with your Kerm - which was strange enough - but after this morning, I\u0027m beginning to think that he meant exactly what he said.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CThat\u2019s another long story,\u201D he said. \u201CBut yours first I think if Donman has sent you halfway around Kerbin to tell it.\u201D He smiled at Enely\u2019s surprised look. \u201CYou\u2019re not the only Wakiran visitor we\u2019ve had since this began.\u201D He reached over to his pedestal and poured Enely a mug of water. \u201CSomething to wet your throat before we start.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely sipped his water for a moment, gathering his thoughts, before putting the mug to one side. \u201CThey were looking for volunteers,\u201D he began, \u201Cto help start new Groves. Hazachim especially - I suppose they thought that desert farmers could make a Grove work nearly anywhere. For my village, the timing couldn\u2019t have been better. Our Kerm had just seeded and we didn\u2019t know what to do; we\u2019re right on the edge of the Hazachi, we couldn\u2019t think of anywhere to plant a new Grove and our Keeper was at her wits end. So going with them was an easy decision, although if I\u2019d known there\u2019d be quite as much sea travel involved I might not have been so keen.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton listened politely to Enely\u2019s description of his voyage to Dazji island and the founding of his new village, only starting to pay attention when the tale moved onto details of Kerm cuttings and planting what would become its second year saplings, interjecting the occasional question of his own. His face darkened, branches rustling in anger at Enely\u2019s description of the Forseti invasion and by the time the uprooted Kerm saplings were being loaded onto their ship, the sleep chamber was thick with flying Kerm leaves and the cloying stench of cinnamon. Outrage gave way to a brief smile as Enely described his first Communion, which rapidly turned into horror and then deep mourning as he finished his story with his conversation with Donman at the sunset pyre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely looked up at the muffled sob from the doorway and saw Gerselle drying her eyes on her poncho sleeve. Behind him, he heard Jonton blowing his nose vigorously. \u201CI can see what Donman sent you here,\u201D he said at last. \u201CAlthough I think he was being optimistic about the understanding part. But what about you, Enely?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe can stay with us,\u201D said Gerselle firmly. \u201CAnd when the memories get too much, he can Commune with you. It\u2019ll be close enough to be good for him but not close enough to remind him.\u201D She and Jonton shared a look. \u201CWhatever else Donman may say, you are definitely the only person on Kerbin that can do that for him, Jonton Kermol.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely looked at them both. \u201CThat would be extremely kind,\u201D he said softly. \u201CThank you. But \u2018not close enough to remind me?\u2019 Who are you, Jonton? And what happened to your Kerm? I didn\u2019t get much time as a Keeper but that Communion with you and the others\u2026that wasn\u2019t anything like any Communion that I remember.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D agreed Jonton. \u201CIt wouldn\u2019t have been. And I think it\u2019s time you heard my long story if you\u2019d like to join me again?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI would,\u201D said Enely, lying back on his bunk and adjusting the pillow under his head. \u201CI would like that very much.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Payload.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead, Payload.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFairing jettison confirmed, Flight.

He clicked his own microphone over to their private channel. \u201CWhat\u2019s your reading, Flight?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan started, eyes flicking rapidly over his console. \u201CUh, concur with Booster. Engine is Go. Guidance is\u2026 one moment.\u201D He toggled his headset. \u201CGuidance sounds pretty relaxed, boss. Can\u2019t tell for sure without going on-loop, but I think we\u2019re Go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney glanced at the repeater displays on his own console. \u201CRecommend you check your rate indicators, Flight.\u201D He saw Lucan frown for a second before his expression cleared.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, boss. Attitude control stable - minimal vehicle excursion in roll and yaw. Pitch looking good.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CChamber pressure?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHigh but stable, and under redline.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBooster call?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilently, Geneney counted down the seconds. watching Lucan from the corner of his eye. He reached zero just as the other kerbal looked up. \u201CNegative, boss. No change, no call.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSatisfied, Geneney nodded. \u201CAlways watch your own repeaters. The comm loops are good for situational awareness and gauging flight team mood but never get lost in them. You have the critical figures right in front of you so \u003Cem\u003Euse\u003C/em\u003E them. Now - what\u2019s your recommendation on that overpressure?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait for controller report at SECO minus two minutes,\u201D said Lucan promptly. \u201CCheck pressure at SECO minus one, wait ten, call for throttle-back if required.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood. Why?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMidline pressure at SECO-1 to mitigate hard restart.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u2019s headset crackled. \u201CFlight, Booster.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead, Booster.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CChamber pressure high and holding at SECO minus two, Flight.

Thank you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the rest of \u003Cem\u003EMinmus 1\u003C/em\u003E\u2019s climb to orbit, Lucan flipped back and forth between the Booster and Guidance loops, eyes glued to his repeater displays. The second stage engine shut down on time at the correct pressure and he hastily stifled a sigh of relief. The checkout orbit flew past in a stream of status reports from the Payload and Comms teams, confirming vehicle startup, deployment of the PV arrays and the successful activation of a host of other critical systems. Then Geneney leaned forward in his chair and Lucan gripped the edge of his console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll stations report in for TMI.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one, the controllers gave their go-ahead. Lucan let go of his console with an effort. \u003Cem\u003EWould you relax\u003C/em\u003E, he told himself. It\u0027s n\u003Cem\u003Eot like there\u2019s a crew up there\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBooster is Go. Starting re-press and ullage sequence.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan\u2019s gaze flicked from his console to his Flight Director and back again. Geneney sat calmly in his chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTank pressures nominal. Igniters armed. Go at thirty.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUllage motors firing\u2026and we have ignition. Thrust at ten percent\u2026 throttling up\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone in the control room turned to watch the main screen, currently showing \u003Cem\u003EMinmus 1\u003C/em\u003E\u2019s orbital track around Kerbin. On a smaller screen to one side, velocity and projected apoapsis readouts both raced upwards and then suddenly stopped. A light on Geneney\u2019s console winked out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, Booster.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead, Booster.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CInjection burn complete, Flight.

FD - let\u2019s get those trajectory numbers firmed up before we hand the vehicle over to Probodyne.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwin spacecraft raced through the outer reaches of the Kerbol system. Far beyond the orbit of Duna they flew, their passage through the asteroid belt marked by a solitary speck on a pair of photographs, both long since transmitted home to Kerbin, itself reduced to a pale blue dot against the vast blackness.\u00A0 Sending that picture home would be a task for another spacecraft on another day and in time it would become an iconic image of the space age. For now, the need to conserve fuel overrode all other considerations; even the tiny quantities of propellant needed to spin the spacecraft around being saved for the rigours to come.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnwards they travelled whilst other spacecraft made landfall on Duna, probing its soils and atmosphere and finding them suitable for life. Outward they soared whilst, far behind them, kerbals walked on the M\u00FCn, making light of the impossible and sparking the all-consuming efforts of Project Starseed. And now, at last, their long journey was finally drawing to a close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA dot against the starscape gradually expanded into a luminous green disk attended by three darker dots, each long studied by kerbal astronomers who named them Laythe, Tylo and Vall. Now ragged bands of shadow and brightness could be seen across the face of the disk, lending perspective and revealing it as a colossal sphere streaked by complex patterns of cloud and lashed by titanic winds. \u00A0The two spacecraft raced the emerald behemoth, leading it then swinging past; letting its immense gravity brake them onto a new trajectory. Now they spun, obeying long-ago programmed instructions, engines pointing forward at a carefully calculated angle. Streams of glowing gas erupted from one, slowing it still further and closing it\u0027s path; a tiny Joolian mun on a collision course with it\u0027s bigger cousin Laythe.\u00A0 The other spacecraft flew on, its fate decided by a pair of wires.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccidentally placed too close together, a pulse of electricity through one wire was enough to melt a bridge to the second. Onboard systems sensed the short circuit, shutting off the power and preventing a possible fire. But the damage had been done. A relay failed to close on command, starving a heater coil of power. A frozen fuel line remained frozen to the end, starving its rocket engine of vital propellant. \u00A0Pressure sensors detected the lack of fuel, triggering backup programs within the probe core. Attitude control thrusters fired to compensate but the moment had passed. Too little, too late, the smaller rocket engines too weak to slow the spacecraft enough for even a gas giant to snare it. Eventually it would skim past a pollen grain shaped boulder, before breaking free of the Jool system and flying onwards into the outer reaches, trapped in a long lonely orbit about distant Kerbol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe discovery of a hitherto unknown Joolian munlet provided scant compensation for \u003Cem\u003EHope 1\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s builders, now watching anxiously from many millions of kilometres as \u003Cem\u003EHope 2\u003C/em\u003E sped towards its destination.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrusters fired, turning a collision course into a grazing pass through Laythe\u2019s atmosphere, or what the Laythe Observation and SpecTroscopy team hoped would be a grazing pass. With no time for a pathfinding flyby mission to supplement observations from Kerbin and allow more precise trajectory calculations, the best the LOST mission planners could do was to err on the side of caution, recommend an increased margin on the heat shield and hope for the best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHope 2\u003C/em\u003E broke apart, aeroshell base gliding away from spindly upper body. Thrusters fired again, nudging the upper body onto a flyby trajectory, doomed to endlessly loop back and forth between Jool and Laythe, sporadically transmitting data back to Kerbin until its batteries could no longer\u00A0hold the meagre charge gleaned from its photovoltaic cells. Meanwhile, the base shell plunged onwards towards its own fate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDays passed, then hours, then mere minutes. Tiny rockets around the rim of the base shell fired again, making final attitude adjustments. The first faint wisps of gas ripped themselves apart against the onrushing spacecraft in a rapidly building, nacreous glow. The glow turned sullen red, swiftly ascending through orange and yellow, then flaring back to white.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fire faded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a crack, the aeroshell split open. Drogue parachutes streamed out behind the plummeting spacecraft, jerking it away from the charred remains of the heat shield before fluttering free. Jointed metal legs unfolded, a second set of parachutes blossomed, held, and fell away. Then with a final burst of rocket fire, \u003Cem\u003EHope 2\u003C/em\u003E came to a gentle stop on the surface of Laythe.\u00A0Photovoltaic panels unfolded, trickle charging onboard batteries. The main antenna unfurled, swung round then tilted, aiming at a precise point in the sky above. \u003Cem\u003EHope 2 \u003C/em\u003Esent a single burst transmission back to Kerbin and then fell silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh for a lump of plutonium and the fins to cool it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWill you stop moaning about that Kerm blighted radioisotope generator,\u201D snapped Jernie. \u201CI know it was the sensible option - \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E knew it was the sensible option but we didn\u2019t get a choice. As you know very well so would you please, for the love of little kerblets, just shut up!\u201D She jabbed a finger at Sidbo. \u201CAnd before you say it, \u003Cem\u003Eyes\u003C/em\u003E they knew we were trying to save the world and \u003Cem\u003Eyes\u003C/em\u003E \u2018not scattering radioactive junk over our new home,\u201D was a stupid excuse, but we just have to live with it.\u201D She snorted. \u201CAlthough I\u2019d love to know what they thought we were going to \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E with the plutonium. Plate it over the heat shield presumably.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidbo squirmed in his chair. \u201CSorry, Jernie. No more complaining - promise.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJernie sighed. \u201CIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t agree with you, Sid. RTGs on the orbiters shouldn\u2019t have been too much to ask for and might have given us enough juice for a proper telemetry feed from Hope 1. How are we supposed to fix things without data?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSpeaking of data,\u201D Sidbo said cautiously, \u201Cthe Jool spectroscopy was pretty spectacular. Looks like it\u2019s even managed to stump Dunney.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHah. He\u2019s not stumped, he\u2019s \u2018working through an interesting problem\u2019.
