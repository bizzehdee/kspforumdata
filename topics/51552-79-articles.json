A single stationary sat over KSC can\u0027t relay commands around to the back side of Kerbin (like if a burn to go to the mun or another planet needs to be made when the vessel is out of LOS with KSC), where as 3 stationary sats will provide basically full coverage around the planet.

I stand corrected. Think I\u0027m still going to setup a stationary network though and make it more for missions that go beyond Kerbins SOI. I\u0027ve been thinking of setting up a 4sat 300-400km network to handle missions closer to Kerbin, which will require less power to run so not as worried about periods when the sun isn\u0027t visible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne problem I was thinking of with geostationary was that if you\u0027re not using RTG\u0027s and you\u0027re not careful enough about where the 3 sats are one may end up in darkness, not sure for how long though as the further out you go the less time you would be in shadow. So far I haven\u0027t actually experienced that yet though, had been trying to use kOS to setup the network. Same would go for lower orbit, although not being \u0022stationary\u0022 I would imagine they might recover faster because of the faster orbital speed.
