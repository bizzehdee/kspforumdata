Your mods are very useful and was not aware of them until recently.\n\nThe method to change the value of Max Physics Delta Time per Frame seems to be the next logical step. Currently exiting to settings menu is agonizingly slow. I am experimenting on the two extreme values to identify the effects on vessel simulation. \n\nExample: a plane flies maneuvers and flown at high G force to try to break it apart. Then the value for Max Physics Delta Time per Frame is lowered from 0.12 to 0.03 and the plane is again put through similar testing. So far the results are not showing much difference and the two simulations have similar results. Re-entry is up next for testing and now knowing that using time warp is messing with the value the main menu screen is going to be seen more often.\n\nIf it is possible could you add a method for changing the Max Physics Delta Time per Frame during run time. You were probably already thinking of this, am I right?\n\nKeep up the great work."}]}
