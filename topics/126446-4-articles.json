Pressure fed/ idle mode for\u00A0the engines - This, while technically feasible, is not what the engines have been designed for and thus may require quite extensive redesign. Also just because it was proved to be technically feasible on the J-2 or the LE-5 does not mean it could definitely be done with the Merlins while they\u0027re travelling in the wrong direction. Also, as you mentioned,\u00A0a single Merlin in this mode would not produce enough thrust to get a TWR of 1 - thus meaning SpaceX having to rework their landing sequence to use more than 1 engine (which provides more redundancy, however means there are 9 times as many points of engine failure in an already complex event)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve just run some numbers, working with the 3% thrust quoted, TWR would be \u0026lt;1 even will all 9 engines running, the engines would need to provide 4-6% to get TWR of 1. Also with this method is throttling possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Flexible nozzle extensions - the technical difficulties of getting these to work would almost certainly rule these out as a viable option. Firstly you have the issue of getting them to work reliably in a predictable way (could they be relied on to restrict thrust in a controlled and - more importantly - controllable\u00A0way?). Secondly, can something like this be designed realistically without affecting the performance of the Merlins, while also capable for withstanding both the heat when the engines are firing and also the stress if an aerodynamic reentry?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would imagine that if it transpires that their current method cannot be done reliably, they will can the idea until they come up with Falcon 9 v2\u00A0with engines designed to facilitate hover\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-15T15:51:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2015 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T15:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222323516\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126446\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450187879\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227117\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exoscientist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Exoscientist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy \u003Cem\u003Eopinion\u003C/em\u003E, SpaceX will not be able land the F9 first stage reliably and\u003Cbr\u003E\nconsistently until they give it hovering ability.
