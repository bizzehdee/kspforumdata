If it\u0027s part of a ship that has a docking port you can send up a drone rescue ship and return that, if it doesn\u0027t have a docking port it doesn\u0027t really matter since I\u0027m sure your crew will be safe in their command pods, that get decoupled anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T20:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Taki said. There\u0027s no real reason to return the MPL itself-- don\u0027t even need to dock with it. Just send a rescue ship that parks nearby.
