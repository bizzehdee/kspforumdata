It looks useful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built up a good number of space-planes over the months before the SP\u002B parts were added to KSP. I had a big monoplane, several x-wings, a long-distance bi-plane, and a several versions that held a rover either above or below the fuselage. (Lots of checking Kerbin\u0027s anomalies, and testing rovers in general.) And my main problem: The wings look *ugly*. The holes along the side of the main 2x1 slab, its slight taper that made it hard to overlap cleanly with other parts, that there was no 1x1 slab to fill in the gaps if you were making any kind of big delta-wing, the dragonfly wing didn\u0027t fit with anything else, etc, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a lot of planes built with the old system. But when the SP\u002B parts came out, I started rebuilding them all, and right away they looked ten times better. Swept wings, swept 2x1 slabs, swept leading edges to further angle the 2x1 slabs, swept elevators! Beautiful aerodynamic stuff. (Not to mention the new sleek cockpit and fuselage parts.) None of this square crap I had to do before. It was all gorgeous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, I had to make a few changes to my original designs. But if I were introducing someone new to the game, I\u0027d want them to have *these* parts. None of the old stuff. Hide that away in an old drawer, lock it, throw away the key and never speak of it again. If you really can\u0027t live without it, use the redistributed ones that have been linked and stop whining. The sheer number of parts in KSP is already overwhelming to new players. There\u0027s not point in cluttering it up more with old and ugly parts -- it just makes the whole game look worse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T02:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe G-meter on the navball is stock.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s the stock navball..\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eman you guys think I\u0027m dumb lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: because I am\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-03T03:04:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2014 03:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by clown_baby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"King Arthur","CreatedById":73849,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T02:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair, you asked \u003Cem\u003E\u0022What mod is telling you the G\u0027s?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E and the only thing showing Gs is the stock G-Force gauge next to the navball. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T03:00:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022King Arthur\u0022 data-cite=\u0022King Arthur\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo be fair, you asked \u003Cem\u003E\u0022What mod is telling you the G\u0027s?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E and the only thing showing Gs is the stock G-Force gauge next to the navball. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoooh I guess I did lol.
