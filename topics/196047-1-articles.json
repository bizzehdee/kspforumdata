Even when these cards were released, they were NEVER intended as cards for heavy use. These were cheap, bottom bin silicon that could be thrown in OEM PC\u0027s to provide multiple display support and accelerate media or Excel calculations. The GT 1030 is a much better card, and far more suitable for a \u0022Entry-level GPU\u0022 (I\u0027d argue that a RX 570 is far better, and at 150 used blows this out of the water but there\u0027s plenty of reasons why you might not be able to use it).\u00A0 But the GT 730 and GT 710 should not be the benchmark, as they weren\u0027t ever intended to be.\u00A0 And these chips are ANCIENT; being based on 40nm and launched in 2014.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are essentially math coprocessors on a process that was outdated even back then that you want KSP2 to \u0022Optimize\u0022 for; imagine if all games did this?

When Sony/Microsoft say that they will continue support of base consoles, that is reflected in contracts with developers. These contracts frequently get modified for exceptions for certain features that simply can\u0027t work with base hardware or without certain specific upgrades. And as time goes on and we enter next gen era, there is no explicit reason why Sony and Microsoft might not start allowing games that only run on Pro/X models of their consoles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there is going to be a lot of pressure to scale back support for base models. There are a lot of games coming out for next gen that can ship for PS4 Pro and XB1X as well with some features scaled down, but only if base models can be dropped entirely. Early on in PS5/XBSX era this will probably be helping generate extra revenue. First of all, market penetration of new consoles will be low, so license fees from selling to previous generation will be a substantial share of profits. Second, it\u0027s a rare time slice when secondary market of used hardware sales is actually beneficial to Sony and Microsoft. If I can sell my PS4 Pro to a neighbor who only has the original PS4 right now, so that I can afford a PS5, that\u0027s still a PS5 sale for Sony. No only does Sony get hardware sales, but they can now sell PS5 version of a new game to me and PS4 Pro version of the same\u00A0game to my neighbor, where porting this game to base PS4 might simply not be feasible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s even more pressure on Microsoft with their Smart Delivery. If I\u0027m a dev working on a XBSX game, and I come to Microsoft saying, \u0022Hey, we can probably pay this external studio to port our SX game to XB1X, so long as we don\u0027t have to support base XB1. Otherwise, we simply can\u0027t make it work, and it will be XBSX only,\u0022 that\u0027s a lot of pressure on Microsoft to cave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ll have to wait and see if we are going to start Pro/X only games being approved, and maybe you\u0027re right, and they\u0027ll decide that possible backlash is not worth the sales generated.
