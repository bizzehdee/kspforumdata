All of my craft also use FAR, so that is necessary. The Foxhound handles just like the real one with FAR: not quite a fighter, but it\u0027s definitely no slouch in agility if you play around with the craft for awhile and learn how it handles, although the MiG-31 is mostly meant for low altitude interception and reconnaissance roles. The cruise missile has a theoretical range of over 2000 km\u0027s (and with the drop tank edition I\u0027m currently testing, over 6,000 km\u0027s at minimum), and both editions with either the turbofan or the turbojet engine can super cruise at under 200 m\u0027s of altitude. The cruise missile, like in real life, is not all that maneuverable, so you have to align the cruise missile for the terminal phase of the flight. If you want to make a direct hit, turn the engine on it to a very low thrust rating, which should make you subsonic and allow for greater accuracy. If you want a good and stable plane with FAR that can turn on the dime, then you should check out the F-15A and C I\u0027ll be posting soon. What\u0027s funny though is that the MiG-31 has over 2000 units of fuel, which makes a great combination with the turbofan engines since they only sip the fuel. I actually haven\u0027t tried circumnavigating Kerbin with this craft yet, but I\u0027m sure it is almost, or just capable of doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Watch out for where the fuel is being drawn from, because that could easily unbalance any craft, especially with FAR.
