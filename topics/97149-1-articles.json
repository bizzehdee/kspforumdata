I have build bases for long duration missions and science and laboratory lander bases to get science from eves surface back to kerbin. I also created a 3 seater eve return vehicle that works and can theoratically under errorless piloting takeoff from 3000m\u002B. But is however used on several 4000m\u002B areas on eve for delta V safety margin. A 3 seat ion glider that has already proven to operate at 10km altitude with 11500 delta V is to get the crew from the base to the nearest escape pod and can cover about 100km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m having is the escape vehicle that gets the kerbalnauts back to eve orbit where a kerbin return vehicle will be stationed. I want to harvest the science on eves surface but one kerbal can only hold one experiment so that\u0027s 3 experiments for each kerbal and you cannot store experiments in a probe core module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a mod that adds a lightweight container where you can store this data (possibly up to 20\u002B experiments)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne that is hopefully not to heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really want a 3 kerbals return vehicle because you need 3 kerbals to operate the laboratory and I don\u0027t want to create 3 rockets for each kerbal and everybody deserves to get back home. Now I already know it\u0027s quite feasible to create a 3x landing can ascent module. I have even seen people get off eve with 3 landing cans from sea level. But I don\u0027t want to redesign everything that has so far costed me nearly a week to assemble. I also want to refrain from using 3 landing cans but use seats instead because I wanted my eve escape vehicle to be as compact and lightweight so it could fit into a gargantuant procedural fairing without the rocket looking all screwed up. At the moment the ascent vehicle looks good and is at a decent size and I don\u0027t want to add extra tons of fuel to it for supporting the weight of these landing cans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions...??\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-19T10:41:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2015 10:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T10:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you aren\u0027t averse to mods you could look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54370-Radially-Attached-Experimental-Data-Storage-Container\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54370-Radially-Attached-Experimental-Data-Storage-Container\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a part that just functions as a container for science results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T10:56:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vaporized Steel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vaporized Steel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem I\u0027m having is the escape vehicle that gets the kerbalnauts back to eve orbit where a kerbin return vehicle will be stationed.

As the previous poster noted, Kerbals on EVA can hold unlimited pieces of data. There\u0027s no need (except for realism\u0027s sake) that your Kerbal be INSIDE the capsule when the rocket takes off from Eve. He could hold onto a ladder outside the capsule all the way from lift-off to orbit. To make sure he doesn\u0027t fall off, you can build a cage using cheap and light structural parts that will literally corral him to the outside of the spacecraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s kinda cheaty, I know. I once had to do this on accident, when I placed a light in the middle of a ladder so the Kerbal was stuck below the light.
