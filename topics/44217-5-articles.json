I got to the point where I could get to Minmus and return very easily but anything past that was impossible for me, even with MechJeb. When 0.22 came out, I started clean without any mods and tried to relearn the game. I literally went from landing on minmus to sending large multi-lander craft to the Jool system overnight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027ve sent two ships to duna, a probe to eve, and have a bunch of probes and landers in orbit around Jool. The best accomplishment for me happened very recently: once I unlocked the atmospheric analysis tool, I created and planned a mission to drop a probe into Jool to study its atmosphere. Somehow the mission went flawlessly. I did a perfect aerocapture with the mother ship and got into a nice orbit. I then jettisoned the probe and de-orbited it. Watching it slowly decend to its destruction was really exciting, plus I got a ton of science for it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saberus","CreatedById":56124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T13:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy proudest moment is from back before 0.18.4 (0.17 or 0.18.2, I think?)
