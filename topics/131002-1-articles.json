Because I am looking for some way to precisely adjust camera angles when you are in orbital view such that I can more accurately line up things like Ascending and Descending nodes when trying to position a satellite in orbit to complete a contract. To my knowledge, the only way to adjust the AN/DN if the satellite orbit is to eyeball it, and the best way I\u0027ve found to do that is to line up the AN/DN on the target orbit with the current orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is quite tiresome when I have a standard mouse that lacks the ability to adjust the DPI and the keyboard input to adjust the camera lacks any sort of sensitivity adjustment (to my knowledge).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is a very niche thing but is there a Mod or something that I am missing in the game itself that would help me achieve this goal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T01:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have a direct answer for your request, but, since you mentioned trying to line up AN/DN on target orbits:\u00A0 it gets a lot easier to do if you double-click on the planet to focus the map view on the planet itself, rather than your ship.\u00A0 When you do that, then all you have to do is rotate the camera until the target orbit\u0027s AN/DN markers are close together, one on each side of the little transparent white dot that the game draws at the planet\u0027s center.\u00A0 Then all you do is plop a maneuver node down on your orbit, right on that spot where it crosses the center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorks quickly and easily, no special mods required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
