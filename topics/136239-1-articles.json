Then you\u0027ve got orbital decay\u00A0(even objects in high orbit will have their orbits affected by sunlight), vacuum ablation (even solid monolithic bits of metal will eventually decay to dust left to their own devices in space), micrometeroids, cosmic radiation, orbital perturbations etc etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver 10millenia artificial satellites will receive a great deal of punishment and if there is anything left after that long it won\u0027t be in any great condition. Kessler syndrome may rear its ugly head once there are no humans around to keep all of those sattelites nice and neatly herded, especially over such a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts not that absolutely nothing will remain, but that starkly few things that we perceive as permanent have any kind of lifetime at all over such timescales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly the most sturdy things, made out of the most chemically stable stuff, has any chance. Even all of the plastic trash floating around in the pacific will have degraded and dissolved by then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to assume that a dedicated effort towards archeology by a future species would eventually be able to unearth a decent collection of relics and remains, but there are scant few objects remaining from civilisation 10millenia ago today, and those which do survive are things like stone tools, which are far more resilient than 99.99% of the stuff that we have around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to leave a really long lasting mark, carve your name deeply into the wall of a natural (inland!) cave, preferably some distance above sea level, far from any flood plains,\u00A0areas of tectonic activity, tornado/hurricane hotspots, etc.\u00A0It could be one of the last traces of our civilisation! I think some of the earliest signs of intelligent life that we know about are cave paintings - so long lived as they are protected from the elements, carved or painted onto solid rock and in a geologically and meteorologically stable place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
