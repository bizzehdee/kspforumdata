Clusters of kickbacks and drop tanks peal off the thing as it screams straight up to interplanetary space. For a Duna trip, the core rocket would be composed of a skipper followed by a set of 3 terriers, the outer two staged on radial decouplers (everything tuned to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E ~1.5). The top can just be a standard pointy pod. The craft would push just out into interplanetary space, and then I\u0027d make a maneuver node (in solar orbit) with just enough prograde to put the craft onto Duna\u0027s orbit. By sliding the maneuver node around, you can find the time when the burn will put you into Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E (you can find your window).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake the burn, and a couple weeks away from Duna, make a \u0027correction burn\u0027 manuever node to put you on course to whatever part of Duna you\u0027d like to visit. For a first visit, I\u0027d recommend having the periapsis at ~10km off Duna\u0027s surface. You know, the poles are nice to visit... bleak, all be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d normally aerobrake using body lift from the rocket to maintain a ~7km altitude, but for a first trip I\u0027d recommend just using the Skipper stage to bleed off extra speed in the upper atmosphere (down to 1000-2000m/s), and then use it to control a pleasant descent, finally dumping the thing a little ways off the ground.\u00A0 The 3 terrier craft will be much more pleasant to land! My personal recommendation is to use the small landing gear over the medium landing legs, but that\u0027s just me. In any case, the outer two terriers can be put on 1.25m tanks topped with the big blue parachutes. Make sure to set them to open as high as possible in as low pressure as possible! While these parachutes won\u0027t slow you down enough on their own, a little kick from the engines just before landing will ensure you don\u0027t turn your trip into an extended impact test. Some extra reaction wheels really help at this stage. Just make sure to bring some extra batteries for them- best of luck and remember there\u0027s no shame in alt\u002BF9 \u0027till you can stick the landing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can jet pack on Duna, but only barely. Pop on out, enjoy the fresh rarefied air! Plant some flags, sing some songs... sure maybe do some science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the trip back, I am once again a fan of the vertical launch. If you just nip yourself outside Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, you don\u0027t need to worry about what direction you\u0027re flying. Just use the same make a node and move it technique from before. For the trip back in to Kerbin... everyone has their own tricks for reentry. I\u0027m a fan of heat shields with their ablator removed, but you\u0027ll find all sorts of ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s about that! So. Brass tacks, what\u0027s it take?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTraveling to Duna becomes \u0022easily\u0022 possible once you get access to the science nodes that cost 45-science as well as the following 90-science nodes: kickback\u002Bskipper (heavy rocketry), fuel cross feed (fuel systems), the mini solar panel (electrics), and the big parachutes \u002B medium legs (landing). I put easily in quotes because no matter what, everything is harrowing the first time you do it in KSP.... That\u0027s the fun! The mission will be easier if you have the next tech level higher in each of these, but I wouldn\u0027t consider it a necessity. For facilities, I consider the following to be a good point: Launchpad level 3, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E level 2, Tracking station level 2 and Mission control level 2.

If you happen to want more specific information, it\u0027d be handy if you let us know what kinda tech level you\u0027re at, and send us a snap shot of one of your ships. so we can get a feel for your building style.

Basically, anything that takes the guesswork out of the equation and I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s perfect for new players, but it can take a lot of frustration out of the process \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eespecially\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E with interplanetary trips as those involve a lot more time both designing and flying.\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E It also makes it easy to \u003Cu\u003Eunderestimate\u003C/u\u003E interplanetary trips\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E as all the numbers those tools put out are the most efficient ones and most people including myself end up wasting a certain amount of fuel to a number of factors. Then again, at least you get a ballpark idea of what your rockets can do. So, it\u0027s up to you really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-06T19:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223082403\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161651\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221496761370\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176479\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022grafdog1138\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n29 minutes ago, grafdog1138 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also thinking about getting a mod or two.

I suggest to bring a good lander, capable of exploring 2-3 biomes at time and refuel in orbit (when you are done with Duna It will be good enough to explore Ike also) some fuel in orbit and a return vehicle (that can be the lander itself after drooping the, now unnecessary, science equipment).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso notice that if you manage to explore Duna, you will also be able to explore Gily (its even easier IMHO), and the lander design used in Duna don\u0027t need much adaptation to also work in Eeloo, Dres, Moho, Vall, Bop and Pol, granted reaching those destination is a bit more of a issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*I have no shame. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
