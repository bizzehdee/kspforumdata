The Guide rails compact down like an old fashion (1970s old fashion) rabbit ear telescoping antenna.  The Helical chain parts are Connected to the Solar array on the inside,  The Telescoping Guide rails are attached via cables on sliding rings, to the outside of the Panel.     A Motive force is applied to the telescoping guide rails (not certain WHAT this force is but it could even be some form of intert gas or a worm gear and electric motor given how minute the opposing forces can be.)  The guide rails extend pushing the end cap out that is also attached to all the above parts.  the Central truss starts to follow and like a lego block locks in place when properly extended.\n\u003E \n\nThough if you can get some pictures showing your description correct, I\u0027ll still spot you for a beer ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T03:43:42Z","Content":"[@Pappystein](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/85755-pappystein/) yes I am using KJR ofcourse! ;).

Likely related to an install/setup error.\n\nHave added a bit of additional debugging and error-handling to the model-loading code -- it will now log the duplicate entry as an error, skip loading the duplicate, and continue with loading the rest of the models.\n\nGlad you got the problem figured out though.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On Saturday, October 29, 2016 at 3:04 PM, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ~~Mage, is there a reason why the TechTree nodes of certain parts are altered in the TechTree.cfg file over the ones defined in the part.cfg files?    ie. the RS25 is defined at heavierRocketry, but is later changed to advHeavyRocketry in TechTree.cfg along with some other parts.~~  \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ~~@PART[SSTU-SC-ENG-RS-25]:NEEDS[!CommunityTechTree]  {      @TechRequired = advHeavyRocketry  }~~\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I see what you did there... It looks like you inserted and extra node in the tree and then moved certain parts around outside of their own cfg files.\n\u003E \n\nYep, pretty much.  The actual files point to a valid stock config node, and then I patch in the creation of an extra tech-node and update the part configs to that new node.  Intended to be an \u0027easy-to-remove\u0027 solution in case someone was using a custom tech-tree/etc.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 hours ago, SebastianPahlsson said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Any idea how to turn off boil off? Can\u0027t seem to get it cooled down with electric charge.\n\u003E \n\n1.)  An \u0027enable-boiloff\u0027 config option will be available with the next release.  With it you can enable/disable boiloff entirely or adjust its amount/effect.\n\n2.)  Apparently there is a bug with the boiloff where it will sometimes still lose resources even though EC is present and tanks are set for ZBO.  Have not yet tracked down the source of this error, but should hopefully have it fixed up for the next release.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Theysen said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) you should somehow sticky this in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E or wherever but since most people don\u0027t read that maybe change the download folder name ? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nYea, seems that I probably should put a sticky up there.  May also just add some code that defaults that setting to \u0027on\u0027.  Probably will wait for 1.2.1 either way to see if it gets fixed up in stock code.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 20 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I had hoped to test SSTU some more over the weekend, but we had a neighborhood Halloween party, and the weekend got away from me. Better luck next time ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) .\n\u003E \n\nLoL, I know the feeling.  I had intended to work on SSTU a bit over the weekend, but instead spent most of my free time finishing up the pre-winter yardwork (final mow, bit of weed removal, put away all the hoses and other non-winter-proof gear).\n\nIn general news -- will likely (hopefully) be posting an updated release sometime during this week.  Have a few more bits to finish up on the HAB parts (mostly config related stuff), and a few more bugs to investigate (boiloff...).  Aiming to get the HAB parts finished as far as initial config and basic balance go, leaving only the centrifuge parts left to do (which will be renamed to ST-CFG-XXX).\n\nAs soon as all of the models and initial configs are complete the work can start on comprehensive balance work, including configs for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and MKS compatibility.  Haven\u0027t yet investigated the 1.2 changes to MKS or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS other than to see that they were quite massive.  I\u0027ll be working on putting together a balance spreadsheet for all of these parts and hopefully post it up on google-docs/etc for easy viewing and feedback (sadly will require two completely separate sets of balance data... one for stock, and one with LS/MKS included... the differences are just too massive for a single data set to work).\n\nAlso -- sounds like Lo-fi got the joint-based wheel stuff figured out and working in KSP... so that is one huge step closer to having working wheels again.  Will certainly be taking some time off after I finish the StationCore parts to work on helping to finish the wheel code (and fix up the SC-E parts)."}]}
