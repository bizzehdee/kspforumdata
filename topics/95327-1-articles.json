Most mods are pretty open about redistribution, but there are some authors who are rather particular about where their stuff is DLed from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour other issue is niche. KSP is about the easiest game to add mods to of any out there. As for a future-y pack, there\u0027s huge disagreements over that as some people swear by KSP Interstellar, but others think its massively overpowered and stick with Nertea\u0027s Near Future mods (myself being one of the latter). If you want to make a mod pack, it needs a very specific role, and I\u0027d also say be prepared to make a handful of parts yourself that no mod adds. (Fuel lines can only be found in the memory intensive COSMOS pack, Struts are found in B9 which is massively memory intensive, and KW Rocketry\u0027s struts are very heavy) The idea there is that you go for a total conversion mod pack. Finding matching themes is hard, but a total conversion is doable with the sheer number of mods out there (be VERY cautious of memory usage).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WesleySmalls","CreatedById":63132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T03:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you read this topic, got some great input from very experienced modders in the community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91939-I-want-to-build-a-modpack-BUT%E2%80%A6-please-hear-me-out%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91939-I-want-to-build-a-modpack-BUT%E2%80%A6-please-hear-me-out%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
