Duna to get me around the planet and Ike for my return fuel. at least that\u0027s what I am thinking.\n\nThanks,\n\nCardano.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T19:43:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 07:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cardano**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T15:41:48Z","Content":"Why do you need a second MPL? Is the one you took to Duna not capable of landing back at Kerbin? If so, you don\u0027t necessarily need a MPL for landing on Kerbin, any container able to hold your kerbals and science data should work fine if you transfer over the data by EVA."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T16:11:30Z","Content":"If it were me, I would just leave the MPL in orbit of Duna. You get a bonus for being in orbit of the planet the data is gathered from. Returning it to Kerbin has no actual benefit. The \u0022data\u0022 held by the MPL does not function the same way traditional science does. It converts that data into science points which you can then transmit for no penalty, provided of course you have the electricity. Any experiment you processed into the MPL is actually still in whatever craft initially contained it.\n\nFor example, if you sent a lander down to the surface, all of the experiments are still in that lander\u0027s capsule (or in the science bits attached to it), so you can return it as well as process it.\n\nI would say you -shouldn\u0027t- need any ISRU setup around Duna just for a mission to Duna itself, but that honestly depends on your mission profile. Ike would be preferable to me since it\u0027s less fuel intensive to land/ascend from, but then of course you either have to transfer that fuel to Duna or send your ship to Ike to refuel.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T16:20:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T16:14:06Z","Content":"No reason not to use the same ISRU rig on Duna and Ike:\n\n![YOAWdyy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YOAWdyy.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T17:20:33Z","Content":"There is \\*NEVER\\* a science benefit to landing a lab back on Kerbin. The data in it cannot be recovered, only transmitted. If you try to recover it, it will be completely lost. Experiment results stored in it are separate to that, but you just EVA a Kerbal over to it, take them, and store them in a simple pod to recover back to Kerbin. There\u0027s not even a real funds benefit to it, even if you get 100% recovery, as you\u0027ve lost the launch cost and spent a bunch more on a large number of parachutes. It costs you far less, and is much easier to land the experiment results using a simple pod.\n\nSo, leave the lab orbiting Duna with a couple of scientists in it, periodically transmitting their results (you do that manually), or bring it back with scientists working in it for the return trip, but do not land it back on Kerbin. It\u0027s of far more benefit for you to leave it orbiting somewhere doing more research.\n\nAdditionally, it is impossible to transfer research data and results between labs.\n\nN.B. The new research \u0022data\u0022 and results totally separate to the old experiment results. You process old experiments in a lab to generate new data, but that\u0027s the only link between them. Old results can and should be recovered (or transmitted with the same transmission cap/penalty as before) after processing in the lab."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T17:24:17Z","Content":"Well, he meant he was wanting to put data in the lab, and also put the experiments in the lab, bring the lab back (researching all the way I think) and then transfer all the experiments to another MPL (but it could be a regular command pod) and recover all the science points, while keeping the data in the lab to generate more science."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T17:41:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, he meant he was wanting to put data in the lab, and also put the experiments in the lab, bring the lab back (researching all the way I think) and then transfer all the experiments to another MPL (but it could be a regular command pod) and recover all the science points, while keeping the data in the lab to generate more science.\n\nSure, bringing it back to Kerbin orbit, with scientists working in it the whole time, that\u0027s a valid thing.
