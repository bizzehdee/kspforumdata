So basically you don\u0027t need to pregenerate a texture or distribute any of the atmosphere cache files and you can completely forget about the proland tool.\n\nFor a new atmo you just create/ship the atmosphere .cfg and the .half is generated when needed on the end user\u0027s machine directly and reused from there. A unique .half is generated from the atmosphere params and indexed with a hash, so even if you rename a planet or modify the atmo .cfg externally it will always generate or use the right file.\n\nCheck out the .zip file scatterer comes in, there are no .half files included.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-27T16:40:14Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2021 04:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-27T16:43:15Z","Content":"I thought as much.

and all over the place for scattering and extinction, and they garble what you can do with the generation. Just copy the configPoint of stock Kerbin as it\u0027s neutral, your atmo will suddenly look thicker, then use the thicken modifier in atmo tab to make it thinner until you\u0027re happy, that should get you what you want.\n\nI\u0027d recommend no longer modifying the configpoint settings now but keeping them at the neutral/default settings, as these are not physically correct and will get janky results, only use when absolutely necessary ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-29T16:05:33Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2021 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovzin","CreatedById":105152,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-30T11:20:21Z","Content":"[@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/)   Sry , next time I will do a spoiler.\n\nAnyway I fixed it.
