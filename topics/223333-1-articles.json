not so much in terms of save/load.\u00A0 The transfer to Jool went uneventfully and we were set up with luck for an easy burn to encounter Laythe for an aerobrake.\u00A0 It was at this point that we realized that it would be best to begin to deploy vehicles from the stack so the aero vehicles could enter Laythe\u0027s atmosphere alone.\u00A0 As outlined in the mission highlights and objectives these bonus missions were successfully spun off.\u00A0 Notably Pol and Tylo were not visited as the goal quickly became to leave hardware on each visited world as a kind of rule.\u00A0 Most suprisingly probe alpha did successfully touch down softly on some sort of surface on Jool after deploying a parachute making for a very strange hazy green view of the sky above.\u00A0 By now, the only bugs encountered were low frame rate during launch and various bugs with the maneuver planner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that gentle beginning of the mission was all about to change.\u00A0 The trouble really began at Laythe atmospheric interface.\u00A0 3-4 FPS was all we could achieve here and a series of complex structural stability and other bugs ensued for the aero vehicles.\u00A0 Certainly the aero vehicles have an \u0022aggressive design\u0022 with a fair amount of clipping but the game waits to punish you for these things at the worst possible times.\u00A0 Very little could be done but a large amount of save/reload actions here to keep the right wing and right engine from falling off Quebec.\u00A0 This was the first nightmare.\u00A0 We have the terrible heating system disabled so aerobraking slowed us down hugely after working past the bugs.\u00A0\u00A0After aerobraking and establishing orbit the aero vehicles were separated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually both Aero vehicles were landed on Laythe\u0027s surface.\u00A0 Second nightmare was with Quebec which has a bug with the cargo bays that it thinks it is crashing into ground at 100 meters but a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E landing instead of a conventional one solved that.\u00A0 Third nightmare was with the Excalibur deorbit and landing that has 2 separate random structural stability bugs which include random rapid shaking which destroys the vehicle and random loss of part cohesion which could not always be worked around with save/reload or fast forward.\u00A0 To make things worse, K2-D2 does not handle as well as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E alone, triggers structural stability bug 1 more often, and does not give good feedback during an emergency that it has taken control away from the player.\u00A0 Furthermore, fuel COG is an issue with Excalibur and there are too many tanks for a manual transfer and it takes too long to transfer fuel during an emergency and there is no automatic facility to do so and the game logic does not prioritize fuel consumption well.\u00A0 All of the troubleshooting and desperately grasping for answers happens at 3 FPS which is both a good and bad thing.\u00A0 Ultimately we have found it is best to let Excalibur flat spin towards the ground and orient retrograde at about 2000 meters altitude and fire the engines full blast and switch \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E mode from retrograde to normal.\u00A0 At low altitude it is controllable at a low thrust setting even with the COG pushed far aft and even with structural stability bug 2 happening.\u00A0 This is a good design - the trashiness of the game code is trying to destroy it but it just keeps flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually Excalibur made a conventional landing around 3KM from Quebec and Quebec taxied over to it because\u00A0 it would have taken hours with the framerate so low to do it the other way.\u00A0 Finally Excalibur takes back off again but not before another bug/poor game design with Jeb not being able to join Valentina because he can not get out of the cockpit of Quebec.\u00A0 Valentina checks out the clouds and gets used to the controls before climbing out using Tylo for a gravity assist back to a Kerbin aerobrake and landing.\u00A0 A bonus nightmare if you will is getting the deorbit right so we deorbit anywhere near the space center and also without a ridiculous vertical velocity but also do not overshoot!\u00A0 Then there is of course the same nightmare #3 that happens on Kerbin after deorbit as well.\u00A0 During landing we had a really strong 7 FPS so that was a happy time\u00A0 The FPS drops a lot when \u0022in play\u0022 and the engines are running so the counter does not show how low the typical FPS is.\u00A0 Anyway bugfest complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComic strip captions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpper left -

Flying in clouds of Laythe.\u00A0 Initially I thought the trailer showed Valentina flying on Laythe but now I see that there is a ringed planet in the background.\u00A0 Also the clouds in the trailer are larger and more numerous than the wispy clouds of Laythe.\u00A0 There is significant haze in the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLower right -
