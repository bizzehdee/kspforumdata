It should have a cursor:default for everything else and switch to cursor:pointer when you mouse over the subject. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOR which would be much more useful; The whole thing should be clickable (as the current cursor implies), so clicking anywhere on a message in the list should open the message (rather than having to click on just the subject). \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s real simple to fix with a little bit of jQuery (or you could do it with pure native javascript). \u00A0Add this to the javascript that\u0027s loaded on the messenger page;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-javascript\u0022\u003E\n$(\u0027.ipsDataItem_main\u0027).on(\u0022click\u0022, function(){ window.location.href = $(this).find(\u0027a\u0027).attr(\u0027href\u0027); return false; })\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBinds an onclick event to the whole message container which\u00A0follows the href of the link on the subject.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - broken \u0022back\u0022 functionality on threads.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you click on a thread that has multiple pages of replies you are taken to page 1. Then if you click on page 2 you go to page 2. \u00A0BUT now if you click back the page will scroll to the top but doesn\u0027t take you back to page 1, you remain on page 2. \u00A0If you click back again you get taken to where you were before clicking on the thread.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever if you go from page 1\u00A0to page 2, then go to page 3 and then click back; you will get taken page to page 2. \u00A0If you click back again then you stay on page 2. (and back again will take you back to before you clicked on the thread).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically the back functionality doesn\u0027t let you return to page 1 which is pretty serious broken functionality. \u00A0This is due to how the AJAX manipulates the browser history. \u00A0On all pages except page 1 it adds \u0026amp;page=x\u00A0where x is the current page no. If when loading page 1 it also appended \u0026amp;page=1 then the back functionality would work. \u00A0However I\u0027ve tried messing around with window.history.replaceState and I can\u0027t as yet find a working solution (I think there are\u00A0some other events that are preventing that from working right).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - Hold ctrl and right click for more options\u003Cbr\u003E\nTechnically (W3C speaking) this isn\u0027t broken, it\u0027s just annoying!\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen you mouseover the text-area of the editor you get the tip text (title) saying \u0022Hold ctrl and right click for more options\u0022. \u00A0Having this as the element\u0027s title attribute means that it constantly pops up while you\u0027re\u00A0trying to use the editor. \u00A0You can click in the editor to make it go away, but if you then happen to mouse away and then back again it re-appears. There really shouldn\u0027t be a title attribute on a text field/area like this. obviously it\u0027s trying to hint at\u00A0some of the more \u0022hidden\u0022 functionality, but just having that text in the footer of the editor (where is also has the insert other media link) would be better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis takes the title from the editor and stuffs it into the \u0022attachmentArea\u0022 div under it and then removes the title attr from the editor. \u00A0Call that on\u00A0pages you can post on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-javascript prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E$\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E(\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u0027*[data-role=\u0022attachmentArea\u0022]\u0027\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E).\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Eprepend\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E(\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E$\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E(\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u0027.cke_wysiwyg_div\u0027\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E).\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Eattr\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E(\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022title\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E));\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E $\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E(\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u0027.cke_wysiwyg_div\u0027\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E).\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Eattr\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E(\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022title\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E,\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E);\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say \u0022stuffs it\u0022 as it\u0027s literally just prepends the text to\u00A0that area. \u00A0It could do with being more carefully placed, probably needs a little CSS to clean it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT\u003Cbr\u003E\nalso just noticed in posting this;\u00A0Syntax highlighting on code blocks is only applied to the last code block you interact with. \u00A0If I set syntax to javascript on both the above code blocks the syntax highlighting is only shown on which ever one I set last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T11:55:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 11:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T17:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course you do realize that Squad has absolutely nothing to do with this, and that you should post this on IPS\u0027s forums... right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T10:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222309537\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127074\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449338341\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022111598\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LordFerret\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 05/12/2015, 17:59:01, LordFerret said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course you do realize that Squad has absolutely nothing to do with this, and that you should post this on IPS\u0027s forums... right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d assume that it\u0027s possible to inject custom CSS and javascript into the current deploy for this site which would be a simpler (and faster) fix than submitting a bug report to IPS and then having to upgrade to an update patch later.
