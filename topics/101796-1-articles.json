The crew were running all over the space station, the terrified humans fearing for their lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for good reason too. Because these sirens were broadcasting a particular message - \u0022Missile Approaching\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith several decompressed sections sealed off already, whether crippled by Kraken fire or debris, the station could not handle one more hit. Only the bridge and a few habitat capsules remained, spinning a little in the void. A lone communications officer stood in the bridge, holding his place against the jostling mob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EControl to HMSS Freya, do you read me?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 the speaker queried, sparking into life. Jebediah Kerman, interrupted from morosely staring out the window, jumped and sent a reply. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Affirmative, we hear you,\u0022 he said into his microphone, keeping his voice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EThank God for that,\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 the ground-based operative exclaimed, relief in his voice as he abandoned the last dregs of professionalism. \u0022\u003Cem\u003EI thought you were gone as well!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022As well?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EYou can tell the captain that HMSS Dummkopf is gone.

Hope we meet again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a second of reflection, Jebediah Kerman left his post and hurried to the captain\u0027s cockpit. The captain was immersed in his computer, muttering and jerking eerily. \u0022Somehow, somehow,\u0022 he seemed to be saying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill?\u0022 Jebediah ventured. The captain span his seat around to face Jebediah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What?\u0022 he demanded, fear and hope in his eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022HMSS Dummkopf has fallen.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hope in Bill\u0027s eyes resolved into anger. \u0022Damn it all!\u0022 he yelled at nobody in particular. He thumped his desk, pressing several buttons which didn\u0027t seem to do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe captain turned to Jebediah again. \u0022I know what to do.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA spark of clarity was lighting in the determined man\u0027s eyes. \u0022Jeb, my long standing friend, I have a job for you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlightly intimidated, Jeb took a step backwards. \u0022Ah- what?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, you could save the world!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Tell me what to do, then!\u0022 Jebediah insisted, annoyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe captain punched a code into a panel in the side of the room and took out a small metal box, like a miniature safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Take this box,\u0022 he told Jebediah, pressing the safe into his hands, \u0022Unlock it.

That thing can\u0027t handle a reentry.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know.\u0022 Bill sighed, seeming ordinary again. \u0022Jeb, I\u0027m asking you to die alone to save the human race.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe communications officer was taken aback by the blunt statement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What\u0027s in the box?\u0022 Jebediah quietly asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022DNA. Protozoic goo containing human genes. There\u0027s a minuscule chance that this will ever work, but maybe one day some lightning will hit the right mud puddle...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah nodded, understanding. \u0022Very well, then, Bill.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe captain enveloped the short officer in a huge, smelly hug. \u0022I\u0027ll miss you, Jeb.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027ll miss you all,\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Jebediah whispered to the void.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA million years after the end of human civilization, a bolt of lightning struck a mud puddle in a field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd behold, Jebediah Kerman (II) was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
