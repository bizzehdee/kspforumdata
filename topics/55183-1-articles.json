With Christmas around the corner I thought it was past time I got myself a telescope. Problem is, I don\u0027t know much about telescopes other than what I was taught in school. So, I was hoping to get some recomendations on a quality, clear-image telescope. I wouldn\u0027t mind learning how to read star charts, so computer assistance isn\u0027t a priority. Other than that I would love to hear some tips.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Codz","CreatedById":9711,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T15:41:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, depending on your budget, I\u0027d go for a 6\u002B inch Dobsonian reflector.

The larger the aperture, the better the image, though the optic quality will also definitely impact this. As a side note, be sure to consider a good pair of binoculars if this is your first real foray into the (all consuming) world of amateur astronomy.

I would recommend against getting a telescope with \u0022GoTo\u0022 installed (motorization), as getting a manual telescope is, in my opinion, far more rewarding and usually quite a bit cheaper. It forces you to find objects on your own, and really get a feel for navigating the night sky. I also still recommend getting a Dobsonian with at least 6 inches of aperture as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
