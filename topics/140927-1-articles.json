Me and quite a few other members of the forums have been discussing the idea of so called \u0027programs\u0027 in the Suggestions \u0026amp; Development Discussion subforum. The basic idea is that they would replace the strategies and have a direct influence on what kind of missions pop up in the Mission Control. But it occured to me that such a drastic change to the career mode could ruin some people\u0027s gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is: Do you use them?
