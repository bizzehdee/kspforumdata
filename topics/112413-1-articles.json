If you want to edit the top, pick a part near the bottom to be the new root. To make that part the root, click the tool, click a part next to that part, and then finally pick the part you want to make the root.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T01:30:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 01:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"tbob","CreatedById":137896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T01:36:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So I have an old rocket design and now that I have some new items and I want to make changes; however, I can\u0027t delete the command capsule.

The game builds the connections like a tree from that one root part, and the direction from the root is how the game knows which parts to detach when you click on one.\n\nThat\u0027s what the re-root tool is for (the one next to rotate that looks a little like a lightning bolt). Click on the tool icon, click any part and then another part (other than the capsule) and that second part will become the new \u0022root\u0022 of the ship - the one part you can\u0027t remove. Then the capsule and everything on the other side of it (from the new root) will be removable.\n\nYou may want to re-root back to the capsule after you swap it, just to make the ship behave as expected next time you load it. Just click on the root tool, click on any part (other than the capsule) then click the capsule."},{"CreatedByName":"rollo1002","CreatedById":145192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:18:26Z","Content":"Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:39:02Z","Content":"It has been possible to delete the root part for several versions now. Detach everything from it, then delete it. The only action you will be able to take at this point is to choose a new root part, which then appears with nothing attached to it. Assembly then works normally again. Re-attach the parts you removed, and save. Same ship, new root part."}]}
