\u00A0There\u0027s a vent. \u00A0You open the vent, the air in the airlock leaks out to space. \u00A0You will die if you do not have a suit on, but the venting takes time, so you could close it if you somehow opened the vent by accident.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou then crank open the outer hatch. \u00A0Done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get back in, you get inside, crank the outer hatch closed, and open the inner vent. \u00A0Air leaks into the air lock from the station through that vent. \u00A0Then open the inner hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if you wanted to board the station and the inner door is open and the station is still pressurized?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou open the outer vent, accessible from the outside. \u00A0All the air in the station will eventually drain out that vent. \u00A0This is how attacking space marines would board the station by force. \u00A0Apparently, the air maintenance systems in the station will \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C/em\u003Eautomatically dump their gas contents to try to keep pressure up - there are obviously compressed oxygen tanks and compressed nitrogen tanks onboard, but the computer controls on them won\u0027t automatically dump their contents - so there\u0027s plenty of air left in the gas tanks so you can repressurize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the station pressure is zero, you can open the outer door. \u00A0Then close it. \u00A0You can then access controls and try to re-pressurize - one problem is the vacuum may destroy some of the equipment from overheating, preventing you from doing this. \u00A0You may have to access the valves to do this manually. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if there\u0027s an attacking alien and you need to open the airlock doors to eject them to space? \u00A0You\u0027re screwed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wanted to execute someone, per several movies and tv shows, you\u0027d put them in the inner chamber, while restrained, and activate the vacuum pump. \u00A0Some time later the air pressure would get low enough and they\u0027d peacefully pass out and die. \u00A0No eyeballs exploding, no sudden ejection to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how airlocks should be designed. \u00A0If I were designing a futuristic airlock, the only thing I\u0027d change is add an electric motor to turn the crank. \u00A0I\u0027d deliberately make the motor too weak to actuate the crank unless there is no pressure differential. \u00A0(I\u0027d design the motor to safely stall without burning anything up when this happens).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d then add some cool looking illuminate touch screen controls explaining how to use the airlock, and I\u0027d have all the key controls backed up by manual switches and manual cranks. \u00A0Actually, nix the touch screen manual - print pictograms into a plate set into the side of the airlock panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 2 main crank handles would fold inwards, and there would be 2 red disks that rotate when driven by the servo motor. \u00A0You\u0027d see them turning. \u00A0If there\u0027s a motor failure, you just grab the disk, pull out the fold out crank handle, and turn them yourselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T15:54:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xorth Tanovar","CreatedById":71205,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T16:14:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222383512\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130916\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453996102\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154263\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SomeGuy123\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n25 minutes ago, SomeGuy123 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how attacking space marines would board the station by force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope.

course an inner and an outer door. \u00A0Both are actuated with cranks - no electrics, no control panel, no cool \u0022emergency blow\u0022 button per several movies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth are designed where mechanically an air pressure differential prevents you from opening the hatches at all. \u00A0So you cannot crank on the inner hatch while there is pressure inside the station, and you cannot crank open the outer hatch while there is pressure inside the airlock chamber. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to use the airlock, you just crank open the inner hatch and get inside the chamber. \u00A0Crank closed the inner door. \u00A0Then, you activate the vacuum pump. \u00A0It just pumps the air inside the inner chamber \u003Cem\u003Eback inside the station\u003C/em\u003E. \u00A0That\u0027s it. \u00A0I always figured there were compressed air tanks for holding that air, there aren\u0027t. \u00A0Just a pump and 2 hoses and 1 set of electrical wires to a switch. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if the vacuum pump has failed or there is no power? \u00A0There\u0027s a vent. \u00A0You open the vent, the air in the airlock leaks out to space. \u00A0You will die if you do not have a suit on, but the venting takes time, so you could close it if you somehow opened the vent by accident.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou then crank open the outer hatch. \u00A0Done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get back in, you get inside, crank the outer hatch closed, and open the inner vent. \u00A0Air leaks into the air lock from the station through that vent. \u00A0Then open the inner hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if you wanted to board the station and the inner door is open and the station is still pressurized?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou open the outer vent, accessible from the outside. \u00A0All the air in the station will eventually drain out that vent. \u00A0This is how attacking space marines would board the station by force. \u00A0Apparently, the air maintenance systems in the station will \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C/em\u003Eautomatically dump their gas contents to try to keep pressure up - there are obviously compressed oxygen tanks and compressed nitrogen tanks onboard, but the computer controls on them won\u0027t automatically dump their contents - so there\u0027s plenty of air left in the gas tanks so you can repressurize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the station pressure is zero, you can open the outer door. \u00A0Then close it. \u00A0You can then access controls and try to re-pressurize - one problem is the vacuum may destroy some of the equipment from overheating, preventing you from doing this. \u00A0You may have to access the valves to do this manually. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if there\u0027s an attacking alien and you need to open the airlock doors to eject them to space? \u00A0You\u0027re screwed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wanted to execute someone, per several movies and tv shows, you\u0027d put them in the inner chamber, while restrained, and activate the vacuum pump. \u00A0Some time later the air pressure would get low enough and they\u0027d peacefully pass out and die. \u00A0No eyeballs exploding, no sudden ejection to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how airlocks should be designed. \u00A0If I were designing a futuristic airlock, the only thing I\u0027d change is add an electric motor to turn the crank. \u00A0I\u0027d deliberately make the motor too weak to actuate the crank unless there is no pressure differential. \u00A0(I\u0027d design the motor to safely stall without burning anything up when this happens).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d then add some cool looking illuminate touch screen controls explaining how to use the airlock, and I\u0027d have all the key controls backed up by manual switches and manual cranks. \u00A0Actually, nix the touch screen manual - print pictograms into a plate set into the side of the airlock panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 2 main crank handles would fold inwards, and there would be 2 red disks that rotate when driven by the servo motor. \u00A0You\u0027d see them turning. \u00A0If there\u0027s a motor failure, you just grab the disk, pull out the fold out crank handle, and turn them yourselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple is better\u00A0\u003Cimg
