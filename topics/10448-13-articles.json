I would\u0027ve preferred to carry on but I think I\u0027ve burned out a little. I\u0027m really busy IRL atm and am not finding any joy in stress-KSPing. As I\u0027ve mentioned, I might resume or run something again in the future, but no promises."},{"CreatedByName":"issarlk","CreatedById":17336,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T11:20:56Z","Content":"Thank you Don for running the campaign. It was great fun and I learned a lot with it in matters of rocket efficiency."}]}
