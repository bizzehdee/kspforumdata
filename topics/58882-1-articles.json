Drop them one at a time in an attempt to score a nice location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Send a robotic lander, drive it to a decent location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Equip your lander with wings so you can glide to a good landing location. Gliding is extremely easy on eve. Even if your lander is huge and just has some tail canards at the draggy end, this can give you tens of kilometers of range flexibility if used correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Install Scan Sat, send a mapping probe, and make your own map to use for planning landing sites.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ScottyDoesKnow","CreatedById":70796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T22:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the \u0022real\u0022 thing the point is that I can land anywhere so I won\u0027t have to search for a good location.
