Get them into an orbit of Kerbin and get them back, and they\u0027re level 1. Simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you do a lot of rescue contracts, you\u0027ll end up with even more level 1 Kerbals, that you don\u0027t really need for your program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be better, for there to be a chance for a level 2 or even a level 3 Kerbal from the rescue mission ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thinking is that it would be more rewarding for longer running career games to keep picking up rescue contracts, and in early stages of career games, a level 2 or 3 Kerbal could really help on some missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
