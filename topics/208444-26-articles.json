The outcome of the event was uncertain; the icecream was completely consumed by Gargamel and the cones became crushed from lack of enthusiasm by the moderators. The inspector later wrote a scathing report; despite having no memory of previous events, it was imaginative and entertaining in its depiction of strange hallucinations and bizarre potatoes. He was deliberately throwing doubt across the entire Kerbol system as to what had happened, so more inspectors arrived to grab a bunch of managers to remove the sting of the report. However, before they were ready for publishing, the Kraken released a piece of artwork based on macaroni cheese to surpass the wiggly tentacles playing the piano for fun. This caused a hyperbolic frenzy in publishing the report, resulting in an outrage against its writers, who then asked, \u0022Where are the snacks?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nBoris suddenly saw an opportunity to sell copious amounts of Snacks. Hot cupcakes sold like hotcakes and cold cake sold like cold cream cups (which are good for puffy eyes). But something unexpected did occur: the inspector shared his lunch and threw a party for everyone, although Geonovast excluded Gargamel. Curveball-Anders took everyone to the local ice cream-pizza-pinball-chicken-applesauce-candy-methalox-whole_pineapple-drywall parlour and asked for some funds from the waiter, who choked on the pinball release-lever, tilting the machine over. \u0022Funds!\u0022 he exclaimed flabbergastedly,\u0022 you want my FUNDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u0022 \u0022HOW DARE YOU EVEN SUGGEST SUCH A THING!\u0022 \u0022WHY I OUGHTA...\u0022 the waiter fumed indignantly as he gasped for air, collapsing while clutching his ukulele. \u0022Oh crud,\u0022 he wheezed into a squeezebox, which inflated to the size of a prize-winning pumpkin. \u0022A prize\u0022, said Starhawk, \u0022is worth funds.\u0022 Tiredly, the waiter raised a kickstarter campaign to capture the wiggly tentacles playing the piano for fun, and a plan was beginning to form in his mind. He imagined a B.O.B (Battle of the Bands) in which Jeb, for marketing purposes, screamed an Electric-Guitar intro of \u0022Let\u0027s go Crazy\u0022. The monster, however, preferred jazz piano, and tried to eat them, but\u00A0a rogue\u00A0hard disk formatted the simulated soft-serve ice-cream, instantly replacing people with\u00A0other people flavoured like\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
