After sorting out the issues I had with the gears, I have run into another, more serious problem. While taking off, the wings, which I made from from the structural parts, break off, even after supporting them with struts. I have no idea how to fix this, thus I came here. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F0zHx5w.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F0zHx5w.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for the replies.
