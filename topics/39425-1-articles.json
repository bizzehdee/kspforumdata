I picked however a rather bad spot to land, turned out to be the side of a hill (never tried landing while dark before) and my initial lander tipped as it touched down sending the command pod down the hill a little ways, all the while being chased by the main bulk of the lander!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mounted a rescue mission for my kerbals, designed a new rocket with a new lander capable of landing on an incline safely. I then launched a refueling satellite into Munar orbit for the lander to refuel before making its trip home (its 22 tons with all the fuel burned off). On the way there I realized I forgot to add parachutes to the lander and an important part of the staging that would drop a few tons of its dead weight so now it doesn\u0027t have enough thrust to land safely on Kerbal so decided what the hell it will be the start of a Munar base and I will send a new lander to pick up my kerbals later however...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1184.photobucket.com/albums/z335/annallia92/landing_zpsb0cdc709.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022landing_zpsb0cdc709.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerfect landing.
