Would it actually help to setup my X52 Pro to fly this in-atmo?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, on the subject of engines/intakes: a pair of RAPIERs is a necessity at this weight (34 tons). the other two can be swapped for turbo-ramjets (again, do these actually do anything over the rapiers?), but I can\u0027t swap in a set of, say, aero-spikes, unless I\u0027m satisfied with sub-mach-1 speeds in atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts right now are to try swapping the FTL800s for a series of Pre-coolers or Mk1 Fuselage intakes. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have the oxidizer at that point to actually reach orbit (fuel hasn\u0027t been the issue yet), but I might be able to run on jets a bit longer/higher. Still not going to solve the lift issues at high speeds....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdits below as I test:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 1: Swapped the FTLs to 3 precoolers (for a total of 4 behind the ram intake), and the outer rapiers to turbo-rams. Was able to get to ~24k under ramjet? power and ~1200m/s surface speed. The problem? with SAS on or off, the plane started to see-saw. Further testing on this setup shows that while I can reliably get sub-orbital at this point (~80k Apo) in a gradual climb method (Rapiers to rocket power at ~20k, turbos run till about 25k), I consistently fall about 900m/s short in terms of delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I need one of the following it seems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) A way to cram more fuel on board without losing intake air. This is....not my preferred method, since adding fuel doesn\u0027t increase my speed, and I have to start firing the rockets lower to make up the weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) A way to have the Mk2 cockpit survive higher speeds than the ~1000m/s speed it currently can. If I could run it at 15-20k and 2000m/s, I\u0027m fairly certain this would be simple (since, for one thing, I could run the jets even higher with the extra air-flow)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) A way to run the jets higher. I\u0027m generally finding that it\u0027s best to switch the rapiers to rocket mode at about 20k. Higher and the turbos choke faster from lack of air, and the rapiers auto switch anyways at that point, and lower I\u0027m just wasting air. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) RATO (rocket-asist-to-orbit) drop pod rockets.

The best flight plans I\u0027ve found are reactive to the mach effect visuals, using the last big gasp of jet thrust to pull up hard and push the AP ahead of them. With rapiers, you can get \u0027useful\u0027 thrust in air mode up to about 25km, and they\u0027ll die at 27 whatever you do; in an ideal flight, you\u0027ll have an AP well over 30 at this point, and I\u0027ve managed 35 on occasion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the controls are twitchy; use smaller control surfaces ^^; In fact you probably don\u0027t need to be using the big delta wings, I think the old triangles would do... might have less drag \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs clarification: I\u0027ve got smaller control surfaces, just don\u0027t bother to put RCS on untill I get something that\u0027s actually orbit-capable. TBH, I don\u0027t *think* flight profile is the issue. Like I said, unless I can find another ~1km/s somewhere in the current design, that\u0027s the issue. I can already get the AP up to 30/35 on jet power, it\u0027s getting it from that to ~75km and then circularizing that I fall short on. I generally keep it at ~800m/s untill I hit about 17km, then floor it.

I might suggest moving the wings back a little and compensating for the shift in CoL with a pair of canards; those would help your pitch issues anyway since they\u0027d be well forward of the CoM.
