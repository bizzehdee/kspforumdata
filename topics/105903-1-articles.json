However, once I\u0027m up there, I only have a few options:\n\n1) already be on a ballistic arc, and fire my rockets.\n\n2) have my engines flame out, slide down to ~15k, re-light them\n\n3) have my engines not flame out by coasting up slower, but have zero control authority, slide down to 17k, repeat.\n\nIt \\*seems\\* like I should be able to get higher, but I either am going to slow and my engines burn out, or I completely lose control authority.

Ditched the oldder designs that were giving me trouble and started from a clean slate. Built the following delta space plane. \n\n![r2Fkjbx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/r2Fkjbx.jpg)\n\nFuselage parts, front to back, are: Mk2 cockpit, drone core, crew cabin, docking port, Mk2 liquid fuel tank (short), Mk2 rocket fuel tank (Long), Bicoupler, RAPIER engines. \n\nSide pod parts, front to back, are: Ram intake, FLT800 fuel tank, pre-cooler (do these actually do anything?), RAPIER.\n\nUsing the Big-S delta wings (empty of fuel) and elevons (Big-S elevons make it WAY too twitchy though, and I\u0027ve got more than enough authority now, so prob going to switch those for smaller elevons).\n\nI can get this sucker into space using either a straight up zoom climb (unable to orbit), or a more gradual, lower throttle climb to ~18k before flooring it (Also unable to orbit, but a good bit closer).\n\nThe issues I\u0027m having are:\n\n-1050m/s over the ground seems to be the upper limit before the cockpit explodes from over heating (below ~22km).\n\n-At that altitude, even if I pitch up, I don\u0027t have the lift to climb anymore, and start to \u0022slide\u0022\n\n-keyboard controls are SUPER twitchy, even with precision controls activated. Would it actually help to setup my X52 Pro to fly this in-atmo?\n\nAs a side note, on the subject of engines/intakes: a pair of RAPIERs is a necessity at this weight (34 tons). the other two can be swapped for turbo-ramjets (again, do these actually do anything over the rapiers?), but I can\u0027t swap in a set of, say, aero-spikes, unless I\u0027m satisfied with sub-mach-1 speeds in atmo.\n\nMy thoughts right now are to try swapping the FTL800s for a series of Pre-coolers or Mk1 Fuselage intakes. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have the oxidizer at that point to actually reach orbit (fuel hasn\u0027t been the issue yet), but I might be able to run on jets a bit longer/higher. Still not going to solve the lift issues at high speeds....\n\nEdits below as I test:\n\nTest 1: Swapped the FTLs to 3 precoolers (for a total of 4 behind the ram intake), and the outer rapiers to turbo-rams. Was able to get to ~24k under ramjet? power and ~1200m/s surface speed. The problem? with SAS on or off, the plane started to see-saw. Further testing on this setup shows that while I can reliably get sub-orbital at this point (~80k Apo) in a gradual climb method (Rapiers to rocket power at ~20k, turbos run till about 25k), I consistently fall about 900m/s short in terms of delta-v.\n\nAt this point I need one of the following it seems:\n\n1) A way to cram more fuel on board without losing intake air. This is....not my preferred method, since adding fuel doesn\u0027t increase my speed, and I have to start firing the rockets lower to make up the weight.\n\n2) A way to have the Mk2 cockpit survive higher speeds than the ~1000m/s speed it currently can. If I could run it at 15-20k and 2000m/s, I\u0027m fairly certain this would be simple (since, for one thing, I could run the jets even higher with the extra air-flow)\n\n3) A way to run the jets higher. I\u0027m generally finding that it\u0027s best to switch the rapiers to rocket mode at about 20k. Higher and the turbos choke faster from lack of air, and the rapiers auto switch anyways at that point, and lower I\u0027m just wasting air. \n\n4) RATO (rocket-asist-to-orbit) drop pod rockets. Again, I don\u0027t want to do this. This is supposed to be an SSTO for Kod\u0027s sake.\n\nThis is the current \u0022best\u0022 setup I\u0027ve gotten to (yes, I\u0027m missing a set of rear RCS. I\u0027m not motivated enough to add them back in every time I swap something) (also, yay! 7.4 tons lighter!):\n\n![Brl2nTH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Brl2nTH.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T07:16:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PanzerAce**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T06:54:17Z","Content":"I suspect that you can get that plane to orbit by a change of piloting tactic ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Four rapiers is far and away enough thrust for the job, and you might well manage with just three - although I\u0027d be inclined to add the \u0027missing\u0027 control surfaces to the rear wing, and have the outer pair for roll and the inner pair for pitch.\n\nWhat you might want to try is this:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Turns out the key is to follow the Mach effects, without blowing up.
