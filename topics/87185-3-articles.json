The wrongness, it must hurt!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is not how a hypothetical space elevator works, not on Mars, not on Earth, not anywhere. The whole point of a space elevator is to reach orbit. The end station therefore must be at a geostationary (or areostationary in this case) orbit. If it\u0027s any lower, then you don\u0027t reach orbit and you fall down when you step off the elevator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA space elevator is built by launching the end station into an equatorial geostationary (areostationary) orbit, and unreeling two tethers: one down to the ground and one away from the ground to act as a counter-weight. The satellite has to, at a minimum, carry both reels of unobtanium tether material that is strong enough to support a climber vehicle, rigid enough to withstand traction over 36000km (or 17000km for Mars), and light enough to be launched. So far we don\u0027t have such a material. Without the counter-weight, the CoM moves away from the satellite and your end station is no longer where it should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would you build a centrifugal space elevator exactly? How could you assume that it\u0027s easier to build one on Mars than on Earth if you don\u0027t understand how it\u0027s built? The answer is, you can\u0027t, because that\u0027s not how a space elevator works. If the centrifugal force was that strong, Mars would be ejecting it\u0027s own mass rocks and would gradually destroy itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGEO satellites in Earth orbit require station-keeping because of orbital resonance from the Moon and even from planets and tiny irregularities in Earth\u0027s orbit. Phobos and Deimos are smaller satellites, but they will be passing much closer, above and below the elevator CoM station, causing a much stronger disturbance. They *will* influence the orbit of the elevator, at best causing its orbit to \u0022wobble\u0022, at worse causing it to fly off course, which will create tension on the tether. Just like any GEO satellite, the station needs station keeping to remain at the exact point over the equator. At one point, because all orbits end up crossing the equator, the orbit of Phobos *will* intersect the elevator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am talking about a hypothetical future where we already have a large presence- probably one or several permanent colonies and thousands (or millions) of people on Mars.

However, during the first decades of the space age, 1960s and 1970s, an alternative means of getting to space was proposed, a space elevator [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5]. The basic concept is to string a cable from the Earth\u0027s surface to an altitude beyond geosynchronous orbit ( altitude). \u003Cstrong\u003EThe competing forces of gravity at the lower end and outward centrifugal acceleration at the farther end keep the cable under tension and stationary over a single position on Earth (Fig. 1).\u003C/strong\u003E Theoretically, the cable could be constructed long and would be balanced in equilibrium [5]. However, placing a counterweight at the far end of a shorter cable, once the Earth end is anchored, would simplify construction and give the same stability. The cable would be tapered such that it is thickest at the point of highest tension (geosynchronous orbit) and thinnest where the tension is the lowest (at the ends) [5]. This cable, once deployed, can be ascended by mechanical means to Earth orbit. If a climber proceeds to the far end of the cable it would have sufficient energy to escape from Earth\u0027s gravity well simply by separating from the cable. The space elevator thus has the capability in theory to provide easy access to Earth orbit and most of the planets in our solar system [5].\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB.C.

In this equilibrium position the string is under tension [4]. \u003Cstrong\u003ETo explain this we note that the motion center, which is defined by the equality of centrifugal and gravitational accelerations, is located at the geostationary orbit (one revolution/sideric day). The motion center is different from the center of mass and the center of gravity of the string. For a mass element of the string located below the geostationary radius the value of the gravitational acceleration acting on it is larger than the value of the corresponding centrifugal acceleration and for a mass element above the geostationary radius the value of the centrifugal acceleration is larger than that of the gravitational acceleration. Thus below the geostationary height the net force acting at a string element is pointing towards the Earth and above the geostationary height the net force is pointing away from the Earth.\u003C/strong\u003E Decomposing these forces into a component in the direction of the straight line connecting these two elements and perpendicular to this line, results that the string is under tension and further a moment is created turning the string into the radial direction, as it is depicted for a dumb-bell satellite, which is a system of two point masses connected by a massless rigid rod, in Fig. 2. This intuitive reasoning convinces some scientists that the radial configuration is stable.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENicola Pugno, Michael Schwarzbart, Alois Steindl, Hans Troger, On the stability of the track of the space elevator, Acta Astronautica, Volume 64, Issues 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01536, March\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153April 2009, Pages 524-537, ISSN 0094-5765, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2008.10.005\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2008.10.005\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576508003391\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576508003391\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA space elevator is extremely simple.

The planet simply twirls the tether around in space, causing the tether to be tight under the tension created by centrifugal force.

Humanity needs a backup in case something hits earth.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Humanity is destroyed, then there isn\u0027t much point in having a backup. It\u0027s not like you could rebuild everything or bring people back. If everything is gone, you won\u0027t be there to lament about it being gone and there won\u0027t be anyone left to care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut seriously, what sort of event could really wipe out Humanity totally? If we can survive in closed-loop habitats on Mars, we could survive any of the extinction-event impactors that have hit Earth in the past. We could dig ourselves underground and live off the same hydroponic tomatoes and recycled urine that would keep us alive in space. Even if 99% of humanity was wiped out, there would still be millions of survivors that would still find life much easier on a scorched Earth than on Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-16T12:24:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2014 12:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
