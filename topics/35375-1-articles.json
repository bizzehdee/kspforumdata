It\u0027s sort of the scientific version of telling stories about elves and wizards, and it\u0027s easy to do on paper. You can write down equations that describe magnetic monopoles, then see what consequences their existence would have. You can write down equations that describe a universe with no mass in it, and see what would happen. You can examine the consequences of changing the speed of light to ten miles per hour, or making Planck\u0027s constant a billion times bigger, and all sorts of crazy sh*t comes out of the equations. It\u0027s fun, it stretches the mental musculature, and it has no implications whatsoever concerning the actual existence of any of those phenomena. There are no magnetic monopoles, the universe does contain mass, the speed of light is not ten miles per hour, et cetera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the more amusing fictions turns out to be the existence of matter with negative mass. You can write down Einstein\u0027s field equations for a metric that incorporates negative mass, and find that crazy sh*t happens -- specifically, certain arrangements of it cause pockets of spacetime to do very strange things, like drag matter along at speeds greater than \u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E relative to matter outside that odd little pocket, which then breaks causality. Miguel Alcubierre did that, and published a paper about the curious consequences of that particular nonexistent universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttention whores like Harold White seized upon this and started trumpeting \u0022Warp drive can be real! Give me money and I\u0027ll have Captain Kirk banging green chicks by this time next year! Just don\u0027t look to closely at the part where none of it works without a galaxy\u0027s worth of negative mass packed into a cubic meter, which you have to conjure into existence and then make disappear at will.\u0022 More recently, further media attention was attracted when they figured out that if you make the nonexistent stuff magically appear and disappear \u003Cem\u003Ereally fast\u003C/em\u003E, then you can get by with a lot less of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhite \u003Cem\u003Eet al.\u003C/em\u003E are very careful to downplay the fact that the entire concept is built upon fiction. In their papers, they will very occasionally mention \u0022exotic matter,\u0022 which is their preferred euphemism for things that don\u0027t exist, but will otherwise treat it as granted that you can drive down to Costco and buy the stuff by the pallet. In the recent paper, they never even get as far as admitting that mass-energy (negative or otherwise) tends not to appear and disappear, despite the proposed scheme depending on exactly that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost physicists, sadly, tend to enable them due to a tendency to be exceedingly precise about what we can prove mathematically, and what is mere empirical fact. When asked about the Alcubierre scheme and its negative mass, they say things like \u0022Well, negative mass has never been observed, but there\u0027s nothing in the equations that explicitly prohibits it.\u0022 This is true, but possibly misleading -- there\u0027s nothing in the equations that prohibits the existence of magnetic monopoles, or Planck\u0027s constant from being a billion times bigger than it is, but those situations are quite solidly not the case. Journalists, naturally, translate that quote as \u0022Warp drive is real! Physicist says negative mass can be made,\u0022 which is utterly wrong. And as agencies like NASA are populated with people who know sh*tloads about turbopumps, electronics, metallurgy, and hypersonic aerodynamics, but are usually no more familiar with general relativity than the journalists, this occasionally results in research funding for the Unicorn Fart Warp Drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear, my beef with White is not that he\u0027s continuing to examine the implications of metrics with strong local negative curvature.

Such observations would be \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E news for the field of quantum gravity -- like Nobel Prize huge. Many of those hypotheses conflict with each other, too, so we can\u0027t even make reasonably precise predictions about whether spacetime even forms closed loops, or their size and duration if it did, or much of anything else in the absence of some observational evidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the causality question: If you can use it like everybody thinks of using faster-than-light travel (i.e. you can start in one place, turn on the warp drive, go somewhere, turn it off, and be somewhere else before a beam of light would have gotten there), then it violates causality. This is a trivial consequence of any information or energy going from point A to point B faster than light, no matter what the mechanism.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T21:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, warp drive violates global causality. But there is absolutely no law stating that causality must be obeyed globally. It is a local property, and warp drive does preserve local causality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for wormholes, there is no known mechanism for a change in topology of space-time, and one must alter space-time topology to create a new wormhole. Of course, it\u0027s possible that there are enough microscopic wormholes around that we don\u0027t need to create one from scratch. Only manipulate it to make it traversable. That we can do with known physics, at least, if not with known materials. But we haven\u0027t discovered any actual wormholes, so that\u0027s a bit of a moot point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarp drive is currently the only FTL method which we actually understand the physics of. There are still some major theoretical hurdles, like requirement for negative energy densities, but these are a problem for traversable wormholes as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T03:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe warp drive does not actually break the speed of light.

Correct. But it wouldn\u0027t be encountered at FTL speeds from the front.
