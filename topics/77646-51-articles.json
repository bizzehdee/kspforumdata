I imagine having the sat turn on every once in a while and charging for hours at a time would definitely be a viable option, but dust buildup is an issue, and batteries do hold less charge over time. If the community could come up with the money needed, we\u0027d need to be sure the satellite could function for a reasonable amount of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest something along the lines of an ultra-low power system, one that could run for days or even weeks on internal batteries.
