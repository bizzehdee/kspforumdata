I have some experience with Unity, Blender and coding so I have some of the basics down at least. I want to create a UI element basically, something like the Docking Port Alignment Indicator and Lazer Docking cam mods do but I have no idea how to go about it. I don\u0027t even know how it works exactly or how stuff like that displays on the screen. Obviously I have a big trip to make in order to reach the point I want, but I can\u0027t find any sources to help me in this trip, so if there are any suggestions or sources you can provide it would be awesome. Thanks a lot for your help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-06T16:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately official documentation is scarce - the API doc is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E -\u00A0 mostly a list of methods and fields with a (very) few comments.
