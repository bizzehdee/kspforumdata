What\u0027s the best approach to join several items in the surface of a body?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been trying to do it without mods. To join several pieces I am\u00A0using some retractile wheels (so when a part is in position I can hide them), but these wheels doesn\u0027t have a motor, so I am using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E systems. But this is cumbersome (and it tries to manage it as if you are trying to rotate a ship) and gives me headaches to join the different parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlpacaMall","CreatedById":209127,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-04T21:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKoQn-aggf88KJjB8ai1XVklHN5LNE84k\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis YouTube series\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0to be really helpful for learning how to best assemble a modular base.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key takeaway (at least, what I got from it) was that it\u0027s best to use some external vehicle (a rover, etc.) to move the base components into place. That way, you don\u0027t have to build the wheels and navigation into every module. One method I like now is to build a \u0022cart\u0022 that can slip underneath a base module, then use the landing legs to lower the module onto the cart.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, for your plane wheels \u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E method, you can select the docking port and choose \u0022Control from here\u0022 to make it act more like a rover. In addition, if you really don\u0027t want rotation, you can disable pitch/yaw/roll in the \u0022Show actuation toggles\u0022 option, if you have advanced tweakables enabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordCorwin","CreatedById":114256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-05T15:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I will take a look on them. A vehicle seems the best approach, I agree. I will also look at disabling the pitch/yaw /roll option with advanced tweakables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
