I\u0027ve accumulated a sufficient amount of designs that I believe it is prudent to put them all in one place. Henceforth, I present to you Brightsong Development, where I shall consolidate information on my current craft and also post future developments. Before I start, I would like to give a very special thanks to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/52690-rune/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002252690\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/52690-rune/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Rune\u003C/a\u003E, whose \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and Surface Base designs were in large part the inspiration for my own craft. If I mention that something is designed to fit into a cargo bay, chances are it was made with his \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E fleet as the first consideration. And without further delay...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EModular Mobility\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe initial offering for the modular mobility section is the \u003Cem\u003EKentipede\u003C/em\u003E, a rugged mobile base. I have personally driven it off the edge of the Dres canyon and ridden it out completely intact. No word on the Mohole yet; It seems that my launch vehicle can no longer survive physics initialization, interrupting plans to test it there. Nonetheless, should you be able to haul it to orbit, each module possesses provision for landing, with aerospike engines, parachutes, and a fuel reserve. \u003Cem\u003EKentipede\u003C/em\u003E modules are built out of Mark3 cargo bays, so they will not fit into them for obvious reasons.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/SingABrightSong/Kentipede\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalX\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext up is the \u003Cem\u003EKaterpillar\u003C/em\u003E. While just as capable in terms of onboard facilities as the \u003Cem\u003EKentipede\u003C/em\u003E, the \u003Cem\u003EKaterpillar\u003C/em\u003E is designed to fit into a Mk3 cargo bay, so it lacks the sheer ruggedness and the ability to self-deploy. It resembles earlier prototypes of the Kentipede, but boasts a much lower part count, as well as regular module length. so extant deployment solutions are much more feasible to use. The wheels were, of course, an issue, but I discovered that they still work even if attached at an angle. If you have an open-ended cargo bay, say, one with a ramp at the end, it can even drive itself out after decoupling. Quite satisfying to pull off.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/SingABrightSong/Katerpillar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalX\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter designing a base to fit in a Mk3 bay, the obvious next step was to design one for Mk2. Thus was born the \u003Cem\u003EKrawler\u003C/em\u003E. No driving out for this one, I fear, but it is rocket-powered, due to the necessity of using landing gear instead of motorized wheels. Thus, if your Mk2 spaceplane has to deploy it before landing, it is theoretically possible to land under its own power on, say, Gilly, though it is recommended that you just flip the cargo bay in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. It lacks the power, of course, of its older siblings, but is still capable of research and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E operations.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/SingABrightSong/Krawler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalX\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, the logical extreme of the preceding process is to make something that fits into a Mk1 cargo bay. Enter the \u003Cem\u003EKreeper\u003C/em\u003E. There is not actually a Mk1 cargo bay in stock KSP, however, and the 1.25 Service Bay is too small and fragile to be much use in this scenario, so instead I used the Structural Fuselage as my design guide. There are very few 0.625m modules in stock KSP, therefore making an actual *base* was out of the question, but if you staff it with an Engineer kerbonaut it should be capable of gathering science indefinitely in any rocky environment, provided it doesn\u0027t explode on the way there.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/SingABrightSong/Kreeper\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalX\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat concludes the initial offering for Modular Mobility, but I have several concepts I wish to explore. Modular seabases? Modular aircraft? I\u0027d look into modular orbital bases but I think that\u0027s already kind of standard. Landers, however...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EMiscellaneous\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInspired by the \u0022experimental aerospike\u0022 from the comic book series \u003Ci\u003EAtomic Robo, \u003C/i\u003Efrom which it draws its name, the \u003Cem\u003ETesladyne\u003C/em\u003E is a \u0022light chemical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022, that, while not of much utility, has proven quite fun to fly. It\u0027s design is not, in fact, based off its inspiration, but was instead an attempt to see how tiny and tidy I could make a Mk2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I deemed it a success after making it to orbit and back intact, but I am not a very good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E pilot so chances are the veterans around here can do better. Any similarity to designs by a certain dropship dealership is purely coincidental \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/SingABrightSong/Tesladyne\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalX\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s it, for now, but I do expect that I shall continue to experiment, and at least some of those experiments will likely end up here.
