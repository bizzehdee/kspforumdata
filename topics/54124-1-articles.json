I noticed that last night. The pod twitches after coming out of warp and it looked like the parachute was the culprit. The fact that the pod has little to no torque doesn\u0027t help either. So what I did was I placed four of the FASA mini-comp reaction wheels in the pod and that nullified it. Still jumps though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alpha tech","CreatedById":84978,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T17:21:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ein 22 the Soyuz tma has retro rockets if that helps \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the retro rockets have auto ignition so that they deploy at 7m\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
