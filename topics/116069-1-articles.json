I don\u0027t think it\u0027s really appropriate to say AR is a \u0022lite\u0022 version of RT.\n\nThe purpose of RT is to make it very difficult to use probes at all. It works under the assumption that probes require direct control from somebody on the ground, so requires you to set up a communications network just to be able to control probes in space. It also factors in signal delay times as distance increases so you have to do some in-game programming to give probes commands in advance of when they\u0027ll actually do them. The bottom line is to jack up the price of using probes by making you build a large and complex communications network.\n\nRT was originally created long before career mode came out so really isn\u0027t career-friendly, especially due to the cost of setting up networks. Because of this, in career games, it basically means you do the vast majority of your missions with crewed ships instead of probes. Another issue with RT is that communications naturally require antennae (and it comes with many antenna parts), but the oceanic nature of the atmospheres of other planets mean that you\u0027ll burn any exposed antennae right off if you try to aerocapture/brake. This means you pretty much need to avoid touching atmospheres with probes.\n\nAR, OTOH, was invented specifically for career mode. Its primary function is to prevent transmitting science data unless you have a connection back to KSC, and the longer the range, the bigger the antenna you need. It has no signal delay and has nothing to do with controlling probes unless you activate that option. Because it only uses the 3 (now 4) stock antennae, you can talk pretty much everywhere with the 88-88. You can, however, set up networks if you want to."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T21:51:16Z","Content":"Geschosskopf is largely correct, but it\u0027s worth remembering that Remote Tech can be configured, so signal delay can be removed and probe control can be enabled when a link isn\u0027t present. So it can work effectively like Antenna Range with different antenna parts. AR is still simpler for career mode though."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T01:23:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E RT was originally created long before career mode came out so really isn\u0027t career-friendly, especially due to the cost of setting up networks.

So I find that the two together add an interesting element of depth to the game-- there\u0027s a real choice to be made in manned-vs-unmanned, since they each come with their own challenges."},{"CreatedByName":"ebigunso","CreatedById":113229,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T04:46:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think he\u0027s after [Probe Control Room](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67450-WIP-IVA-PLUGIN-ProbeControlRoom-1-0-beta8a-IVA-All-the-things!-new-3D-RPM-17) mod.
