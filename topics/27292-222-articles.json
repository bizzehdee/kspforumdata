I looked at my archives, and noted that I was missing the materials study and mystery goo data both high above and near Minmus. So, I thought to myself, that\u0027s something I can just stick into a transfer/orbital stage, then collect the data before going to land. I threw together an ascent stage and checked its mass, to see if I could make an ascent and Kerbin return on RCS alone. I thought I could, but didn\u0027t go into any depth calculating, just a quick, crude, conservative estimate of TWR in my head and plenty of monopropellant. Didn\u0027t end up mattering, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put this RCS ascent stage onto a biome-hopper/landing stage with two materials labs and two goo canisters, both intended for the surface. Then, below, I attached an orbital transfer stage with another two materials labs and goo canisters, and a reaction wheel, along with fuel and engines, of course. Seven orange tanks with mainsails and asparagus staging would lift it to orbit. I didn\u0027t add any SRBs this time, which probably contributed to the fact that the lifter stage was only just more than enough to achieve orbit with my admittedly poor ascent profile. So the lifter was not so overpowered as to also do the whole transfer burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI transferred, did the materials/goo science, took lots of gravity readings, made orbit, lowered it, did the other materials/goo science and took more gravity readings, transferring the data back to the lander can by EVA. Then I began to land, using the transfer stage for much of the deceleration. It was still partially full when I dropped it just above the Great Flats, but due to a staging error, the engine on the lander stage did not immediately activate, and the assembly hit the ground together. Attempting to lift off resulted in a crash, followed by a quickload. Unfortunately, last quicksave was LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I did it all again, more carefully this time. Circularised a high orbit around Minmus, did science and checked that the orbit passed over several biomes I had not yet landed in, lowered and recircularised to get more science and to choose landing spots, then came in to land at Minmus Highlands, dropping the transfer stage higher this time, and actually activating the lander engine. When the transfer stage was dropped, it split into three pieces explosively, despite lack of radial decouplers. You can see some of the remains in this image: what remains of the central piece is in the foreground alongside Jeb and the lander, while that little thing in the background is the debris of one of the side pieces, with the instrumentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/eoBJOP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eoBJOP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter doing the surface science, it was off to the Flats, which were nearby, and happened to be in just the right place that heading straight up was almost the direction to burn for Kerbin return. Also, like the Highlands, they were on the sunny side of Minmus, which was important because I had forgotten to add landing lights. This went well, and so did the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/FUQsve.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FUQsve.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the return. While I was confident I could make the return on RCS alone, I decided it was better to be safe. So, I used the lander engine to get most of the way to Minmus escape, then dropped it (still half-full, I think) and did the rest on RCS. I attempted to guide my return and land in the crater, but ended up in the grasslands. But it was a safe return with a lot of science (though it may not be impressive to some).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/CHG3qs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CHG3qs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2418.

Also the Z-4k, lots of structural pieces and probe cores and so on. Only three top-tier technological nodes to go, and also Ion Engines. I expect to get enough science for those in a Mun mission soon, because I haven\u0027t revisited Mun for a while, and I somehow forgot to get the Crew Report in space near the Mun.
