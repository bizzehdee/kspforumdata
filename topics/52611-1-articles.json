KSP_Win is the location where KSP is installed if you download the Windows version from Squad\u0027s store page. Steam installs it to SteamApps/Common/Kerbal Space Program instead. Mods tend to install into the GameData directory inside common/Kerbal Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps.
