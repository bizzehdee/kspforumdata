It had a nice radial chute about 3x the size of the mk16xl. I tried a big habitat hub on top of a twin boar. All the chutes streamed out above 10k which is nice (next thing on agenda is Duna stuff) and then came down at 5m/s with a half tank of fuel! Very impressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think this was the one I tried before, \u00A0but it works for what I need.
