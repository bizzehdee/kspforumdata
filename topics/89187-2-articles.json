So the number of textures is an issue, as is the size. The bigger they are, the more memory it\u0027ll consume. Think of it this way, an uncompressed 1024x1024 image, is 3 mb in size. So no matter how much compression you cram into your texture, KSP will still load 3 mb for that texture. If you have 10 textures, you are already looking at 30 mb of RAM being consumed. That\u0027s why KSP uses so much memory. I don\u0027t know if this is a problem with Unity though, or it\u0027s something Squad chose to do. Game engines like idTech 5, or CryEngine have dynamic load of assets to reduce memory usage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T21:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGive us a download!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffersonFlight","CreatedById":111703,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T23:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea of this.

There is no part in my inventory that looks good when placed there, and for some reason that REALLY bothers me! I thought that the screenshots in the OP were a trick of the light, or that you had some other part attached between the shielded docking port and the command pod, but no, it really is that ugly when anything of 1.25 meter diameter is put there. It\u0027s a shame, I was really looking forward to adding these parts to my game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not share your pessimism, specially when it\u0027s such an easy fix \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The diameter was wrong, and is on the list of fixed things for next release \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neutrinovore","CreatedById":72520,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T01:06:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022v1per\u0022 data-cite=\u0022v1per\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do not share your pessimism, specially when it\u0027s such an easy fix \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The diameter was wrong, and is on the list of fixed things for next release \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, jeez, I\u0027m really sorry! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E I thought that maybe it was a deliberate design choice, for a reason known only to you.

It looks like your work is of above average quality, and I\u0027m sure that it will only improve as you continue to create new parts and refine what you already have. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, I certainly encourage you to not let schmucks like me discourage your creativity and abilities. You can do something that I\u0027ll never be able to do, and frankly that\u0027s great by me. You can create all kinds of neat parts for the game we both enjoy, and then we all get to play with them, yay! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep on keepin\u0027 on, V1per!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"v1per","CreatedById":115406,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T01:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry dude.

I fixed the diameter as mentioned previously and added an airlock to the windows of the Living Module. Unfortunately, that didn\u0027t work as I had hoped. The Kerbals will be able to IVA through them, so be careful to not IVA them on the launch pad, as it\u0027ll be quite a fall.
