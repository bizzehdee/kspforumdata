Viking took a long time to build (planning started in the late 60\u0026#39;s well before Apollo really got into its stride) and a lot of the development problems were computer related. So in that context, I figured Hope wasn\u0026#39;t too far fetched given that the kerbals were starting with much better computer tech and, as Commander Zoom pointed out, have a rather pressing need for their interplanetary probes. Hence funding and other resources were not an issue but even then, the Probodyne guys were all running on fumes by the end.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven then, Hope had been in the works for a while. The lander hardware was being tested well before the Pioneer 2 flight and in fact the Pioneer 2 crew delivered the heat shields for the first Hope probes on their way through to Barkton for their training.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo answer Macdjord\u0026#39;s point - basically, the kerbals went straight to Viking without going through Mariner first. They did have Minmus as a practice run for deep space probes but even so, yeah going straight for a lander was ambitious. Again, this was largely down to urgent need - a flyby mission wasn\u0026#39;t really going to help them answer the key questions about Duna in time, so it didn\u0026#39;t happen. As for the first time success - well Viking was pretty damn impressive on that score too. NASA had a bit of experience with retrorocket landings with the Surveyer probes but Viking was a huge leap forward from there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s worth noting that the Hope probes are general purpose, one size sort of fits all, interplanetary probes. They\u0026#39;re a modular design, intended to be produced in bulk and launched until they work. As such they\u0026#39;re fairly over-engineered for a Duna mission but getting them to Laythe (for example) is going to require some creativity... In fact with the way the launch windows worked out, Hopes 1 and 2 were dispatched to Laythe (and are still in transit as of the last chapter) well before Hopes 3 and 4 set off for Duna.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T23:21:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daelkyr","CreatedById":149075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T07:26:36Z","Content":"\nKSK,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI decided to get sick over this weekend and on a lark thought I\u0026#39;d see what the Fan Works had to offer.

Hope 3 and 4 were solar powered - you can see it in their self-test sequence - and I was kind of assuming that Hope 1 and 2 were solar powered as well without a lot of thought as to how feasible that would be. Technically it\u0026#39;s doable - the 2011 [URL=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)\u0022]Juno[/URL] probe was solar powered, although that\u0026#39;s rather later tech than I\u0026#39;ve had the kerbals using up to now. On the other hand, they\u0026#39;re generally more advanced with renewable energy sources relative to human development in the 60s -70s (see the default use of electric vehicles unless they\u0026#39;re in a particularly remote location or have a need for a particularly rugged vehicle), so solar powered Jool probes might still fit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomething to think about for sure - thanks! Without giving too much away, the question of nuclear powered spacecraft is definitely going to arise in Part 4, so it would be relatively easy to slip in a minor retconn to RTG powered probes at that point. What do folks think? Solar or RTG for Hopes 1 and 2?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daelkyr","CreatedById":149075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T09:59:08Z","Content":"\nYou could go solar as a main with a small RTG in them as a backup. And have Probodyne catch flack when lighting up the RTG is needed. Environmental blow-back would be a fun little bit of tension.

How exactly does one \u0022light up\u0022 an RTG? They\u0026#39;re on, always. That\u0026#39;s kinda one of their things.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyways, solar does have its appeal. However, how big are the Hope 1 and 2? I mean, Juno\u0026#39;s sails are pretty big, whereas the RTG-powered probes have been mostly compact, I think. RTGs were also around in Apollo-era flights, while solar was relatively crude at that point. I mean, the Apollo flights used fuel cells instead of solar. However, as you said, kerbals seem to have a bit more development in this direction. I haven\u0026#39;t tried it yet, but I think it\u0026#39;s pretty hard to run a probe on solar out by Jool, even with KSP\u0026#39;s high-tech solar arrays.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBesides, I could see ten years of superiority in solar, but close to forty? Ehh... I think your best bet is RTGs. Maybe supplemental solar for high-load situations, like doing [SIZE=1]SCIENCE!

Welcome to the thread.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks also to Narwhalz and Daelkyr for weighing in on the RTG vs solar question. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTechnically, I suppose you could take a mini-RTG for heating purposes and emergency power but after going to the trouble of tying a lump of plutonium onto your spacecraft, I\u0026#39;m thinking you might as well do the job properly. So I\u0026#39;m leaning towards RTG for Hope 1 and 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDaelkyr does raise an interesting point though - there might well be a backlash against the possibility (however remote) of scattering plutonium over another planet, especially if you were then touting it for possible colonisation. Alternatively, there could be quite a nice little story about Probodyne being forced to gimp the lander by using batteries only, thus getting little or no scientific data.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHmm, lots of potential here - I like it!\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-25T09:18:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2015 09:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T12:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUrgh - looks like I have a lot of reformatting to do on previous posts. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the meantime, the next chapter is up.

Beneath it, flames licked against the tree trunks, a single sapling wreathed in smoke with thirty-six smaller saplings leaning against it. Together they made a briskly burning chimney. Donman bent down and picked up a leaf. Its edges were singed by the flames and it\u2019s once glossy green surface was dulled by heat and smoke, but the spots were still visible; a scattering of dull black eyes staring at him accusingly. He turned to the kerbal standing rigidly beside him.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWould you like to talk about it,\u201D he asked gently.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThey mutilated my child and left it to die in the dark, Ambassador.

We must know what went wrong.\u201D \u003Ci\u003EEven if it means intruding on your grief, \u003C/i\u003Ehe added to himself bitterly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEnely\u2019s flat gaze regarded him incuriously. \u201CWhy? How many other Kerm were you planning to murder, Ambassador? Because that\u2019s what any attempt to uproot them will be. Murder.\u201D He looked around. \u201CWhere is Ambassador Burvis?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI spoke to her,\u201D said Donman carefully, \u201Cand we both agreed it would be better if I came in her place.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe smoke caught at Donman\u2019s eyes, making them water. He looked down guiltily at his handful of shredded Kerm leaf and slipped the fragments into his pocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThey tried you know,\u201D said Enely conversationally. \u201CDug a great big pit, unearthed all the roots they could find, teased out the fibres with gloved hands. I was there - I saw it happen - but it didn\u2019t make any difference.\u201D His face crumpled with grief, the momentary brittle facade splintering like skim ice under a careless footfall.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CD...d...didn\u2019t make any difference.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDonman sat down on the grass and stared into the fire. One of the saplings shifted in the blaze, the charred filigree around its base crumbling into ash. Beside him, Enely\u2019s face was buried in his hands, shoulders heaving spasmodically, breath hitching in his throat in little mewling hiccups. Donman dabbed at the corners of his eyes and waited.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe managed to replant them all,\u201D said Enely thickly. \u201CThe second year saplings were flourishing on the mainland - hardly surprising after spending all their lives in thin volcanic grit. We gave them a month to settle in, then the proper four months for Knitting. The seed-sapling was looking healthy enough - all its branches were growing back, all its leaf clusters were green and glossy. I lay down for first Communion\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEnely paused to wipe his eyes. \u201CAnd everything seemed just fine. I wasn\u2019t anywhere near prepared for it of course - those itching, burrowing leaf hairs and then that first touch of another mind against yours!\u201D He sniffed. \u201CThe poor thing seemed a bit subdued, a bit slow compared to some accounts that I\u2019d read but some kerblets start out quieter than others, so why shouldn\u2019t Kerm be the same, especially after all this one had been through.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDonman nodded.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFor a while,\u201D Enely continued, \u201Ceverything just got better and better. My Kerm learned to recognise me - I taught it a picture of a smiling kerbal and afterwards that was always how it greeted me! It tried to show me things although they never made much sense, just coloured blotches and swirls. Maybe they would have made sense in time, but then the pains started.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEnely stared at him. \u201CHave you ever had earache, Ambassador? That\u2019s what this was like. Not too bad - not to begin with, but always there and \u003Ci\u003Enothing you can do about it. \u003C/i\u003EYou can\u2019t reach it with a cold compress, you can\u2019t draw it out with a hot poultice. And how do you give a Kerm painkillers? The Archives weren\u2019t any help but I did everything I could think of - checked the soil to make sure there wasn\u2019t anything attacking it - although a Knitted Kerm should have been able to look after itself. Mostly, all I could do was to Commune with it, try my best to comfort it, tell it that everything was going to be alright.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEnely\u2019s face twisted. \u201CAlthough by then it was obvious that things were far from alright. Finally, I plucked up the courage to go digging. I didn\u2019t want to - not after the Forseti - but I had to\u2026had to find out what was hurting so badly.\u201D He looked at Donman through tear-blurred eyes. \u201CThe fibres were cracked and \u003Ci\u003Eleaking\u003C/i\u003E, Ambassador. All sticky and pink and crusted with mud. I don\u2019t know whether it was something in the soil that it wasn\u2019t used too - nothing much grows in volcanic grit I don\u2019t expect - or whether it was an injury from the uprooting that had gone bad. Whatever it was, it was too far spread to be cut out.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA hard lump settled in the pit of Donman\u2019s stomach. \u003Ci\u003EThis is worse than talking to Jonton. \u003C/i\u003EHe bowed his head, unable to meet the other kerbal\u2019s eyes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CA...after that,\u201D said Enely, \u201Cthere was nothing else to do but hope that my Kerm could fight off whatever had infected it. But as the pain got worse\u2026\u201D He shook his head, wincing as his poncho rubbed over his shoulders.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSome days I couldn\u2019t get through at all and some days I was afraid to \u003Ci\u003Etry\u003C/i\u003E.\u201D He saw a flicker of expression cross Donman\u2019s downturned face. \u201CI did try once, Ambassador but it was like\u2026well you wouldn\u2019t cross the path of a scallan with toothache, would you? And it got worse. It started off angry and confused - I couldn\u2019t make it understand \u003Ci\u003Ewhy\u003C/i\u003E it was in pain - and then the anger just turned into misery. Showing it pictures of happier days didn\u2019t help - it couldn\u2019t \u003Ci\u003Eremember\u003C/i\u003E those days or what the things in the pictures even were. It began to ignore me and then near\u2026n\u2026n\u2026near the end, it didn\u2019t even recognise me. At least it couldn\u2019t feel the pain anymore either - I suppose that\u2019s something. All the fibres must have been dead or nearly dead by then.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEnely drew a handful of Kerm leaves, matted with dried blood and stray hairs, out of his pocket. \u201CAnd then it just stopped. No pictures, no voice, no\u2026. no more pain. The leaf clusters wouldn\u2019t let go - I had to tear my head free.\u201D He swiped the back of his other hand across his eyes. \u201CThe rest you know, Ambassador. So what happens now?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor a long moment, Donman was silent. \u201CYou need to speak to\u2026an acquaintance of mine,\u201D he said at last. \u201CIf there\u2019s one person on Kerbin who could understand what you\u2019ve been through, it would be him.\u201D He caught Enely\u2019s disbelieving look. \u201CI communed with him - trust me, he\u2019ll understand.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou communed with him?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes. He used to be a Keeper too. He lives in a Grove near Barkton - his name is Jonton Kermol.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou \u003Ci\u003Ecommuned \u003C/i\u003Ewith him?!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI did,\u201D Donman replied. \u201CIt\u2019s a very long story, and one which he is far better placed to tell. You can trust me on that as well.\u201D He looked reassuringly at Enely and passed him a small square of card. \u201CWhenever you\u2019re ready to travel, just present this at the airport and ask them to put you on the next flight to Barkton.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEnely\u2019s eyebrows shot up. He looked closely at the card, noting the number stamped on it in gold and rubbing his thumb over its embossed seal. \u201CIs this really\u2026?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt is,\u201D said Donman. \u201CYou\u2019ll be travelling under the auspices of the Twelve Pillars. Not something we do every day but then - these are unusual days. Don\u2019t lose the card on your flight - you can also use it to requisition transport to Jonton\u2019s Grove.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere was a knock at the window.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAldsen looked up from his monitor and lifted his hand in farewell to the tired looking kerbal standing outside. As he turned back to his work, he heard a door closing behind him. The lights in the main laboratory went out, leaving nothing but the faint glow of sleeping computer screens and the blinking lights of row upon row of disk drives to illuminate the room.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAldsen sipped his tepid coffee and pulled up the day\u2019s list of satellite images for review. \u003Ci\u003EI need a bigger monitor for this. And better software running on a faster computer. And a chair made of hand-carved M\u00FCn rock. \u003C/i\u003EHe snorted softly and tapped out a command, leaning back as the first sub-sector of Kolus appeared on the screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Blight was clearly visible, dark ellipses of dead vegetation boxing in the brighter spots of cleared ground that marked the new Groves. \u003Ci\u003ELike eyes watching us even as we watch them. Doesn\u2019t seem to be any un-contained Blight though, thank the Pillars. \u003C/i\u003EThe keyboard clicked rapidly. \u003Ci\u003EScan and match filter sets\u2026execute alignment on HOTSPOT data\u2026cross correlate\u2026run. \u003C/i\u003EA grid appeared over the map with the upper left square greyed out. An analysis program started automatically in a separate window, rows of numbers flickering past as the computer matched the section of image, line by line, against its database of spectral signatures.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe analysis window blanked out and the next grid square turned grey. Aldsen watched the screen for a moment then swung around to face the pair of monitors behind him. Rubber squeaked underfoot as he rolled his chair over the nest of cable runners stretched across the floor. He tapped a key, paging through the list of jobs running on the laboratory computers, scratching the back of his neck thoughtfully. \u003Ci\u003EHmph \u2013 so much for that. Three by three it is then. \u003C/i\u003EDisc drives chunked and whirred and both screens filled up with new sections of map.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe computer bleeped softly behind him. Aldsen glanced at the clock on his office wall, sighed, and regarded the thick black sludge in the bottom of his mug with some trepidation. \u003Ci\u003EProbably just as well Lodan isn\u2019t here. \u003C/i\u003EIdly, he swung back and forth on his chair, trying to muster the enthusiasm to start another set of satellite images. \u003Ci\u003EWe really need to figure out a better way of doing this. Some way of normalising the cleaned images without washing out the Blight signatures. \u003C/i\u003EHe yawned. \u003Ci\u003ENot tonight\u2019s problem.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA stippled patch of dark green woodland filled the middle of the screen, set amidst a chequerboard of fields that lapped against the beginnings of a range of foothills to the north. A Grove occupied the space on either side of the woodland and a gleaming hair-thread wound down from the hills, skirting the eastern Grove before disappearing off the southern edge of the map. Aldsen smiled at the lushly coloured image. \u003Ci\u003ENot a speck of Blight in sight. Looks like those folks got lucky.\u003C/i\u003E He picked up his mug and was halfway to his feet when an oddly shaped field caught his eye.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ci\u003EStrange. If it wasn\u2019t for the colour I\u2019d swear that was an overlap\u003C/i\u003E. He sat down again, mug forgotten, peering closely at the screen. \u003Ci\u003EPosition is consistent too. I wonder. \u003C/i\u003EHe retrieved a creased and well-thumbed atlas from under his desk and flipped through it rapidly. \u003Ci\u003ENot far from Barkton \u2013 thought I recognised the image codes. One square to the north\u2026 \u003C/i\u003EHe typed in a number and waited for the computer to fetch the new image. The screen refreshed and Aldsen leaned forward intently.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAnd there it is. Kinda hilly - not anywhere I\u2019d pick for a Grove but it seems to be doing alright. At the right sort of distance for that field to be an overlap too. \u003C/i\u003EAldsen typed in a command and a grid drew itself over the map. Another command and a scale bar appeared along the bottom of the screen. He tapped the screen thoughtfully, working out the distances in his head. Something about the first map nagged at him, something not quite right. Frowning he flicked back to the previous image and pulled up the grid and scale bar again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ci\u003EHang on a second\u2026. those two Groves. They\u2019re far too close together\u2026 and there\u2019s no scrap of\u2026.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAldsen\u2019s eyebrows rose. His fingers flew over the keyboard; the map flickered, replaced by a HOTSPOT infrared map. He stared at it in disbelief, possible overlap utterly forgotten.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThat can\u2019t be right. That vegetation is thriving - and it\u2019s all well established. Maybe that Grove isn\u2019t so new after all.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe keyboard clattered.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDate stamp is correct. Okay lets step this back. Six month intervals should do it to start with. \u003C/i\u003EAldsen drummed his fingers on his desk impatiently. \u003Ci\u003EDefinitely need a faster computer. Okay, here we go...both Groves still there. Back another six months\u2026\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAldsen fumbled for his desk phone with suddenly nerveless fingers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLodan.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDirector? You\u2019re working late.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLodan stifled a yawn. \u201CTime and the Council wait for no kerbal,\u201D he said. \u201CSo once again I spend the evening trying to distill Geneney\u2019s latest report into something memorandum sized. At least the executive summary was straightforward: Pioneer 4, first Munar landing attempt, launch date two weeks from today. Anyway - what can I do for you at this unreasonable hour?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCould you come down to my office, Director? This is a matter best discussed face to face I think and I think it will also be a matter for another memo to the Council.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLodan stared at the screen. \u201CYou\u2019re quite sure about this?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPositive, Director. The images are date stamped and the dates match with the system logs. I\u2019ve cross-referenced them against the HOTSPOT data and that checks out too. Somehow, somebody has planted a new Grove without triggering a Blight incursion.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhereabouts are the Groves?\u201D asked Lodan quietly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNowhere special as far as I can tell,\u201D said Aldsen. \u201CFrom the image codes they\u2019re somewhere north of Barkton but I haven\u2019t checked exactly where yet.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBarkton,\u201D muttered Lodan. \u201CBarkton, unexpected Kerm behaviour\u2026\u201D The colour drained out of his face. \u201CJonton.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJonton?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CA Keeper. His Grove is north of Barkton and\u2026\u201D Lodan stood up, pacing back and forth in agitation. \u201CWe\u2019ll need an investigatory team - I\u2019ll call the Berelgan first thing in the morning.\u201D He flashed Aldsen a quick glance. \u201CWe will need a second memo for the Council - they\u2019ll want somebody on the team I have no doubt.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAldsen stared at his Director, forehead wrinkled in puzzlement. \u201CBut this is good isn\u2019t it?\u201D he said slowly. \u201CIf this - Jonton - has found what the Berelgan have been looking for: a way of close-planting Kerm? No need for a colonisation program - not yet at any rate\u2026\u201D He stopped at look on Lodan\u2019s face.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJonton is a\u2026unique case,\u201D said Lodan. \u201Cand I fear for any kerbal volunteering to follow his example.\u201D He shook his head. \u201CThe risks would make volunteering for the colonisation program look safe by comparison. No - this is but a first small step - it cannot be the key to the Kerm crisis - it simply cannot!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLodan gathered himself with an effort. \u201CYou\u2019d better come back to my office - there are files you need to see. Files in my \u003Ci\u003Epersonal \u003C/i\u003Esafe.\u201D He eyed Aldsen\u2019s long-forgotten mug with distaste. \u201CAnd I think we\u2019re going to need some proper coffee too.
