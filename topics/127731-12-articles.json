Much like the others noted. I would gather they had a SP experience coded, then an MP. Squad has, numerous times, referenced the same. So, the three I noted would thus be acceptable. But sure, others, like Subnautica, Stardew Valley and Don\u0027t Starve. Don\u0027t Starve already implemented theirs. Subnautica and Stardew Valley have it planned and likely in testing as well. Oddly people misunderstand why some would enjoy a good coop game as well side by side with a good SP. Whats better, for KSP, is the lack of need to provide deep MP content. They need to set rules and the mechanisms.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jatwaa","CreatedById":59627,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-05T00:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222697164\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469869603\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278020\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/30/2016 at 5:06 AM, AlamoVampire said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is this still alive? I think at this point, a few things are obvious:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. There is a MOD that does this ALREADY!!!\u00A0so why is squad wasting time \u0026lt;now, or later\u0026gt; pandering to a small portion of the population, when again, there is a MOD that does this?\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. No, really, WHY is it Squad is going to at some point pander to a small portion of the player base and make stock what a MOD already does and yet, something that has REAL UTILITY like MechJeb is never up for Stock Candidacy, when it has a much LARGER base of folks who are screaming for it to be stock?\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. It is CLEAR that part counts will be a SERIOUS issue, it is CLEAR some people run subpar machines that barely handle 100 part ships and yet, get 2 people with moderate crafts and you can blow past 200 parts in a hurry, it is CLEAR mods \u0026lt;part mods\u0026gt; will be an issue, say you run BD, I dont. I run NovaPunch, you dont. Will we be able to see each other or will we crash the system? It is NOT REMOTELY possible to plan for and prevent every contingency, issue, or troll.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Expanding on 3. What is to stop a player from making a ship and launching 300\u002B decouplers, launching into an orbit, punching the decouplers into space and repeating this until the sky is a minefield similar to the one seen in either WALL-E or Cowboy Bebop? Whats to stop a player from going into a server and wrecking everything and staying around long enough for the AUTO save to happen, and rewriting the Quick Saves? Seriously, how do you stop this? Answer? IT CANT BE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I FULLY expect people to come at me saying things like well, servers can be set for so and so and blah blah blah so that WONT happen. Sorry, it can happen no matter how well prepared you are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook, its simple. DMP takes care of this. Also, and just as importantly, this game has issues, serious issues. Some are local to the games code, some are on Unity, and until this game is STABLE, yes, its NOT stable. Better, perhaps, but, still bad, and until its not, multiplayer needs to remain a far far 31st century distant thing. And the other things are dealt with, like Gas Planet 2, or heck, CONSOLE stability is now a thing too, and yet people STILL want multiplayer added.. \u00A0come on folks, its not remotely acceptable for it to be now, or even 3 years from now a thing. 6 to 10 years down the road, perhaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. This is an assumption\u00A0that it would be a small set of people that would use it. This is not fact, it is an uncertain, also biased, opinion. I am biased the other way so I am just as guilty in my assumption that people WOULD like it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Refer to the above \u002B I do (and did) back Mechjeb. Fantastic mod. I would vouch for it. Then again...it doesn\u0027t need much work because it is already great. They would just have to tweak and distribute it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Parts count is a massive issue. I have a few 1000\u002B craft that will fly fine together but not so much with the others. Beyond welding hulls, this could be a problem. But, I am not asking them to take this into account actually. Let the end players build their craft accordingly and host from a fast, powerful and low latency system or host or know that the environment may not be overly considerate...kind of how the game is already.\u00A0Mod requirement checking isn\u0027t too complex. You can\u0027t stop all trolls. Simply said, all they would need to do is offer the MP option and rule set at a high level and possibly password protection.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. They have the ability to clear debris already. I use it when I am on sandbox. Sure there will be complications. Heck people can spawn 1000s of mobs in Minecraft. You kind of just deal with it and laugh or get upset. Or both...it happens. I just make sure I know who I am gaming with. As with the current game, backup the saves and set it to an interval. It is the best anyone can hope for in any game. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not asking them to take into account Each and EVERY possible troll or small concern. I would be all for removing Warp all together. The problem people have with DMP is the bugs and latency. I could list on for days why I stopped using DMP. I really...REALLY would like DMP to be the end all for MP. But it\u0027s just not. The game does have issues, yes. I would not debate that. I am not saying, STOP EVERYTHING and give me MP. Because...no, the game itself does indeed need some fixes for bugs. I have a dancing Minmus base. But, MP was on the table before, once things are stable state, THEN MP as an option would be viable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-05T01:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222704882\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470351423\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002281697\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kiwi1960\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, kiwi1960 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they added MP to KSP then it wouldn\u0027t feel like KSP anymore, I know they wouldn\u0027t remove the single player option, do I look stupid?
