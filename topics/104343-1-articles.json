With the Eve Buster Mk2, it\u0027s possible to do near sea level direct ascent missions to Eve. \n\nIt can take the Mk2 Lander Can to the surface of Eve and back to Kerbin in a single launch. Here are some stats:\n\n- 14,344,190kg mass\n- 1468 parts\n- 22,566m/s delta-v\n- 17 stages\n- 6,016,300 cost\n\nNo mods were used except Kerbal Engineer Redux v1.0 to measure delta-v.

Sometimes I\u0027ll use a toroidal tank when using TR-2V Stack Decouplers, to hide the gap. \n\nHonestly, I could have gotten away with less than a thousand parts if it wasn\u0027t for the [Radial Decoupler Bug](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/2842). \n\nI built a 1 kerbal sea level lander for Eve with less than 600 parts before the bug appeared in 0.24.2."}]}
