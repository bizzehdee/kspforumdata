It will then transmit the signal to satellites orbiting Mun, via antenna. The base station would always be pointing towards Kerbin, seeing as Mun is tidally locked, and the satellites are spaced evenly apart so at least one has a clear line of sight to Mun at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is providing power to the station. I want to do it with solar power, but that presents a problem. The base station would be pointing away from the sun for at least half of its orbit, and Kerbin will eclipse the sun regularly as well. Can anyone give me an estimate of how many hours of darkness I should count on?
