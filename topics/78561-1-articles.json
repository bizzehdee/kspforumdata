First of all, I\u0027m loving the new update. Contracts were for me a very welcome addition. One thing that I think would add tons to the current contract system would be other-user generated contracts in conjunction with multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would work like this: there would be a separate tab in the current contracts UI for contracts made by other players. You could add contracts following the templates that the current auto-generated contracts follow with some custom flavor text, company names, and logos. Other players could then take these contracts and complete them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there are a lot of hairy details that would need to be thought out. First, where would these contracts be stored/accessed from? SQUAD could host them on a server of their own, but I have no idea what their current architecture looks like so I don\u0027t know how easy that would be for them to add. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, There\u0027s the possibility of \u0022cheat\u0022 contracts (land on Kerbin for a billion funds), impossible contracts (land on Jool), or spam contracts. One way to overcome this would be some sort of user-feedback mechanism. So users could up/downvote contracts, mark as spam, or flag for inappropriate whatever. Then on the contract list side, you could choose to filter by average rating, show/hide spam/inappropriate contracts, and other such options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t see this in the \u0022What Not to Suggest\u0022 list or in any other suggestions, but forgive me if I missed anything. This is just something that would be neat to add to the game, not something that I think is 100% necessary. So what do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
