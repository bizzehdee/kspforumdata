Anyways, you are welcome to take 1st turn, i am not exactly super competitive here so i dont care whether i win or loose, its more for fun and to try to improve my ship designs (as there is no better way to find flaws then actually fighting people who arent yourself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we start the battle, i plan on deploying one rather armored ship, my Sk-CRV-I B or C depending on whether the C is finished in time (~50-60t max mass), and 2-3 smaller vessels, at least one of my new FK-103 fighters (under 10t), and the other 2 will most likely be like 20-30t vessels, experimental and just developed (actually im almost done with one of them, will be a bomber that uses mk2 parts, armed with ~10 stubby ibeam missiles). I dont know your fleet composition, but all i ask is try to bring stuff that is roughly similar in mass (1 ~55t ship, 2 ~25t ships, 1 ~10t fighter). While its impossible to get 100% balanced ships as one side will inherently have better armor, or more firepower, or whatever advantage, mass at least makes them a similar class.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm going to be using exclusively 625mm projectiles (oscar-B diameter) so even if your ships arent uber tough, i should still have a challenge dealing with them. Although i do have plenty of 1250mm ordinance, i dont really enjoy the whole every ship that attack an enemy ship is borderline guaranteed to kill it style. I really prefer is ships remain intact even after an attack, as i feel its more fun to deal with stuff like aiming at weakspots, crippling engines, ect, instead of the more common blowing a ship into 10 pieces with a single rocket salvo that seems to be the norm in this thread (my last 2 battles ended that way, basically whoever attacked with a properly armed ship was guaranteed to get a kill). As for what ordinance you bring, im not gonna impose any real limits except i ask you please refrain from using anything that weighs more then 1 ton, as missiles that are heavier then this tend to do ALOT of 1 shot kills. As for guided or unguided, pick whgatever you like to use, i have a fair mix of both on my ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat planet would you like? more higher gravity or lower? Lower makes dV and range way less important. My ships for the most part are middle of the road in terms of ranges, nothing too crazy, but also nothing that would be considered bad either. If you have no preference ill pick some planet thats middle of the road in terms of gravity, since you dont really get much of an advantage of disadvantage there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and srry for any spelling or grammer errors, i sent this from a touchpad phone, terribly hard to hit the right keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing, do you have anything against both sides being allowed one up to 30t supply ship (may not be used in actual combat) per side? since most of my ships use weak weapons, i feel running out of ordinance will be a major problem. Ofc with a resupply ship, vessels cannot attack and resupply in the same turn as thatd be kinda cheap, but itd be cool to have if the battle ends up drawn out and ammo starts to run out (ofc if i get one you can also bring one for your own fuel/ammo needs).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T20:16:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T23:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMeh, my weapons aren\u0027t reloadable.

Also, a little over 1 ton is fine, if you use 625mms then even if you go a little over there only so much that caliber can pull off. Again, im not too picky, but i just dont want as much 1 shot kills as ive seen when teh super competitives get at it (believe me, im not at that level, although if i brought a SK-CRV-III youd be in big trouble as that thing is superior to a drek with the modifications ive done to its armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will bring 1 ship that is approx 55t. Then i will bring 1 10t (it was 7 last i checked though) fighter, and 1 20t bomberish thing (well heavy fighter, bomber, whatnot, its hard to really classify what that thing is). That should be a fair counter to your 2X 10t, and 1 65t whatever you choose to bring. I reccomend the ship though, since my 55t is a SK-CRV-I, which while nowhere near competitive armoring, has incredible firepower (it has 12 long ibeams in the nose, and 16 KDrones for anti-fighter work, even if these weapons arent that powerful alone, there is little that can survive without at a minimum engines shot off so many missiles fired at a target, anything that isnt behind heavy armor will just evaporate). Also, now that i think about it, i can use the capital ship as a ammo station, do i actually NEED 16 anti-fighter missiles \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will upload the save file tomorrow, its somewhat late and i still need to do some real life stuff before bed, so as soon as i get out of work tomorrow i will get the save online and you then can take your turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a completely unrelated note; after watching Macey\u0027s last vid and seeing what Spiritwolf\u0027s new flagship looks like, i think i found a perfect Hanland flagship to counter it, which BTW was updated last weekend, my one best ever cinematic vessel and carrier ive ever made sofar (ok tied to my old dead SR-1 Normandy SSTO replica and BC-304 Korolev):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/07NjN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
