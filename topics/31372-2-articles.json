This depends on the skill of the drivers, and the conditions. On a dry, warm road with no obstructions along the sides or wildlife, with a vehicle in good condition and skilled drivers (everyone on the road) it can be quite safe even above the speed limit. This never happens. Roads get wet, vehicles are worn out or damaged, people are flawed, moose cross the road every now and then, and so on. Speed limits are there to account for that, and it is illegal to go faster than them for a reason. Nonetheless, there are cases, perfect conditions, like Salmonella put it, where you can safely go faster if you feel like risking your license. You still shouldn\u0027t get upset at people going at the speed limit, but below it is quite justifiable. There are cases where you should go slower, but perfect conditions are not them. Holding up traffic is just as dangerous, as people get frustrated and may begin acting recklessly to get past you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalmonellaDingDong","CreatedById":57168,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T11:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem with your argument is that everyone still drives above the speed limit.
