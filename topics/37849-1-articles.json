These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their recovery. But they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice. These two men are lying down their lives in mankind\u0027s most noble goal: the search for truth and understanding. They will be mourned by their families and friends; they will be mourned by the people of the world; they will be mourned by a Mother Earth that dared to send two of her sons into the unknown. In their exploration, they stirred the people of the world to feel as one; in their sacrifice, they bind more tightly the brotherhood of man. In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7uuEzyo.png\u0022 alt=\u00227uuEzyo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T11:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood thing he didn\u0027t have to give this one out.
