Docking ports should have an option to lock themselves with the port theyre docked to, this would make the docking port much more steady, however come at the cost of said docking port be unable to be used again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-10T17:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts more an issue about diameter I think, using auto struts or eva added struts solves the issue in my experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-10T20:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, I agree something has to be done about docking ports, even if it\u0027s just a matter of making them 50% stiffer. But I also don\u0027t hate the idea that it\u0027d be clearer in KSP2 that if you\u0027re going to high-thrust your on-orbit-construction, then you gotta do EVAs to add structural supports...like have it mentioned in a tutorial video about space station construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I wonder how much the space-docks result in a partial alternative: fewer docking ports because you build it in an orbital bay rather than piecewise from planetary launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
