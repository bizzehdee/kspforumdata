Like Elthy said, building your own PC offers more variety and generally better performance for cheaper prices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I would go with this build: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pcpartpicker.com/p/3tpHnQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pcpartpicker.com/p/3tpHnQ\u003C/a\u003E Total Price (After Rebates): $1023.47 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis includes everything you need and cuts the fat off of what you listed above (Note: I\u0027m extremely Intel biased). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllow me to list my reasons for choosing those parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU: i5 4440: Cheap CPU. It\u0027s Haswell architecture (not the current architecture, but the most mainstream at the moment). AMD has better value CPU\u0027s, but as I said, I\u0027m Intel biased and this chip should perform just fine for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU Cooler: No overclocking, stock one is good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM/Memory: Corsair Vengeance are great cheap RAM sticks. 8 GB is enough for most games right now and the performance you will get from 1866 Mhz or higher is marginal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotherboard: Only H97 because you don\u0027t plan on OC\u0027ing. Cheap and reliable board (I like ASRock Boards). Allows for expansion of up to 32 GB of RAM later if you wish to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStorage: Double the size of the HDD you listed above. Cheap and it works, nothing special about HDDs. Having the OS on an SSD and storing files on the HDD can be tricky, but if you\u0027re willing to do it, that\u0027s fine. Due to the price of SSDs, I\u0027d stay away from them for this build to stay within budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGPU: Much better performance than the 750. Great bang for the buck. Fairly recent, it was only just replaced by the 970 which is also a great GPU. This should still give you decent performance. SLI is not worth it imo, due to the fact that the more cards you add, the price to performance ratio drops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase: I choose the 300r because it is roomier than the 200r, but you can also go for that and save a few bucks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPSU: XFX has great quality PSU\u0027s for their price. 550W is all you should ever need. I chose the non-modular one as it can be easier for first-time builders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptical Drive: In case you have some disks you want to play and want to install the OS on it. You can also install Windows 8.1 through a flash drive if you don\u0027t want to spend the few extra dollars on this, but I reccomend to go with it anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOS: Windows 8.1 is currently the best gaming OS atm. When Windows 10 comes out, which is an amazing step up (I have it the Tech Preview installed, great OS) from 8.1, you can install that for free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonitor: Good, cheap 24\u0022 monitor. Speakers are weak, however. Other than that, it\u0027s good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENetwork Card: Intel NICs are great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeyboard/Mouse: Same as the one you chose before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reccomend waiting until Black Friday or Cyber Monday to purchase your parts.
