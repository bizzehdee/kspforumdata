We\u0027ve established that rocket gets more kinetic energy due to Oberth Effect. A natural question is \u0022Where does the energy come from?\u0022 And that has to do with propellant. People usually think of rocket engine as converting chemical energy of the fuel into kinetic energy of the rocket. But the cool thing about a rocket is that it also converts part of the kinetic energy of the fuel into additional kinetic energy for the ship! If you\u0027re going fast enough, most of the energy of the rocket is gained from kinetic, not chemical energy of the fuel. Of course, that fuel had to be brought up to speed in the first place. Usually, you burn a lot of fuel early on to get the rocket and fuel moving. But if you use Oberth effect, the planet gives you extra energy to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case of the solar sail, the extra energy comes from the fact that reflected light is going to be red-shifted. So there are no exhaust gasses, but there\u0027s still an exhaust of sorts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223765017\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192860\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585818105\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172487\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jevry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, jevry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022it has to do with the planet, you move faster thuss lose less energy as you leave it\u0027s gravity well\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat one isn\u0027t right. Once you finished the burn and are climbing out of the gravity well, your energy isn\u0027t changing. Sure, kinetic energy of the ship is becoming gravitational potential energy of the ship, but the total is constant.\u00A0Oberth effect lets you actually gain more energy. You end up in an orbit with higher total energy if you burn prograde at periapsis than if you burned at the apoapsis. And the burn can be very short, not long enough for gravity to impact you while you are using your engines. So this explanation is wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut planet\u0027s gravity does play a role as outlined in the previous one. It\u0027s either adding or taking away the kinetic energy from your fuel, which you are using to gain more energy for your rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a side note, there are two parameters that determine shape of your orbit around a single body. It\u0027s energy and angular momentum. People who play around with rocketry generally know that you gain most energy at the low burn. But you gain most angular momentum as far away from the planet as possible. And to go from a low circular orbit to a higher one you need to increase both energy and angular momentum. Which is a somewhat hand-wavy explanation of why a Hohmann transfer is so efficient. You do first part of your burn at the lowest point to maximize energy gain and second part at the highest point to maximize angular momentum gain. This is just to point out that you don\u0027t always care just about kinetic energy gained there are other parameters of your orbit that you might need to adjust in the most fuel-efficient manner, and for these, burning low isn\u0027t always a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-02T09:44:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223765017\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192860\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585818105\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172487\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jevry\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n44 minutes ago, jevry said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nF = M X V^2, and V = Vstart \u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, thuss when Vstart is higher you gain more energy\u0022 (sounds reasonably correct to me but i think its missing some details?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope.

The Times posted a retraction of that on July 17, 1969, the day after Apollo 11 lifted off from Cape Canaveral:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th century and it is now definitely established that a\u00A0rocket\u00A0can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs humorous as this was, it underscores a critical element in understanding the Oberth effect, along with all other types of rocketry. Rockets are not magical force engines which produce thrust by simply flipping a switch; they are reaction issues which gain thrust by pushing against exhaust gases. The harder and faster the exhaust comes out, the farther and faster the rocket will fly. The farther you throw the exhaust, the farther it will throw you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Oberth effect says that the deeper you are in a gravity well, the more energy you will ultimately gain from a burn of specified length. But instead of thinking of it in terms of an engine\u0027s thrust, think of it in terms of the exhaust you are leaving behind. If you burn your engine while high in a gravity well, you\u0027re leaving your exhaust behind in its own orbit, one which has a high amount of potential energy relative to the bottom of the gravity well. The particles of exhaust will fall toward the bottom of the gravity well, their potential energy forever lost.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy diving deeper into a gravity well, on the other hand, you convert the propellant\u0027s potential energy into kinetic energy first. A burn at periapsis leaves the exhaust behind close to the planet,\u00A0rather than wasting momentum carrying it up into a high-potential-energy space to be lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-05T04:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223766432\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192860\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221586054096\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Oberth effect says that the deeper you are in a gravity well\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*buzz sound* Wrong!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing that matters is velocity: the faster you go, the more oberth you get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs one tends to go faster in low orbit, this may seem like a distinction without difference.

Either you build ships there with EL or you went there to refuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurning from Mun Orbit to return to Kerbin takes 310m/s, and puts you in an orbit that would have cost 860m/s had you burned it from low Kerbin orbit (I\u0027m getting these from a stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E map). From \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to Jool takes 1930m/s, so from your \u0022left Mun\u0022 orbit, if you do everything perfectly, it will cost you another 1070m/s, which when you add the 310 to leave Mun costs you 1380m/s (not counting the mid course correction if any)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get to Jool from Mun directly (again not counting the mid course correction) I just set up a node to test, and it cost me 1788m/s.

Instead ejecting to Kerbin for 310 and then burning the extra 220 necessary to get to Duna costs 530, so going straight to Duna from Mun is better than doing the dive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus is cheaper, mostly because its an lower eject speed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour explanation also explains why I use this as much, I tend to use this to\u00A0launch huge ships on 4-5 Km/s trajectories, this let me launch them pretty empty and top up the tanks at Minmus before dropping them, some times I also add some fuel for the Minmus burn in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
