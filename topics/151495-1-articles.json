Doesn\u0027t look anything like the US shuttle or Buran but it is nice looking. Smaller than I would thought it would turn out.

It has one secondary engine. A skipper. Fully functional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system and a realistic docking port. (Inside cargo bay) I haven\u0027t found out its full payload capacity but I\u0027m guessing it could take up a full orange tank. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 2.5 to start with no payload. 33 ton shuttle and 455 tons with the rocket attached to it.

This legend beasts its way through the atmosphere at flippin\u0027 40 degrees angle of attack. It also doesn\u0027t need wings on its bottom. I don\u0027t know why but it is very easy to control in the thick atmosphere after re-entry. Oh and it uses a fuel cell for EC charge but that seems to be bugged. Not generating EC when turned on. :/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction groups:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Toggle skipper\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.
