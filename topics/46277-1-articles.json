My latest incarnation is a canard biplane. My current problem with this plane is on the climb out when I get it to 6000-8000m it suddenly noses up and goes into an unrecoverable spin. I have plenty of speed and have the nose at about 25 degrees when this happens. I designed the plane to be stable according to aerodynamic principles (I design, build and fly a lot of R/C airplanes so I understand the basic concepts) but the planes in KSP don\u0027t follow aerodynamic principles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is required for a stable plane in KSP? My first attempt was scapped when I was unable to reenter from orbit without an uncontrolled spin. I thought this was because I was more top heavy on re-entry (fuel tanks were slung low and had nearly emptied) so I designed this plane to be balanced in the pitch axis as well as the roll axis but it seems to be even less stable than my first one. For both planes, I always have to maintain at least a 15 degree pitch or I lose altitude, is that normal? Are their any parts with airfoils or does everything depend on the angle of attack? Do people regularly angle the wings up on the fuselage or does everyone just fly with their ass dragging through the air? In what units is the \u0022lift generated\u0022 parameter on wing parts? How do you calculate the amount of \u0022kerbal lift\u0022 to lift a plane of a certain weight? Does the KSP aero model even have a concept of a stall speed? It feels like the planes fly exactly like the rockets, the only thing that seems to matter is the direction of thrust, the wings dont seem to interact with the atmosphere at all. With this model, what makes a plane stable or unstable?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CorruptDB","CreatedById":75308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T03:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne more question: The wiki says that the intakes produce less drag when closed, is there any other documentation on that?

Putting the centre of lift even more than a few \u0022CoM ball widths\u0022 behind the CoM is OK too *if* you have enough control surfaces to compensate. Never put the center of lift in front, this is a common cause of uncontrollable pitch-up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint 2: Be aware that as fuel is drained from the craft the center of mass is going to shift. Usually people put a long fuselage of fuel tanks with the engine or engines at the back. In this configuration, the centre of mass is going to shift backwards as fuel drains, potentailly moving far enough to put it behind the centre of lift. Then see point 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint 3: As your velocity increases drag becomes a significant factor in the behaviour of the vessel. An aircraft that uses the scoopy, surface attached radial air intakes on, say, the underside of the fuselage might seem fine at low speed, but when you start hitting 1000 m/s or more you will discover that the extra drag under the plane makes it difficult to get the nose up. On the other hand, if the scoops are on the top it might be difficult to keep the nose down. Note, also, that the drag forces are tricky... intakes way at the back will tend to make the plane want to point its nose along the velocity vector, since any deviation from this will create a torque as drag is produced off the centerline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this also means that if you have a lot of air intakes near the front of your craft and you are pitched up, the drag from the air intakes will want to pitch the craft up even more (unless you have zero AoA)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your second paragrph: There is no stall speed in KSP, but wings do generate more lift (up to a point... I think someone figured out the exact value, maybe about 40 degrees?) and more drag as the angle of attack increases. If you have too high of an angle of attack the drag will be quite high, but KSP includes mass in its drag equation, and the mass of wings is very low, so this is usually not an issue. Long story short, it *is* beneficial to attach your wings to the fuselage with 5 or 10 degrees of angle of attack (hold down shift to rotate parts in 5 degree increments instead of 90 degree increments). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntakes definitely generate much more drag when open than closed. The most efficient intakes (in terms of intake-air-to-drag-ratio) are, by far, the blue-textured high performance intakes. You can test this yourself... build a plane with heaps and heaps of air intakes (like, 20), and put 18 in an action group to toggle them open and closed. Take off and start climbing. Keep an eye on your speed and how fast you are accelerating. Now toggle the action group to close 18 of the intakes... your acceleration will be MUCH higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as knowing whether you have enough lift: I don\u0027t bother.

The drag model in particular uses the weight of the part multiplied by the drag coefficient (which is what the \u0027drag\u0027 stat is). One side effect of this is that all parts produce drag regardless of position, based mostly on their weight. So things that are normally used to reduce drag at the expense of weight, like nose cones, actually INCREASE drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lift model is similarly less than spectacular, and does NOT include stalling in any form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most likely causes of uncontrollable Pitch-Up are either the Center of Mass being right on/ahead of the Center of Lift, or Center of Drag being above the Center of Mass. Note that because of the way the game calculates drag that empty fuel tanks have less drag than full ones, due to their change in weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of Drag being ahead of the Center of Mass can also result in pitch-up in some situations, particularly while aerobraking/re-entering. This is usually caused by forward-mounted air intakes, exacerbated by having empty fuel tanks. What happens is, any deviation from straight forward is accelerated, as the too-far-forward center of drag suddenly has enough deviation from the CoM to start pushing the nose of the craft around. In such a case the craft will only pitch up if you\u0027re in a nose-up orientation to start with: If you\u0027re nose down it\u0027ll go down, if you yaw it\u0027ll turn into the yaw. In any of these cases without intervention it\u0027ll come to rest flying backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s an addon called Ferram Aerospace Research that exists specifically to update the drag and lift models to be fairly realistic, but it requires much more attention to the aerodynamic qualities of your design, and most designs that work fine in stock will not work or will work poorly with FAR. It also makes nosecones a requirement for efficiency, and requires changes in rocket flight path to deal with the changed aerodynamics. A counter to all this is that it actually REDUCES overall drag, and in particular removes the link to weight. It also makes some changes to jet engines that limit your top speed to about mach 5 (1600 m/s, roughly), and reduce their overall power.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-18T04:26:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2013 04:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CorruptDB","CreatedById":75308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T04:27:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; 1) The sudden spin mostly cause by your engines out of air.

Speaking of that, how much IntakeAir is enough? The TurboJet engine in the SPH says it requires 15 units of IntakeAir but the Ram Air Intake only provides .2 units so do I really need 75 intakes to feed each TurboJet engine? That seems a little unreasonable, I must be missing something here. The plane in question has 6 engines, with 12 Ram Air intakes and 34 radial intakes. My previous plane didn\u0027t have as many intakes and it was able to reach around 25k before flaming out so I don\u0027t think it is a lack of air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Point 1: In the VAB make sure your center of lift is just behind your center of mass.

My understanding of the model is that each part had a value for drag (0.2 for the scoop intake) and that value combined with its mass determined the drag of the part regardless of orientation. The drag of all parts is summed to determine the drag of the vessel. I\u0027m almost positive that is the way it works for rockets, does it not work the same for planes?

The SPH reports more drag for the ram air intake (0.2 vs 0.3) and it masses only 0.0015 tons less. The scoop says it supplies 0.5/1 units of intake air but the ram air only supplies 0.2.
