You can use empty fuel tanks as flotation devices now. Water will now produce lift, drag as it should.

For example, if you can design your boat so that it tips nose-up a bit when underway (like a real boat), it will start to rise up and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cskim\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 over the water, which was never possible before. You can even design a craft with some aero surfaces below the water surface that works as a hydrofoil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven without a hydrofoil, though, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not hard to build something that will get up to around 100 m/s on the water. I say this as the designer of several unintentional speedboats.
