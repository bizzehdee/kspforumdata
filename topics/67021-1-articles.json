A few random shots in the dark and I found a possible contender: Toluene boils at something like 160C at 5atm, and melts at -95C. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question would be, what natural processes might produce toluene oceans? Its basically carbon, hydrogen, and a tiny bit of oxygen, but its a fairly large molecule compared to the usual ocean-forming stuff (methane, ammonia, etc). Wikipedia says it forms at some fraction in crude oil, so perhaps Eve was once a lush world covered with biomass, which then got broken down due to high temperatures in a runaway greenhouse process and slowly degraded into a number of large organic molecules, out of which leaked all the stuff which happened to be liquid over the entire range of Eve\u0027s day-night cycle. The stuff that straddles the cycle (and there\u0027s a lot of it) would form some sort of very complex daily pattern of evaporation and condensation that I don\u0027t really know how to think about. I guess it would probably end up creating density bands in the atmosphere, staying just high enough that the local pressure means that it remains in vapor phase, like you\u0027d get in fractional distillation. Alternately, it might create mid-atmosphere rain storms where something hits a combination of temperature and pressure sufficient to condense high in the atmosphere and then rains down to an area of the atmosphere where it reverts to vapor phase as the temperature increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have a handy dandy atmosphere calculator we can put the components of crude oil into and see what we get?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Polstar","CreatedById":89598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T07:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso on wikipedia - \u0022Like other solvents, toluene is sometimes also used as an inhalant drug for its intoxicating properties; however, inhaling toluene has potential to cause severe neurological harm.\u0022 - thats why kerbals have that daft grin all the time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T07:54:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it ever -50 at sea level?

But if its never that cold on the ground then that changes a lot. At that point, it could be pretty much anything whose 1atm boiling point is somewhere around/above 110C I think, since the boiling point vs pressure adds from 40-90C to the boiling point going from 1atm to 5atm for the usual small molecule culprits (e.g. things with a small enthalpy of vaporization). For the more tightly-bound options (8-carbon stuff, liquid metals, things that form highly charged ions, etc) you get to add about 30C to the boiling point, so you\u0027d want to look around 130C for those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater is interesting because its just barely at the boiling point at 5atm (152C). That would suggest that the temperature and pressure at the surface of Eve would be very strongly buffered if it had water oceans, because not only is the heat capacity of the water resisting temperature variation but it also boils off as needed (resisting both pressure variation and also adding the enthalpy of vaporization to the energy budget to resist a temperature change). So this might mean that the day-night cycle would be very muted as far as temperature swings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the other possible thing to look at would be temperature at the poles versus temperature at the equator, and the distribution of ocean over the surface.

A secondary reason is, whatever you have oceans of, you need some process pervasive and thorough enough to produce oceans of that material at the surface (either through generating it within the planet and then migrating it preferentially to the surface, or generating it at the surface, or having it come in via impact events). For large hydrocarbons its kind of a delicate balance to get them via chemical equilibrium, since at high temperatures its preferable to have many smaller molecules rather than one big one (pressure goes the opposite way, which is what\u0027s going on with diamond), but at low temperatures its hard to get over the energy barrier to form covalent bonds. Maybe something like a \u0027cold\u0027 (e.g. significantly less than 500C), high-radiation environment would be ideal for that kind of process? E.g. something that creates a lot of chemically active things that can drive condensation reactions, but which doesn\u0027t create an environment where cracking of large hydrocarbons occurs naturally.

Where introduced beneath sedimentary basins this methane could accumulate in the conventional structural and stratigraphic traps in which we find petroleum. Geochemical evidence strongly argues that crude oil is of sedimentary (biogenic) origin, but the origins of natural gas are more complex and the proportion that may be derived from mantle (that is, abiogenic) sources is unknown. Using a geometric mean of 3x10[sup 6] for the molar CH[sub 4]/[sup 3]He ratio in uncontaminated, mantle-derived fluids from spreading ridges, mantle plumes and summit fumaroles of arc volcanoes, the median abiogenic methane content of commercial gases is estimated to be less than 200 ppm by volume (range=0 to 12,000 ppm). While admittedly a rough estimate, this calculation suggests that little confidence should be placed in the resource potential of abiogenic natural gas. In rift or convergent margin basins, hot magmatic fluids can strip methane and other volatiles from metamorphic basement and overlying sedimentary rocks, however, and commercial accumulations of this type of gas may be present.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are abiotic hydrocarbons on Earth - in the specific case above, that abiotic methane is only 0.02%... but it is there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will agree the consensus is that a biological origin is the predominant origin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on a lifeless world, where the much faster biotic process is absent, could an abiotic process still produce significant amounts of high MW hydrocarbons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, Titan may be a nice test case to see what sort of complexity you can get in hydrocarbons without biological processes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1) It will be very hard to see anything that is not on the surface or just a short distance below it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2) Due to its lower mass, the pressures will not be as great\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3) Its much lower temperatures will also affect this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4) There\u0027s a chance that biological processes are at work on Titan, and that would be so cool that nobody should mind that our test case is inapplicable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESuch diversity and complexity of chemicals in it is impossible to occur in sterile conditions, and microbes can\u0027t exist in conditions in which oil is formed.
