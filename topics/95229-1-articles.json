It comes from you friends, saying they want to trade an item with you with a link to a picture. Clicking the link gives you the virus. It apparently hacks your account, but I know not what it does. Once infected, it sends the same message you received to every steam friend you have. Warn your friends if it affects you, and tell them to warn their friends. If the file is still on your system, delete it and wipe your recycle bin. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.malwarebytes.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.malwarebytes.org/\u003C/a\u003E Malwarebytes is adapted to know about this, so scan your system with it. Make sure to change your steam password and secret question too. If something important comes up, I will post an edit here. P.S.A.

Steam is known well on KSP Forum. KSP is even offered on Steam. Also, Steam virus has happened before. Simply read other Comrade\u0027s warning and apply. I agree with Comrade mike9606\u0027s reply. This is not friendly behavior. Comrade, there is no need to be unfriendly towards other Comrades, you may be sent to Gulag for such actions. In fact, State Police may be watching you at this very second. Always be vigilant for any break of State Doctrine or accepted standards! Report any criminals to State Police! Police yourself or you will be policed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I do not wish for State Police to think this is roleplay. I wish to say that roleplay is multiple Comrades, single Comrade is imitation or impersonation. I also state fact that roleplay is not defined in State Doctrine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T04:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no need for accusations.
