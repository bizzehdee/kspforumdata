The core is up, and now I am doing early testing and design on a tug. The main objective for the tug will be to dock with a fuel tank attached to a lifter, then move the tank to the station and dock it with the station in a 125k orbit. Leaving the lifter behind (for its own retro burn to dispose).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tug currently has 1 2.5m atomic motor (300 @ 800 isp), and 2 1.25 atomic motors (60 @ 800 isp) for any heavy pushes it may need to do. (I would like it to double as a station mover if feasible.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is in regards to the rcs thrusters. I currently have 8 (mounted 4x symmetrical) equidistant fron the center of the unloaded tugs mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be better (as in easier to control) to mount rcs thrusters on I beams extended foward from the tug, allowing for equidistant rcs while carrying its load?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe load is just a single 2.5m orange fuel tank with docking struts. Future payloads will include rcs fuel, and possibly a lander. My idea is to have the extended rcs thrusters on the tug, so payloads can be designed to keep the tug c.o.m. around the same point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe c.o.m for the loaded tug, is close to the front (docking point), and the tug itself ways around 40 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill placing those extended rcs ports make a noticeable difference? Are they really needed? The station the tanks will attach to is perfectly balanced as long as I dock tanks symmetrically. And until I dock the tug on it\u0027s rear end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr_jt","CreatedById":58149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T17:13:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbals are not well understood\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T13:32:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 01:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by dr_jt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T17:16:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI ended up doing the opposite.
