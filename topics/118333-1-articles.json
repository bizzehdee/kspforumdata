Find yourself a solid enough foundation of adequate height, a boulder or rock/brick wall. Take a few pair of old socks, put plastic bag liners inside them, and fill them with sand/dirt... tie off the end with string or a rubber band. Flop a few of them down and nestle your camera into it... you can push the stuff around and get the framing you need/want. Use the timer delay on the camera (assuming your camera has such) to make the shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always carry such stuff along with all my equipment.
