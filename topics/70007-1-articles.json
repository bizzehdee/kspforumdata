Human beings are very good at surviving. But we are also very good at cutting the branch we sit on. I honestly have no idea which one is more likely. There are no fundamental problems with starting off-Earth colonies. There are some engineering problems. There are lots and lots of socioeconomic ones. There would definitely have to be some changes, either in technology, politics, or environment, but I don\u0027t think anyone could remotely reliably predict these.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T07:38:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there is money to be made then yes, people will settle those places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople are selfish by nature and if they think they can strike it rich there will always be a few that are prepared to take huge risks .

I think this is a very realistic possibility for Mars. Mars has water and energy. There\u0027s plenty of iron for construction. Getting started on mars is just a matter of sending enough start up technology. The lack of a strong magnetic field on Mars does present a difficulty, so shielding will be very important on your vehicles and cities, but that\u0027s simple enough to build. Cities will probably be underground to take advantage of easy shielding, much like particles physics experiments which are conducted deep underground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that it is theoretically possible to terraform Venus, although the sheer might of terraforming equipment required may prove to be prohibitive. OR maybe not. To me, the holy grail of terraforming is engineered extremophile microorganisms that you can send a vial of and let them do the work for you.
