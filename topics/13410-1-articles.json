Less math, more edge of your seat panic maneouvers. Ideally, you would actually stop moving around Kerbol shortly before Kerbin arrives, and just hold your orbit using your engine, assuming it has enough thrust and can recycle its fuel fast enough to make this viable (and maybe start running away from the planet to give yourself some extra time for course corrections). If not, your going to be coming in super fast, and your engine might not have enough thrust to make the needed corrections. If you have a small engine attached to your command pod, that might come in handy (more thrust? and less mass). You don\\\u0027t need to hit Kerbin directly, but your going to have to be very close or you\\\u0027ll fly right by and get tossed into a different orbit and orbital plane, and that wouldn\\\u0027t be good. All things considered, your target circle would be about maybe 670-680km in diameter. Any more than 35-40kmkm from the surface at your nearest point, and friction plus your engine aren\\\u0027t going to have enough power to prevent a flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you could take a sane and reasonable approach, and plot an intercept course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-29T04:59:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet into a retrograde orbit around Kerbol at the same altitude as Kerbin.
