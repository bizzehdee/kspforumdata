So I do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I noticed no heating and KER said the critical temp was at 15%. Airbrakes didn\u0027t blow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurely I\u0027ll do some more testing. My mods are really basic with default config (MJ, KER, KAC, KJR...) nothing too fancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you noticed that ?

This was tricky. It\u0027s a bug of KSP when the KSP.exe is launched without forcing the \u0022run folder\u0022 to KSP folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I start KSP with the launcher or directly from the folder or with a shortcut, it works fine. But when I launch it with my Windows 10 warpper (TileCreator) which doesn\u0027t handle \u0022run folder\u0022 heat management is off (especially the convection flux data)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if I remove the physics.cfg and run the game wit TileCreator, the Physics.cfg file is NOT recreated, even the game seems to run correctly (except for heat management). Mods aren\u0027t damaged by this glitch and the game never crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably the game forces the run folder quite soon, but some parameters seems to be initialized before that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
