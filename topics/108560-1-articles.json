The parachute part looks like it\u0027s safely situated out of the airstream, but obviously the deployed parachute won\u0027t be! And since 1.0.1, parachutes don\u0027t survive being popped open at hypersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause you\u0027re not pointing to retrograde, so the chute has some drag, though small.

If I change anything about chutes, it\u0027s to slightly vary their fully open altitudes so that multiple chutes don\u0027t all open at the same time and jerk the ship apart. And I never stage chutes until the ship is doing 250m/s or less. Following these rules, I\u0027ve never had any chute failures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
