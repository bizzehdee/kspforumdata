Similar sorts were used for other result categories. The graph is sorted for the 60% dry mass tests (or 40% \u0022wet\u0022 mass).\n\nEdit: There were some interesting things to note in connection with the graph. All craft started with a TWR \u003E 1. Generally, it was 1.2 in the VAB and a little over 1 on the pad. The Rapier Mixed mode altitude was less than the Rapier Air-only mode altitude because the fuel ran out just before the closed cycle was to engage. The SRBs were emptied of about half of their propellant mass prior to launch. This is due to the fact that I did two other test categories not shown; \u0022efficiency\u0022 used one smallest fuel tank and for SRBs I equated that with the propellant mass of one Sepratron: the other test was TWR \u003E 1, with about 90% \u0022wet\u0022 mass, so for the SRBs the propellent was full. Radials were tested with three engines (and the values for two engines were calculated). Most engines were tested at 100% throttle. The aerospike was tested with the 1\u002B meter diameter parts and also with the 2\u002B meter diameter parts. Vernor clusters were placed under the fuel tank rather than radially. Engines which did not lift even one meter are not shown on the graph.\n\nIts interesting that the Rhino in this test peaks at just above the lower atmosphere.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T14:29:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 02:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher**\n  \nCorrections/ update"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T14:12:17Z","Content":"I\u0027ve added the image above; the link remains so that the full size image can be obtained."}]}
