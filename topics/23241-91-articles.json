This is the perfect style and detail ive been searching for. BUT because you did such a damn good job. I hope to heck you make wicked space station parts(solar panels and all), if you could include parts similar to Kosmos, dragon and some of nova punch it would make your mod pack something I would expect from squad(BTW no offense to squad, these are better than squad in my opinion). Why cant I run them all and have all that? Well ever since I installed this mod in combination with the mentioned plus mechjeb2 I get texture problems and B9 parts go clear leaving just a silhouette of the parts followed by KSP crashing. Happens Once every 8 times or so booting up KSP while developing things in VAB station. So if I could have ONE mod to cover planes, rockets, space-stations, and landers of this style, build detail holy cow. It would be the best thing to hit KSP and make me jump like a little kid in a candy store(and im a grown man haha). So yes B9 pack covering it all and making it all run smooth would be ARSESOME! No mod-devs yet had made our lives easier. I like many but many clash together. Whats not to love more than one mod to cover the general of everything leaving room to downloads others. Im tired of testing to see what mods work together and what dont. Who updated and who hasnt. I just want simplicity and to play. This would set it straight for me. Have this as my main mod and what others dont work I dont have a problem living without them would be nice.

KSP is great but I think they released it too early. Will be nice when all these kinks get worked out. But they should have had the foundation set first then build on that.
