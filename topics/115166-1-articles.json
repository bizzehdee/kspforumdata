I want to deploy a standalone ore tank with a mining mission to Minmus. Using tweakscale I created a (I think it was) 10m tank that held approximately 1,000t of ore. Deploying any normal legs just have them fall off the moment I deploy it on Kerbin, Maxing out tweakscale, 8 legs, all comically large, even for the huge tank, and they stay on but all instantly get damaged, such that they cannot retract. Presumably, it would fare far better on Minmus\u0027s rarified gravity; But I also want to sort of land on it to connect and shuttle it around. Presumably I would just be hovering over it, but invariably it will put some extra strain on the legs.\n\nAny ideas? It does not even have to be legs. For example, does anyone know if you can use Roverdudes airbags for this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T13:13:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wisnoskij**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T04:59:24Z","Content":"Maybe try using girders/I-beams directly under the tank to take the main part of the weight, combined with landing legs on the edges for suspension?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T05:17:25Z","Content":"as Reddeyfish said, just use girders. or just sit the tank on the ground, just make sure to land carefully.\n\nif you really want landing legs, i think there are some heavy duty deployable ones in the Karbonite mod.

The girders have a fair amount of spring which absorbs a bit of the impact on landing and tend to be more hardy when supporting massive weights."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T08:42:41Z","Content":"Another option is MK3 parts.
