So any mode of propulusion that relies on fuels that need to be cooled (liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen) is a bad idea for any long-duration mission. Insulated tanks will help a bit, and will reduce the boil-off to an extent, but unless you\u0027re going to be using the fuel within a few days of launch, use non-volatile hypergolic fuels instead. They\u0027re less efficient, but don\u0027t boil/leak away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T23:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a question of pressurization; *all* tanks are pressure vessels, but pressure-fed engines require highly-pressurized tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027re talking about is \u003Cstrong\u003Eboiloff\u003C/strong\u003E. Many rocket propellants are cryogenic, which means essentially they need to be kept very cold. For liquid oxygen (a \u0022mildly cryogenic\u0022 oxidizer) that means -178 Celsius. For Liquid Hydrogen (\u0022cryogenic\u0022, and a very good fuel) that means -259C. As you can imagine, that\u0027s very hard to do with the sun heating it, so over time the liquid gets too hot and boils (turns to gas). That gas must be vented in order for the tank to not explode, and the loss due to venting is called boiloff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome propellants, however, commonly called storables (because they are storable at room temperature) are not subject to boiloff. These propellants are usually chosen to be hypergolic (the fuel and oxidizer burn on contact, they don\u0027t need to be ignited). Also, for simplicity and reliability (especially when multiple ignitions are desired), the engines that use them are often pressure-fed. However, storable propellants usually have much lower performance than others, and are poor choices for LVs or departure stages, only coming to their own for long-duration missions (i.e. Saturn V was kerosene\u002BLOX and liquid hydrogen\u002BLOX, but the propellants used by the Apollo stack were all storable hypergolics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you post a screenshot to show the problem in your third paragraph?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThorBeorn","CreatedById":96670,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T23:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ToyToy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ToyToy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi !

It\u0027s like in real life so no problem, but I felt like it leaks really quickly ! I understand that if I use pressurized tank there is less leak, but the only pressurized tanks I could find are the old RCS tanks (filled with corresponding fuel of course). Am I missing something or is that normal and I\u0027m supposed to use such tanks for long mission ? For exemple if I want to go to Mars, should I just use RCS tanks ?...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse Procedural Parts for tanks. Tanks can then be switched to \u0022cryogenic\u0022 which minimizes boil-off. You can also attach thermal fins (they come with Real Fuels I believe) to a tank to decrease boil-off even more. However(!), cryogenic fuels (liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen mostly) are not well suited for very long missions, like going to mars for example. Use hypergolic propellants for that instead, such as NTO\u002Bhydrazine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ToyToy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ToyToy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, when making a good old great rocket, my engines aren\u0027t covered by the... \u0022cover\u0022 like they should be.
