It\u0027s probably best to just let people get the 4.6.4 files themselves; despite the ridiculous download.\n\nBut again I am compelled to say: The Unity agreement is a matter of civil law. Civil law doesn\u0027t mete out punishment and it doesn\u0027t act arbitrarily. Civil and contract courts seek to make injured parties whole. The redistribution of these two files does not injure Unity as a legal entity. So regardless of the text of the agreement - IMHO - Unity would have no actionable claim here even if they wanted to bring one. (Which, of course, they wouldn\u0027t because you\u0027re saving them 1gb of bandwidth per person per annum ad infinitum en perpetuum legal word legal word legal word YES.)\n\nAnd while this theoretically falls in the realm of Intellectual Property law, applicably speaking the property owner\u0027s rights are in no way undermined by the usage here. If a court intervened and found you in breach of the written text - again - what can they possibly return to Unity when Unity has lost nothing?\n\nThis is the sort of download that shouldn\u0027t be on an official code repository because its not to the exact letter of the law, but that should remain \\*FREE\\*-ly (emphasis added) available via an independent alternative because it benefits everyone and harms no one."},{"CreatedByName":"kreutzkevic","CreatedById":146514,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T20:16:23Z","Content":"Confirmed working for me without a hitch (...until now.
