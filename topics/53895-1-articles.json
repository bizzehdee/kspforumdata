A mass of fuel tanks and engines thrown together at a moments notice, the rocket still represented the best that Kerbin-or, atleast, the United Provinces could offer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWehner looked at the pad, at the small rocket standing glistening in the sun. The words UPDF were scrambled on the side, and a engineer was securing two fuel tanks together. The LV-909 engine stood on the bottom of the spacecraft, the newest breakthrough in engine propulsion-well, that is, until his team on the LV-45 would report in. A truck arrived, bearing fuel, and the engineer and another Kerbal ran out and began to fuel the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Kraken-8 represents the best in rocket technology... Actually, other than modified Q-4 rockets we got during the Big War, we have no rocket technology.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scientist kept silent, fingering the medal the Great Leader had given him during the war. Bobfred approached him with a stack of papers, and set them on his desk, and went out to grab a cup of coffee. Wehner looked down at the papers. He looked back up. The first rays of sunlight where peeking over the mountaintops now. Hopefully the test payload was secured along with the control unit, and the rocket won\u0027t fall apart and lose control in mid-air. The Rocketry Research Division needed a success to get their funding, after all- the Parliament kept threatening budget cuts if the Kraken-8 wasn\u0027t completed in time for action in the Bali Insurrection or something...it didn\u0027t matter. He\u0027ll show them. Bobfred entered the room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bobfred.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Please go perform a full system and structural check on the rocket.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And once you\u0027re done, head over to the local Kerbucks and get me a kappuccino. Extra sugar, not decaf. Frozen, with whipped cream. Oh, plus twenty of their glazed doughnuts. Large. I need to restock the Employee lounge.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes sir. I\u0027ll get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack onto the launch pad, Gene was securing the last of the bolts. He had heard about the first Kraken-8 test flight, and he didn\u0027t want it to happen again. After all, the last one did almost get him laid off before he even started his job, until Wehner intervened and managed to cajole/beg/bribe Parliament into approving another million for the Airforce Rocket Division....that was enough for another month-and that was if this flight was successful. A 23-million annual budget gets you nowhere, after all. The screwdriver stopped shaking, and he took it out and patted the bolt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Keep in there, little piece o\u0027metal, and I\u0027ll get to support my family another year.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gene!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Huh?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobfred ran up to him, panting and gasping for breath. The rocket was shining in the early morning now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What\u0027s with Wehner? He hasn\u0027t left the main Headquarters for a while.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There\u0027s air conditioning there...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gene, can you check over everything? Wehner wants to be sure.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ok.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobfred then ran off toward the employee parking lot mumuring something about frozen coffee with extra sugar and twenty glazed donuts. Gene bent down, making sure the bolts where secure. He opened a small panel, and stuck in a metal rod. It came out wet, stick with some black substance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s good. Fuel full.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe closed the panel, and secured the bolts one last time. Bending down, he felt the engine, and checked it over for cracks and dents in the bell. Nothing. This rocket was ready for launch. Another truck arrived, and several workers exited, and started carrying large red supports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hello, I\u0027ve managed to deliver your order from Jebediah\u0027s Metalworks. Nice day today, isn\u0027t it? Now, where should be put them?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh, arrange them around the rocket, activate them, and attach them to the fuselage.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Got it!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe workers put the launch clamps around the rocket and fastened them to the pad, before activating them and driving off into the distance. Jebediah...had he heard that name before? Wasn\u0027t he that cheery (And slightly insane) young airforce officer who came here one day and asked them if they had a space program, and if he could be a astronaut? No matter, there was work to be done. Gene climbed a clamp, and started to secure it to the rocket. After aligning the suction cups and structural parts, he sighed. \u003Cem\u003EOne down, three more to go\u003C/em\u003E. He clambered down, and went to work on another clamp. After this, he had to touch up the paint job. It was still morning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack at the building, Wehner worked on his plans. Well, plans that would come to fruition if Parliament ever made a space agency. Even the current Missile research agency was criminally underfunded. And their funding was on a downwards spiral. He needed a success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir! The Kraken-8 is ready for launch! And I got your coffee! They ran out of donuts, though, so I got fifteen.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobfred stood there, grinning. Wehner motioned for him to come in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ll launch right now. Tell Gene to hurry up, and set the engine ignition timer to Five Minutes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Got it. Can we get one of those little devices that you talk in and other people can hear you? Like the ones we see in old war movies of the Big War?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They cost money. We don\u0027t have money. Besides, you have to exercise. Now get out there and tell him!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes sir!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobfred ran out, and rushed outside, cursing the Parliament under his breath. The budget was a issue. Wehner looked at the watch. He had a appointment with the Secretary of Defense in a couple hours. Outside, two Kerbals scurried off the launch pad. The timer was set. It was almost noon. The few engineers in the building would be at their posts now, watching and waiting for the launch. Over the only radio in the entire center, he could hear excited chatter amongst the scientists in the control room as the timer slowly counted down. Picking up his papers and a pen, he opened the door and went down the stairwell to join in the excitement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFive minutes later, the little rocket hurled toward the sky, blazing fire and smoke out of its engine. Wehner went to the telemetry station, and immediately began to observe the information coming from the craft. The altitude started to rise, and the speed picked up as the little rocket soared towards the sky. Several engineers looked out the window, watching as the glowing streak of light slowly disappeared as the rocket soared above the clouds, leaving a trail of smoke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, I think the gasoline and sulfur combination worked.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sulfur?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes. Gasoline as main fuel, sulfuric acid as oxidizer. By the way, what\u0027s the odd smell in this room?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh.....\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene got up and left, and so did the smell. A second later, he poked his head into the room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m going to take a shower. Be right back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Smells so much better now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Engine burnout in five secon-now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Apogee?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022105 Kilometers. It\u0027ll land several hundred kilometers away.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022105KM?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe control room cheered as rocket neared its Apogee. \u003Cem\u003EIn space\u003C/em\u003E. But that wasn\u0027t the only reason they cheered. This would secure funding for some time, and they had families to support with a hefty paycheck, after all. Telemetry ceased from the first stage-the decoupler had fired, and the test payload was now plummeting back to Kerbin. Wehner was tense, slowly chewing on the ice cubes in his finished coffee. The heat shield was the only part they had not tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Reentry in five..four...three...two..one!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll telemetry ceased from the payload as it dove through the atmosphere. Some numbers came in, but they where scrambled. Suddenly, the temperature dropped, and the craft fell through the clouds, toward the small recovery ships below. Telemetry resumed. Loud cheering could be heard in the control room, and the parachutes opened, readying the Kraken-8\u0027s payload for a splashdown. Wehner looked at the readouts joyfully, and back at the smoke plume that the first stage had left, growing fainter and fainter by the second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene returned from his shower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m back! What happened?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mission Accomplished, Gene. Mission Accomplished.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA thousand kilometers away, the test payload bobbled in the waves as a recovery ship secured it with ropes and nets. The captain of the vessel watched as his sailor hoisted the small craft out of the water, then looked above toward the stars.

The research center was quiet, most of the scientists and engineers having gone home to their respective families, and only a skeleton crew of security guards and researchers remained to work the graveyard shift. A black car with governmental markings was parked in the main parking lot. Wehner was in the Employee lounge, eating a large glazed donut while he talked with the newly appointed Secretary of Defense-a old friend of his whom he had met while on a international trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022As you can see, sir, the Kraken-8 missile is ready for action. The test payload has been recovered several thousand kilometers away by a UPDF missile patrol boat and is being shipped back here. The Kraken-8 is a success, which will help the Rocketry Division secure it\u0027s funding for another month.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Defense Secretary stayed silent, and walked over to the coffee machine and started to make a cup. He frowned in disapproval, and looked toward Wehner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh-where\u0027s the cream?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022In the upper cabinet by the sink.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thanks. Got it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter pouring a whole packet of vanilla cream into his cup, the Secretary sat down in a armchair. The fireplace was running in a corner as the two officals looked at each other uncomforatbly. Finally, the Secretary broke the news. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wehner. I\u0027m going to allocate more money to your Advanced Space Studies division. Actually, I\u0027ll be raising the budget as a whole. From 12 million this year, to 24 million in the coming months, and hopefully onwards to next year.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And I\u0027m going to vouch for the creation of a space agency.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWehner paused, trying to suppress his happiness. \u003Cem\u003EA space agency\u003C/em\u003E? He stayed silent, giving time for the Secretary to keep talking.

I used to work there as a high school student, y\u0027know. Now, the space agency will be headed by you and the other high-ups in the rocketry division.

It was getting late, and he had to catch his flight back to the United Provinical Capitol. He took a quick peek at wahat was happening outside. One of his bodyguards outside was chatting with a security guard, while the other was pacing relentlessly. His driver was reading a novel with a flashlight, and another of his guards was staring at the door. Turning from the window he immediately excused himself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I have to go now.

I was going to check on the Kraken-8, but since you launched it already-what a neat surprise anyways, I ought to give you more funding.

Several airforce soldiers opened the doors, and immediately started carrying out a new type of device noone had ever seen before-let alone seven of them together. Even the sight of the armored transports was enough to excite-after all, the nearby small suburban town\u0027s did get much excitment, and large armored military trucks is not a sight to be seen everyday. Wehner stood in the crowd of curious onlookers, and immediately recognized the device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey! That\u0027s the LVT-45! Our Propulsion teams have delivered!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small crowd of engineers cheered as the servicemen saluted, and started to carry the engines into the storage building. The Propulsion team had done an excellent job with the engines, and the scientist\u0027s couldn\u0027t wait to try it out. Wehner picked up a blueprint for the Hulfry-1 Exo-Atmospherical Orbital Sounding Rocket, and smiled. With the new budget raises in the Advanced Kerbin Science\u0027s division, he could now afford follow the plan he had waited months to try. After all, he still had one of those experimental payloads in backup storage. He looked toward his blueprints, and stroked the paper softly. \u003Cem\u003EThis is a idea today, but it shall exist by next week. And who knows? It might push Parliamentary support for the space agency and get them to listen to the Secretary of Defense\u0027s advice!\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe sighed alone, as he once again realized all projects had to get through the President. Picking up the phone, he called Madfield, silently praying for the approval of the project. The cheering was growing fainter outside as the LVT-45 was safely deposited in the storage facility and the transports returned to base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Allo?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hello? Is this Wehner? The Secretary of Defense has been recommending the space agency proposal to me, and he say\u0027s you\u0027re fit to command it. Are you sure about that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes-and this is abotu something different. The LVT-45 engines just came today from our propulsion engineering team, and I badly want to launch a orbital satellite.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A orbit satellite? Good idea....maybe. I\u0027ll approve funding on the program, and see how it goes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So it\u0027s a green light to go?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You could say that. I have to hang up now, the Speaker of Parliament is meeting me in a couple minutes. Wish you the best of luck. Oh, and about the space agency-I\u0027ll forward the proposal to him and recommend you for the job.

The project had been approved, given the green light, allowed, funded, everything! His dreams where coming true-now all that remained was his efforts. And sure as hell, he would try. He looked back over his blueprints, and called oer his assistant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bobfred!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh-huh?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I want you to do a engine test with Gene, Tom, and Adam.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir, my legs are aching. I don\u0027t want to walk anymore. When will you buy these little devices that we see in the old war movies?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Just shut up. If they\u0027re aching, then you get muscle. You\u0027re single, right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good. Keep it up, sooner or later you\u0027ll be strong enough to attract any kerbette you want. Now get out there and tell them! We got a engine test today!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LVT-45 was the breakthough in rocket propulsion, being the only engine not completely derived from the Q-class rockets the coalition forces had recovered in the Big War almost a decade ago-a great war that had caused the collapse of many great civilizations and empires, and had ravanged the surface fo kerbin, killing many Kerbals in the process. The scars of the war was still apparent on Kerbin today-especially into the rocket division. Wehner was forever marked by what he had experienced during the war as a military officer in charge of R\u0026amp;D, and forever carried with him the scars and reputation he had acquired. But that was of no interest now-the LVT-45 was sleek, modern, and reported to have a thurst ability four times that of the LV-909, and with a fuel conservation ability that rivaled it nonetheless. The rocket division was proud of it-and they had a good reason to be so-after all, it \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E among the best engines in the world, and the best that money could buy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the launchpad, the technicans hauled out a LVT-45 and began to attach to to a fuel tank and supports. This was be it\u0027s first firing test, and they needed to keep up the success that had started with the Kraken-8-and, after all, they had families to feed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gene! Can you get the umblical cords attach to the fuel tank?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ok. I\u0027m on it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWehner stood off to the side with a group of engineers with clipboards and sensory output recievers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yep! We\u0027re ready lads! Let\u0027s go!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ignition timer set to a minute! Everyone, off, run, and hit the ground once the thrust starts!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022GO GO GO\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe technicans scrambled off the launchpad as fast as they could, and the rocket suddenyl burst to life behind them, spraying smoke out toward the blue sky. There was clapping amongst the engineers as the readouts came. A couple faces fell as bets where lost, but the mood was greatly positive among them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nice one!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple chuckles and a \u0022Congrat\u0027s, Gene\u0022 rolled through the scattered group of engineers, followed by a high-five and a quick passing around of a bottle of wine. The engine stopped firing, and the fuel meter reached zero. The engine test was successful, and exicited chatter broke out amongst the researchers. But another group was watching intently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nice. I think it would be interesting if we managed to get the Rocketry Agency to launch a science satellite.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah. I have some connections in the government-we might be able to pull some strings in the Parliament to get them to launch a science satellite.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three astronomers stood in the forest clearing as the white plume of smoke slowly faded in the sky, scattered by the wind as the sun shone overhead.
