KW Expanded Fairings place the payload above the structure. Use the stock offset tool to place the payload onto the structure.\n- Some of the interstage node placements don\u0027t scale well with the interstage model, you may see some clipping.

If you want, I can help you add it, or I can do it myself, my process isn\u0027t too complicated.\n\nActually, something I\u0027m looking for is a list of mods that have fairings that are unconfigured. Since this is kind of meant to be a companion mod to RealismOverhaul, I\u0027m prioritizing mods we support there, but eventually I\u0027d like to support most everything with a fairing."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T02:13:48Z","Content":"Have most of it done but my nodes won\u0027t stay they keep moving ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) if you don\u0027t mind will send you a PM."},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T11:05:30Z","Content":"Excellent idea!

Looking at the way your fairing textures are set up, would have to edit them a bit to make them compatible, since Firespitter texture switcher won\u0027t let me change the mapping per texture. I also probably need to adjust the way I do some stuff, since if someone has your textures installed and mine, it would override yours."},{"CreatedByName":"Ravenchant","CreatedById":84260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T14:29:55Z","Content":"Ok, what can I do to make them more, uh...compatible?

Your textures should work just fine! On which note, I need to install a plugin to edit dds\u0027s with GIMP because a couple of the textures have a bit of weird scaling that they shouldn\u0027t. I think mainly the Atlas and Titan textures (which appear to be basically the same.)\n\nThere are a couple of ways of handling compatibility, the easiest would be to just include your textures and shapes in the pack and give you credit. Harder would be a cross-compatibility MM patch, where if present, it adds your textures to the list of available textures, and adds the whole list to your fairing shapes. It does complicate things somewhat since at present my configs assume that all the textures are in the same directory.\n\nBut it would be doable, and I\u0027m flexible for either solution at your discretion.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Looks good! I\u0027ll definitely be keeping an eye on this when I start my career game. Is it compatible with FAR at all?\n\nIt should be fully compatible with FAR, especially since FAR uses a voxel-scan to determine vessel shape now, rather than assumed part shape. All Procedural Fairings does nowadays is alert FAR that the shape has changed so FAR can re-scan the vessel."},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T23:49:17Z","Content":"I take it this is something different from the Procedural fairings mod that has been around for several years? only changing other fairing parts, not adding any?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryds","CreatedById":108453,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T10:05:53Z","Content":"It seems that way.

You (Gryphon corp, I think?) are listed as the manufacturer, and the name and description have been kept pretty much the same. Your shapes default to the correct texture, and have access to all the other textures. Actually, if you\u0027re any good with texture-making, could you edit the Atlas and Titan textures to straighten out the curved ridges in the upper cone? I was tinkering around with it in GIMP, and it just reinforced how terrible I am at anything remotely artistic.\n\n Thanks for the awesome textures and shapes!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Here is some fairing, I made for using with Long March mod [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/Untitled%20Folder/screenshot13.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/Untitled%20Folder/screenshot13.png)[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/Untitled%20Folder/screenshot14.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/Untitled%20Folder/screenshot14.png)\n\nThose are pretty awesome, I\u0027d love to have them in the pack.

Might be cool for some ship designs to be able to give them a non-standard shape, or omit them entirely.\n\nActually, that\u0027s not a bad idea. RealismOverhaul has a shroud toggler, so if you\u0027re using that it\u0027s a little more clean. Otherwise, the shroud relies on a node to exist to which it should attach, so you can disable them in bulk like so:\n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleJettison]]:FINAL{\t@MODULE[ModuleJettison]\t{\t\t@bottomNodeName = this_node_does_not_exist\t}}\n\nI\u0027ll give some thought to whether or not I want to do that by default.
