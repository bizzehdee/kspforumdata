I\u0027m not really sure exactly what the scope of possible improvements are in that area, but it\u0027s enough to get my attention. Of course, right now the closest thing I have to a living room is the TV perpendicular to my computer, facing the couch. Given that I normally use a keyboard, I am rarely tempted to use the TV instead of my monitor (the TV is always hooked up for streaming through), and sitting at my desk gives me a screen that is about the same apparent size I think. So if I went for this, it would probably be as an alternate OS, or just something for the next time I change OS (free also gets my interest, depending on how capable it is as a general OS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, with a house all to myself, the whole two computer thing is not at all appealing, not until the TV itself can be that second computer streaming from the gaming rig. Of course, that might just be the reality by the time that happens. Also, Valve probably has a better shot than anyone at actually getting games onto Linux, and I have to figure that this is the opening move in a years long plan. I also have to figure that Valve is in an excellent position to try and bring Linux into the mainstream properly, both because they are potentially in a position to provide incentives to the gaming masses (if they can bring the games), and because it will be a Linux OS developed by a body that is already experienced with designing programs for the masses, so I think they could create something that people might find easier to use.

Erik in that Forbes blog I linked said it was way overdue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for getting game devs to support the Linux platform, it\u0027s the usual chicken and egg problem. However most games nowadays are developed for multiple platforms, namely Playstation, Xbox and our beloved PC. Xbox and PC are both basically DirectX boxes, so really two technical platforms (x86/DirectX and Cell/PSGL) and two interface types (Desk/Keyboard/Monitor and Couch/Gamepad/TV). Getting them to take on another platform will be hard to pull off if there is a small Linux and SteamOS install base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever....... as it happens, the new Playstation 4 is x86 based and supports DirectX and OpenGL \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. So, if a game dev goes down the path of x86 and OpenGL, then that will cover 3 platforms; Playstation 4, PC, Linux/SteamOS. If they do a DirectX version as well (like how they cover two technical platform already), then they have the new Xbox as well.
