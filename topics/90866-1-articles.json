While I could work it out for myself, I don\u0027t understand why you would want these values? What would you hope to achieve by knowing them? Wouldn\u0027t you be more interested in where you are going to land? The lat/lon of your entry interface really has no bearing on where that will be because you could end up in entirely different locations depending on how steeply you reenter. I\u0027ve never used it but I think MechJeb has a landing targeting function, doesn\u0027t it? Maybe that would help? Sorry I can\u0027t offer anything more useful than that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
