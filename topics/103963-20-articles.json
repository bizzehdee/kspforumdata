I get it in both Windows and Linux when I have OpenGL enabled. I do not get them when I run without forcing openGL in windows. To do that it requires me to strip down the number of mods I have loaded to be able to run the game in Windows 32 bit. In Linux I tested on 1.0.2 with only Scatterer installed and the jagged circles occured. Removing the mod removed the jagged lines. That said, it appears KSP 1.0 in openGL has some of it\u0027s own issues....like some missing textures...in the \u0022loading\u0022 dialog and I\u0027ve seen it in the altitude dialog. I get those issues in KSP in both Windows and Linux.\n\nMy system details:\n\nDual Boot OS: Windows 7 64 bit Ultimate and Ubuntu 14.10 (propietary drivers)\n\nGPU: 2x R9 290 4GB\n\nRAM: 16GB of RAM\n\nI run in Linux to be able to use the 64 bit version of KSP. The Windows version cannot handle all the mods I load into my KSP now that a bunch of them have been updated. Before 1.0 I was running a Linux install with 140\u002B mods. When I say I loaded only Scatterer I ran it on my \u0022Base\u0022 install, which is the game copied from it\u0027s location in Steam (which I don\u0027t modify at all) to a Games directory I maintain. I keep a \u0022Base\u0022 install so I can test things isolated from the rest of my mods. The only modification to it is I have CKAN added to it to manage mods I can add to it. The only mod loaded with CKAN for that test was Scatterer.\n\nI\u0027d really like to see this mod make it to a released status....it is a beautiful mod. I just can\u0027t run it yet with the number of other mods I like to run. I estimate, with mods added since 1.0 came out, that I would be over 150 mods if all my mods were updated. Right now without Scatterer, I\u0027m running 75 mods according to CKAN.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T23:34:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 11:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thundergod97**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyseman76","CreatedById":67018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:22:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The jagged circular lines in the sky appear to be caused by this mod when it is run with openGL.

Mountains stick out of the atmosphere like a sour thumb. While 1000 of 1000 looks exact right (like earth from space) .. I think that kerbals have a slight percental thicker one. 1003 (or 1004) of 1000 hides (almost) all of them. The only workaround I can think of is apply tricks (like render the atmsphere towards the horizon smaller or apply an extra layer to mountains)\n2. After setting Post processing depth to 1000 (instead of 150) I realized that in default it looks too soupy from space.\n3. I get that infamous \u0022above ~25-30km everything fades to black\u0022 bug. But only if it is day and the planet in visible in the camera view. Even in space the background is black if the planet is visible but only on the day side. As less visible as the planet is the more background I can see on the day side. Same goes for night day border. As more I slide into darkness as more the background becomes visible.  \nAs debug I deactivated PS from the menu and nothing changed about the background. (I thought it maybe might be simulated overexposure)\n\n![D3002317809CF6E80264C8B4B68BDF1ABECBFE6A](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534018071217815531/D3002317809CF6E80264C8B4B68BDF1ABECBFE6A/)\n\nedit anyway I love this mod...just wanted to give a little feedback."}]}
