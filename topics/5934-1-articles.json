The extra stages gets the orbiter up no problems. I then tested the positions of the RCS to see if any control axis\\\u0027s had any unwanted secondary effects, but most most of the work perfectly and the few with secondary effects could be balanced out. Next tested the glide approach, and found that more than 25% power caused the craft to want to flip round, so never managed to reduce the fuel enough to test what the gliding was like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea I am tempted to try out is removing the top decoupler and seeing if two additional parachutes along with the capsule\\\u0027s and the rockets can get the entire orbiter to land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway that aside we have our first community built orbiter!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(pics coming soon!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"segaprophet","CreatedById":14087,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-26T20:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s something I came up with noodling around in photoshop - I can come up with more variations on this if I need to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2850668/sprinter/project_odysseus/project_odysseus.png\u0022 alt=\u0022project_odysseus.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-26T21:15:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy a half-life symbol?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eischei","CreatedById":15394,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-26T21:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s only a greek letter called lambda.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESepp\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkshadow","CreatedById":14251,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-26T22:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022segaprophet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022segaprophet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s something I came up with noodling around in photoshop - I can come up with more variations on this if I need to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2850668/sprinter/project_odysseus/project_odysseus.png\u0022 alt=\u0022project_odysseus.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m liking the greek style font.
