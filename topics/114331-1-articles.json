If you did somehow manage to get far enough out into deep space that gravity was being rounded to zero by floating point errors in a double precision value, I think you\u0027re likely to have bigger issues...) and does not stop accelerating objects, so unless you have some form of propulsive system you will never maintain 0m/s (relative to the star...) for more than a fraction of a second"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T07:22:41Z","Content":"Well, gravity would pull you towards the center of your current SoI.

To put it simply; if there were only two objects in the universe, they would eventually fall towards each other. In Kerbal Space Program, it works a little bit differently (gravity is still functionally infinite as noted above) but not quite enough to make a difference.\n\nBeing a video game, KSP has an internal coordinate system. Objects exist in set, discrete locations that are so tightly packed that you don\u0027t see the \u0027jump\u0027 from one spot to another as you travel, it all looks smooth to you. It would be possible to cancel out your velocity with respect to this coordinate system in the game engine... for a moment. \n\nThe reason for that is that no matter where you are in the game world, you\u0027re always pulled on by gravity from some source. Even if you fly away from all other planets and bodies in the game, you\u0027ll always be under the influence of the Sun. All other objects around the Sun in the game also travel around it, so even if you cancel your velocity with respect to the coordinate system used internally by the game engine, you won\u0027t be going at 0 m/s compared to the planets, and you won\u0027t be able to stay stationary with respect to the coordinate system for very long either, as you\u0027ll be invariably pulled towards whatever you end up orbiting!\n\nSo like with so many things in life, the answer is \u0022Yes, and no, depending on how you look at it\u0022.\n\nBut mostly \u0022No\u0022! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T08:50:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E even if you cancel your velocity with respect to the coordinate system used internally by the game engine, you won\u0027t be going at 0 m/s compared to the planets\n\nI feel you are nitpicking here...
