Going to try a level three attempt (5 kerbals, a full time pilot with the others taking turns). My biggest issue so far is designing my ship. I\u0027ve come up with 5 different designs and scrapped all 5 due to each design having too much dead weight.  Any suggestions on how to minimize my non-fuel mass? I\u0027d appreciate some direction and suggestion.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I should mention the overall design I\u0027m working around though. I have a detachable heat shield section comprised of multiple heat shields at the front of the ship. Linked to that via large docking port is a simple hitchhiker crew container. Linked to that, via large docking port, is the main fuel section containing a 2.5 to Mk.3 addapter, Mk. 3 monoprop tank, Mk. 3 to 3.5 adapter, the smallest 3.5 fuel module, and the rest is stepped back down in reverse order. That\u0027s then linked via large docking port to my lander for all 5 moons and also the main engine drive for the entire ship. Its a Mk.2 lander can, large reaction wheel, 2.5 utility bay filled with batteries, a full scientific instrument arrary, small monoprop tanks, and a pair of RTGs, folloeed by a large orange tank with a poodle engine attached with six dart engies attached radially with large 1.5 meter tanks.  It also has 4 drouge and radial parachutes to slow the lander on Laythe.\n\u003E \n\nYou\u0027re carrying a lot of monopropellent in that Mk3 tank, do you really need that much?  Also maybe split up your fuel tanks so you can stage them off when they\u0027re empty, and consider the inflatable heat shield might weigh less than your multi-shield section.  The design philosophy of using lander engines to push the mothership could be a good one, but you will need lots of fuel without nukes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, samamstar said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On level 3:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m considering doing a mission where my lander fits 1 kerbal, but my mothership lands to refuel. Tylo and laythe would only have 1 kerbal land, but all 5 would land on Pol, Bop, and Val. Would this still qualify for level 3? Or would it only be level 2?\n\u003E \n\nYes it would, as long as Tylo and Laythe are done by different Kerbals.  That way every Kerbal gets to \u0022lead\u0022 for one moon."},{"CreatedByName":"GwynJHawke","CreatedById":162547,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T03:51:01Z","Content":"I\u0027ve put a little more thought into the matter. To start, I only have v1.0.5, so I don\u0027t have the inflatable heat shield, or else I would gladly use it. It would take a 19 part heat shield section and bring that down to only 2 parts. Sadly, not an option at this time (older computer problems). However, my original flight plan called for a aerobreak in both jool and laythe\u0027s atatmospheres. My original plan had me burning retrograde for a little while to slow down enough in laythe\u0027s atmosphere to where nothing blows up and let air resistance slow the lander down enough to deploy the drogue chutes followed by the parachutes. My new thought is to simply detach the heat shield as planned after aerobreaking into orbit around laythe, and attach it to the lander. This way I can save precious deltaV in the descent and only fire the areospikes just before landing.\n\nMy second issue is landing on Tylo. I planned on a very low orbit for the mothership at ~12,000 meters. This should hopefully help save deltaV that gets bled out to fight gravitational pull. The less I have to fall, the less I have to waste. However, my deltaV calculation for the lander is just about 4800 d/V. That\u0027s plenty enough to land, but the mission is not to start a colony. From my research, it seems I\u0027m a bit short on my fuel capacity. Maybe I can take a dockable fuel tank that I can drain and ditch before landing... it would only add 5 parts to my part count, 2 docking ports, fuel tank, and 2 micro SRB\u0027s to push it away after it\u0027s empty.\n\nTaking a lot of fuel isn\u0027t something I\u0027m much concerned with. I can swap out the middle part of the ship\u0027s main fuel section for a larger 3.5 meter piece and keep my part count the same, which is thr bigger issue for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Norcurion","CreatedById":101467,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T09:17:58Z","Content":"[@sdj64](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/100819-sdj64/)\n\nThanks for the clarification.

The reason for that rule is that ISRU already provides a means to refuel.  It would be devastating PR if you had to send a rescue mission to refuel your self-refueling ship!

What if you start from another planet (Dres)?

It\u0027s an irsu ship BTW.\n\nWould it count as Normal Jool 5 irsu? Or to do that would it need to leave with the lander attached? Or maybe it would be something in between normal and grand tour?

I could probably launch with it if it makes it easier for you [@sdj64](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/100819-sdj64/), but that would mean a larger and much more complicated booster and mission plan. \n\nI\u0027m wondering because the \u002BWatney I launched recently in my mission report I plan to have go to Jool next Dres-Jool transfer window.
