This way you will reduce your vertical speed, so you won\u0027t be sinking into denser atmosphere. The horizontal speed would be decreasing rapidly by the drag. You just have to use your engines (or to some degree shape of your craft) to adjust your vertical speed. If you get to hot you need to go up, if you stop loosing horizontal speed then you need to go down, or make another orbit if you dont have enough deltaVs. This 36km alt of periapsis is what works for me, but it depends from your speed.
