For instance in my recently successfully completed Duna crewed landing campaign (woo hoo!!) out of 4 interplanetary transfers (base, habitat \u0026amp; lander \u0026amp; crew to Duna and crew return from Duna) 2 of them ended up in a retrograde orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens if I plot the transfer by hand or use a tool to compute the node. When I enter the SOI of the target I burn retrograde until I achieve capture. Obviously this is sub-optimal as I have to expend dV just to get orbiting in the correct direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any tips on how to prevent this from happening?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-20T13:07:33Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2015 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerBlammo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T12:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, never actually ran into this... maybe try aerocapture?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T12:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt just requires tweaking the maneuver node for the transfer. After you set up the node, change your focus to your destination planet. You can then see the trajectory you will eventually take when you arrive. By tweaking the maneuver node you can adjust that trajectory and determine which side of the planet you arrive at and the altitude of your periapsis, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T12:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you find you are in a retrograde orbit after a transfer it is because you got your encounter slightly wrong.

There are a couple of ways to check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen fine tuning my encounter I click on the target and zoom in. If you have a low PE you should be able to see some deflection of the orbit. This should always be in the anti clockwise direction (to the left) when viewing from above the north pole. If you are coming in so fast that there is no deflection you can still see which direction you are traveling from the escape node at the end of the orbit segment and ensure that the planet is on the left.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlammo","CreatedById":137834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T13:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow thanks for the quick replies.
