In career mode, you just start a policy to exchange all science for funds/reputation.\n\nBut why not add some repeatable tech nodes, which hold upgrades to existing parts? For example:\n\nThe engine upgrade node gives each time completed a bonus of 2-3% to engine ISP, thrust, max temperature, etc\n\nSolar panel upgrades would give more EC/s with each upgrade. This would also make solar panels more useful, if you are far away from kerbol.\n\nYou could split up the nodes even more and make certain item groups like \u0022orbital engine\u0022 or \u0022jet engines\u0022.\n\nOr just add a upgrade menu, where you can select a part, which will get its stats boosted, if you invest a certain amount of science (which will raise after each upgrade for that part)."},{"CreatedByName":"Unheld","CreatedById":74707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T14:33:17Z","Content":"what a great idea you have there ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T16:21:21Z","Content":"This could be awesome.\n\nPay 1000-5000 science to add 5-15% to a part\u0027s ISP.
