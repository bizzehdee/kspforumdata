In career mode, you just start a policy to exchange all science for funds/reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut why not add some repeatable tech nodes, which hold upgrades to existing parts? For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine upgrade node gives each time completed a bonus of 2-3% to engine ISP, thrust, max temperature, etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar panel upgrades would give more EC/s with each upgrade. This would also make solar panels more useful, if you are far away from kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could split up the nodes even more and make certain item groups like \u0022orbital engine\u0022 or \u0022jet engines\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr just add a upgrade menu, where you can select a part, which will get its stats boosted, if you invest a certain amount of science (which will raise after each upgrade for that part).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unheld","CreatedById":74707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T14:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat a great idea you have there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T16:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis could be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPay 1000-5000 science to add 5-15% to a part\u0027s ISP.
