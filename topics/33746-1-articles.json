On #3 you are using engine LV-T30 which has no vectoring so it will not steer. Use engine LV-T45. It has vectoring and goes straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for #4 if you check your balance you will see that the thrust/mass is slightly skewed. I haven\u0027t tested far enough to see why this is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA solution I use when I have strange craft is the DRAkTEC-VTOL-pack. It has some engines in it which can be used for throttle streering and work like a charm when you have an unbalanced load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn #4 your rover is unbalanced and will not land properly either.
