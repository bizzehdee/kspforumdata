Then, you can attach it to whatever using the docking port. OR, make the engine the root part, and attach via that.\n\nAs per the docking bug, I\u0027ve heard it before, perhaps it was attached wrong, or there\u0027s an issue, which requires a little bit of editing of persistance.sfs\n\nAs per the third one, I don\u0027t understand. They worked for many years near constantly on the game to get it to 1.0, took a break, worked for a year, and then released 1.1 and hotfixes, and 1.1 did a helluva lot more than simply add the encyclopedia, it moved to unity 5, making the game 64 bit, run faster, use multiple CPU cores, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Mjarf","CreatedById":16666,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T21:42:00Z","Content":"What I hate most about this game is how addictive it is, who knew burning rocket fuel could be as addictive as snorting certain types of powder. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogenutt","CreatedById":151770,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T21:56:29Z","Content":"You can only have one F5 save and then if you want to F5 again it copys over the original one and then you F5 again but this time around its a case of no chance of  surviving the impending doom! and then another 45 minutes wasted repeating the same stuff!"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T22:11:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 minutes ago, Dogenutt said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You can only have one F5 save and then if you want to F5 again it copys over the original one and then you F5 again but this time around its a case of no chance of  surviving the impending doom! and then another 45 minutes wasted repeating the same stuff!\n\u003E \n\nAlt F5 lets you save more than one quicksave and ALT F9 allows you to load any quicksave."},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T22:12:12Z","Content":"What do I hate.......nothing.
