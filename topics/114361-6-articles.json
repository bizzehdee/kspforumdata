It came from hell. It is really fun. But maybe you\u0027ve done everything there is to do in the game. Maybe you want to build stuff that looks cool or mirrors something in real life. Maybe you want to do an Apollo replica. So you build a lander (a very cool one) and move it over to subassemblies. But It says\u00A0THE SELECTED PART IS NOT ATTACHABLE. Could you explain why instead of yelling at me? No? Ok, screw you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0But I give it another chance. I work around the issue. I launch. I perform an encounter burn. I dock\u00A0to the lander. I get to the Mun. I undock. I try again. And again. You see, it\u0027s kind of hard to enjoy this game when I can\u0027t undock. I hit the button. Nothing happens. The button DISSAPEARS. Now this happens all the time. Sorry Space Station, Mun Base, etc., you are worthless now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0Then I look at their\u00A0update history.

It is not a mod, it is a independent program that runs outside ksp. When you get the dock problem just quicksave. Then alt\u002Btab, open up KML and feed it your quicksave.sfs file(in the KSP installation folder -\u0026gt; saves).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis shows you all the errors in your save game as warnings. You should see one to do with the current Apollo craft. Right-click that, and select to fix. Remember to save afterwards(overwrite the quicksave.sfs file)...then back to game and quickload, all is fixed until next time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
