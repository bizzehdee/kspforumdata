A work around / solution to all this is to set the game\u0027s Flight UI setting to Tiny, mouse over the Resources tab and film all you want (Works best with static shots and Kerbcam aided shots. For some reason when mousing over the Resources tab the green highlight doesn\u0027t appear. Not the case with the other gauges). While editing all you have to do is crop out what you need to. If your game\u0027s resolution is 720 or higher a slight zoomed crop shouldn\u0027t be noticeable. I recommend doing some visual quality testing camerawork prior to adopting any new techniques.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
