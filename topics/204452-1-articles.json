I see that the RoveMate has only a 10 degree field of view, and the anomalies should appear as \u0022?\u0022 in the KerbNet screen. I found in the Wiki the \u00A0latitude/longitudes for the three arches, but is the only thing I can do is watch KerbNet until a \u0022?\u0022 appears and set a waypoint? Or is there some way that\u0027s more efficient?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that MJ2 allows you to plug in coordinates for a landing site, but I\u0027ve been trying to wean myself away from it because I came to depend on it too much.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-21T17:32:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2021 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by maddog59\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-21T21:11:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u2019re doing things right, but maybe a higher orbit will help? The narrow FOV is less of an issue up there and you should be able to see everything and mark them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, use SCANsat and do an anomaly scan to automate the whole process and get usable maps with precise locations that you can then use on other crafts without messing around with waypoints etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
