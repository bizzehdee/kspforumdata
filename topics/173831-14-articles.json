I\u0027ve got a little bit of experience in both, and I can tell you that coding was way more complex and sensitive. Just changing where a line of code was could improve the performance of the software massively. In my experience coding and software can be different based on what day of the week it is, the position of the planets, season, and the state of the weather... There\u0027s a very real possibility that 1.4.2 was extensively tested and some of these issues never occurred during testing. How software behaves is so sensitive to things like OS setups, hardware, and so on, that there\u0027s never a guarantee to how it will behave. The real issue here is likely to be that the testers probably have very specific hardware and software setups that do not adequately represent the average user\u0027s setups, thus leading to inconsistencies with how the game behaves. Of course, the game was never very stable to begin with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine if a machined piece changed shape massively based purely on who was using it and on random other factors and that you had to find the root cause in the tooling, and you\u0027d get somewhat close to the issue at hand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had the landing legs explode on one mission - and work perfectly fine the next.
