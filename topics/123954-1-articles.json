I found that whenever I went back to the main menu after a training mission, I could not do another training mission, as it would glitch to where I couldn\u0027t see my ship. When I went on to map view, the camera would lock on to random planets, yet I still was unable to select anything making the missions unplayable. Whenever I sped up the time, the planets or the mark where my spacecraft is supposed to be would remain stationary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I tried some fixes (taking off the read-only and excluding KSP from my antivirus {Avast}) and it still wasn\u0027t fixed. The only way I could get the training missions working again is by Verifying the Integrity of the Game Catche via. It would always find 1 - 2 and replace them. But, I still have to do this after every time I do a training mission if I want to do another, which means a lot of closing the game, re-verifying game catche, restarting, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t found a thread pertaining to my problems, yet, so I hope I\u0027m not the sole player with this problem.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*EDIT* In career mode (if I didn\u0027t verify my cache before playing the game) I cannot launch any rocket/space planes either.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-03T19:21:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2015 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tyler269\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFound more glitches\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDD","CreatedById":153078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T13:48:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have just installed the game via Steam and I have the same issue.
