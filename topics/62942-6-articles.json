First stage launches straight up and pushes to about 185k, second stage detaches, does an RCS burn to gain space then a gravity turn burn to reach a stable orbit. I then switched back to the first stage and followed it to landing. Then back at my second stage, I got abit overly critical about the eccentricity of my orbit so I used RCS burns to stablize it at around 175k. Then detached the payload, RCS burned to give me some space to work and set it for landing as well. Now i did use MechJeb for landings, I must admit I\u0027m not really good at the fine adjustments in general and tend to overcorrect. But my piloting skills suck, I don\u0027t question that =P.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all I wasn\u0027t disappointed with the exercise but I still found it a bit easier to achieve this sort of payload delivery than I was having with my original launch vehicle I was tinkering with. It looks like I may have inadvertently created a 2 stage reusable rocket as a result of this experiment, just need to setup a way to refuel and find a better pilot than me to lift off the second stage and carefully reattach it to the first and a crane to reload the payload. I was quite happy with the landing sites of the different stages, I think I\u0027ll keep them there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might revisit this again someday in the future as I do like the concept of a 2 stage lifter that is fully reusable but I\u0027m happy with this for now.

I honestly enjoy seeing everyone\u0027s creations and if a 2 stage SRB creation was posted (even one that needed a VAB to recombine \u0026amp; refuel) I would honestly be as interested in seeing how it was accomplished as much as the next creation. My only thought was that the idea of using a VAB to recombine and refuel somehow feels like cheating after all the other entries went to great lengths to not use it. I still respect the attempt, but out of fairness for the other entries I feel those should be kept on a separate leader board or marked on the existing leader board as \u0022VAB used\u0022 if their entries are scored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I very much agree, we\u0027re learning the lessons of the shuttle with this challenge and that\u0027s why I like it =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKudos on the TSTO reusable launcher! Yeah, reassembly is going to be hard... perhaps a really tall crane? There was an idea about ramps in this thread which would be glorious to see implemented, going all stock with crawlers on top of ramps and other crawlers rolling things under adn really complicated ground ops (which considering you can quickload/quicksave frequently, is the place to get complicated without wasting copious amount of time to the kraken). You need something gound based for the refueling operations anyway... and you minimize useless structure on the rocket. Plus, it would be very realistic looking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to VAB and solids... well, using the VAB goes very much against the spirit of the challenge, especially to reattach things, I don\u0027t think that should be allowed at all. But if someone can do this with plain SRBs while taking them back to KSC and reattaching them... they can refuel them using pixie dust for all I care, they deserve great kudos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the \u0022worst\u0022 thing I see about TSTO is precision and repeatability. I mean, having wings makes hitting the runway easy, and lifting off in a single stage means with a bit of practice you can hit rendezvouses in very low orbits in one or two orbits without corrections that translate into inefficiencies. And when you have to repeat the whole thing at least five times... well, let\u0027s say it\u0027s good you can save now anytime, and that every landing got my heart racing while I was doing the challenge (and the Broadsword glides like a feather and lands on a ridiculously short distance at less than 50m/s).

It took me forever tho... a crane would definitely be the way to go, and like you I did like the ramp crane setup, I just wonder if I could make something high enough that would still work as intended. I honestly haven\u0027t given ground ops a great deal of thought yet on my 2sto launcher, but I have a few theories on how to simplify it... they should prove interesting but it will be a few days before I can find the time to put them together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for precision and repeatability of a 2sto, I\u0027d have to agree with you that the setup is not ideal, for one its not like regular rocket setups where I can set MechJeb to launch when the time is right for rendezvous, so I\u0027ll almost always need to do an adjustment burn after achieving orbit, which means I\u0027m going to need to ether push more fuel into the second stage or leave some payload on the ground. I had 10.5 t approximately so I could easily cut that in half to get some extra time, and I had extra fuel in the first stage so I could in theory shift that fuel / weight into the second stage with some tank adjustments to give me more fuel for adjustments... Honestly not sure what I would aim for but you are correct and my second stage didn\u0027t have nearly enough fuel to play with adjustments for rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I agree that mechjeb makes getting a VTOL back to the pad infinitely easier, if it wasn\u0027t for MechJeb I probably wouldn\u0027t be working on a VTOL entry for this challenge and going the spaceplane route as at least that I can manhandle easier when bringing it in for a landing. (that is not to say landing a large spaceplane isn\u0027t a challenge because it most certainly is, but its easier for me to make landing adjustments for than a VTOL IMO). Now I\u0027ve got parachutes on my VTOL for landing so its not exactly hard for me to land without mechjeb (deorbit burn and point parachute away from ground) but it is hard to figure out the exact landing trajectory to land near KSC. While I probably could work on getting an approximate reentry position to land near KSC with enough trial and error, I see no reason to torture myself with doing that over and over again. I\u0027m not a rocket scientist after all =P, which is probably why I love KSP. If you can do without MechJeb, then you have my respect as I don\u0027t think I could easily do without all the information that MechJeb provides, or some of the autopilot features (I don\u0027t use the autodock or the plane autopilots yet, and this was technically the first time I used the landing pilot, I hadn\u0027t needed it before this)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecha Pants","CreatedById":58006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T23:42:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing about piggyback payloads, I\u0027m learning that it\u0027s very important to mount them as far forward as possible, otherwise they lead to uncontrollable back-flipping as the CoM moves above and behind the CoL.

Did you know that cupolas have a dragginess number of 0.4, twice that of any other pod? I don\u0027t know what that means, but it sure did crash a lot of trial launches! I hate cupolas. Hate hate hate. The only thing I found that would work was to build a \u0022lampshade\u0022 shaped scaffold that dangled the cupolas around the rocket down near the center of mass, so they didn\u0027t drag the front of the rocket sideways and crash it. Then when I got the whole mess up to the station, the Alaskan Mosquito RCS tug was just a little bit too big around to place the cupolas onto their final location on the superstructure. Total fail. Cupolas are evil. I could only launch 4 at a time, plus some fuel. The launch mass was 30.745t, so sometimes drag is more significant than mass for this launch system, it seems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission 7:\u003C/strong\u003E This is the Same thing plus a strut attachment so the RCS tug can actually reach the right spot.

At 718 parts, it was starting to lag even on my desktop machine. The superstructure panels accounted for a lot of parts. If I had to do it again, I\u0027d want RTG\u0027s instead of all the small solar panels just for the lower part count. Ladders were the biggest sacrifice, so Kerbals have to use RCS to get around most places. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since I decided to go with a station shaped like an Archimedean solid, the complexity really got out of hand. Each panel is separately dockable, though most went up together with a support structure. The attempts to launch them as stacks of panels were hilarious slinky-shaped crashes. Everything that remotely involved a cupola found some way to be horrible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, scoring. It\u0027s too bad tonnage is such an overwhelming factor. I was going for complexity, and the mass kinda just happened as a side effect. Module count is the hardest part to figure out. There\u0027s maybe 20-ish separate parts that were moved and reconfigured during station construction, and over 50 separately dockable pieces.

Now, I have a question regarding the rules of this challenge as I have run into a game engine restraint. My rocket weighs 750t fueled up and requites ~500t of fuel. I have a fuel rover capable of hauling this much fuel to the rocket and filling via KAS (I know, too easy right?), but the issue is that the weight of the rover destroys all the wheels of the rover no matter the quantity of wheels present. I had 20\u002B on the final attempt, and it shattered wheels as soon as I moved forward. Since I really don\u0027t want to redesign an entire reusable station launcher system, is it permissible to Hyperedit the tanks of a smaller rover full multiple times to in turn fill the rocket?

Mine is similar, but a much more brute force approach. I have a rocket capable of getting 50t to 80km orbit, then a space tug moving it to the 120km orbit the station will reside in. The chutes were particularly fun to figure out how to repack, as there were about a million of them. However, it does mean that the deorbit burn is all the Delta-v I need to burn to land. To solve the issue, I just put a Mk2 Lander Can under each massive chute stack and assigned the single resident to EVA on landing to repack the 8 chutes around him.
