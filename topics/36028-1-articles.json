We got normal high-thrust, low Isp engines (typical rocket engines) then there\u0027s the low thrust, high Isp engines. And then we got the switchabl type like VASIMR. But is it possible for a rocket engine/ion thruster/nuclear engines/anything that can propel things into deep space and other planets to have a \u003Cstrong\u003Econsistently\u003C/strong\u003E high thrust \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E specific impulse?

Higher exhaust velocities require higher energies to accelerate those particles, and energy goes up as the square of velocity (E=1/2*mv\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E). Thrust is based on the force given by those particles, or momentum per given time (mv/t).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you want higher Isp, the energy required per particle goes up really fast. If you want high thrust, you have to accelerate a lot of those particles in a given time. So an engine with both high Isp and high thrust requires both a lot of energy and a way to give all that energy to the particles of propellant in a short time. So the power needed (energy/time) goes up very fast. Also, the temperature is proportional to energy, so you need very high temperatures to give high Isp (and a lot of material at very high temperatures to also give high thrust at the same time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically, you would need at least a nuclear reactor to generate high power like that. Even then, with a nuclear thermal rocket having a high TWR, the Isp would only be about 1000s (This is mainly limited by the temperatures of ~3000K needed, which are at the limit of what materials can withstand without melting). Nuclear pulse propulsion has an Isp of 10,000-100,000s because of the millions of degrees at the center of detonating nuclear bombs. Antimatter rockets can get up to maybe 1,000,000s Isp theoretically, but are not really practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is the fact that the more powerful a rocket becomes, the more energy can be unleashed by it, either purposefully or in case of an accident. An antimatter rocket that could bring 1000 tons to 10% of the speed of light packs almost the same energy as the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T20:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, the limiting factor is power consumption.
