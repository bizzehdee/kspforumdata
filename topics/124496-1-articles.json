It may be that you have already, I can\u0027t tell without seeing the markers in the SPH. Do you know how to show those? They have buttons in the bottom left of the SPH screen, next to where you select symmetry etc. If the blue CoL marker is slightly behind the yellow CoM marker, you\u0027re good. Given that your plane more or less flies itself (until it wants to change course!), your CoL/CoM relationship is probably ok already. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be a little more clear than I was in my last post, the fact that you can\u0027t easily roll your plane is because your only control surface is in line with your CoM. To roll, you need to impart upwards force on one wing, and downwards force on the other. If your only control surface is right in the middle of the plane, there\u0027s no way it can impart a different direction of force onto each wing. It does the same to each wing, so that control surface can only control your pitch, it can do nothing for roll. A control surface on each wing is the solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd tbh, the rudder is kind of a luxury, though I would still recommend it. The tailfin however, is essential, because it will greatly stabilise the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Belphegor","CreatedById":118918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T15:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell.. airodynamics might have failed in this thread but it sure managed to send my sides into orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etake a look at this gosnel,this is how i learned how to plane \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T15:39:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMajorGosnell, just ignore Tex_NL he is obviously mad about something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGojira and Belphegor both gave good advice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T15:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not mad about ANYTHING!

That control surface at the rear might work for pitch but your vertical stabilizers are quite small, I think you will need more. Optionally you can put Yaw on the vertical stabilizer (it\u0027s not required for flight). Finally to turn, you will roll the plane and pull up.
