I gave up on the Steam client (downloaded directly from Steam) about a year ago. I didn\u0027t know about gDebi and perhaps that would work. I believe some improvement has arrived for multiarch over the past year also. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found at the time that while installing 32 bit dependencies allowed Steam to run it was also causing havoc with the pre-existing 64 bit counterpart libraries and such. As my KSP purchase was directly from Squad (since just before the Steam version release?) and as KSP is my one and only game, I have nothing to really motivate me to get Steam working correctly. If Steam do a proper 64 bit version I will try again. Until then I can check out what\u0027s new on Steam with a browser just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me say, I cannot express enough my thanks sal_vager for your continuing and excellent assistance for linux users over the last ~2 years that I have been playing KSP. Your advice here on gDebi may be invaluable to someone who really needs to get Steam working.
