Probably not very helpful to you but I have no problems with chatterer so I just checked my system. I run kubuntu (so KDE) but I am assured that Mint is excellent so I am not suggesting you change. Looking at what sound stuff I have installed I am shocked to find that I have all of pulseaudio, alsa and phonon-gstreamer-backend!

With my limited understanding of how this mess all works together I am not sure what is being used by KSP but I think the phonon-gstreamer-backend is the channel that KSP has found to use.
