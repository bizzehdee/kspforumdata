So launching strait east puts you on the ecliptic. IRL, the axial tilt of Earth is 23 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope that the devs actually understood what they were doing with these things, and not that they just *thought* that the Milky Way should line up with the ecliptic. Certain things in this game (like how Duna\u0027s atmosphere extends into space for much less distance than Kerbin\u0027s- that\u0027s wrong, despite the low pressure and mass, Mars\u0027 atmosphere extends into space slightly further than Earth\u0027s atmosphere, owing to the low gravity) make me wonder if the devs really know their astronomy that well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-29T17:22:27Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2013 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Werwolf","CreatedById":38001,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T19:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Certain things in this game (like how Duna\u0027s atmosphere extends into space for much less distance than Kerbin\u0027s- that\u0027s wrong, despite the low pressure and mass, Mars\u0027 atmosphere extends into space slightly further than Earth\u0027s atmosphere, owing to the low gravity) make me wonder if the devs really know their astronomy that well.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErm.... it\u0027s not Mars, though.
