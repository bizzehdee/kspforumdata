It wasnt designed to use them. Also some craft desigs dont allow such chunky sepetrons to be installed. Id rather rely on the radial manifolds. I dont want to edit 900 parts either. THere should be a global config somewhere , just need the knowlegable person to find it for me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T02:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, you use mods.

The only reason is DOESN\u0027T happen (a minor but very important distinction) is because successful space programs expend a great deal of engineering brainpower and computing time to ensure it doesn\u0027t. Space Shuttles used Separatrons, essentially. Soyuz has a different method which I don\u0027t recall at the moment and am too lazy to go look up, but they do take active measures to make sure the strap-on boosters go \u0027out and away\u0027 rather than \u0027in and love tap\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeMeSiS","CreatedById":5379,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T14:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also spin to give discarded boosters some momentum away from your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T01:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NeMeSiS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NeMeSiS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can also spin to give discarded boosters some momentum away from your ship.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekinda like the \u0022bbq\u0022 roll?
