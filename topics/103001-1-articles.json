I don\u0027t need to press the space bar to start things, needyless to say this complicates more complex rocket designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had this problem a while back with not that many mods installed, but a restart of KSP solved that. But now it is back and restart does not solve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is one strange thing, it only affects liquid fuel engines. SRBs do wait till i press space. Also it affects all stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI revalidated the game files with steam and it found 3 files who where not correct. however, replacing those did not solve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personaly think this has nothing to do with a mod but as i have quite a lot of mods installed (wich only a few recently since the bug is shown)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the even more stranger thing, i reverted back to my latest stable mod install. Then this happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst test with rocket: All good, rocket engine waits till i press space. (loaded direktly at the launchpad)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond rocket, loaded from the VAB, engines start to fire as soon as the loading ends....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecould it be that the VAB has something to do with this ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed that the engines start as soon as the presence file is loaded, could this be broken ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso when i build a craft from scratch this behaviour does not occour. Only when i load some craft i build earlier. Also there not on every craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m totaly lost here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the craft file: With this the bug started to appear and only with this the bug is every time present: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=03302074608351353404\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=03302074608351353404\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk now it gets really crazy, if i switch the engine in the file above with the \u003Cstrong\u003Esame\u003C/strong\u003E engine the bug is gone, not autostart anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Player log does not show any errors....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny Ideas ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-30T23:32:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2015 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
