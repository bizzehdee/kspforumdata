It was my understanding that the bigger wing should give a larger lift; however, it seems to require a larger take-off speed, and the data from FAR seems to match this - both in the graphs and the stability derivatives giving a lower Cl (I understand to effectively be the lift) for the rectangular - 0.278 vs 0.369, despite being a larger area.

Why? Because you\u0027re relying on the control surfaces attached to the wing to take off, rather than a separate canard or horizontal tail. So when you switch to the rectangular wing, you have the control surfaces closer to the CoM, so they can\u0027t act on it as well. This is also the reason why you have trouble landing. Make the plane longer, add a separate surface for pitch control, make sure that the main gear are only just behind the CoM so that it can rotate well. The fact that you need a lower lift coefficient for flight at the same speed indicates that the wing is behaving as it should, but that the issue is elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor turning, I\u0027m assuming that you\u0027re rolling and then pitching up to turn; in that case, the problem is almost certainly that your vertical tail is too close to the CoM, so you have basically no yaw stability or damping at all.
