Basically, all solar satellites have their power output calculated at a fixed distance from the sun so that their power output can be inverse-square scaled relative to their distance from the sun. It seems, however, that the reactor/generator powered satellites are getting this behaviour too, meaning their power gets multiplied up as they get closer to the sun.

Aluminium-Oxygen minerals and Water/Water Ice. That\u0027s all well and good, some things can be found anywhere but plenty of things cannot, plenty of things are rare. In order to tackle problems like nuclear refueling, I needed to tackle making some kind of rare resources that would have varying abundance across the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to make a system that was basically infinitely extendable so I could create as many resources as I wanted with variable abundance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of nuclear material, what I need to detect resources is a gamma ray spectrometer (GRS). This sort of equipment has been used to measure the abundance of thorium on the Moon in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/95/Lunar_KREEP_concentrations.jpg/640px-Lunar_KREEP_concentrations.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022640px-Lunar_KREEP_concentrations.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all gives me something to aim for. I decided an image wasn\u0027t a bad way to interpret planetary resource information so I opened up MATLAB and fired up some kind of fractal (of the non-self referential sort) generation algorithm and started generating some maps. After a bit of tinkering, I generated this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MrXI4Rc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MrXI4Rc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis image doesn\u0027t look very exciting but it\u0027s a good way of storing logarithimically encoded data about resource availability. It is actually a map of thorium abundance on Kerbin. The greyscale represents the amount of Thorium, because my interpretation code is, in this case, log-scaled, only the very brightest parts actually represent significant quantities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also needed a way of connecting up this resource information to something within the game. I thought this kind of resource system something might be something other people might be interested in using (please let me know if you are interested!) to generate their own resources so I decided to try and make everything simple to use.
