Maximum power is about 7.25 Ec/s. This is achieved when the engine is running close to its maximum operating temperature of 2500 degrees. Once the engine is shut down, power output will gradually decrease but the engine will still produce power several hours after shutdown thanks to residual heat in the reactor core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adds a custom resource - UraniumDioxide. The LV-N has an internal storage that contains 50 units of UraniumDioxide. The engine needs this in order to produce heat. It cannot be refueled, so once the UraniumDioxide is depleted, the engine is useless. Consumes 0.00815 UraniumDioxide per 0.9 LiquidFuel. 50 units is enough to keep it running at full power for about an hour (but the real lifetime is longer because you can\u0027t run the engine at full power all the time or it\u0027ll overheat and explode). This will need to be tweaked if/when zero-thrust electricity generation is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat it doesn\u0027t do (yet):\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Produce power when the engine is not producing thrust.

Using an example Wikipedia cites, the Hiroshima nuke loss less than a gram of mass when it exploded (~63TJ of energy was supposedly released.) For scale, 89.9TJ (1 gram) of energy/power would let a high-end gaming PC drawing 1kw of power run for ~2850 YEARS straight. (Assuming my math is right, anyway...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah: negligible mass losses = no reason for a waste resource you can\u0027t do anything with = massless intake resource.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T06:38:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 06:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StahnAileron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spanier","CreatedById":57247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T16:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds good.

I\u0027ll have to edit things a bit as it still produces thrust at a temperature of 4 K, which is more than 16 K lower than the temperature of the fuel (assuming it\u0027s liquid hydrogen). I might scrap the stock thermal system integration and replace it with a scripted one as that would make things A LOT simpler and easier both for me and for the people who use the mod. The current system, being 100% physics based, is just way too unpredictable and difficult to control accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T11:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother status update: My GPU appears to have died and I\u0027ll be ordering a new one today or tomorrow.
