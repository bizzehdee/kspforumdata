The goal is to land on every landable body in the Kerbol system, no refueling, no ISRU. 1.0 brings new challenges by nerfing most engines across the board, bringing aero heating etc. Still, should be doable just fine with a bit of planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP version is 1.0.4. Mods used are transfer window planner and kerbal engineer redux. Parts, aero, etc. are all stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mothership has room for 5 kerbals with a comfy pressurised cabin. All the landers have stock science gizmos with them. Although this is a sandbox game, I\u0027ll be doing the science experiments just to demonstrate.

The mothership weighs 518 tons in orbit and has ludicrous amounts of delta-v which is a bit hard to calculate exactly, because parts of the payload get dropped along the way.

Once you have all the basics down (transfers, rendezvous, constant altitude landing, gravity assists, aerocapture) it\u0027s just a matter of combining the techniques to achieve an efficient enough mission. It\u0027s actually not that hard. I haven\u0027t completed one though (currently in Joolian system), so take this with a pinch of salt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T00:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERespect for doing this with full science.

Mainly related to the ion tug not having enough power and therefore TWR to perform necessary manouvers while in a moons SOI. It has the delta-v, I just underestimated the TWR needs of transfer manouvers, only considering them for landings. \u003Cp\u003EI should have enough delta-v even if I use the MS to perform the insertions at Laythe, Vall and Tylo. So far I have landed and returned from Laythe and Tylo, sitting at low Tylo orbit. The far lander is parked in low Vall orbit with not enough fuel to land. I discovered it could not survive Laythe aerocapture, so I separated it and redirected it to Vall. I need to refuel it with the MS, land on Vall, then continue to the smaller moons as planned. Most of the time I am at altitudes below 20km, so no time warp. Couple that with 0.01-0.1 TWR, and it takes a looooong time to perform manouvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-19T14:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2015 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Teutooni\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xendelaar","CreatedById":139535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T15:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour story inspired me to try and perform a manned return mission firm Eve from sea level.
