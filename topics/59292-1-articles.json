I replaced the retropack with a tiny RCS tank and three RCS ports at the bottom. The LES is not so realistic, but who cares? The launcher was 2 FL-800 tanks with an LV-45 on the bottom. It launched me to 150000 meters (After retro rocket burn; without, it takes you to 200000m) Then, I popped the chutes.. and then it exploded. 3 hours of work gone down the drain. Capsule is really realstic, almost better than Mulbin\u0027s. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E Any thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
