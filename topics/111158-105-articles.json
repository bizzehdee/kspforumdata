If a user is going way off the rails and spouting profanity (that\u0027s been caught by our filter or skirted around), report immediately. A good rule of thumb is that if you\u0027re not sure, report it. There\u0027s no penalty for simply making a report to bring something potentially actionable to the moderation staff\u0027s attention, and if nothing needs to be done with a report it\u0027s..... three mouse clicks away from being solved.\n\nPMs are generally more useful if you want to have a private discussion with a moderator about previous action, or raising your concerns in a more formal way. Like [@Vanamonde](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/) said, if it\u0027s not time-sensitive, you can send a PM.

Is that what you mean? In that case, I suppose the answer really depends on how doubtful you are that the post is ok.
