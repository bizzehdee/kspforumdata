I\u0027m a developer, and while they may have begun rolling their own multi-threaded implementation, it\u0027s doubtful. Physics is a very math / logic (when it comes to multithreaded) implementations. Ask anyone who has ever made a game engine from scratch, and they will tell you the physics part -- the part that makes the game act like real life -- is the most complex part, especially if you need to make it fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, the physics aspect is what determines whether your space ship blows up or lands, how far the ship goes down on its landing struts, and how fast you can go. Because the current implementation in the Unity engine, it can only do calculations in one core. This technology is antiquated at this point, but as the Unity Engine is used by hundreds -- if not thousands of games -- that don\u0027t need super fast math done ... it is probably very low on Unity\u0027s todo list. Now, I bet Squad could pay a hefty sum of money and make it happen -- or even do it in house -- but lets face it, there is a game to finish! However, if someone is already doing all the work, and they only need to pay a small sum of money, then hey, we all benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are the benefits? Well, for one, no more 15 minute realtime but 3 minute game time launches... and more importantly, a higher part count before hitting unbearable lag. If this guy\u0027s implementation is really 2.5x faster, then we could be looking at 2.5xish more parts ... meaning bigger ships, bases and stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T06:01:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease implement more optimizations.

(Physics is being calculated completly on the cpu in ksp/unity) if i am understanding the unity addon linked here it is an nvidia physx implimentation that would allow for moving the flops intensive part of physics calculations to the gpu instead (which is far more well suited for fast floating point operations) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn comparison.

But mostly ppl with modding addiction(like me) would have the most enjoyement from it(adressing more than 3.5gb memory, and yes im already using the texture compressor plugin).
