Where and how exactly do you get that science? I send a Kerbal down there with his EVA pack but he was killed before i reached the bottom since i collided with the walls, i did several EVA reports while falling but they were all from the ridge. What do i have to do to get the science from the sinkhole itself, especialy a surfacesample?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI though about letting someone down with a KAS rope, but the physicsrange is to low (i would loose my anchorpoint). Hoovering in there would be very hard but not impossible, that wouldnt get me a surfacesample, though. Im not sure if landing in there is possible since it had a sharp edge at the end, nothing flat. Did that change?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T22:29:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople have piled Kerbals at the bottom of the Mohole before, so you can land in the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wolfedg","CreatedById":58442,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T03:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to recall hearing that the hole was conical.
