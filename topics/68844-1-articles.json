The primary challenge was something that could be lifted into orbit in the first place, followed by getting it to Eve, which was a trial. Then of course landing safely, and returning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing vehicle has somewhere around 8,700 Delta-V and weighs about 125 tons at landing, about 118 at Eve liftoff (I put all the parachutes and landing gear on decouplers so I wouldn\u0027t have to lift them back into Eve orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Imgur album:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/2C0fb#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/2C0fb#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few highlights:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uwXIPR4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uwXIPR4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve landing. I used Mechjeb to land at the location, and sadly it did such a great job that it landed right on top of the rover I was using as a target (I had sent it ahead to find a good landing spot.) The fact that it survived the landing shocked me. The landing gear actually wasn\u0027t supposed to hold up the whole craft, it was just supposed to cushion the impact on the girder landing struts. As it turned out, the rover was holding up much of the weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TiVYeAt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TiVYeAt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI almost couldn\u0027t get back on the ladder because the rover was interfering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HP5rqzh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HP5rqzh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff from Eve.

I had to use MechJeb ascent guidance just to keep the thing pointed right, and even then I had to manually correct it during launch. It just got into wild oscillations and went out of control otherwise, even with MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iOFT79l.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iOFT79l.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedocked with transfer stage for the return home.
