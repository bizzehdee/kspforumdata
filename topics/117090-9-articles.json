Likely won\u0027t get too much done texture wise this week (other than the unwrap, AO bake, and shadow/light bakes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayed around with them for a bit last night (the IVAs, at least the LC3-IVA). They are fairly usable in the stock configuration -- the landing view \u0027from the seat\u0027 isn\u0027t the greatest, but you can double-click on the window to view from a \u0027nose-to-the-glass\u0027 perspective, with included landing instrument cluster (speed, alt, navball). All the rest of the stock info-props are available and visible. It is about as usable as most other stock IVAs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the RPM-enabled IVA is -very- usable (perhaps even enjoyable?), even for an info-nut like myself; having all of the orbital stats available is great. It becomes a bit more of an \u0027instruments only\u0027 affair, but given the functional usefulness of the MFDs, it works out quite well. I also have included a non-cheaty external camera in the pod for use as a \u0027landing camera\u0027 (e.g. it stays close to the view that would be afforded by humans looking out the windows or by a simple hull-mounted external camera). Works quite well for LC3 setups, and acceptably when the LC3 pod is used on LC5 tanks. Between the camera and the rest of the instruments, you have more than enough info for basic landing or rendezvous operations. Even the scientist station is fully equipped, functional, and usable for landing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what I\u0027ve done so far is only scratching the surface of RPM use. I really don\u0027t have time (or want/need) to dig in too much deeper for the advanced functions (e.g. custom screen setups, more functional/clickable props, animated props) - but they do exist if someone else had the inclination to do an overhaul / update. Unity is free to download and setup, as are KSP PartTools. Those are -all- the tools that are needed to do prop-setups in IVAs, so I certainly don\u0027t need to be the only one working on them (especially seeing as how I\u0027m not even really interested in them). Yes, I will be including -basic- RPM-IVA support out of the box. But if you want more than the basic experience -do it yourself (or find someone else to do it for you, but it wont be me!)-; there is no excuse other than laziness; Unity/PartTools are not that hard to figure out, and you do not need the development assets to design an IVA (everything you need for IVA work is in the KSP GameData folder).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the note of included external cameras -- how many / where should they be positioned? I\u0027m currently only placing a single one near the main windows of the pods, facing mostly downwards (about 30\u0027 forward from a straight downward view, the straight-down angle is still in the view). A second one is automatically included in the docking port, so there is no need for a docking-port specific camera. And of course you can always install/create a mod that adds the simple radially-attachable external camera parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I don\u0027t really see any other camera points being -needed- in the base setup.

However if someone has a specific suggestion, please let me know. I have no problem with giving it a name if something awesome comes up. As to the current suggestions -- a Scorpio, to me, is a piece of siege equipment (a small-ish, higher-tech type of ballista). And Triton, in my mind at least, has generally been associated with water (idk, I guess it almost fits if you equate sea-faring to star-faring/space-faring). If I were to pick something, it would probably be more from the Norse pantheon, rather than the Greek or Roman. Honestly though, I\u0027ve tossed around a ton of different possible names internally, and nothing seems to really \u0027stick\u0027.

Perhaps you had your boosters on the wrong side(s)? -- Anyway, I\u0027m considering putting it at a 45\u0027 offset, so that it will still be visible when using 4 boosters.

If anything they should have slightly -lower- mass (and thus better TWR); if engines didn\u0027t increase in actual efficiency as you went up the tech-tree, why even have a tech-tree? (unless I forgot to put the stats in the config files; should be that the 3x engine cluster weighs 20t). Hmm... looking at the configs, I must have missed a few values. Yes, they are supposed to be fairly heavy (20/30/40t for the 3-4-5 engine clusters). Probably still a bit more tweaking to be done as I finalize the capabilities of the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEngine Balance\u003C/strong\u003E -- Yes, the 3x engine cluster is intended to be used for a \u0027light\u0027 first stage, or custom heavy upper stage. As such it has -slightly- higher ISP than the dedicated lifter engines, but also will have lower thrust-per-nozzle than the others. There -should- already be a bottom node on the engine (and an auto-fairing); if not, there -will- be. Am also investigating the balance/need of a 5m 2x nozzle engine cluster for dedicated upper stage use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBooster Orientation\u003C/strong\u003E -- Thx, will look into it (rather, will keep it in mind when exporting the nose-cone parts for mesh-switching), likely just exported it in the wrong orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESC-B-CM Ablator\u003C/strong\u003E -- Huh. Strange. Right now it is using a custom ablator module with mesh-specific darkening capabilities. With no (or an incorrect) mesh specified in the config. So, technically, -nothing- should be getting darkened. If it -is- getting darkened or changed, please let me know and I\u0027ll fix it (or at least look into it) (I didn\u0027t notice in my play sessions over the weekend, but for some reason my re-entries are always at night). (this should be easy to test by removing all ablator from the CM in the VAB and launching it; as the shading is based on current/max value of ablator rather than any actual heating receieved, if it -is- blackening things, it should be fully-black with all ablator removed.) Anyway, it is -supposed- to just blacken the heat-shield mesh; however as the heat-shield is already black, I had decided to disable the shading/darkening entirely for that part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, thanks for the feedback / ideas / info \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Will def. be using some of those reference images when doing the fuel-tank parts.

Hope to have this cleaned up/finished up later this evening for some initial testing; will hopefully allow me to finalize the geometry of the lifter parts this week and get them ready for texturing (and real testing, balancing, etc).
