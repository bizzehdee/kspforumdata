My main issue is overdependence on it, where you can\u0027t use a mod without it. In some cases that makes sense, B9 Aerospace really benefits from it and the KSO Shuttles would be much harder to load without the in-VAB animation control. I start having issues with it as soon as someone makes a stock part revamp and then says you need another mod for it to work. It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t like mods, (I\u0027m a mod creator, for goodness\u0027 sake) it\u0027s that too much reliance on them can result in a burnout from too much content, something I have struggled with before. Firespitter is also starting to go down the road of Romfarer\u0027s Lazor mod in that there\u0027s so much functionality in the plugin that isn\u0027t used when a mod uses one module out of the whole plugin for a very minor improvement in usefulness on one part.
