Like you need first do a pressure scan (or earn some points or score using it) tobe able to research advaced parachutes, or that you need fist to take a surface sample to be able to research heavy legs\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T21:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion science points should be dropped completely and the whole tech tree should be driven this way. But that\u0027s just my perspective looking at the game in its current state. W don\u0027t know what\u0027s the devs\u0027 exact plan for the final Career mode and it will most likely be more complex than it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
