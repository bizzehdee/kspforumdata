I would like to expand the Mission Controller Extended research tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to introduce Mission Level Unlocks. I would set up a few levels of missions that mission builders can make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo say level 1 is normal missions we all play now... Kinda low paying normal missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel 2 would be Military Contracts.. (or maybe goverment contracts) These are meant to be more high paying levels.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel 3 would be say Civilian Contracts. (even more expensive)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this could either work 1 or two ways. These could be just level unlocks.. So when a mission maker builds a mission he could say its a level 2 mission.. Give it a pretty good payout.. Or whatever reason he does not want in available at first.. So this way its totally Mission Maker idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr the 2nd idea could be an increase to mission payouts. So Level 2 could be a 10% increase. And level 3 could be another 10% increase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe a combination of both ideas.. Unlocks and mission payout increases.. Now I totally thinking that these types of research should cost easy 1000 Science points to unlock.. And maybe the 2nd one would be 1500 points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShoot me some ideas..

But I have mentioned many times to Mission authors that Docking Goals should be by themselves in a separate goal. There is no way around the way KSP works with Vessel IDs. If you dock with a vessel the vessel ID changes. And if it changes to the wrong ID (doesn\u0027t take the Original vessel ID) the mission goal won\u0027t be complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the goals are seperate then you have a higher chance of not running into that problem. Because the Docking Goal is a separate Goal From the others. If together, then MCE is checking the IDS of every goal in that SubMissionGoal. Its a pain in the ass, but I have tried a thousand different ways around this.. And they all cause just as many problems. Even Knobody had this issue and he was trying to find a way around it. Until KSP changes the way this works in the actual game. Its going to be a problem. If they must keep the Goals together then they need to use either the Special field which turns off the Vessel IDs saving for that Goal (but causes the more then 1 docking port bug) or they can use vesselIndependent which doesn\u0027t save any of that goal to file and any vessel can complete it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-01T13:11:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2013 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyd","CreatedById":73520,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T14:43:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is no science objectives on those at all..

In the old days you could launch a vessel in Flight mode, or disabled mode and after launch switch modes back to Normal Flight mode. When you did this you could finish missions with this vessel. (and in process cheat and pay 0 for vessels)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new update released this week totally killed that exploit. Now when you launch a vessel in Test Mode or Disabled they are Labled as FLAGGED.. You even get a warning about this on the Main MCE window telling you this. (also tells you what mode your in). Once a vessel is flagged.. You can never, ever use it with a mission.. forever.. No matter how many times you switch out of Flight mode to Test mode.. If its flagged, No missions for that vessel. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso remember that if you say... Do mission 2 with a vessel. Finish the 1st set of goals with this vessel. But you crash and revert KSP to VAB before finishing the last goal (in this case landing). When you launch your 2nd vessel (and this is something I want to fix) it now has a new Vessel ID. Your still in mission 2, and the first goal was done with vessel ID #1.. (that is recorded and saved in .sp file) when you try to finish Goal 2 with vessel 2. It now has a different Vessel ID.. When MCE checks the IDs with The first goals, they do not match. And you can\u0027t finish the last goal with a Different vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way around this is to edit the .sp file a delete the Goals for that mission.
