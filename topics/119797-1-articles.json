We have discussed in the past glactic black holes. These black holes absorb matter and belch plasma and x-rays from their poles that rip the gas in galaxies ejecting it into intergalactic space. A collection of radio, visible, infrared telescopes have spotted the re-energization of a electron rich gas cloud that was was produced when the bowsock created from the merging of two galactic clusters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T16:16:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know enough about cluster physics (especially hot intracluster gas) to say many useful things.
