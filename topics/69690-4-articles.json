Also when Jool\u0027s moons get biomes, you might be quite happy to set up a small science station and transmit rather than having to spend a few years Hohmann transferring all that science back to Kerbin, though this would mean you would have to revisit any given biome several times to maximize your science return (but what is wrong with that?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is now I found it useful in the case of Minmus or the Mun, you can reuse a super minimalist lander to hit all the biomes, clean out the experiments at the lab after each surface sortie, EVA a kerbal to pack all of the science into a capsule, and then return the capsule back to Kerbin for a huge science payoff!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T04:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem is, when the title of the thread is \u0022The mobile processing lab is terrible\u0022 instead of \u0022I cannot find information on how to use the mobile processing lab on the wiki,\u0022 we are unable to come to that intelligent conclusion.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not deny that the title of the thread could have been better chosen, but a \u0022constructive\u0022 suggestion must be sensible.
