He is fully rigged, including a full facial blendshape setup. He is currently textured for VRay, but now that Renderman Non-Commercial is out I plan to convert the materials to Renderman.\n\nSoftware used:\n\nMaya, vray, photoshop, mudbox, nuke\n\n![KSP04.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12773495/KSPImages/KSP04.jpg)\n\n![KSP01.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12773495/KSPImages/KSP01.jpg)\n\n![KSP02.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12773495/KSPImages/KSP02.jpg)\n\n![KSP03.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12773495/KSPImages/KSP03.jpg)\n\n![Shot1.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12773495/KSPImages/Shot1.jpg)\n\nThe jet pack control arms are rigged and unfold like they should.\n\n![Shot2.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12773495/KSPImages/Shot2.jpg)\n\nAll the knobs and buttons are there.\n\n![KSP_0000_Layer%207.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12773495/KSPImages/KSP_0000_Layer%207.jpg)\n\nHere is his face controls. Smiles, frowns, open close, blinks, puckers, everything a character needs to emote and do basic dialogue. Emoting without eyebrows is very difficult.\n\n![EarlyJebRender3.jpeg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12773495/KSPImages/EarlyJebRender3.jpeg)\n\nThe lights on the helmet can be aimed with a controller.\n\nSo there it is. I hope you like it. I would be interested to hear what you would like to see him do, he\u0027s all ready for animating. \n\nThere are a few limitations to keep in mind with your suggestions though: No longer than 10 seconds, no dynamics (liquids, smoke, cloth) I can do some subtle dust and smoke effects in post-production like a puff of dust as he walks on the mun or the jet stream from his jetpack. But no crazy splash down shots or big explosions ( I know...KSP is all about the explosions).\n\nIf I have enough time, and I really like the idea, I might just make it happen."},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T00:40:43Z","Content":"Awesome work!
