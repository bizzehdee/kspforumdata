That isn\u0027t between them, that is each!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso 34 MegaNewtons of thrust to lift a 2.3 Kilotonne spacecraft may not be overkill, but I\u0027m not sure there is a good way to replicate it in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if we use 7 of the new quad-engine boosters, The diameter is wider than that of the Saturn V, but the thrust would be only 22.4 MegaNewtons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the Saturn V was 10 meters wide. (and you thought 5-meter nodes were huge!) and had a thrust/node of 528.90625. That is better than any liquid-fueled rocket in KSP stock. (Bi-engine booster with built-in fuel: 500, Mainsail: 375, Quad-engine booster: 355.56, KR-2L advanced engine: 277.78, LV-T30: 225, R48-7S: 120) Additionally, circles don\u0027t stack 100% efficiently For example, one can only fit 7 1.25-meter nodes in a 3.75-meter node, despite 3.75-meter nodes having fully 9 times the area. At the very best, one can achieve 90.7% efficiency or so. This means that replicating the thrust of a Saturn V requires a significantly lwider rocket than even a Saturn V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way, with engine clipping, that this can be done without overheating everything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if one considers the SpaceX vehicles, this gets even more problematic. Not only are they using virtually the same node size as KSP ARM engines and tanks (3.66 meter), but they still have managed to squeeze 9 Merlin 1-Ds into a single 3.66-meter node for a lift-off thrust of 5.85 MegaNewtons (Granted, it is at 282s ASL Isp, so its not terribly efficient). We can put just 3200 in a slightly larger space. KSP engines just don\u0027t seem to be designed for high thrust per area, do they?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-10T22:41:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2014 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T22:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need as much thrust in KSP because things are scaled down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need even more thrust, you might want to try the stock rebalance project (link in my sig), the quad SLS engine has thrust bumped to 4000kN.
