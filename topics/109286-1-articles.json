One tiny example: I almost just sold some of my current science in the Admin building. via Research Rights Sellout. The game told me I would get 503.215 funds for 12 science. Since I read it as 503,215 instead of 503.215 it seemed like a much better deal than it actually was. The problem is that the . and the , look very similar -- especially when followed by three more numbers. In several places the Admin Bldg uses three decimal-place-accuracy where it is not only unneeded, but can be misinterpreted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple Solution: when you list the rewards, limit the display to 1 decimal place accuracy. Changing it to \u0022503.2\u0022 funds for 12 science, would have little to no downside, and would be harder to misinterpret, especially among the four-eyed crowd. As a writing professor once said: \u0022If it can be misunderstood, it will be misunderstood. Try to write something that can not be misunderstood.\u0022 Anyway, I know this isn\u0027t a huge deal, but it should at least be really easy to polish up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T06:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis makes total sense, and I agree with everything you said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T07:06:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Apparently this problem is relevant only for cultures where comma is used as a thousand delimiter.
