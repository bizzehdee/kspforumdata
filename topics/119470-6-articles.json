For two reasons. Firstly, UB40 are the single worst band in the history of music. Secondly, a musician who actually cares about the art would not have \u0027selling records\u0027 as their primary aim. What they are is business men, not musicians/artists. \u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, your post made me think of a few points points. I agree myself that they are not a very good band but secondly they never said it was their primary aim. Another point is that Squad are not artists but software developers who are in the business of selling a game, being they are also primarily businessmen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a couple of recent news announcements from Squad I think the way to influence them to do what we want is to make them think it will hurt profits to NOT do it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI notice you didn\u0060t actually disagree with anything in my post, I didn\u0060t even call them a band and in fact you agreed that they were in the music business as businessmen. What they said was that the reason they were in the music *business*, rather than just making music for the sake of art, was to sell records. If they were only concerned with the art they would not have started on the road of selling records, in a similar way if Harvester only cared about making his game about \u0060little green men\u0060 for art/himself etc we would not have even known about it. Instead he started on the road of making KSP into a business and like the universally despised UB40 he didn\u0060t do that to NOT sell copies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last point was, it was supposed to be a humorous/witty quote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen did everyone around here lose their sense of humour?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMyself I could not care less whether KSP can be implemented on a Wii-u, a PS4 or an Xbone. I have net been made angry by the less than perfect Mac version and I have not been driven into a frenzy of angry posting about Linux having a 64 bit client. The 3rd party team developing KerbalEDU does not affect my day much either and the EDU version actually has features I would like in the standard client.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am actually happy they decided to not replace the Devnotes with the announcement this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is vastly improved since I first started playing and there are signs it will continue to improve. If modding becomes easier and the API allows more access then removing the memory ceiling is really all that is needed and that looks likely.
