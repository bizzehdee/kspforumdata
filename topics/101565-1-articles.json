I hate Invision boards. I frequent another vBulletin board that has quite the range of themes (like over 10), and they never crashed. Of course, I\u0027ve only been a member on that board for 14 years, so it\u0027s not like I have a lengthy history there or anything. Forum crashes are usually a pebcak error. I also much prefer darker colors, because after a while it (the lighter color) does affect my eyes."},{"CreatedByName":"Fueniker S.","CreatedById":89507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T02:50:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i also much prefer darker colors, because after a while it (the lighter color) does affect my eyes.\n\ni\u0027m not alone!!!

It\u0027s unfortunate that it isn\u0027t an option. Reddit (or RES anyway) has a white-on-black night theme that is easily 1000 times easier to read than this forum.
