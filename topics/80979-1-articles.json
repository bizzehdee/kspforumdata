Im looking for some guidance on which places I would need to change around for this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrimarily, one of the goals will be to reduce the overall number of biomes on kerbin, minmus, and mun to 3 each. (this would likely also include increasing the science multiplier of those (not sure how science mult works). This I expect to be the hardest part, and to some extent I can just.. not go to other biomes if that is how it must be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, similarly important goal - I want to generally simplify science. By this I mean make any science recovered give 100% of the available science, and any science transmitted via a lab to *also* give 100%. I think that part is easy enough, should just be modifying sciencedefs? I am not sure where transmit value is though. (and what is this datascale value?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
