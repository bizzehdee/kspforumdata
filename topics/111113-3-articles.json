I mean, we\u0027ve seen some of the lake but not a whole lot.\n\nWith a combination of radar and other techniques we have a pretty good idea of what\u0027s down there to the extent that scientists can predict the weather there. \n\nOnce again you are making giant leaps in logic. Just because something is possible within the boundaries of physics, it doesn\u0027t mean it is in the slightest bit likely. I refer you to Occam\u0027s razor - while not a law as such it is a useful tool in science for dismissing more outlandish ideas. Which is more probable - that the Earth is being visited by extraterrestrials, or that everyday phenomena are responsible for what people misinterpret as extraterrestrials? \n\nYou are basing all of this on eyewitness accounts which are notoriously unreliable and cannot be taken seriously as scientific evidence. People\u0027s minds are incredibly easily manipulated and the memory is nowhere near as clear as we like to think it is. Did you know, for instance, that there are spikes in the numbers of UFO sightings in the years that *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* and *Independence Day* were released? Spooky huh? Now, I could make some wild assumptions about that. I could say that aliens were listening in to us and specifically chose those years to reveal themselves to people because they thought people would accept them better or something, or maybe that the films were actually documentary evidence of aliens from those years! But it is far simpler to assume that the films being released caused the idea of aliens to leak into the public subconscious and result in more people linking things they may not be able to explain to that concept. \n\nYes, we should investigate the unexplained, that\u0027s what science is about, but making wild guesses about alien technology under the protective cloud of \u0027how could we possibly know anything about them!\u0027 is frankly ridiculous. There is not a scrap of hard evidence for extraterrestrial visits to Earth, yet there are decades of research into psychology and centuries into the world around us that easily explain the majority of \u0027sightings.\u0027 Probably there are some which are caused by unconventional means, but to leap to it being aliens, and to from that to make up wild theories about the aliens\u0027 origins, their technology and their motives is doubly ridiculous.

There\u0027s not a shred of solid evidence beyond easily faked photographs and eyewitness testimonies. The distances and energies involved are so vast that the prospect of them arriving here and not leaving substantial evidence behind is utterly untenable. Either they travel incredibly quickly, either at close to lightspeed or at superluminal velocities via something like warp drive, or they have mastered generation ships or long-term suspended animation and travel slowly. Either way, they\u0027d be detectable. As has been pointed out before stealth in space is pretty much completely impossible. Any spacecraft would be much warmer than the majority of the space behind it as seen from Earth. That\u0027s just how the laws of physics work. To make the \u0027aliens are visiting us\u0027 hypothesis (if you can even call it that) work you need to make astounding leaps of logic and pretty much say that the laws of physics that we know of are wrong, or at least can be circumvented. \n\nJust apply Occam\u0027s razor please, people. There is plenty of evidence for phenomena here on earth than could be misinterpreted as ET sightings. There is ZERO evidence of intelligent life on other worlds.

I\u0027m not saying you should accept every case as fact just because they\u0027re trained observers. I\u0027m simply saying they\u0027re more credible.

You may have been looking for God and claimed not to have found Him, but what would you say to someone who was not intending to find God and yet did? The same applies to angels and demons. Heck, you\u0027re convinced that the phenomena you observed were \u0022ghosts\u0022 and \u0022aliens\u0022, but what if someone were to tell you that you were actually observing spiritual entities? Such as angels, demons, or even deities? I\u0027ve certainly heard countless claims both ways. I can explain many of these things through natural phenomena such as sleep paralysis, but I can\u0027t explain them all. Personally, I always raise an eyebrow of skepticism whenever I hear of \u0022oogie-boogie\u0022 claims such as these, but as scientists, we are supposed to be open minded.\n\nI already addressed this. In my post. That you quoted.\n\nI realize the paradox of this situation, which is why it\u0027s hard for me to say those things. I am NOT a person of faith. Yet my belief in aliens and ghosts is do largely to personal experiences. We have a word for this: \u0022faith.\u0022\n\nIt is strange that I myself cannot bring myself to employ the same logic I use for everyday things (just science and logic in general) for things like aliens and ghosts, and yet I also cannot bring myself to employ the same faith for ghosts and aliens for things like religion.\n\nI am aware of this paradox.
