I could say that aliens were listening in to us and specifically chose those years to reveal themselves to people because they thought people would accept them better or something, or maybe that the films were actually documentary evidence of aliens from those years!

There is not a scrap of hard evidence for extraterrestrial visits to Earth, yet there are decades of research into psychology and centuries into the world around us that easily explain the majority of \u0027sightings.\u0027 Probably there are some which are caused by unconventional means, but to leap to it being aliens, and to from that to make up wild theories about the aliens\u0027 origins, their technology and their motives is doubly ridiculous.
