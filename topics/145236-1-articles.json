(What a guy!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have now come to the point in my Career game where I start missions to the planets, which take years to complete. If you do all these missions sequential, they will take decades if not centuries to complete. Do you care about that at all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI considered to launch some easy missions (e.g. Minmus plant-a-flag) while my guys were on their way to Duna, but finally decided to put that Minmus mission on hold, so that it doesn\u2019t hurt me as much if I have to load an earlier save game because I screwed up the design for the Duna mission. I may do parallel missions if I have more confidence in my designing skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u2019s your take on this?
