(Note also in the background one side of what is probably the most insane rover ever made.)\n\n![683CB48C9593D31ABDAE42DBD044CAE6D1AEE5C4](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447328853201980974/683CB48C9593D31ABDAE42DBD044CAE6D1AEE5C4/)\n\nShe is as close to the door as one can get.\n\nThe door handle is just above her eyes and out of easy reach of her hand. The door looks to be between 5-6 US feet high, too small for use by the average range of human heights, but WAY too big for Kerbals.\n\nSo, who, or rather, WHAT works here?\n\nDun dun dun.\n\nRescaling all the building exterior artwork to keep them the same size but with more floors is something the team may want to toy with if they get bored.\n\n(Trivial bug side note. It is possible to fall through the ground in the Level 3 R\u0026D complex and wind up standing on the original ground level the complex is slightly raised above. Walking out of the complex is easy though, so it is not important. Presumably another Physics engine issue?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T07:04:51Z","Content":"Nice catch."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T17:28:03Z","Content":"I recall bac9 mentioning this at some point; apparently the buildings were scaled (uniformly, so everything including doors scaled) after creation, rather than being recreated at the new desired size."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:05:55Z","Content":"I don\u0027t mind.
