It is something to bear in mind when you\u0027re building the thing, it\u0027s not like getting a rocket into orbit, you\u0027re really going to have to know what you\u0027re about to get a working space plane. If you actually manage it, you\u0027re a hero and they\u0027ll build statues of you in Kerbaltown. Maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as bsalis said, sounds like you\u0027re making the standard early attempt at SSTO mistakes. However many intakes, lifting surfaces and control surfaces you thought you needed when you started this thing, you\u0027ll almost certainly need more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also worth bearing in mind that even if you design the perfect SSTO there is still a lot to do when flying it. But I\u0027m a rubbish SSTO pilot, so I\u0027ll say no more about it. Suffice to say, there\u0027s more to it than just flying up in a straight line, which is how I used to do it when I first tried it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
