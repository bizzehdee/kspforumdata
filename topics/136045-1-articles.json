They\u2019re big dreams, and I don\u2019t have any problems with people dreaming. Mars One, let them dream. That\u2019s not the delusion. The delusion is thinking that SpaceX is going to lead the space frontier. That\u2019s just not going to happen, and it\u2019s not going to happen for three really good reasons: One, it is very expensive. Two, it is very dangerous to do it first. Three, there is essentially no return on that investment that you\u2019ve put in for having done it first. So if you\u2019re going to bring in investors or venture capitalists and say, \u0022Hey, I have an idea, I want to put the first humans on Mars.\u0022 They\u2019ll ask, \u0022How much will it cost?\u0022 You say, \u0022A lot.\u0022 They\u2019ll ask, \u0022Is it dangerous?\u0022 You\u2019ll say, \u0022Yes, people will probably die.\u0022 They\u2019ll ask, \u0022What\u2019s the return on investment?\u0022 and you\u2019ll say \u0022Probably nothing, initially.\u0022 It\u2019s a five-minute meeting. Corporations need business models, and they need to satisfy shareholders, public or private.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA government has a much longer horizon over which it can make investments. This is how it\u2019s always been. And the best example, I think, is Christopher Columbus. That was not a private mission. There were some private monies in the public monies that were used, but basically the mission statement was established by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, and they said go plant the flag wherever you land. There\u2019s hegemonistic motivation, and it wasn\u2019t specifically military at the time, but Spain certainly had an armada to back up their land grabs. Only after that, only after Christopher Columbus comes back and says, \u0022Here are the people that I found, here are the foods, and here are the trade winds,\u0022 only then does the Dutch East India Trading Company come in and make a buck off of it. They didn\u2019t have to make that first investment. The risks were quantified, the cost was well understood, and the return on investment was calculable. That is a recurring model in the history of our civilization, and I don\u2019t see any reason why that would be any different from advancing a frontier such as that in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what is SpaceX doing now? They\u2019re bringing cargo back and forth to the space station, as should have been happening decades ago. You don\u2019t need NASA to move cargo, you get NASA to do the things that have never been done before. And then when they do it enough and there\u2019s a routine, then you farm it off to private enterprise, which can actually do it more efficiently than you can, and presumably make a buck for having done so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=39922.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=39922.0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/24/9792854/neil-degrasse-tyson-interview-delusions-of-space-enthusiasts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.theverge.com/2015/11/24/9792854/neil-degrasse-tyson-interview-delusions-of-space-enthusiasts\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are a few posts from NASASpaceFlight:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHOwever, not investors.
