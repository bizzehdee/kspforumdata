Since the save stores the unlocked nodes there seems to be some potential for awkwardness if it doesn\u0027t happen this way.\n\nI am thinking of trying a different tech tree, one which better handles some of the large-size tanks and engines, and i wonder if I need to set up a second copy of KSP just to use a different tech tree without breaking anything. That looks to be the only safe option."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T11:49:28Z","Content":"New Tech Tree = New save. I had this problem when I installed KSP Interstellar. What I did was add up all the science I had earned (unlocked nodes \u002B whatever you have left) and write down my funds and reputation. Started a new savegame and transferred everything through a mix of savefile editing and hyperedit. Worked quite well, although it was a hell of a lot of work ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nEdit: Oh, and to answer your question, the tech tree loads once, when you create a savefile. At least it used to, someone correct me if I am wrong.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T12:24:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 12:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"}]}
