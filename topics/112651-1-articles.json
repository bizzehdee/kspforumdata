Since the save stores the unlocked nodes there seems to be some potential for awkwardness if it doesn\u0027t happen this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am thinking of trying a different tech tree, one which better handles some of the large-size tanks and engines, and i wonder if I need to set up a second copy of KSP just to use a different tech tree without breaking anything.

I had this problem when I installed KSP Interstellar. What I did was add up all the science I had earned (unlocked nodes \u002B whatever you have left) and write down my funds and reputation. Started a new savegame and transferred everything through a mix of savefile editing and hyperedit. Worked quite well, although it was a hell of a lot of work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh, and to answer your question, the tech tree loads once, when you create a savefile.
