It\u0027s the best looking ship I made so far, I usually go for function first then looks. I broke my rules and this is the beauty I came up with. Simple and elegant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I used to make heavy multi-layered armored ships cause they are prone to being cut in half in the middle. Now all of those former ship designs are obsolete because for the (885) partcount it has compared to the weapons it could carry (12) I say this is better and it cannot easily be cut in half even if the weapons phase through the armor (not sure if there\u0027s other weapons out there that I don\u0027t know of). I used to have 1200\u002B part ship that only carries eight (80) Tirepedoes. Those Nuclear engines using liquid fuel is amazing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I tested it with my own Kraken Tirepedoes though, so far it can take five (5) shots and still keep functioning unlike my previous ships that could take only 3 shots (don\u0027t laugh at Tirepedoes, they are lethal weapons originally developed by me just ask zekes and panzer1b.
