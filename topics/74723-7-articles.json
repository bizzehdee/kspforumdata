Visibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow should we treat the visibility of of your ships? I have 3 ideas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. In order to keep your troops \u0022invisible\u0022 to radar aka other corps from seeing them you have to launch a signal bouncing satellite that is visible to everyone that would make your guys invisible. I was thinking 1 per 2 planets round down minimum 1. That way people can take it down, but as long as they are up, no one will know about how many troops you have or where they are. Adds surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The only way you can know about troops is seeing them, and to even know how many ships they have, you have to keep track of the ones lost in battle. Everyone sees you launch a vessel. You can\u0027t hide that on kerbain. Again adds surprise tactic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Everyone is visible. Go plan and simple, no additional rules or complications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I was thinking of doing something to the tune of, if you catch a kerbal in a super carrier, or carrier or some super important kerbal that we all would be required to have one of, you would be able to hear all of the plans that a person makes and order they issue for 1 turn. What do you guys think? Kind of like temporarily crack the encryption with their \u0022given\u0022 knowledge?
