I made a couple of tweaks, mostly with the number and placement of small science equipments. The largest change I made by far is that I added six solid rocket boosters to the external tanks as a \u0022stage one\u0022 to give the craft a little more oomph getting back into orbit. I\u0027ve tried it several times with only the external tanks and it just doesn\u0027t have enough juice. Even when I take off from near Olympus, in the peaks region of the planet, I can\u0027t even make it halfway around before falling back into atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo anyway, I added the boosters. Only now, when I land, the legs keep clipping into the surface (I landed in the shallows this time) and then blasting out again so my craft keeps shaking violently back and forth as first one side, and then the other clip into and bounce back out of the surface. I didn\u0027t have this issue without the boosters, but I am reluctant to believe that\u0027s the only reason this is happening, since they don\u0027t interact with the ground or the landing struts at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else had this happen before, and how did you fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027ve tried to add the craft file but I can\u0027t get it to work. I\u0027m not sure if the file is too big (seems less likely?) or if I\u0027m just doing it wrong (seems more likely).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peteletroll","CreatedById":144573,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-05T22:37:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-06T00:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntry either with more or with less landing legs. those are usually the culprit when your craft bounces on the surface\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-06T10:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that the extra mass of those boosters, combined with Eve\u2019s high gravity (1.7g I think) is overloading the landing legs and causing the suspension to become unstable.
