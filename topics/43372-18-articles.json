It takes people who have extreme personalities and are therefore entertaining, something which would be extremely ill advised for any space mission. A good portion of reality shows have scripted events that make it more entertaining.

Also, a large number of reality shows \u0022change it up\u0022 over time, which is something fairly hard to do in this case. There can be no competition, which is one of the more popular additions to the common reality show. Literally the entire reality show would be people interacting with each other in everyday life with almost no possible outside variables.
