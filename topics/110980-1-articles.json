The Dunian surface gravity is 2.94 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 vs 9.31 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 at 16 km over Kerbin (3.2 times lower).\n\nWhen a plane flies, four forces are applied to it:\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C6\u2019gravity *mg* (pointing down)\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C6\u2019thrust *Ft* (pointing forward)\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C6\u2019lift *Fl* ~ *v*\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 (pointing up)\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C6\u2019drag *Fd* ~ *v*\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 (pointing backwards)\n\nTheir sum equals zero when flying at constant speed and altitude.\n\nIf I replace the Ion engines with Spark rocket engines and xenon tanks with tiny LF\u002BOx tanks, I can get a plane of the same shape and mass but with thrust 3.2 times greater (assuming the fuel and throttle levels can be adjusted). With such a plane at 16 km over Kerbin, all 4 forces are balanced at 3.2 times greater values.\n\nSo if I manage to fly it horizontally at a constant speed over Kerbin, I will be able to fly the ion one on Duna at a speed \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A13.2 = 1.8 times lower.\n\nAre my speculations valid, or am I mistaken in something?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T02:13:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Teilnehmer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T07:57:05Z","Content":"I\u0027d use Hyperedit either to make Kerbin have the characteristics of Duna and test your craft that way or else I\u0027d hyperedit the craft to Duna and try it there.
