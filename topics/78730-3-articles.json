I won the contract, that\u0027s great! I\u0027ll get on working on the next one right away. One thing tough, \u0022no testing\u0022 is quite difficult, at least for boosters. Getting fairings and stuff to work requires at least simulations on the pad, never mind judging delta-v and gravity losses and such. So while I won\u0027t do much more than a quickly reverted \u0022simulation\u0022, I rarely get a design that can be used without a RUD or two on the first hit of the green button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
