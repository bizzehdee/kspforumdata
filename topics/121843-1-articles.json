Once you get to orbit, you\u0027re on rocket power only, so you should have the right balance of liquid fuel \u0026amp; oxidizer for rockets, any extra liquid fuel beyond what you have oxidizer to burn with is dead weight from then on. There might be room to reduce some of the liquid fuel carried; between the wings and engine pods, you have a lot of storage there. Conversely, if you spend so much time on jet power that you reach orbit with an overabundance of oxidizer, that\u0027s dead weight too, and you should add more liquid fuel tankage so you can take advantage of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T22:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceplaneAddict\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceplaneAddict\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E/\\\u003Cp\u003E|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat he said.

This is not counting the fuel that\u0027s required to get it up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you incorporate NERVs, this percentage drops to 12%, which is a whole lot more manageable.

You cannot do anything else really. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to keep the shape, consider part clipping for fuel tanks (there are many opinions on this, some people consider it normal, others consider anyone who clips at all a cheater). Myself, i use clipping when i insist on a certain appearance, in particular when im trying to make a very minimalistic vessel. Just place a few fuel tanks inside a bomb bay, or even add them to the fuselage (since you dont mind making it longer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many other options if you insist on keeping a certain look, but overall, you need to add more fuel, remove mass, or switch to higher ISP propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T21:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe responses above about not hauling a bunch of dead mass are basically right. However, in the spirit of trying to answer your question the way you intended it, here are the things I would try. Not sure if they will be able to get you 1k dV but they should at least be good for a few hundred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You\u0027ve chosen a very heavy cockpit, which is basically dead weight. Do you need a 4-seater? Try replacing the cockpit with some fuel and a smaller cockpit. That will get your mass fraction up a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Can you delete the 5th engine entirely and still have enough atmospheric performance? More eliminated mass = slightly higher mass fraction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Don\u0027t go with auto-switching to closed cycle on your Rapier engines. Use manual switching in order to milk every last m/s out of the air breathing side of the engines. Play with your ascent profiles to try to hit at least 1400 m/s, ideally more, before you switch to closed cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Carefully optimize how much liquid fuel vs. oxidizer you have so that you aren\u0027t lugging excess liquid fuel after you get out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
