I\u0027m sure that you have some copies of sci-fi comics lying around somewhere, or have been inspired by them at some point, and you\u0027re not alone (I was five after reading a Star Wars comic, and put myself in a cardboard box, trying to be a Star Destroyer). Besides, it\u0027s fun to see what they imagined what we\u0027d have in the 21st century (hovercars, rayguns), and what we actually have (rising tensions between countries, threats of nuclear war, etc).
