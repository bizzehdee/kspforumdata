If I could use CSS/JavaScript on the forum, I\u0027d be able to make a REALLY nice forum post, and be able to present the information even better \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0.

I am simply someone that uses the Internet for my college courses and two blogs that I run. A while back, I had a fellow blogger, who did allow code in comments, to have a person insert a line of code that linked to a self-extracting exe file that proceeded to lock data of anyone who clicked on the link. The virus that was installed was a type of keystroke virus that not only spied on what was being done on affected machines but then turned around and locked down the user\u0027s data and required a \u0022payment\u0022 for a key to unlock the data. Yeah, there are people such as that in this world...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow while us older Internet users would not dream on clicking on a strange looking link, there are a lot of folks that click on nearly any link they come to. I would hate to know that this forum had been the cause of a security breach, the compromise of personal data, or even the loss of personal data. I\u0027m very careful of the forums I belong and in the event that this forum ever allowed code -whether moderated or not - to be used on the forum, would be reason enough for me not to come back. As a professional historian and someone that does a lot of research and teach at a local university, I simply could not run that risk...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust my two cents...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
