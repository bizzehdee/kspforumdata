However, from what I\u0027ve read, I believe this is unnecessary. If I do a fresh install, is literally everything I need in the saves folder? And equally important, if I want to copy all of the mods I use, do I only need to copy over my GameData folder? For some reason I though maybe some mods had files outside the\u00A0GameData folder, but from what I\u0027ve read, this should never be the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo am I safe if I only bother backing up my Saves folder and GameData folder (and ships folder if I wanted it) and nothing else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
