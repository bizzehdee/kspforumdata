Because different rockets take different amounts of time to climb. (this is why Mechjeb\u0027s \u0027launch to rendezvous\u0027 function requires a \u0027practice\u0027 launch to the target altitude before you can use it: You need to determine how long the rocket takes to launch to that height, measured by the \u0027phase angle\u0027 the target object should be at when you launch.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, going \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Estraight\u003C/span\u003E up is horribly inefficient, because you\u0027ll be losing speed to gravity the entire time. Much more efficient would be to launch normally directly to the Mun\u0027s altitude. This would entail getting both the timing and the apoapsis right so that you encounter the Mun without having done a Circularization burn yet. I\u0027ve tried to use the aforementioned Launch to Rendezvous function to do this, without success because the rocket I was using had Turbofans for boosters and Mechjeb wouldn\u0027t let me have enough time to spool them up before launch. I haven\u0027t yet tried it with another design, though I swear I\u0027ve heard it said it\u0027s less efficient than launching to orbit and then doing a transfer burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AnalogAddict","CreatedById":59758,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T13:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh I apologize, by straight to the moon I figured you meant a direct burn from the surface of kerbin to the mun surface, which could be accomplished during that period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I can see how it depends on the rocket, fortunately for me any mun bound craft I\u0027ve ever built makes it out of the atmosphere in time.

If your point occurs before the Mun then you can simply execute a longer burn and intercept it on your way back down to Kerbin.

The moon was almost directly over the space center so I decided to attempt a straight burn since I knew my ship could produce the Delta V and and had more fuel than needed for a standard Mun encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set the Mun as a target and burned toward the prograde target marker on the Nav ball, it was about 5 degrees off center toward 90 at the time. About half way to the Mun I had to do a coarse correction for an intercept. Since I was aiming for an orbit I did another correction once my ship got caught by the Mun\u0027s gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it is possible but I had to burn way more fuel than normal, almost double the amount, when accounting for the coarse corrections. With a bit more practice I probably could do it better, but I think I will stick with the standard Mun encounter burn from Kerbin Orbit. It gives more time to set up a maneuver with a better Mun Orbital trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T02:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, start when the moon is just coming up the horizon.
