Generally you shouldn\u0027t block the path of any rocket-thrust with a part.

If it is to be fixed I wouldn\u0027t expect that to happen until the big aerodynamics revision that\u0027s due in the (eventual) future -- because, once you\u0027ve got good aerodynamics calculations on parts you can use that to work out how thrust is affected by an in-the-way part too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, when that happens they might still decide \u0022you shouldn\u0027t put parts in the line of thrust\u0022, and leave it at that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E So the only advice for now and the foreseeable future is \u0022don\u0027t put parts in the line of thrust.\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpeederAlpha","CreatedById":126027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T00:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArgh!!!

On a vertical rocket, if your radial boosters are snapped to 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, put the fins at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. On a spaceplane, if you\u0027ve got wing-mounted engines, you usually want to mount the tailplane either above or below the line of thrust.
