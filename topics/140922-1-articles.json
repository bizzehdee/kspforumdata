It requires planning and if forgotten will kill the crew and waste your funds- or worse, you thought your interplanetary mission wouldn\u0027t take as long, and you need to send a probe full of life support, but by the time it\u0027ll get there, it\u0027ll be too late!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest you create a sandbox with these mods (I again suggest StockRT so you can save the probes) and slowly attempt larger and larger missions.

Crew capsules are usually very crash tolerant and it\u0027s common to botch a landing, and be left with just the capsule sitting on the ground. Unless you\u0027re on Mun, rescue is physically impossible before the crew dies, so you either lose them or quickload. For this reason, I recommend USI Life Support specifically because it does\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E kill the crew.

If you just want to send things to places it doesn\u0027t half get in your way. Speed of light and line of sight mean\u00A0having to plan manoeuvres way in advance, and you can basically forget the idea of landing probes on vacuum bodies. I certainly think it has its niche, but it\u0027s probably best saved for when you want to do a Real Solar System hardcore realism run \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T13:46:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222611201\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140922\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464775861\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257865\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stibbons\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, stibbons said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never played a career without TAC-LS.

RT demands a lot of micromanagement and adds some very specialized gameplay elements, overall adding a lot of complexity and difficulty for unmanned missions, making them very unbalanced against stock manned missions. To make things even, you need to use a life support mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I do recommend a life support mod even for a first career. The whole point is to turn time into an important resource, making the game dependant on two resources (mission duration and payload weight)\u00A0 instead of only one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t recommend TAC-LS which adds too many resource and is made more for realism that anything else gameplay-wise. Same thing for USI-LS, it is of no interest without the whole USI package. Snacks is probably the best for a first career as it is simple, integrate well with the stock game and is more forgiving (Kerbals won\u0027t die, you will only loose reputation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option is Kerbalism which is a all-in-one communications/life support/quality of life/radiation/malfunction mod. It does all these things in a very coherent, straightforward and stockalike way, not adding too much complexity but adding a lot to the stock gameplay, both for manned and unmanned missions. It feature a nice mission planner to ease things and integrate well in the career progression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T19:12:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Gotmachine\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
