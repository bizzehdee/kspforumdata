As for what tech to spend the points on, well it\u0027s mainly about having the best possible airbreathing engine. \u00A0 The Terrier is a great closed cycle engine and appears very early in the tech three. \u00A0 \u00A0 All the others are heavier and have worse Vacuum ISP, \u00A0the only improvements to be had are in Sea level ISP and Thrust which aren\u0027t important in a spaceplane. \u00A0 The nuke is a step up but not vastly better if you\u0027re just shuttling to low kerbin orbit, it really comes into its own if you\u0027re flying beyond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll wings have basically the same performance, regardless of shape. \u00A0 The Fat S airliner wing and the Big S space shuttle wing/wing strake are an improvement, because they have the same mass/lift ratio of the others, but also have considerable liquid fuel capacity.
