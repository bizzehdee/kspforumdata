The parts will include a base part - The CRY-5000 - with a 4 kerbal capacity and a Glykerol tank that fit in with the KPBS mod parts and styles. Nils277 will be releasing these parts as part of his mod (in the next day or two). So head over to his [**mod thread**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127413-WIP-1-0-4-Kerbal-Planetary-Base-Systems-v0-2-2-Update-25-8-2015?p=2190101\u0026viewfull=1#post2190101) for more details and the release of these parts. You will need his Mod for the parts (when he releases) and DeepFreeze Continued... V0.18.2.0 if you want these glorious parts for your bases.\n\u003E The CRY-5000 includes a Glykerol tank on-board, 4 cryopods, animated Lightstrips, the new V0.18.2.0 pod window animations and supports RPM Transparent pods feature and props.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/gvpQbL7.png](http://i.imgur.com/gvpQbL7.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/wSWLZoe.png](http://i.imgur.com/wSWLZoe.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/zeUwRZ7.png](http://i.imgur.com/zeUwRZ7.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/5OLwCoA.png](http://i.imgur.com/5OLwCoA.png)\n\nThere has been a delay in Nils277 releasing the DeepFreeze parts for Kerbal Planetary Base System as there were some compatibility issues that we had to sort out.

It is not going to be easy due to the way KSP works. My investigations thus far have found that whenever you EVA or switch vessels this problem can occur as well.\n\u003E It\u0027s actually documented as a known issue on the Texture Replacer thread: \u0022Cabin-specific IVA suits don\u0027t persist through scene switches while on EVA.\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think this is actually a DeepFreeze bug, as so much as the way KSP works. DeepFreeze extends this known Texture Replacer issue to also include when you thaw a kerbal using DeepFreeze.\n\u003E \n\u003E It won\u0027t be fixable within DeepFreeze but will require fixes on the Texture Replacer mod, if at all possible. I have started a conversation with shaw who is the main author of Texture Replacer mod.\n\nOk, a fix to make Texture Replacer compatible with DeepFreeze is nearing completion. Expect an update to Texture Replacer in the near future (days?) - it has already been tested.\n\nI can then add Texture Replacer support into the next version of DeepFreeze. So any customised Kerbals will no longer lose their customised textures when they are frozen/thawed (as is currently occurring with current versions)."},{"CreatedByName":"Space gh\u00F6st","CreatedById":50704,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T19:52:02Z","Content":"I\u0027m getting an exception that causes my ship to fly off to no where when switching vessels.

Put Kerbals into the freezer, froze them (while docked), then undocked the ship, and then made a few modifications to the ship (with KIS).\n\nWhen I went to unfreeze them (thankfully *before* the interplanetary journey), I couldn\u0027t. No Kerbals in the frozen list.\n\nLooking at the save file, DeepFreeze saved them in SCENARIO{DFGameSettings{KerbalInfo{}}} against \u0022vesselID = 6201018e-5580-48b6-9785-f655b44769cb\u0022 which doesn\u0027t exist, but presumably used to be TC2 (I also modified that station heavily using KIS). I changed that to c4792c2b-50e8-4e50-a3b9-67a166b6cfff to match the PartInfo{} vesselID of the actual freezer, as well as the actual ship:\n\n    VESSEL                {                        pid = c4792c2b50e84e50a3b967a166b6cfff                        name = Explorer 1\n\nNow the Kerbals show up in the list! But I can\u0027t unfreeze them. Pressing \u0022Thaw\u0022 says \u0022Code Error: Cannot thaw kerbal at this time / Thawing Aborted / Cannot thaw kerbal at this time\u0022. The log is full of \u0022Argument is out of range\u0022 spam.\n\nI\u0027ll try to fix this by save file hackery (probably just restoring them to \u0022live\u0022 and then re-freezing), but this brings up some questions:\n\n1. Do you test against the vessel ID changing, via freezing and then undocking, or just moving the freezer (with frozen Kerbals inside) from one ship to another via KIS?\n\n2. If I change the vesselID of the freezer and *then* freeze Kerbals, is that safe? I can live with a restriction of \u0022don\u0027t modify the ship while frozen Kerbals are aboard\u0022 but I do need to dock/undock and modify ships with KIS.\n\nIt seems to me that storing the frozen Kerbals in the PartModule instead of the global SCENARIO{} would avoid the vesselID issues, but might not let you access their data while focused on another ship (the global Alarm window and such). Maybe just have each PartModule store which Kerbals are frozen on board, and update the vesselID in SCENARIO{}?

Put Kerbals into the freezer, froze them (while docked), then undocked the ship, and then made a few modifications to the ship (with KIS).\n\u003E \n\u003E When I went to unfreeze them (thankfully *before* the interplanetary journey), I couldn\u0027t. No Kerbals in the frozen list.\n\u003E \n\u003E Looking at the save file, DeepFreeze saved them in SCENARIO{DFGameSettings{KerbalInfo{}}} against \u0022vesselID = 6201018e-5580-48b6-9785-f655b44769cb\u0022 which doesn\u0027t exist, but presumably used to be TC2 (I also modified that station heavily using KIS). I changed that to c4792c2b-50e8-4e50-a3b9-67a166b6cfff to match the PartInfo{} vesselID of the actual freezer, as well as the actual ship:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     VESSEL                {                        pid = c4792c2b50e84e50a3b967a166b6cfff                        name = Explorer 1\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Now the Kerbals show up in the list!

The log is full of \u0022Argument is out of range\u0022 spam.\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll try to fix this by save file hackery (probably just restoring them to \u0022live\u0022 and then re-freezing), but this brings up some questions:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Do you test against the vessel ID changing, via freezing and then undocking, or just moving the freezer (with frozen Kerbals inside) from one ship to another via KIS?\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. If I change the vesselID of the freezer and *then* freeze Kerbals, is that safe? I can live with a restriction of \u0022don\u0027t modify the ship while frozen Kerbals are aboard\u0022 but I do need to dock/undock and modify ships with KIS.\n\u003E \n\u003E It seems to me that storing the frozen Kerbals in the PartModule instead of the global SCENARIO{} would avoid the vesselID issues, but might not let you access their data while focused on another ship (the global Alarm window and such). Maybe just have each PartModule store which Kerbals are frozen on board, and update the vesselID in SCENARIO{}? I don\u0027t know the solution, just throwing things out there.\n\nThank you for the extensive bug report info.\n\nYes, DeepFreeze stores frozen kerbals against the SCENARIO rather than in the PartModule. This is so it can be accessed from anywhere in the game, such as another vessel (when the part is unloaded), etc and given there are Electrical Charge and Heat usage and monitoring that occurs all the time in game, this is required.\n\nI am unfamiliar with how KIS operates and was not aware it can remove parts from vessels. It would be safe to say at this stage that DeepFreeze is NOT compatible with KIS. I will have to investigate how KIS removes parts, renames vessels, etc to see if it is using standard KSP GameEvents or not.\n\nI will check the GameEvents that DeepFreeze uses and check that standard docking, un-docking and renaming still works.\n\nRather than your game save hack, DeepFreeze does allow you to Thaw Frozen Kerbals from the Space Center (they will re-appear in the Astronaut Center back at KSC) if they are no longer associated with a valid vesselID. So you could try that."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T08:40:36Z","Content":"Update: I deleted my DeepFreeze SCENARIO{} and put the 3 Kerbals into the command pod.
