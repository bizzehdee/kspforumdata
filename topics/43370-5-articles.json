But the observer on the ground sees you get blown up by the bomb. So now you stop the train with the emergency brake. The observer on the ground sees an invisible, noncausal force pull the emergency brake handle, while your splattered remains continue to drip off the flatbed car. You walk up to the observer on the ground, who still does not see you. You punch him in the face. The observer on the ground is punched in the face by an invisible, inexplicable force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the fact that you CAN punch the observer on the ground in the face implies that the atoms in your hand still interact with the atoms in the observer on the ground\u0027s face.

Instantaneous communication is impossible in classical theory. And this is actually a very neat example of why. I hope you don\u0027t mind that I borrow it at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to the meat of the matter. Let us first start with classical relativistic mechanics. Instantaneous communication just cannot happen, but what about very rapid, FTL, yet finite speed communication. Say, 10c. After all, that\u0027s all that Alcubierre Drive promises - travel at some multiple of speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us say that bomb is located some distance d from each receiver. Beam of light is sent at the speed c, and reaches each of the detectors in time d/c as seen by observer on the train. The return signal is sent at 10c, and so the total round time is 1.1d/c for both signals as seen by observer on the train.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let us suppose that the train is traveling at some velocity v, and we consider the whole scenario from perspective of the observer who is standing nearby, braced against the immense shock wave generated by a train traveling at a fraction of c. Let us say that the observer was located right next to the train, so close that we can ignore any transverse separation and treat it as a 1D problem. And for simplicity, lets say that the observer was right next to the bomb when the original light signals were sent. This simplifies things, letting us place the event of sending light signals at x=0 and t=0 for both observers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost, stationary observer, as the blazes of plasma engulf him, manages to nonetheless spot that the two receivers are a distance d\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1(1-v\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) = d\u0027 away from the bomb. They nevertheless, still move at the speed of v, and light moves at the speed c. Therefore, from perspective of the observer, the light beams reach the detectors in time d\u0027/(c-v) and d\u0027/(c\u002Bv) for the forward and rear detectors respectively. Now the detectors send their faster than light signal. And here is where things get really interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom perspective of observer, the FTL signals return at speeds of 10c. But this isn\u0027t speed of light. This speed is not the same in all coordinate systems. And neither is it 10c\u002Bv and 10c-v, because velocities just don\u0027t add up this way. Fortunately, we have the formula for adding relativistic velocities. And most fortunately of all, this formula works for FTL speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe singal from the front of the train has velocity of the train subtracted from the signal propagation speed giving us v\u003Csub\u003Ef\u003C/sub\u003E = (10c - v)/(1-10v/c). The signal catching up from the back, however, has the velocity added. v\u003Csub\u003Er\u003C/sub\u003E = (10c \u002B v)/(1\u002B10v/c). Note that if I had c instead of 10c, both of these simplify to just c. That\u0027s what you expect - speed of light is the same in all frames, but speed of object traveling FTL is frame-dependent same as that of object traveling slower than light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, each of these still needs to cover the distance of d\u0027 while the train is moving along at v. So the times are d\u0027/((10c - v)/(1-10v/c) \u002B v) and d\u0027/((10c \u002B v)/(1\u002B10v/c) - v)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now we look at the total. t\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1\u003C/sub\u003E = d\u0027/(c\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u0153v)\u002Bd\u0027/((10c \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 v)/(1 \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 10v/c) \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1 v).

So the round trip for the two signals is exactly the same from perspective of observer, despite return signal traveling FTL.

No explosion!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo relativity wins, once again. I could derive this whole thing with an arbitrary velocity for signals going away and towards the bomb, and so long as the speeds are the same for the forward and rear signals, it will always work out that round trip time is the same, even if one or either of these speeds is FTL. It\u0027s all in how relativistic speeds add up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this resolves your paradox. Agreed? I\u0027ll give you some time to check all the math, and feel free to ask questions if I didn\u0027t make some of the steps clear, but this is how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the elephant in the room. Time travel. I already said that if the communication is instant, bad stuff happens. And I already said that time travel is possible. And it is obvious that using time travel you can make faux instant communication by simply sending the signal with enough lead time. So what\u0027s up? Did I just dig myself into a hole? Well, not exactly. Here is how we can make the detectors at either end send \u0022instant\u0022 signal to the bomb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine, if you will, that an ancient alien civilization being able of many technological wonders, living in relative proximity to a rotating black hole, and trying to win a bet with their neighbors have built an automated station that accepts radio messages and fires them into the black hole\u0027s ergosphere \u003Cem\u003Ejuuust\u003C/em\u003E right. And it receives these messages hundreds of thousands of years before sending them, and bounces them back towards whoever sent them. You, having decoded in cosmic background a hidden message with instructions and the activation codes required to make this station do your bidding realize that ability to end the universe is finally within your grasp. So you build the train bomb, arm the transmitters, and time everything so that the signal to detonate the bomb is sent by receivers \u0022instantly\u0022. Of course, what really happens is that transmitters receive the beam from the bomb, send message to the ancient station thousands of light years away, the message is sent thousands of years back, relayed back to your detectors, and arrives with enough lead time for you to send the message to the bomb to arrive at the exact instance that the signal is received by transmitters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet, there is a problem. Simultaneity is in the eyes of the beholder. Two events happening at the same exact time in one coordinate system happen at different times from the other. From perspective of you, riding on the train of doom, the signal is sent instantly from receivers to the bomb. From perspective of the lone kerbal scientist on the tracks, the two receivers got triggered at different times, but they also did not send the signal instantly. In fact, one fires it too early, and the other fires it too late, which results in the bomb still getting the two signals at the same exact time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurses!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet, the day is once again saved by the relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T09:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have another example where FTL breaks causality.

We could just send some sort of bacteriological weapon or virus on an FTL probe that wipes out life on their home planet millions of years before they even evolve into becoming sentient organisms. The result would be that we would never encounter them in the first place or even be aware of their existence. Rinse and repeat this a couple of times, and what would the universe look like to us?

Say v1 is c and you look at it from a coordinate system moving at v2=v. (c-v)/(1-v/c) = c(c-v)/(c-v) = c. Speed of light is the same in all frames. This would not work with a \u002B sign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sign changing for v1*v2 \u0026gt; c\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 and v1 \u0026lt; v2 is simply an indication of event order changes when you go FTL. That\u0027s what we\u0027ve been talking about all along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd these formulae are correct, or the whole thing would break down even with both velocities being subluminal, and then you could recreate your paradox by simply having detectors at either end of the train fire a gun into the targets on the bomb. The train wouldn\u0027t even have to move that fast for this to be measurable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo again, relativity works. You can\u0027t use contraction/dilation formulae from Special Relativity under v \u0026gt; c, because space-time has to be curved for you to get FTL, and these formulae are for flat space-time. But velocity addition formulae can be used so long as space-time outside of the warp bubble is flat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T08:38:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll watch the progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-18T08:41:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2013 08:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DJEN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T08:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022 data-cite=\u0022|Velocity|\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs in, if warp drive capable ships were possible, there\u0027s a very good chance we would have been colonized millions or billions of years ago.

At 10c, we can cross interstellar space easy enough. That means we can plant colonies on multiple stars and gradually expand outward. With a 10c drive, there is no single or any plausible chain of disasters that can wipe out our entire civilization short of encountering a more advanced civilization. From there on, even if the actual frontier expands at merely .1c, entire MW galaxy is going to be colonized in under a million years. That might sound like a really long time, but it really is not. Humans were less evolved a million years ago, but out of 3-something billion years that life has been evolving on this planet, a million years faster or slower to reach a certain stage in evolution is not much. And there are planets in MW that would have had a head start by billions of years simply based on how their star systems have formed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how hard is it to build a 10c warp drive?
