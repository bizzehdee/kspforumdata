There are a lot of small features they could implement that would make the experience much better. For example, key bindings for common actions at the Space Center like rejecting/canceling contracts, the ability to specify contracts that you don\u0027t want to see pop up (by type and location both), a fix for the problem where action groups do not respect symmetry when parent parts are moved... Little things like that would really make things easier on the player. I would think a little flashing \u0022check here first\u0022 arrow over Mission Control the first time you start up a Career mode file would be a helpful addition for newer players too; that sucker\u0027s tiny for something so essential!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:17:01Z","Content":"I assume the main thing the next one will bring, is unity 5 conversion.\n\nThough what I\u0027d like to see worked on is some propper ground exploration tools. It would be awesome if the kerbals could hop on a rover, drive about, and start loging all the notible geological features of a landing site, rather than anding, quickly running a few experiments, then doing nothing untill it\u0027s time to leave.\n\nThat, and maybe and overhaul of the sceince system, something where you get to actually record some data, and start to build up a picture of each world, (and space itself), rather than just scoritng points.

A greater variety of parts. I cant play without mods anymore myself. Kis/kas, space-y, if robotics, science alert, engineer, ksprc, alarm clock, and a couple of others u have recently discovered. That\u0027s where I hope ksp ends up, they add so much more to the game. After they polish it up and add features such as those, then, add more solar systems \u0026 planets, and near future parts to help us get there. Also, 64x.

That\u0027s taking separate issues and tangling them up together. The resource system that they were talking about was originally planned for 0.19, they didn\u0027t like the way it worked, so they canned it. There was no \u0022Hey, good idea, let\u0027s sell this separately!\u0022 talk.\n\nAs for the fuss, the fuss was about them mentioning DLC and people going orbital because they bought the whole game and never wanted to pay for anything else. As to why they\u0027d mention DLC, 0.23.5 was originally intended to be free DLC, but it updated too much of the game so they had to integrate it into the game. HarvestR was talking of a hypothetical situation, not any plans they had.\n\nThe only things these two things had in common was that they were both announced at a big online event (three days of streaming) and both created a big stir in the community.\n\nThey\u0027ve already talked about the fact that they\u0027re planning what\u0027s going into 1.1, and yes, Unity 5 is on the tentative list. I can\u0027t definitively say that there will be a 1.2, but I\u0027d be quite surprised if there\u0027s not."}]}
