As of this point, there is no campaign to guide you, so you are responsible for making decisions on what you want to do. I would recommend Landing on both Moons, making a space station in orbit, and then space stations in orbit around both moons, as well as ground bases. While you are doing these things and you feel you are ready to do something more advanced, try making standardized lifting stages and making less overpowered ships, as this will prepare you for the campaign\u0027s money management.
