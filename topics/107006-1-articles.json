While pushing a ship into reentry position with a Kerbal, the camera absolutely wigs out and goes ....ing nuts. It looks like it\u0027s trying to \u0027reshape\u0027 the camera like how it does when a ship goes from surface flight to orbital flight, but on an EVA Kerbal this is just insane and makes them impossible to control. Since a Kerbal while EVA could cross this threshold while simply maneuvering (a little forward, they\u0027re \u0022reentering\u0022, a little backwards, it\u0027s \u0022orbit\u0022) this makes it ridiculous and the camera spins around wildly and so does the Kerbal. It can be nearly impossible to get them back to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut the camera in something other than Auto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChase, locked, orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a known issue, it\u0027s been around pretty much since EVAs were introduced.
