It\u0027s due to Squad resizing the small reaction wheel (the one in the craft used to 1.25m, not 0.625m) a few versions ago, but not updating the scenario and craft used therein - it still references the part named \u0027sasModule\u0027 which is the tiny one and not the \u0027advSasModule\u0027 which is the 1.25m one. The parts either side are spaced out because that\u0027s where they were when the RW was larger and, due to not updating the craft, that\u0027s where they remain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe legs though, I\u0027ve no idea. Could be a similar problem and the craft just needs to be updated (by Squad).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
