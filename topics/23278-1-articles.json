Have managed to get into orbit and got my head around orbits, also managed to get to the mum and back but not ambitious enough to attempt a landing let. But oh my god I just can\u0027t dock in orbit for love nor money. I get everything perfect, circular orbit for both ships get under 1km apart and try to move them closer lining things up but it just changes my orbit on the far side and they end up even further apart. Frustrating!!!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut fun :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T16:19:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T16:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow quickly are you approaching the other ship for the actual dock? Within a kilometer you should be able to just steer straight towards it, but if you are going VERY slowly, then time and orbital mechanics will draw the ships apart. Try closing the final distance at 20m/s\u002B. That shouldn\u0027t be too fast to brake to a stop again when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T20:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Claytsuk \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah as Vanamonde says, if you have a 1km separation just point at the target and set a target relative speed of a few m/s, you\u0027ll close the gap easily enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget to actually target the other craft and if your speed readout doesn\u0027t automatically change to target mode just click on it a few times \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are really close, lower your relative speed to 0 to give yourself time to work out what you will do for the actual docking :)D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claytsuk","CreatedById":59247,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T09:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys will give it a shot!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lacedemonian","CreatedById":79686,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T13:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Claytsuk \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah as Vanamonde says, if you have a 1km separation just point at the target and set a target relative speed of a few m/s, you\u0027ll close the gap easily enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget to actually target the other craft and if your speed readout doesn\u0027t automatically change to target mode just click on it a few times \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are really close, lower your relative speed to 0 to give yourself time to work out what you will do for the actual docking :)D\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already tried that, but i can\u0027t cancel my relative velocity. it always just reverses direction at 6 m/s.
