being able to deploy teams of specialists, either tier 1 operators or technicians whose skills are required for a given military crisis, is undeniable. \u00A0The problem is that this ability is used\u00A0more as a crutch than a tool. \u00A0Ideally we (whoever \u0022we\u0022 are) maintain enough of\u00A0a regional presence in force that local logistics are maintained to support unexpected, protracted operations in force. \u00A0Dependence on rapid and effective QRF allows us to think we can sustain security operations when we have not developed or maintained logistic systems to do so or to deal with nasty surprises.\u00A0\u00A0Airlift alone\u00A0is not feasible for sustained military operations, especially at any kind of scale.

offloading lifesaving supplies and experts to sick, starving and oppressed masses. \u00A0It\u0027s a powerful image and it\u0027s a powerful experience to do so. \u00A0The effects of airlift like this don\u0027t live up to our imaginations, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn small scale airlift, the ability to provide reliable services to remote operations actually prevents investment in roads and security that would deliver much cheaper and more reliable supply to the people in need. \u00A0Large scale airlift in Nigeria (Biafra), Ethiopia and elsewhere have people abandon working on their dirt farms to collect Ming supplies. \u00A0Moreover local criminals try to capitalize on these supplies requiring the attention of local police and military to focus on perimeter defense of airfields rather than ensuring bandit-free road access to deep water ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven in missionary flying, protracted use of single engine aircraft to deliver aid serves the people doing the flying more than the people needing aid on the ground. \u00A0A long term effort to get and maintain secure ground lines of communication and supply does more for those in need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, here\u0027s a little Blurb about Fred Cuny who made many of the same observations I did, only a few decades

Reducing the use of airlift won\u0027t necessairly make the money go to another investment. The only reason airlift is there it\u0027s beacuse nobody built any road to start with and may never will, for one reason or another. Maybe because the terrain is so harsh that building and mantaining a road would be as costly as airlift or even more. Or the local government don\u0027t want to help a certain village because the are from a certain tribe or something like that or the government simply don\u0027t want to build or let someone build a road but accepts airlift. Road transport could be dangerous, so investment in security would also be needed. We get to a point where if all investments weere made, the need for aid would cease beacuse the country itself would develop. Somethings are not that simple IRL as in paper.
