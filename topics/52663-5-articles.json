For example, after your 3rd Mun Landing, the game would suggest going to Minmus, but dosen\u0027t yet think you\u0027re capable of going interplanetary yet. The game also may focus on parts you just got from the R\u0026amp;D lab. Say, you just unlocked Advanced Electrics, and have recently landed on Duna. The game would offer a mission to launch a sattelite into a Geostationary Orbit around Duna, but it must have some weird unique part only for the mission (You cannot buy it, and get one in stock when accepting the mission) that requires a lot of electric Charge, making you test out your new parts, along woth doing what the game thinks you are currently intrested in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB.O.T., I would HATE to see a real autopilot in-game. It\u0027s not that I hate the concept, but I think autopilots take the fun out of the game. I bought the game to build and fly ships, not to build ships and watch the game fly it for me. If they do that, they might as well cut out the actuall flying stage, as everybody is going to use it, and not actually fly the craft. Though that is my personal opinion, I HAVE landed on both Duna and Eve without any kind of Autopilot. Although that really dosen\u0027t seem very impressive to the expirenced pilot, if you use things like MechJeb alot, just try and land on Eve without it (Especially without the optimal time window).
