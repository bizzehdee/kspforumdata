Inspired by a rover/plane I saw online somewhere, I decided to build my own for exploring Kerbin and/or laythe one day. Building off of the stock Aeris 3A jet, I bring to you the Aeris 3A-RV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mPkCGykh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mPkCGykh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Groups:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Toggles VTOL Engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Toggles Primary Jet Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats it.

She\u0027ll take off straight up and if you\u0027re a decent enough pilot you can bring her down very slowly (I haven\u0027t managed a perfect vertical landing yet, but very slow landings yes.) In rover mode she drives decent, just need to keep in mind the VTOL engines hanging under the wings. She can navigate some small lips, like climbing back up onto the runway, with a small boost from her rear mounted jet. But be careful, as shown in the last pic, you can easily destroy the VTOL engines by driving off said lip too fast. At 37 parts she\u0027s easy on the PC too. Last but not least, the top mounted docking port allows for easy transportation/re-supply/storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-28T13:14:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2013 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Yalin Hawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot .craft file (duh)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dimitriye98","CreatedById":68102,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T11:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks really nice, definitely going to try it.

I do have a few complaints though. The first and foremost is the lack of an ASAS module. It results in the craft requiring constant babysitting to fly straight, as well as making it far more difficult to successfully take of in VTOL mode. One other extremely minor problem is the unneeded fuel lines. Wings are fuel cross-feed compatible anyway, so the fuel lines do nothing but add drag. Now, on the other hand, after I added the ASAS, the craft was remarkably stable and could be left cruising with no problems, even at two-times acceleration. I did have a problem with the craft being slightly TOO maneuverable, in that it maneuvered so quickly that it was difficult to avoid over-steering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"llamatoes","CreatedById":57750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T06:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts based on the Aeris 3a, which is about as twitchy as a rabbit on 5 shots of espresso\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dimitriye98","CreatedById":68102,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T07:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh, I haven\u0027t really ever flown stock crafts, so I wouldn\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yalin Hawk","CreatedById":72640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T06:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah she\u0027s what I\u0027d call...ahhh...\u0022extremely responsive.\u0022 For most flight ops I never throttle up past 40-50%. At just a tap of throttle on the VTOL engines she\u0027ll float right up. This is one plane where less throttle is more.
