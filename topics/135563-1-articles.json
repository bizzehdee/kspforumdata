Why did Gene send a mere recruit?\u00A0 And one that was probably NOT briefed on the mission?\u00A0 She knew he could help out regardless, however she feared for his safety.\u00A0 How could he survive out here with just the supplies offered by the Fishtail trainer?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaydi and her team were much better off.\u00A0 The cockpit of the Monster was now serving as their home
