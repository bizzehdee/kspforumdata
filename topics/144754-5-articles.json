I believe it ran out of fuel during descent and/or landed on an incredible slope and may have prior lost one or more landing legs. It got so rekt and painted the walls of a small crater behind a larger one, some 80km away from the Mun base. Fortunately the lander can and its 2 crew survived. The rescue craft was a tank-style rover built with Kerbal Foundries parts (so KSP 1.0.5) and the rescue party was 6 large, all in command chairs (8 chairs total). They drove that distance and back with the help of a Rapier in Closed Cycle. The monster of a lag on close approach due to the debris field took some fun out of the encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
