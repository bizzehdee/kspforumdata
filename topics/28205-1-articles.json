I\u0027ve only had the stability launch assistance towers spawn and they spawn in the same configuration as the pre-launch towers. I generally have a problem with them spawning around the 1:05 minute mark into the mission (it continually destroyed my new rover with command seat) as the rocket began to make its gravity turn. I don\u0027t know if this is related to the rocket turning or if it was just coincidence. I tried to launch the same rocket without an launch stability towers (by resting it on the ground) and interestingly the same towers appeared. I\u0027ve also seen the towers appear in orbit and (sadly as they\u0027ve created some crazy debris) during transfer orbits to mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
