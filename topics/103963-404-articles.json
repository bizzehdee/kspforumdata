They said (e.g. the author of the Stock water fall effects configs), some future release could contain an offset, but it never was brought into one of the releases and is still the way it was. It\u0027s more than half a year since I asked some of them. Fully understandable, since every modder does it in their free recreational time.

I don\u0027t think all partmods, that come right out of the box with waterfall plumes, will adapt to this issue. They are just too many. E.g. in my case these mods have one or more parts with waterfall plumes: Stock waterfall effects, SpikeX, KerbalAtomics, NF Launchvehicles, NF Propulsion, NF Spacecraft, SSPXr, Far Future Tech, KARE, BDA\u002B .... and that are just the ones, that I have. Out there in the wild, there are many many more.  Especially the ones by Nertea (and they are many) won\u0027t see any updates anymore, \u0027cause he retired from KSP1-modding and became part of the KSP2-team. Fully understandable.
