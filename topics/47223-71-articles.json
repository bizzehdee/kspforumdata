In both cases you will keep the batteties charged and also supply the present ec load up to the\u00A0reactor\u0027s max rating.

All Ec sources in KSP seem to function like that however. For low Ec rated sources like solar panels or the NUKs this is not an issue to care about, but a reactor capable of delivering 2000-3000Ec/s it would be more realistic to charge the battery at a lower rate than the max Ec load possible, cq charging the batteries at 2000/s is not realistic.\u00A0On an alternator the load gets it supply from the alternator (reactor in this case), not so much the battery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-26T16:15:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2016 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T01:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t intend to change the mechanics of how energy consumption and generation work.
