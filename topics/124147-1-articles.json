After a (very) short deliberation, i\u0027ve decided not to update KSP until finishing the Elcano challenge on Tylo. I consider the challenge more important than the update. Although i believe the update won\u0027t break the current savegame, i prefer to keep the conditions the same as before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday, I\u0027ve covered more distance than i expected. Initially, the terrain gave the impression that there would be no sharp inclination changes but during the drive i did encounter a few sharp edges. Not as bad as on Pol but nevertheless something to keep in mind while driving towards an edge. The rover doesn\u0027t fly off like on Pol or Minmus. On Tylo the rover has the flight characteristics of a large brick. It a good thing the tracks are quite sturdy. During tests on Kerbin the tracks could absorb a drop of 59 meters without much damage. For all, i must avoid making sudden changes in direction. Even though the center of mass is situated very low, the higher gravity and friction on Tylo could cause the rover to overturn. The landing feet will prevent most of the damage but the remaining generator isn\u0027t fully protected by them. It still is possible to damage it. Continuing on the RTG\u0027s is possible but then langer stops will have to be made to refill the energy. I noticed that while driving at full speed without the lights on, the RTG\u0027s and generator provide enough power to fill the batteries nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the lighting of Tylo, i\u0027m forced to drive with the nightvisioncamera as display to the world (read: moon) outside. Constantly looking at a green monitor is somewhat stressfull to the eyes but it also has its advantages. No matter what the angle of the terrain is (front to back and lateral), it appears to the driver as if the rover is just on a flat surface. In other words, driverstress caused by driving under an angle is prevented. You do have to monitor the navball, though! The rover is only certified for angles not exceeding 45 degrees. The maximum angle i\u0027ve encountered sofar was 25 degrees lateral. The rover does handle differently under an angle when compared to driving on a normal flat surface. It\u0027s much harder to keep the rover on the same course, for instance. A turn continues until it is stopped by a correction in the other direction. In a way, you can compare it with the rotation of a craft in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to reset the point at which the generator switches on. It\u0027s more advantageous to start the generator at 50% energy capacity than at 30%. It reduces the time needed to refill the batteries when stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve added nano gauges to the mods to better keep an eye on the energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T22:32:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 10:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheCardinal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T13:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll get well over 35 degree declines in the \u0022badlands\u0022 of Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T16:56:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EO, DEAR!!!
