Direct ascent. One huge rocket, even larger than Saturn V would launch one craft up to the Moon. This was the simplest mission plan, with the fewest steps that could go wrong, but there were significant downsides. First, the Spaceship would look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://d1jqu7g1y74ds1.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Apollo_Direct_Ascent.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Apollo_Direct_Ascent.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was top-heavy, would\u0027ve been nearly impossible to land, and required a huge amount of fuel to get back home.

Nova would\u0027ve been a nightmare. There was nothing to say Nova could never work, but getting it to work would\u0027ve taken more than the time NASA had before the 31st December, 1969.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR). The Spaceship is assembled and fuelled in Earth orbit by several Saturn V launches, then does the mission similar to direct ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.alternatewars.com/SpaceRace/SP-4205/images/c063c.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022c063c.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis removed the need for the \u0022super-rocket\u0022, but the Spaceship design was as difficult to fly, and there was no way Boeing, North American, Douglas, Rocketdyne and others could build the Saturn Vs fast enough to meet the deadline (It wasn\u0027t just Apollo 11 that needed the Moon rocket.

Lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR). Instead of one, big Spaceship, there are two, smaller craft-a main ship for the astronauts to be in during the trip to the Moon, and the trip back to Earth, and a lander for the astronauts to go to the surface, leaving the main ship in Lunar orbit. Then the lander will climb back into orbit, and dock with the main ship, which would take the astronauts back home. They came to be known as the Command and Service Module, and the Lunar Module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/a/apocsmlm.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022apocsmlm.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission plan had the risk of performing the rendezvous around somewhere other than the Earth, while astronauts are in a craft that wouldn\u0027t have a hope of getting home, or surviving re-entry.
