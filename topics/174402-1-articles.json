I recently downloaded KSP after deleting it many years ago. I went to the KSP website and downloaded the game from there. I performed the standard OSX install, drag to Applications etc and everything seemed to be going well. Both Launcher and KSP were in the applications folder with all the\u00A0files along with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem arises when I open the installer, click play and the game launches in a new window. The loading bar appears for a split second, appearing to load half way then the screen becomes black. No amount of waiting solves this problem. Could it be that when I \u0027deleted\u0027 the game back in 2015-16 some files remain on the computer and are conflicting with the newest update?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cfds","CreatedById":82109,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-29T17:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I know the launcher has never worked in any version for a long time.
