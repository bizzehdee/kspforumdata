These are glorified glue guns, melting a continuous plastic filament (I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s the \u0022hose\u0022 referred to in the quoted post) and extrude the molten plastic through a small nozzle, leaving a tract of plastic that eventually builds into layers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShapeways uses a selective powder bonding technology. These machines use a bed of powder (which can be of various materials, including metals, ceramics, plastics etc) onto which a binder of some kind of sprayed exactly like a traditional inkjet printer sprays ink onto a sheet of paper. A new coating of powder is then spread on top of the previous layer and the process repeats to build a 3D shape which then has to be dug out of the unused media, cleaned and often \u0022hardened\u0022 by infusing it with another compound. as an extra bonus you get full color capability by simply using dyed binder like you would colored ink.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowder based methods typically have the same resolution as inkjet printers, since they use exactly the same fundamental technology (You can even build your own using a re-purposed inkjet cartridge... it\u0027s been done). FDM machines have a theoretical resolution of twice that of powder printers or even better, but in practice are limited by nozzle orifice size so the \u0022sharpest\u0022 corner you\u0027ll get is no better than 0.5mm or so. That\u0027s still impressively detailed, though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the big difference is you can build a FDM machine for ~US$700.
