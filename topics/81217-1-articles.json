First time starting a new thread here, and just wanted to suggest that some of you follow a cool game called NavalAction. I don\u0027t intend to advertise however this caught my eye on the Steam Greenlight and had to share it with a wider audience. I\u0027m posting this here because I think many of you will be interested in a realistic sim like this. Anyway, here\u0027s a link to the official website: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.navalaction.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.navalaction.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
