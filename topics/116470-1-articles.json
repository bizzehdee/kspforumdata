Then I suppose there is something wrong with my KSP? \n\n This is same with MPL on wiki: \u0022The Lab does provide IVA as of the 1.0 update\u0022\n\nOther IVAs have no problem seemingly. Though it doesn\u0027t greatly affect my game play but still makes it a little bit annoying. Is there any way to fix this or I\u0027m misunderstanding anything? \n\nAppreciate any help in advance.\n\nedit:\n\nIt seems to be caused by non-english character in the directory path ( Chinese in my case ). Which can be easily fix by rename the path. It should still be fixed or warn the players, though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T13:44:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 01:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EwingKang**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T11:25:47Z","Content":"I suggest you redownload KSP EwingKang, or if you are using Steam try a cache verification.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

You actually inspired me with my little experiment.\n\nI bought the game directly from the store on the website. I redownload it again and found it executed without problem on desktop. Then I move whole KSP folder into my gaming directory, the bug struck again. Which reminds me another bug I\u0027ve encounter with a image process software called hugin. \n\nNevertheless, I rename my directory, make it english-character only, and BOOM! Everything is fixed!\n\nMy gaming directory used to contain Chinese path, e.g. D:\u00C3\u00A8\u00C2\u00BB\u00C5\u00B8\u00C3\u00A9\u00C2\u00AB\u00E2\u20AC/ksp-win-1-0-4/... That seems to cause the problem.\n\nThis is probably definately a bug I would say. Though it might not be that inportant since the texture of these two module are the only one that\u0027s affected I\u0027ve seen so far, it would be nice to be noted somewhere like in the wiki.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T13:43:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 01:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EwingKang**\n  \ntypesetting"}]}
