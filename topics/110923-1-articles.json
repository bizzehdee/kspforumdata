After all that time spent and fraustration i finally reached orbit of Kerbin where i encountered the KRAKEN... Now the asteroid and the ship is gaining speed from somewhere so the apoapsis and periapsis is constantly changing. Even new ships i send to space started encountring this infinite thrust after getting out of the atmosphere so i am going to return to an older save. Now i don\u0027t want to go trough this again so would it be stable to use lets say like 4 claws at the side of the ship and then decouple the engine from the back and couple it to the side thus creating a stable platform that can push the E class asteroid without causing KRAKEN problems?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T20:58:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T19:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel your pain... the claw is \u003Cem\u003Esuch\u003C/em\u003E kraken-bait, and has been for a really long time. I\u0027m sorry I don\u0027t have more concrete advice for you-- my own solution is \u0022don\u0027t use the claw, ever, and just ignore asteroids completely.\u0022 Which I realize doesn\u0027t help you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experience is that \u0022more claws\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean \u0022less kraken,\u0022 but quite the reverse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from kraken problems, though, one thing that can help with the \u0022wobbling back and forth\u0022 problem is to keep your torque and your thrust entirely separate. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Your main ship has engine thrust and a single claw on the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Put docking ports on the sides and give it a couple (or 3, or 4) little robot \u0022daughter ships\u0022 that are just a claw, command probe, some monopropellant \u0026amp; RCS thrusters, and big heavy reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When you dock your main ship to the asteroid, detach the daughter ships and have them move to a different part of the asteroid and latch on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Then you go and carefully disable ALL sources of torque on the mother ship: turn off all reaction wheels, disable any torque on the command pod, make sure that its engine is gimbal-locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Now you\u0027re good to go: your main thrust won\u0027t waggle (since it has no torque authority), and your little daughter ships can handle torquing the \u0027roid to the orientation you want (since they\u0027re not thrusting, it doesn\u0027t matter if they waggle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother approach I\u0027ve done is to \u003Cem\u003Epull\u003C/em\u003E the asteroid instead of pushing: the claw is on the \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C/em\u003E of the craft, and it has engines that stick way out to the sides on booms so that their exhaust goes past the asteroid. This works like a charm... except it\u0027s limited to smaller asteroids (wouldn\u0027t want to try anything bigger than a C), and I haven\u0027t tried launching such a contraption in 1.0\u002B, I imagine it would be an aerodynamic nightmare.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T20:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI feel your pain... the claw is \u003Cem\u003Esuch\u003C/em\u003E kraken-bait,\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah just tried multiple claws before you posted that and it even got worse... The frikin prograde and retrograde location was moving as the asteroid moves... It was even moving the ap and pe up down into kerbin then outside of kerbin on top of that sometimes it was even showing me kerbin escape... How can this be so broken its like you have to create trial and error style crafts and hope that it doesn\u0027t cause KRAKEN attacks.. It is not something that rarely causes bugs but its like something that causes a bug %90 of the time when you try moving an E class asteroid. I have moved smaller asteroids before and there was no problem but when the asteroid is an E class the claw itself isn\u0027t strong enough to keep the ship straight and it bents under the movement causing all sorts of problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am considering to pull the asteroid as you stated since that might actually work yet that is going to come at a high price. Since the asteroid is so big i have to put the thrusters with atleast 30 to 45 degrees which will create cosine losses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T21:02:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T22:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you a KAS user?

Either my game is broken or my save i don\u0027t know which but this asteroid just keeps on causing the ap and pe change all the time as it turns so i honestly don\u0027t know what to do? Maybe the asteroid im trying to bring back is bugged? Or is this a normal behaviour and it should just be left alone? I haven\u0027t towed a 3500t asteroid before so i honestly don\u0027t know what to do.. Kraken attacks every time without question then the whole game breaks... I can\u0027t even leave it like that since even new crafts that i launch gets cought into kraken infinite thrust after they get off the atmosphere for some reason. This only happens if i fiddle with the asteroid tho so if i leave it alone there doesn\u0027t seem to be any problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T19:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDang, I just took a contract to push a class E out of the solar system.
