They all have some sort of niche, some use case where they are ideal. That said, there are two items that have me scratching my head: the advanced inline stabilizer, and the stack separators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advanced inline stabilizer is a 1.25m reaction wheel part. However, there is another 1.25m reaction wheel part: the inline reaction wheel. This other part comes earlier in the tech tree, and has exactly the same stats as the advanced variant... with one difference: it is lighter. So I am asking myself: if I have two parts that are mounted in an identical fashion and perform an identical function with identical stats, except that one of the two is lighter and researched earlier than the other - why do I need the other part at all? What does the inline advanced stabilizer do that the inline reaction wheel doesn\u0027t, that justifies its existance with higher weight and more difficult access?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, the stack separators. In this case, I do understand where they function differently than decouplers - they eject both sides away from them instead of just one side. That still leaves the question though, as to why I would need that? A normal decoupler is lighter, comes much earlier in the tech tree, and achieves the same end result: cutting the rocket in half. All the separator does is add another part of space debris into the mix, because it floats off on its own, and that\u0027s bad. So where is the use case for stack separators?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for taking the time to enlighten me! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-01T17:01:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2014 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T16:16:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EThe advanced inline stabiliser also adds ASAS functionality to your craft if it doesn\u0027t have a command part that has it (holds your craft\u0027s orientation when you press \u0027T\u0027).\u003C/span\u003E *edit* My bad, that was before they changed how it works...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the stack separators, sometimes you want to separate two things from each other without leaving the decoupler ring stuck to one of them.
