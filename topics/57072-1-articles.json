Anyways... I launched a habitable module first, though it had an unmanned control unit and no people on board. The module had a hub of 5\u002B1 docking ports (a cross plus one on top, and one on the other end of the module). I then launched a series of identical tanker modules, designed to rendezvous with the station as a big orange tank \u002B monopropellant (RCS) tank \u002B docking port \u002B probe core \u002B MechJeb. I launched four, and in the end I had a station at 100km orbit, with 4 orange tanks and a habitable module. I then designed a tanker that would carry about one largest white tank full of fuel to orbit (is that like 400? think so) and some monopropellant too. I launched those until I had 4 orange tanks full of fuel and 4 large mono tanks full. Now I could launch a heavy craft, refuel it in orbit and shoot for whatever planet I wanted. I was so happy I took a hiatus from playing this (RL, you know). When I came back, 23 was out, and I just started all over again : )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T22:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost certainly.

This may have been overdoing it a bit, but I put together a mothership for a Duna trip consisting of a pair of nearly identical Command Modules \u002B Landers \u002B Rover docked to a Jumbo tank with a Kethane rig \u002B probe for mapping (Kethane and ScanSat). This whole thing was sent to Duna and aerobraked into orbit (using Deadly Re-entry, so I needed that inflatable heat shield). Anyway - it required 4 launches (minimum) to get everything in space, where I then assembled, found out I built the Kethane rig wrong, launched a new rig, docked it, then launched refueling missions to top off the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do orbital construction using stock only parts, I recommend using the Clamp-o-Tron Sr. to get a good strong connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/8iXNrM8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8iXNrM8.png\u0022 alt=\u00228iXNrM8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/DXiFO9g\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DXiFO9g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DXiFO9g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrisb2e9","CreatedById":87224,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T23:34:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Soda Popinski\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Soda Popinski\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do orbital construction using stock only parts, I recommend using the Clamp-o-Tron Sr. to get a good strong connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7460/10298606565_e1e05315d7_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210298606565_e1e05315d7_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also dock more than one port at a time. it\u0027s hard to do, but it makes the rocket nice and symmetrical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T08:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made my mother ship to Eeloo using 4 docked orange tanks with probes,rcs,and sr dock port :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cancanaja","CreatedById":96301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T11:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisb2e9\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisb2e9\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7460/10298606565_e1e05315d7_o.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://farm8.staticflickr.com/7460/10298606565_e1e05315d7_o.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also dock more than one port at a time. it\u0027s hard to do, but it makes the rocket nice and symmetrical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow did you add the struts after the ship was built?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T18:25:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cancanaja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cancanaja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow did you add the struts after the ship was built?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe probably used the Docking Struts mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toric5","CreatedById":58046,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T21:44:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eno, if you look closely, the crafts are always strutted to themselves.
