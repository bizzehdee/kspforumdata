I do have to tell you though, that this challenge very lackluster. Most veteran KSP\u0027ers can land on Bop without much difficulty, as it has a very low surface gravity and is not extremely difficult to get to following a Jool Aerobrake. If you would like to keep this challenge, change it up a little - add more criteria such as \u0022Lowest weight on Bop,\u0022 because just landing as a challenge is... boring. Anyone can decide to do that on their own. Please do take note of the Challenge submission guidelines at the top of Challenges forum, because i believe you\u0027re violating rules #1, #3 and #5. By the way, why would your Main Score be based off of Fuel starting - Part count? I could build my ship with 16 Rockomax -64\u0027s at the start before my transfer, with 2880 fuel apiece for 1 part. Try just the part count as a score.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile i do have to put in a disclaimer that i haven\u0027t yet landed on Bop, i have a ship in the works for it. Plenty of other Forum Mods may come to tell you that this isn\u0027t worth the challenge as it stands though, so i recommend revision. Also note that many players like to see an attempt by the challenger before attempting the challenge, so don\u0027t give us challenges just because you \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E they might be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"plainawesome","CreatedById":76282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T17:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the pointers, Dynamo, how about this for a challenge, you have to fly to the Mun, but, your spacecraft is limited to 3500 units of fuel\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T03:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EErr?
