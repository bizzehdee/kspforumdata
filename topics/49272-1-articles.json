In an atmosphere, air molecules hit the thermometer and exchange heat with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are particles in interplanetary space. Almost entirely the solar wind. The solar wind is predominately protons and electrons ejected from the Sun. At Earth-like distances from the Sun, the solar wind density is tiny: often in the range of a few to tens of particles per cubic centimeter. At that density, they can not come into thermal equilibrium with a thermometer. If you slapped a thermometer on a spacecraft, all you could measure is the temperature of the spacecraft due to solar radiation. That is valuable info, but not a measurement of the environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kruleworld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kruleworld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is annoying. i\u0027m sure NASA did temperature scans at varying distances from the sun to track it\u0027s fall off and so forth. also it\u0027d be interesting to see a difference in temperature from direct sunlight and in shadow of planet/body.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes they have, but not with thermometers. Here\u0027s some data going out to about 70 AU for the solar wind proton temperature: \u003Ca href=\u0022ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/plasma/publications/jdr_radial_temp2/jdr_radial_temp2.withthumbs.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eftp://space.mit.edu/pub/plasma/publications/jdr_radial_temp2/jdr_radial_temp2.withthumbs.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL:DR: until about 30 AU, the proton temperature falls off at about 1/T^0.5 to 1/T^0.7. After that, it starts to heat up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this brings up the question of what temperature means. One thermodynamic definition of temperature is the average kinetic energy in a system. A glass of water at room temperature is surrounded by air molecules with the same average kinetic energy as the molecules in the glass and the molecules of water. Thermal radiation and particle collisions even out the average kinetic energy until all parts have the same temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space things work a bit differently. Solar wind particles don\u0027t interact the way gases interact for multiple reasons: they are low density charged particles in a magnetic field. In fact, the solar wind electrons and protons typically have different temperatures! The electron distribution and the proton distribution don\u0027t interact so much on a particle by particle basis, but instead as a group. As a result they don\u0027t readily come into thermal equilibrium with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way you measure plasma temperatures is by measuring the velocities of a large sample of solar wind particles and fitting the distribution of velocities to a Gaussian distribution to determine the bulk properties: density, average velocity, temperature, pressure. This is one of the ways Voyager and many other spacecraft measure temperature. You can also measure temperature by looking at plasma waves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can associate a temperature with the solar radiation spectrum, but really it\u0027s the intensity or energy flux that matters. That temperature won\u0027t change as you get farther from the sun. You can sample the relative flux vs distance from Kerbol with a solar panel though. I haven\u0027t checked, but I hope they follow a 1/r^2 relation. That is just measuring the fact that the solar panel is catching a smaller patch of sunlight farther it is from the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe temperature difference between sunlight and planetary shadow isn\u0027t really a sensible question. The temperature of what? Solar radiation just passes through space more or less unimpeded. It doesn\u0027t have a big effect on the plasma temperatures. Space isn\u0027t so much hot or cold as it is empty. The temperature of a spacecraft or a Kerbal on EVA on the other hand is a sensible question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think it\u0027s good that thermometers only function near bodies. Though I do agree that they could give a zero science value report, rather than an error message.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-08T10:03:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2014 10:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Yasmy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T09:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll four science instruments have areas where they don\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thermometer doesn\u0027t work while \u0022high in space above \u0026lt;celestial\u0026gt;\u0022.
