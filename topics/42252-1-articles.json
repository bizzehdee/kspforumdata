I\u0027m a senior computer science student in louisiana, but honestly I have no idea how to apply what I know to anything practical. Pretty sad education, eh? I\u0027m kidding, my concentration is Web Design, not game design. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I know how to use 3DS Max and one of my classes starting in 2 weeks is on Maya. I also know Illustrator/Photoshop very well. On top of that my coding knowledge is several years of C\u002B\u002B and the various web languages like HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, etc etc. The sad thing is I have no idea what to do with what I know (unless it\u0027s for a website, lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, with all that in mind I want to get into modding cause I\u0027m bored out of my mind with school and want to learn something practical. If someone would like to help me learn I\u0027d really appreciate that and would return the favor in any way possible. Any guides or help for getting started?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T02:49:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-Last-updated-10th-August\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-Last-updated-10th-August\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis will get you started - I have a lot of good intentions to start myself but no time\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VerdammteSeele","CreatedById":77390,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T04:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuite involved.

I\u0027m not going to point you to the big thread of tutorial threads as You have prolly already found it stickied, you already have all of the skills that you need. The biggest advantage is that you already know all of the \u0022concepts\u0022 that you need so I would suggest that you start small, bash out a model and a texture and then pass it through the Unity system and get it in game, I\u0027d expect it to take you about 2 hours to tweak and get your head around Unity for your first project but don\u0027t fear as it has a very Autodesk feel \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E there are plenty of tutorials, I watched a full hour length video by LLL that showed him creating an object right from the very first primitive and that was more than enough to get me up to speed (and then right back down the scale as soon as I tried to get fancy hehe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!
