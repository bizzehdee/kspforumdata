Well, I asked the winter owl about this along time ago, and he sugested to me MSI Afterburner. Its a great video recorder for free (well, its better than fraps, specially with resources). The only problem with it is that it doesn\\\u0027t record audio, but that can be done by another program if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB.

Well, if you doing lets plays, be different, be patient, and have fun. If just doing non frequent videos, then have fun is the only thing needed to be said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED. Um, well, if the game is lagging without a video recorder working, well, your out of luck, as there is no way that its going to run well with the recorder in the background. If not, but running other things in the background is a little too much, then go for something like MSI or BandiCam (though I can\\\u0027t recomend BandiCam, because I haven\\\u0027t used it, but aparently its good).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandit4910","CreatedById":14446,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-28T20:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ED.
