Since all subsequent contracts require a 2nd condition, besides the suborbital flight and since sub-orbital condition gets completed when doing something else, this design is dead, at least for me. I use a 9 ton passenger orbiter, which lifts a full hitchhiker container into orbit and the main stage gets recovered. The blasted thing costs 50k, but you get 22k back for landing the engine stage close to KSC and a further 20k for recovering the orbiter, so I only lose around 10k per mission. Just for fun, I tried building an asparagus stage Lifter that hauls same module into orbit. It costs 10k less, but you can\u0027t recover the stages, except the last engine and the orbiter itself.\n\nMy 9 ton orbiter:\n\n[![screenshot3_zpsjjkew2co.png](http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h313/Zamolxes77/screenshot3_zpsjjkew2co.png)](http://s67.photobucket.com/user/Zamolxes77/media/screenshot3_zpsjjkew2co.png.html)\n\nand its very fuel efficient (but not economic without a stage recovery mod) brother:\n\n[![screenshot4_zpshhbtacy7.png](http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h313/Zamolxes77/screenshot4_zpshhbtacy7.png)](http://s67.photobucket.com/user/Zamolxes77/media/screenshot4_zpshhbtacy7.png.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Trenchfoot","CreatedById":92783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:26:33Z","Content":"just fyi, your posting the incorrect link for your pic to show on the forum..."},{"CreatedByName":"g.koster","CreatedById":115794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:36:33Z","Content":"Mine is an rb5 connected to 3 LT45 with 11 smallest tanks and 6 rb10 on those all topped up with an mk1 pod (10 in total) and 13 parachutes (3 on extra structural elements). good for getting them suborbital. good for 9 turist in one go.
