I can bring my ship down to the ground without issues but slowing down is confusing me. The lowest I can get is about 20m/s before I start rising again and have to cut my engines to lower down, usually resulting in either crashing or my capsule bouncing across the surface. What is the technique to removing the \u0022bounce\u0022 from my landing and coming down smooth onto the surface?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyre","CreatedById":20921,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T02:15:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you still have horizontal velocity to kill.

What does you ship look like (in screenshots)? Maybe you could get close to the speed you want with the main engine, and then use RCS bursts to fine-tune. You might also build your lander shorter and wider, in which case you can bounce a little and still land upright. But mostly I suspect that if you\u0027re going sideways 20m/s as you\u0027re about to touch down, you\u0027re waiting too long to cancel your horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T11:24:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the nav ball shows velocity so if you\u0027re showing 20m/s on that while your vertical speed indicator is reading 0 then it\u0027s horizontal speed - you can either tilt your rocket slightly and use the main engine to kill it or use RCS via the IJKL keys.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-29T13:02:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2012 01:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by EndlessWaves\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legal2k","CreatedById":26945,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T12:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry starting descent from high orbit (~50 Km or so).After main retroburn to lower periapsis.
