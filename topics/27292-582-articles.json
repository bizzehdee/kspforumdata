If you plan to actually build anything there with Extraplanetary Launchpads you should make sure you have all of the parts on either landing gear or wheels. This is because as you mine ore and produce rocket parts your base\u0027s center of mass will change and cause parts to rotate slightly. KAS joints will carry this rotation over into the workshop and the garden and cause them to clip into the ground. You won\u0027t see this unless you time warp. When you break warp or come back to the base after a while the parts that clipped into the ground will rebound upward, either destroying themselves (most likely) or causing your entire base to flip out of control. The base is usually destroyed when this happens. The effect is magnified as the diameter of your base increases.\u003Cp\u003EHaving parts on landing gear or wheels allows the gear\u0027s suspension to act as a buffer to this rotation, preventing the rebound. Landing gear (note the legs, not the wheel gear) has more wiggle room than wheels when it comes to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been experiencing this already D: Fortunately it hasn\u0027t gotten so bad that it\u0027s tearing itself apart, but it does fly up into the air for a few seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould re-attaching the pipes fix it?

Now THIS is the weirdest thing that has ever happened to me while playing Kerbal Space Program. (And this is from the guy who managed to ram his mapping satellite into the Statue in front of the desert Pyramid Complex...while the satellite was in orbit, and, presumably, the Statue was not. Sort of like how your spaceplane can accidentally run into the VAB while the spaceplane is way out over the end of the runway...only more so.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway. These freaky things happen when I\u0027ve been playing KSP for an extended period (which used to be maybe half a day...but now may be an hour or so), and the game is apparently about the crash. But sometimes mayhem ensues first. Textures go wonky. You can hit things that aren\u0027t where they are. Controls fail to respond. Stuff like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...I was playing in my Developing Duna mission (link in signature). Aldner Kerman just returned from an exciting mission testing the DunaDog ion plane, and he was ready to get out of the ship. So I clicked EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly there were \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000CD;\u0022\u003ETWO ALDNERS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E flying off away from the ship, tumbling end over end.

But just getting out of a cockpit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game did indeed bug out after that, refusing to return the the Space Center.

Wait...no, no...they are both standing on Duna, so neither one of them could be antimatter Aldner. Besides, if that was the case I would have expected them to fly off in opposite directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture of the weirdness...not that you can tell anything from the picture.
