(The difference is that the magma at any depth is effectively solid, it is only vast volumes of magma which are capable of rising.) This convection process brings heavy elements up to the sub-crust layers, and they get deposited there at places where new crust is forming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext off, once heavy elements get trapped in the crust (whether they are in compounds or unreacted), they are locked in place and unable to move down. There is some degree of extra force due to their greater density, but it isn\u0027t enough to break the rock matrix they are in allowing them to slip through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, there is no process by which heavy elements can sink through the magma. While at the surface magma can liquefy, at depth, under pressure, it is effectively solid and lead and other heavy metals are effectively trapped within the magma matrix, unable to diffuse down through the magma. It is only once magma has risen high enough in the mantle that it liquefies that heavier elements can start to settle out, and that is usually only when the magma is on the point of converting into crust (or spewing out of a volcano) when they get trapped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETectonic activity can affect the way minerals are presented in the crust. When a mountain range is lifted up due to the pressure of colliding tectonic plates, all minerals within the rock are lifted up, regardless of density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, water tends to segregate different minerals within the crust. In many places at many times during the Earth\u0027s history there have been flows of cold water down into the lower crust where it tends to dissolve many minerals, including those that are not soluble at surface conditions but \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E soluble at great pressures and temperatures. The hot, mineral-rich water then rises, and deposits minerals at whatever depth is cool enough for them to precipitate out, without regard to their density. The same column of water can deposit many different minerals at different depths. This is how many heavy elements tend to end up in surface seams where we can mine them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there are lots of reasons why dense minerals can be found at the surface of the Earth, but they all, ultimately, depend on the unimaginably vast reservoir of heat at the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings will be very different on worlds that have never had a liquid core. Such planets will have been effectively solid ever since they got warm enough for gasses and liquids to separate out from the rock matrix and for the rock to consolidate. In those cases, there is a good chance that minerals will be present in the rocks at almost uniform distributions throughout. The only possible cause for variation in density will be if there was variety in the composition of the rocks and dust that aggregated to form the planet in the first place, but this is likely to be small-scale variation in distribution rather than any large variation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T19:26:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by softweir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded quote to make it clear who I was responding to.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T22:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat does not answer the question.
