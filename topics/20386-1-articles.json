Its meant for Interplanetary travel, It may be slow, but its MUTCH more effeciant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T00:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for answering so fast!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re answers asnwered at my question,thank you(again)!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
