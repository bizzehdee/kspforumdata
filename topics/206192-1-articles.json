I was able to de-orbit this beast from 15Km to the Mun and it\u0027s performed fairly nicely once landed. Once landed I\u0027m able to use the spiders (which are on servos) to lift off and land, then switching to the rear facing engine (not visible in the picture) I can get it across canyons and craters. The rear facing engine was also used for de-orbiting, but once I got within a couple hundred meters of the ground I switched to the spiders, leveled out, and landed it horizontally.\u00A0 I use action groups to switch between sets of engines, and between pitch control and the servos I can get fairly good forward and backward motion for shorter hops.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce landed I empty the upper tanks into the lower ones manually, but that\u0027s because I forgot about setting fuel priorities.
