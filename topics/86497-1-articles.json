Noting that there was still no IVA, I decided I would roll the cockpit over to the flag pole and climb up it. As the cockpit rolled past, I put the Kerbal (Fredfrod Kerman) out on EVA and let the pod keep rolling. He slid along the ground past the flag, and when he stopped and stood up, the screen went black, leaving only the HUD elements. Map view was also entirely black save for the HUD. Going back to the space center screen, it turned out that was also gone except for the HUD. I attempted to load a quicksave from before the event, but it was the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshot: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fumoz1yq2hfdopc/nothingtoseehere.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fumoz1yq2hfdopc/nothingtoseehere.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fsf3c5abzk0stq5/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fsf3c5abzk0stq5/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELog: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/luykb4y80v7q7y8/KSP.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/luykb4y80v7q7y8/KSP.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESystem Specs: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/a43ynqu8tggu94e/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/a43ynqu8tggu94e/DxDiag.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
