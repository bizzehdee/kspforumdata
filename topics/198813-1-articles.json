Please can you let us know and possibly when that might happen please. It runs so much better already on XB Series X, hardly any lag and pretty responsive now. Would like an update bringing it in line with PC version if possible. Any thoughts anyone? Any comment Squad would be appreciated. Thanks for a great game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
