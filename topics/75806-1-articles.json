Long, tall, and skinny, so the CoM is as far forward as possible. Minimize radial boosters because these move the CoM back, but they can be used if necessary. The current version of FAR isn\u0027t so picky here; not long ago, about the only way to use radial boosters was to attach them to the upper stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB. Big tailfeathers on the bottom stage. I usually use stock delta wings with the large control surfaces on them. FAR likes 4 of them. It\u0027s gotten better recently with using 3 fins but 4 still is preferred. You have the choice of putting them on the cardinal angles or the diagonals. If you put them on the cardinals, be sure to set 2 for pitch, 2 for yaw, and all for roll. If you put them on the diagonals, don\u0027t bother with their axes. NOTE: If you drop this stage while still in relatively thick air, you probably will need small tailfeathers (AV-8R) on the 2nd stage as well. Be sure to balance the CoM and CoL of just that part of the rocket too, just like you do for the whole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC. RCS. Put an inline RCS tank just below the payload and 3 sets of quad thruster blocks at the bottom end of each stage in the stack. Activate RCS as soon as you launch. This really helps MJ keep the thing stable. It\u0027s also required to orient a long, tall rocket for the circularization burn at Ap, and if you\u0027re launching really heavy payloads. These RCS thrusters aren\u0027t for docking, they\u0027re for steering. The payload will have its own for docking if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MJ settings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Start the turn at 1-3km. This gives you enough airspeed for the control surfaces to have decent bite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use a 65% curve or so, so the beginning of the curve is very gentle and it steepens as you get higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Finish the turn at 100km so you never quite get totally horizontal in the atmosphere. If you set the turn finish at 70km, often MJ will have your rocket slightly nose-down in the upper air, which can cause problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Limit to terminal velocity (of course)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Avoid overheats (usually not a problem because....)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. ...Limit acceleration to 15-20m/s. This is mostly if your 1st stage (at least, maybe 2nd as well) has a TWR \u0026gt; 1.5 or so.

There is a patch by sarbian that has basic FAR support, but I\u0027m not sure how useful it actually is. Either way, you can leave Limit To Terminal Velocity on or off, it doesn\u0027t make a difference as MJ thinks that because your craft has no drag, it has an infinitely high terminal velocity.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to disagree with this. I think MJ\u0027s recently got a bit smarter on this than before and takes FAR into account. I seem to recall actually reading that in the MJ thread. And my observations back this up. If you have FAR, limiting to terminal velocity results in higher speeds at lower altitudes than without FAR. So the setting definitely makes a difference, even with FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T13:54:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry missed that, so we were on the same sheet of music just talking about it in different ways.

This expends less energy purely to gain altitude, incurring reduced gravity losses, and extracts a little more energy from the Oberth effect by conducting the horizontal acceleration slightly deeper in the gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
