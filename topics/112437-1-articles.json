Your debug log will have a null reference exception. The bug is mostly experienced if you are using claws. A certain part will keep their speed vector, resulting in deorbiting or tearing the craft apart in physics timewarp. It usually won\u0027t let you non-phys timewarp saying that the craft is under acceleration, or if it does let you timewarp, the craft will fall apart explosively after slowing down again, due to that one part keeping the old speed vector, while the rest of the craft transitions to a new one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bug can sometimes be counteracted by undock, save, reload, redock, but it can take a few tries. Sonetimes a simple quicksave quickload also fixes the problem, but not always.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: After 1.0.2 this bug can also happen if you pack a utility bay with too many parts, especially physicsless parts.

It\u0027s due to the intakes being placed using symmetry mode. For some odd reason it causes the mirrored part to take in less air than the root part, which in turn also causes unequal drag and engine thrust. I\u0027ve solved it by changing how I design planed by first for example, placing an intake on the left side, followed by a jet engine.
