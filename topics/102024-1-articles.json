Most games have a scaling system where, the player starts small and gets bigger, better things (this does happen in career) but... Over time, the challenges the player is presented with get more difficult faster then the player gets his new trinkets that makes it easier... (this part is not in KSP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contracts kind of do this (which is why they are probably less annoying than science) but not enough to motivate the player to push through a tough situation.. You can just x away contracts until an easy one pops up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only current proposal I\u0027ve seen to this has been rival agencies (who would step up their game to make the career harder as the player got new parts and such, the player would have to do more impressive feats with less than them..).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other ideas ?

Currently, none of them really exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Time challenges. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the only time challenge is the transfer burn times for efficient rendezvous with other orbital bodies. These optimal burn times can be ignored with enough dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no other cause for time to be considered, in stock. TacLS gives you a realistic issue for your crews, but that\u0027s self-imposed at launch time, it\u0027s not an external challenge of the game itself. Again, with enough dV, you can overcome it by over-supplying any particular mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause there\u0027s no pressure, this is not a challenge vector currently. Even an \u0027Oh My God the Asteroid is coming on x date!\u0027 type of pressure might be useful. However, that\u0027s a Kerbin SOI level of difficulty, and not solar system level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Knowledge vs. Execution\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to Dwarf Fortress, once you know what you\u0027re doing, the challenge is in execution. However, execution does not ramp up in difficulty to proceed. If you take, for example, a side scrolling shooter, then the difficulty is increased against this by adding more versatile enemies, bullet storms, etc. KSP does not lend itself to this type of challenge vector. Unless you have invading aliens or something...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowledge gained is kept, and once learned doesn\u0027t need to be applied much differently at the end than at the beginning. Land once on Mun and Kerbin and you have the basic knowledge tools you need for landing anywhere (besides on Jool). While it may require different variables (Eve\u0027s gravity vs. Gilly\u0027s, for example, require a different approach) the execution method doesn\u0027t really change as a challenge, unless it\u0027s self imposed to \u0022Do It Better\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Limited Resources\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is currently a vector in career mode, and is the cause of the \u0027grind\u0027. Science, similarly, is also a vector in this category. Additional to this is the need to upgrade your buildings at the KSP to get access to useful tools and/or large enough ships for the dV required. All of these force you to perform tasks with less than optimal setups. However, this challenge is avoided due to contract declines and contract churn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaid declines and churn however are necessary, as the contract system is far too variable and procedural to allow for it to be enforced. I offer you the following scenario: All you have is part test contracts worth less than the part costs you. You have three satellite missions and they\u0027re all at Tylo and Lathe, and a good transfer window won\u0027t open up for 2 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless the contract system is made less procedural and more coherent and consistent, it\u0027s not a valid vector to enforce as the only path to the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA similar idea to this is the competing agencies, causing either auctioning of contracts for lowest bid or competition of the limited resource of a contract pool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T03:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure the scaling in difficulty can be done eventually with new planets/moons or reworking the current Kerbol System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the ships I have build on Kerbin and launched had about 8k dV.
