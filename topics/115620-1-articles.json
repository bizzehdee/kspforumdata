What makes it war edition? It has a full carbody (i.e. it\u0027s railings are replaced with extra walling to armor it more) and it\u0027s armed with two Beamwing I missiles peeking out of the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring testing, I had another SD40-2WE come up behind the primary one, and both missiles were fired into the missile space of the first one, but hardly any damage was done due to the close-range shots of its missiles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore testing will be done before ULW releases its SD40-2WE.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
