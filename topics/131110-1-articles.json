I imagine its a support nightmare when thousands of new players start screaming about bugs, and needing support for old versions, that have already been fixed or addressed... I mean, how many times have we seen people post about mods having bugs and being completely broken, only to find out they are using an old, unsupported version, or they installed it incorrectly?....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dfthu","CreatedById":80296,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T19:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can download the old free KSP Versions here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22879-old-versions-of-ksp-some-versions-still-wanted/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22879-old-versions-of-ksp-some-versions-still-wanted/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
