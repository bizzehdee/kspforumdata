It\u0027s because at the moment of loading the content, the game\u0027s software has lots and lots of setup work to perform, invoking new objects and getting them all squared away with the game engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way to avoid load times is to spread the loading out over the entire duration of the program so its a continuous process as you walk toward new terrain on the edge of your \u0022vision\u0022, rather than something that happens at single specific points. (i.e. instead of \u0022wait 30 seconds every 10 minutes\u0022 it becomes \u0022accept a smaller FPS all the time all along.\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the approach taken by KSP when you are near the ground and it\u0027s trying to load ground polygons. For about 5-6 km around you, there are polygons loaded for the terrain (it\u0027s a longer radius than the 2.5 km for ships, but still rather short). As you move along, it unloads the polygons from behind you and loads up more in front of you, continually. (The rest of the distant terrain you see isn\u0027t made of \u0022full fledged\u0022 polygons. For one thing, the far away polygons are much less precise, and also they have no collision detection enabled on them and they are just passive do-nothing scenery. You can\u0027t crash into the mountian you see in the distance, until you get closer and the game starts replacing the placeholder do-nothing polygons with the real full-fledged physical ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T22:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eloading screens then starting games will stay, they have two purposes, one is to load data the other is to process them (doing the stuff told then KSP starts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoading screens for levels can be avoided by preloading and preprocessing the data before the next scene, this is done in lots of games with huge open areas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever doing this in huge scale is very memory expensive and you want you game to be able to run on a system with less memory too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if systems get more powerful you add more stuff, you have many games with more than 20GB data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old Nintendo systems did not have load times was pretty much without load times as the carriages was pretty fast while they only had to load KB of data as the system could not handle more.
