The initial article I read had stated that, if they did exist, they\u0027d be hard to find if not impossible using current technology. I find that a bit hard to swallow however, especially since our current technology allows us to see (visually) exoplanets such as Fomalhaut b and HD 189733b. TNOs are interesting to begin with, and these more-so ... at least the implications in this new \u0027theory\u0027.
