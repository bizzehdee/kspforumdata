I had thought about the way that .22 expanded upon the KSP Universe and how without any major tweaks to the game world other than an updated KSC the devs managed to add a considerable amount of content simply by locking items away and adding point system to acquire the unlocks. Looking at the weekly dev updates it seems this also left them a bit of an opportunity to clean up some old game code and get a bit of a performance boost too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is what do you guys think Squad could add in the future that would flesh out the Career mode as heavily as possible whilst minimizing workload? I\u0027m sure we would all enjoy some new planets to visit someday but in the meantime would a financial system provide the extra layer you need to be planning missions more efficiently? Or perhaps a few preset tasks from Squad that could be the building blocks of mission further down the line?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027m more an advocate of seeing Space Stations, Rovers and Probes become more important one day as they are still fairly irrelevant to the games main features currently. But whatever ideas you have I\u0027m just interested to see what you would like from KSP, even if it\u0027s a feature that\u0027s never coming. I know the devs probably already have their own plans for the next few updates, but I\u0027d like to know what the community would do differently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see the vanilla recourse system\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetter aerodynamics and new aircraft parts to replace the current place-holders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way would be, to complete the Biomes for other planets and rebalance the Tech-Tree (with regards to costs of Nodes, as well as parts associated to Nodes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I assume adding Resources and Heat-Management (including Reentry Heat) might add aditional parts to populate the tree\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EResources or a better Aero system and a revamping of those parts\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainArchmage","CreatedById":82533,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:32:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see a resources extraction system, in preference to any other additions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbonautical","CreatedById":75532,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow I\u0027m surprised how much the Aerodynamics have already shown up!

At some point, probably after 0.23, allowing Science points to unlock enhancements to parts (more thrust or ISP boosts for engines, lower mass for parts, better efficiency for solar panels and RTGs, whatever).

As it is rovers are also rather pointless since the biomes are huge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImo, the way to make science more interesting is to take the biome idea and apply it to your landing area on a small scale. As you get down to the surface the system would procedurally generate a map of the area based on some random noise, just like how craters are done. Then you can gather samples and do experiments in different mini biomes for more science (obviously balanced so this isn\u0027t too OP). This gives you more incentive to move around a bit, explore the area and gives rovers an advantage over stationary platforms. Later on these mini biomes could have different textures or groundscatter to give the terrain much more interesting features on a small scale level (Bare rocks, sand, boulder field, small crater etc) so the planets look less uniform.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor next release?
