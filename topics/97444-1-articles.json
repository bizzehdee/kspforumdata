NASA and other space agencies have already thought about electrolysis of urine for different purposes. As mentioned before, the ISS already uses electrolysis of waste water for oxygen generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to go about using waste products is to convert them back into usable materials rather than expelling them. That requires energy, but the advantage of just requiring energy is that energy-producing equipment can provide energy for years and years for comparably low weight. What changes is that the \u003Cem\u003Erate\u003C/em\u003E at which energy is generated goes up if you use better (heavier) equipment. If you recycle almost all your matter, you\u0027ll need a lot of energy, but low starting supply weight. If you expel waste matter as a propellant, either through mass driver or converting it into rocket fuel, then that part of your supplies is gone forever, so you need a lot bigger initial supply. This would be the problem with a mass driver expelling solids. (also, amon other problems, accelerating non-ferrous solids without a propellant would be difficult)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you have sufficient resources on-site, then ideas such as converting water into rocket fuel suddenly do become a lot more appealing. Current plans for Mars return missions are looking at rocket fuel procuction on site on Mars in order to save weight on launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence: on missions where raw materials are extremely limited in supply (such as deep space), you want to expel of as little matter as possible because every atom you expel is one you\u0027re never using again. On missions where you have access to a large supply of raw materials, on-site production of goods is very attractive because it saves on launch weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T19:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell now...how about making a mass driver and launch solid waste through it as reaction mass?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHell, just cut to the chase and turn it into a railgun.
