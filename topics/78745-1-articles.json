A DC-8 crashed in Guantanamo Bay in August 1993 after the flight crew botched the approach due to extreme fatigue. It is an infamous example of how flight crew fatigue can lead to accidents. I recall reading in one account that the captain actually experienced little micro sleeps during the approach that lead to lethargy and indifference about the fact that the approach was going very badly. Fortunately, all three people on board survived (it was a cargo flight). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR94-04.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe accident report\u003C/a\u003E includes a transcript of an interview (on Page 51) with the captain (who was the pilot flying) talking about his fatigue during the approach:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AIA flight 808 Captain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AIA flight 808 Captain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll I can say is that I was -- I felt very lethargic or indifferent.

But, even the most healthy people on the planet can fall victim to a fatal cardiac arrest. So there is no way to completely eliminate risk. It\u0027s also impossible to legislate health codes for everyone because everyone is different. The US DOT forces me to drive for 11 hours straight(with the exception of a mandatory 30 min break) because of the way the logbook laws are written. I think this is absolutely ridiculous and somewhat dangerous. I personally feel best when I sleep twice a day, about 6hrs at night, and a 2-3 hour nap in the afternoon. Let me decide what is best for my own health and safety as far as sleep is concerned. However, I also don\u0027t want to see the drug fueled 3-day cross country super truckers anymore either.
