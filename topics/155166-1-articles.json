BDArmory is one of the few mods doing that, and it really makes everything more clear when you have zillions of mods installed. But how does it do that? All I found on that is that it gives its parts \u0022category = none\u0022 in .cfg files but that of course can\u0027t be the only thing you have to do to give the parts a special category. Setting \u0022category = SomeNonStockCategory\u0022 causes an error when the game loads configs.\u00A0Setting \u0022category = none\u0022 without doing anything additional lets the game load but the parts don\u0027t appear in the editor if you don\u0027t use\u00A0advanced categories mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T02:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe you need a plugin of some sort for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, recently a generic plugin has been created for it: Community Category Kit.\u00A0 Details on use are here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BobPalmer/CommunityCategoryKit/wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/BobPalmer/CommunityCategoryKit/wiki\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDestroyer111","CreatedById":160216,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T06:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUhh...
