This is my first time attempting to use this mod. I started to go through the process of getting log files etc, but I decided to do some troubleshooting myself first, and I\u0027m pretty sure I found the source - but I\u0027m slightly confused as to why the problem\u0027s there at all. Log files won\u0027t help, I don\u0027t think, as the problem is in the .cfg file for a particular part. Any info as to how to fix it would be very much appreciated. I\u0027m on a Mac running OSX 10.9 (Mavericks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m having is associated with the FASA Apollo Command Module and associated parts - the Apollo heat shield, particularly. As you all no doubt are aware, the Apollo CM part from FASA doesn\u0027t normally include the heat shield, which instead is is a separate part attached to the CM\u0027s lower attachment node. When Realism Overhaul is installed into my game, I get the following thing happening (imgur links):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/19gk2oO.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/19gk2oO.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GrunMFE.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/GrunMFE.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImportantly - the heat shield that you see misaligned there is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a separate part that I\u0027ve added. That\u0027s what the CM part now looks like - when RO is installed the CM part has somehow had the heat shield added to it. As you can see, it\u0027s also not placed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, I\u0027ve double-checked that I have up-to-date versions of all the dependencies required for Realism Overhaul and furthermore that I have the latest version of Realism Overhaul itself. Having initially encountered this issue I re-downloaded RO to check that the latest version did indeed have this issue and it did. I was installing RO into KSP along with FAR and RSS and I checked all the dependencies for those as well. Furthermore, I tested adding each individual mod into the game in turn and found that the effect only occurred when RO was present. I have also ensured that I correctly followed all the installation steps for all relevant mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all led me to look into the FASA cfg files included in RO. I found that in the \u0027RO_FASA_ApolloCSM.cfg\u0027 file, within the \u0027@PART[FASAApollo_CM]:FOR[RealismOverhaul]\u0027 part entry, there was the following section:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODEL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E model=FASA/Apollo/ApolloCSM/FASAApollo_Heatshield\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E scale = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E position = 0, -1.371, 0 // 0, -1.271, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E rotation = 0, 0, 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoving this section from the config file got rid of the heat shield from the CSM model and that particular part subsequently seemed to be behaving normally. Again - this is present in the latest-version download, I have double-checked that it isn\u0027t anything I\u0027ve personally done that\u0027s somehow screwed this up. In any case - having deleted this particular bit of the cfg file, the heat shield part itself is now having other issues. I now can\u0027t attach it correctly to the base of the command module - what instead happens is shown here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/rxqMzPh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/rxqMzPh\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with part-clipping enabled I can\u0027t get the heat shield to move up into its proper position - there isn\u0027t a node there to accept it, it seems. I\u0027ve looked at the entry in the config file for the heat shield part and I can\u0027t seem to fix this latest problem. Fiddling around with the node positions doesn\u0027t seem to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really appreciate any help that anyone can give here - I\u0027m slightly nonplussed as to why the entry in the cfg file for the command module part even includes the heat shield at all. Are there an earlier set of config files I could use? If not, what exactly is going on here - is this something that only I am having a problem with? Searching within this thread did not turn up anyone mentioning the same issue as far as I can tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T20:29:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xv323\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wingnutt","CreatedById":146587,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T21:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk did a fresh install of KSP, installed CKAN, installed Realism Overhaul VIA CKAN, installed the required and suggested mods..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet a ton of incompatible warnings on loading saying many of the mods are only 1.02 compatible, game crashes on startup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is legitimately, government papers, retarded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edeleted all content again, installed CKAN, installed ONLY the required mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame now launches, but whatever ungodly POS engine smoke mod this thing is running is absolute GARBAGE.
