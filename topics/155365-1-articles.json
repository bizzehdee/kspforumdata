The issue at hand is that the inputs unity reads are based on the raw output of the joystick, not the calibrated input. This means that even though I had calibrated the X-45 I just bought, the throttle was inverted, didn\u0027t go to 0, and my stick was being read as back and left at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past I have used PPJoy to get around this, but I couldn\u0027t seem to get it working on Windows 10. I have found a replacement in 2 outside applications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst is Vjoy. This was originally meant to be a PPJoy replacement, but they seem to only be developing the back end, and letting others create what they call Feeder applications. However I found someone had written a feeder application called Universal Joystick Remapper. UJR takes the windows modified inputs of a physical stick, and feeds them to the Vjoy virtual stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my solution has KSP reading the Virtual joystick created by Vjoy, which is fed inputs from UJR, which takes the calibrated output of my stick.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe result is perfectly stable control inputs in the game. I hope this helps, I\u0027ve spent about 12 hours researching this. However I can\u0027t tell you how disappointed\u00A0I was when I thought my new joystick would never work in this game. I hope this helps someone else in the same boat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVjoy can be found at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand UJR at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/89279-\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://autohotkey.com/board/topic/89279-\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-21T17:59:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2017 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DeadM0nkey\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T18:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for that!
