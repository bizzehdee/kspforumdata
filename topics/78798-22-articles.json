A balance must be struck between fun and realism, but that balance is much further away from realism right now than most people realize with respect to mods like MKS, Kethane, or EL (all of which I use and love). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I really appreciate all the effort you guys go through to make these mods. And I have a feeling that with ORS you\u0027d have a hard time implementing finite resources because ORS is just not structured for it with those PNGs. But, if you happen to think of an easy way to implement something like that I know I would be very appreciative. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I apologize again for my overly lengthy response. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I know that many people believe that the water on the Moon is from cometary impacts, but I think now-a-days most planetary scientists would agree that the solar wind theory fits the measurements better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info! I really do appreciate it. There are two choices for ORS: One is to dynamically change the PNGs (which I need to fiddle with given Arrowstar\u0027s work anyway). The other is to dynamically change concentrations, which would likely involve a fork of ORS (which I am not opposed to - just not yet!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nowater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nowater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei dont find the 1,25m in techtree \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo u ever sleep?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer or sandbox?
