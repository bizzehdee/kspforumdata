Now stock engine control disables gimbals, and combined control (apparently) disables all engines. Pod torque now appears to behave normally though. Also, I\u0027m still getting gimbal roll authority even when no mode is activated. Is that intended? I don\u0027t mind it but it implies that kerbcom is doing stuff even when the UI says nothing is turned on.\u003Cp\u003Ee: combined control is showing \u0022internal error 04\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUh, yeah, that\u0027s a limitation of the \u0022stock engine control\u0022 mode. I should update that at some point. Combined control should not be disabling engines, and the \u0022internal error 04\u0022 is probably the problem. Please could you post a picture of the craft this is occurring on? Gimbal roll authority whilst KCA is disabled is intended - in this particular state engines use my improved gimbal control mechanism as a replacement of stock gimbal control. You can think of that as an upgrade to the existing behaviour, rather than an avionics feature. For example it will be active even when KCA is not installed on a vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pina_coladas","CreatedById":9346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T19:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImgur was being a giant idiot and it took like 5 tries to upload this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/f3K1c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/f3K1c\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first craft was the one giving me error 4, probably because I had only one set of stupidly placed rcs blocks.
