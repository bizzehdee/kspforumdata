I have TAC life plugin installed, so soon I need to send a big cargo lander to keep them alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T21:10:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by onlinegamesz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T17:29:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re best bet without too many parts is a spaceplane. However, because Eve\u0027s atmosphere does not contain any oxygen you will either need the KSP Interstellar mod for it\u0027s thermal turbojets, or Kethane for it\u0027s Kethane jet. If you don\u0027t want either of those you are going to have to build one heck of a lander and make sure your ladders are placed exactly perfect (Otherwise your kerbal won\u0027t be able to climb up to the command seat)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T17:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis leads me to a thought for a mod - Rokoons on a grand scale.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T17:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll have to design an ascent stage to get them back up, which is one of the game\u0027s big challenges.

Your first task is going to be getting them supplies, which will be tricky enough. You may need to force an out-of-window transfer, which thankfully for Eve isn\u0027t that difficult unless you really are out of time. You\u0027ll also need to land precisely, I might send more than one lander to get extra chances.
