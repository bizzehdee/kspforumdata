Let\u0027s take a trip back in time, to a little over five years ago.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe details are fuzzy, but I do distinctly remember scrolling through youtube in early-to-mid 2017 and coming upon a video titled\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/xuww0F1fXiM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022Kerbal Space Program - 01 - First Flight\u0022\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0by a guy named KurtJMac. Now, I already followed Kurt for his Minecraft Far Lands or Bust series (a journey to the edge of the game\u0027s world that still continues to this day), but I had never watched or even paid any attention to his KSP series - I guess judging a book by its cover syndrome had me. That fateful day, however, I clicked on the video and was presented with a little game about building and flying your own rockets - complete with tiny green astronauts. I was instantly hooked - I\u0027m pretty sure I binged the rest of Kurt\u0027s KSP series after that - and by the end of the year, I had my very own copy of Kerbal Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was immediately faced with the game\u0027s steep learning curve - while I don\u0027t remember experiencing that much adversity getting to orbit or even landing on the Mun (I think the latter took me only two attempts), orbital rendezvous stumped me at first. It didn\u0027t help that I chose an Apollo-style munar orbit rendezvous for my first ever Mun mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter many tutorials, tracking station terminations, and waiting for Jeb, Bill and Bob to respawn, I finally cracked it. Whether it was by skill or dumb luck, I don\u0027t know.\u00A0 Regardless, the sense of accomplishment I got from simply docking two spacecraft in orbit was immense - and that was only the beginning. To this day, I still haven\u0027t landed everywhere, and only just put my first Kerbal on another planet last year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had been interested in spaceflight for most of my life thanks to my dad indoctrinating me, but I don\u0027t think I could ever truly call myself a space\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enerd\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0before I found KSP. I\u0027ve picked up an intuitive sense of how orbital mechanics works, and I certainly wouldn\u0027t have been so deeply entrenched in current IRL space news had it not been for the Science and Spaceflight section of this forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I think there\u0027s one thing that KSP did that stands out. I don\u0027t think I would be pursuing a career as an aerospace engineer had it not been for this game. It hasn\u0027t been easy, but with the promise of our future as a species waiting at the end of the road, it is by all means a sacrifice I\u0027m willing to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027ll stop rambling. I\u0027m sure many others can join in saying a resounding THANK YOU to the community, and everyone who made this game what it is today. Here\u0027s to another 5,000 posts, and many more thousands of hours, whether that\u0027s in KSP1 or KSP2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
