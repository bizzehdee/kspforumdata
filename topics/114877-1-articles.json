All attempts ended in failure. Then I decided to modify my first aircraft to circumnavigate with just basic jets, and then circumnavigate successfully in a shorter amount of time. Its wheels touched down 7 hours 39 minutes and 17 seconds after takeoff\n\nWe had several people check out the livestream, I must say thanks to all of them!\n\nI hope to do more in the near future"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T03:20:21Z","Content":"What I saw of it was the greatest thing ever.
