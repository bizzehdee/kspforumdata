The current pack jumped from 12MB to 82MB. so for now i just changed the smaller textures to DDS (all but 3)\n\u003E From what I have seen, anything that is greater than 1024x1024 seems to get bloated in size. It almost makes it seem that it would be better to not use any common texture, and have every part have its own dedicated texture. Though I know people have tested out that using a larger texture atlas give the best in-game benefits.\n\nYes, DDS textures have larger file sizes than their PNG counterparts.\n\nMy understanding, however, is that with PNG textures, Unity will internally convert them to DDS anyway, resulting in a similar increase in effective filesize / memory usage, plus some overheads. Fully migrating your textures over to DDS will render the internal conversion step (and the associated overheads) unnecessary, resulting in faster load times and also non-trivial memory savings."},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T02:16:15Z","Content":"I made a texture similar to the endcaps of the Unity node.\n\n![vl6kV6R.png](http://i.imgur.com/vl6kV6R.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralSirJohn","CreatedById":84184,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T19:10:04Z","Content":"Are the docking ports supposed to be so sensitive?

A Common Berthing Mechanism can change between active/male (technically not male because these don\u0027t use probes) or passive/female, which means that any CBM port is in theory compatible with any other, and is done by rotating the petals you see coming off the port. \n\nThe CBMs in this mod can\u0027t switch, so what it means functionally is that they\u0027re like soyuz docking ports; active ports are only compatible with passive ports, and vice versa. So if you\u0027re using the CBMs from these, then one docking ship needs the passive port and the other ship needs the active port. Generally the ship you are docking *to* \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9uses passive.\n\n3) No idea on this one but if they didn\u0027t work for you I\u0027m assuming they don\u0027t work with stock ports at all."},{"CreatedByName":"dresoccer4","CreatedById":141944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T15:22:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1) the Common Berthing Mechanism is the larger docking port...\n\nthanks for the quick reply and thorough explanation! i believe i\u0027m good to go now ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T18:42:40Z","Content":"Just to expand on what FlyMeToMinmus wrote,\n\n1) Larger format docking port styled similarly to the ACBM and PCBMs on the non-russian ISS modules. \n\n2) There is no restriction to docking a passive with a passive, or active with active. Its up to the users to decide if they want to set a rule for themselves to only dock active with passive docking ports. I modeled both for variety and to implement that rule for my career mode.\n\n3) They do not work with stock docking ports. They have a larger diameter mating surface, and use a different node size. They do however work with the Fustek 1.25M IACBMs.\n\nThe PMA can dock with the stock docking ports. Just attach an IACBM on the larger end and dock it to your station.
