A Common Berthing Mechanism can change between active/male (technically not male because these don\u0027t use probes) or passive/female, which means that any CBM port is in theory compatible with any other, and is done by rotating the petals you see coming off the port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CBMs in this mod can\u0027t switch, so what it means functionally is that they\u0027re like soyuz docking ports; active ports are only compatible with passive ports, and vice versa.
