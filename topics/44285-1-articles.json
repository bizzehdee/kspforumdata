I just got this game and it\u0027s taking all my spare time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping to attach pods together to simulate a orbital station with artificial gravity kinda like this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.daviddarling.info/images/2001_2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222001_2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI installed a couple mods but I can\u0027t find a proper attachment that will allow me to connect things at anything other than right angles. I know I can use shift and ASDWQE to adjust things but it seems that most of the pods won\u0027t move with those commands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe there\u0027s a mod that will help but I haven\u0027t found it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaptGentry\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T17:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do is connect modules with docking ports, and then angle the docking port on one end. Use surface attachment and not node attachment to be able to do this. Attach the other docking port perfectly level. Copy this module and its docking ports, then attach the flat port of your second module to the angled port of your other module, and repeat as necessary. If you angle it 10 degrees (two shift\u002BASDWQE presses), which gives a very smooth look, it will take 36 modules for a full circle. Do bear in mind that you cannot make circles in the VAB; the last set of docking ports will fail to connect. These docking ports can attach once physics kicks in and they become magnetized, however. Do it right, and you get something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b7lbTPel.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b7lbTPel.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nasakev","CreatedById":72681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T19:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo add to what Kimberly said, it is easier to break that circle up into parts and use multiple launches to bring it to orbit.

This method does work but there is another way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tex.texel.com/ksp021/screenshot30.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot30.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did with my K-Nor station was to place one of the arms vertical on top of the core and added the ring parts with two-way symmetry, angeling them downward the same way Kimberly did. (But instead of docking ports I used the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/BZ-52_Radial_Attachment_Point\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBZ-52 Radial Attachment Point\u003C/a\u003E.) Then placing the entire arm radially to the core with three-way symmetry to check alignment and back on top of the core for further adjustment. After some more checking and adjusting I tied it all down with struts. The station gives the impression of being a complete circle but in fact it is just three identical radial arms.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
