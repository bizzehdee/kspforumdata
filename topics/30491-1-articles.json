I\u0027m pretty sure this is the right place for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been having a problem lately with rcs. Im using mechjeb 2 but I notice this even when I am not using smart a.s.s. or the docking autopilot. When ever my craft has asas on it can\u0027t stay still and literally burns up all of my mono prop fuel. Is this a design issue on my part because my ship isn\u0027t balanced or is there another way to keep this from happening?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T16:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt probably is because the RCS thrusters are imbalanced. If you don\u0027t want to relaunch the ship, you can just turn off ASAS whenever possible, and if you need it, turn off RCS first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMAN72","CreatedById":68707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T16:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks I\u0027ll try to balance the rcs better\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Promii","CreatedById":36781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T16:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurn RCS off when it\u0027s not required.
