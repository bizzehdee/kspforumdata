So far, anything below 100 t that I have built can\u0027t seem to get off of the planet, even with 12, 13k delta-v, starting as low as 3 km above sea level. So far, what I can accomplish is a 120t lander starting at 3 km, and the payload of course is a nubby, cute little 1.5 t payload with seats, lol. I\u0027d like to know how everyone else builds their craft, and how light you could possibly, theoretically go for a successful LES.\n\nAnd I am not talking about single launch and back Eve LES vehicles. Docking and assembly can be permitted in space. I am asking just strictly about the LES itself on paper what is feasible for the lowest weight, as well as what altitude it can launch from to orbit. Still, a single launch stage is okay, too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T02:31:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Der Anfang**\n  \nI should reiterate..."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T02:15:41Z","Content":"Have a look at this. \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/44966-Lightest-Eve-Lander-I-could-make](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/44966-Lightest-Eve-Lander-I-could-make)\n\nHere\u0027s Scott Manley\u0027s Video\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNDXRjN2piY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T03:26:51Z","Content":"[http://garycourt.github.io/korc/](http://garycourt.github.io/korc/)\n\nI\u0027m doing this from memory, but I think the lightest you can do is about 30-35 tons with 48-7s, The lightest you can do with aerospikes is about 65 tons.
