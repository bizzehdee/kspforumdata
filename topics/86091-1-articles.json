Instead, they\u0027re firing one at a time - I have to hit the space bar four times to get them all off. The decouplers were attached via four-fold symmetry, they weren\u0027t put on one-by-one, and I\u0027ve definitely got them all grouped to fire at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not messing with the staging in-flight at all.
