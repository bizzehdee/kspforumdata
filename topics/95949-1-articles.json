But after tinkering around with it for a while, I\u0027ve got some questions. Namely, how does one get all the fancy compiled pictures like these?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qCp4g\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Or is that functionality in KVV? And how do you get everything the same scale, for zooming purposes? There aren\u0027t any \u0022ticks\u0022 for KVV, it\u0027s all a smooth zoom/rotate/translate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KristopherKerblumbus","CreatedById":132207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T17:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnybody know anything?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T16:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recall another mod with an almost identical functionality but I just can\u0027t remember the name. I can\u0027t be bothered to go searching from my phone. I think it was \u0027vessel exploder\u0027 or something... I\u0027m probably way off. But you would load its GUI in game, set the parameters and click \u0027explode\u0027 to generate these blueprint style pictures of your ships. It was AWESOME to say the least and I was just thinking to myself the other day that hopefully its been maintained through the updates. Good luck on this\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nitrous Oxide","CreatedById":131998,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T17:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, more than likely they save images from KVV and then edit them together in Photoshop/GIMP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
