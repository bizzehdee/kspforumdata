Refueling and landing entirely handled through docking. This will probably prove to be impossible, but before I drive myself crazy calculating DeltaV\u0027s, the big snag I\u0027m running into now is how to operate the darned thing. Given the size of it, each of the engines will be getting sent up from Kerbin on its own and then attached to the main craft. To further complicate things, I want to use nuclear engines for breaking/entering planetary orbits, and use ion engines when the sun is the dominant factor. This would require me to enable/disable a LOT of engine parts when I\u0027m switching between the two drive systems. But at least in the stock game, I\u0027ve seen no way to alter action groups (even though you can alter stage configurations) after the ship has been built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after I assemble this thing in orbit, is there anyway I can reconfigure the controls so I can operate the engines at the touch of a button?
