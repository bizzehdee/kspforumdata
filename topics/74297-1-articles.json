You usually won\u0027t notice that since most maneuvers are either prograde or retrograde, but you will sure notice it when trying to do a sharp inclination change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuver nodes add/remove dv not in direction in which the maneuver is currently oriented but in direction of the original trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means, by pulling normal handle, I am adding impulse in direction perpendicular to the original trajectory, not perpendicular to how the maneuver is oriented at the moment. I cannot turn my orbit 90 degrees that way, I still need to combine half normal and half retrograde to turn 90 degrees consistently except at the end that normal will be where retrograde originally was, and retrograde will be in original position of the antinormal handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso when I pull retrograde until I completely clear my orbital velocity, the maneuver starts oscillating and \u0022turning it around\u0022 to reverse the orbit is almost impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy suggestion\u003C/strong\u003E is to let the maneuver follow the original trajectory orientation instead of turning it to follow the planned trajectory. That would make handle orientation consistent with direction in which each handle adds impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reasonable option would be that handles add impulse according to the maneuver\u0027s orientation. That would e.g. allow me to turn 90 degrees by pulling Normal handle without changing shape of my orbit. But I think it might get confusing or uncomfortable in certain situations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T14:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYES!
