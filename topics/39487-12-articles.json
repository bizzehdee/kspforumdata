I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s true.. but after googling on KSP and multi-core CPU\u0027s that\u0027s the general consensus from what I\u0027ve found in results, and we never have had an official response from the devs anywhere that I can see. They might have in this thread.. but I dunno if I want to go through the entire thing. I might later today. So essentially, KSP is likely doomed to be single-core for it\u0027s entire lifespan. Unless I\u0027m wrong? If I\u0027m right, then building a system for KSP needs no more than 1-2 cores/threads for maximum KSP performance, and any haswell chip that can accomplish that would work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd old video cards are quite cheap, We can pick up a GTX-550 for $45 - $50 today, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-03T03:39:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2014 03:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by kithylin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wurmi","CreatedById":103740,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T10:52:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didnt saw any Xeon CPU right now there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso i made a test with mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU: Intel xeon E3-1231 v3 @3,40 Ghz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGraphic: Asus Radeon 7790 1GB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1920x1080\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFPS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxmXhA1O4msaZWd0bzdWM3FfNWM/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxmXhA1O4msaZWd0bzdWM3FfNWM/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrametimes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxmXhA1O4msaMm0tM1ZrNmhjdWs/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxmXhA1O4msaMm0tM1ZrNmhjdWs/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JZavala","CreatedById":1969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T22:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecpu: i7 5820k @ stock 3.3ghz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egraphics: 2x MSI twin frozr gtx 670 in sli.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1680x1050 windowed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9H7aJOXdZvyNEJVVXRUXzdIYVE/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9H7aJOXdZvyNEJVVXRUXzdIYVE/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eframetimes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9H7aJOXdZvyNEJVVXRUXzdIYVE/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9H7aJOXdZvyNEJVVXRUXzdIYVE/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esystem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/djw0j8R.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/djw0j8R.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-05T23:08:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2015 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JZavala\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scribbleheli","CreatedById":97627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T22:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes your FPS plugin work in .90? along with the test ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have CPU limited set up i think.
