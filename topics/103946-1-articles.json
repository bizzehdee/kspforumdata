It has parameters A,B,C defined in a .cfg file, and is assigned model 1. I right click on the engine, and I can choose to switch to model 2. It has parameters D, E, F, assigned by another elsewhere in the .cfg file. \n\nI know this option exists, because this \u0027model switch\u0027 is used in procedural fuel tanks. \n\nHow is this done? What .cfg code do I need to add to the engine?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T23:43:59Z","Content":"You might look at how MFS does it \n\n        MODULE    {        name = FSmeshSwitch        moduleID = 0        buttonName = Next variant        previousButtonName = Previous variant        objectDisplayNames = FH-HL;FHN-HL;FHW-HL\tobjects =\t     FH-HL;FHN-HL;FHW-HL\taffectColliders = true\tuseFuelSwitchModule = true        fuelTankSetups = 0;1;2    }\n\nOr just look up Firespitter and look at the wiki on it."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T23:46:27Z","Content":"Thank you!\n\nJust to clarify, \u0027objects\u0027 list the general\\_parameters part name or the mesh model name?
