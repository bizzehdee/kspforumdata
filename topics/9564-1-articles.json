The topics seemed to be un-accessible to me and in fear of reviving an old thread, I didn\\\u0027t want to run the risk of being banned/beat up. But it appears when I use a \\\u0027pretty large\\\u0027 \u0027Space Station\u0027 that I have created, it ALWAYS tumbles then explodes onto itself (very LOW FPS, obviously). I have managed to get a much smaller version (basically the middle section) into instant orbit, no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my SS I\\\u0027m trying to put into orbit: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i360.photobucket.com/albums/oo48/Andy87T91TT/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot12-1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot12-1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\\\u0027t able to get a reliable screenshot after it blew up (onto itself), but there was quite a few dozen debris items floating around afterwords (normal FPS). Maybe you guys would know better than I would but *I\\\u0027m* thinking that maybe its a combination of a mod issue along with too many parts combined.

After reading, I think I have an idea of what it is.. possibly 2 things: 1) \\\u0027spacers\\\u0027 between some of the \\\u0027pods\\\u0027 and 2) possibly different \\\u0027pod\\\u0027 lengths may not \\\u0027properly\\\u0027 reach. I will take a look at it later on tonight \u0026amp; rebuild it. I\\\u0027m guessing \\\u0027those\\\u0027 could be the cause of the \\\u0027infiite \u0026amp; amplified oscillations\\\u0027, which I did notice before it blew up (ie, spun \u0026amp; tumbled faster \u0026amp; faster until.. BOOM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\\\u0027t wait to see when they implement the weight, TWR, etc etc into the VAB. Hopefully they\\\u0027ll also show some type of \\\u0027high stress\\\u0027 areas as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
