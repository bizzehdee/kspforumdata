However, there are a couple of things making it a bit iffy to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, the compressor expends IntakeAir, Oxidizer and ElectricCharge even if the SuperCompressedAir container is full, and even if it\u0027s not getting spent to begin with. This makes it very inefficient at high altitudes where you could lower the thrust to lower the consumption rates and get more out of the atmospheric mode. It seems to be hugely less efficient than a basic jet engine in relation to how much intake resources (oxidizer) you have to carry with you to use it, although it has a lot higher thrust as a tradeoff. Another factor in this is that the OPT fuel tanks don\u0027t provide a oxidizer-only alternative apart from the OPT drop tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, it\u0027s a flat rate for the compressor, producing 4.50 of SuperCompressedAir per \u0022tick\u0022 in resource panel. It always works at maximum capacity it seems, meaning it doesn\u0027t care if it\u0027s overproducing. This means it can\u0027t be adjusted to produce just the right amount of SuperCompressedAir for a certain number of ARIE engines. Causes issues in designing crafts with it. This could be somewhat fixed by adding a tweakable limiter to it, or that it would produce just enough for a certain number of engines, and that you can then design the craft with a certain part ratio of compressor/engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I could only see that one compressor isn\u0027t enough for two engines and it\u0027s way over the needs of one engine. I hit some kind of a sweet spot for it around 40% thrust with two engines and one compressor on the runway. It also seemed that the engines use up to 2.0 of SuperCompressedAir per \u0022tick\u0022 on the runway, but I couldn\u0027t get it exactly on 2.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, the vessel designers need some better utilities to balance the resource cycles, and maybe even during flight.
