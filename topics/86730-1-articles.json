To rotate the vehicle in one direction, you spin up the proper wheel in the opposite direction. To rotate the vehicle back, you slow down the wheel. Excess momentum that builds up in the system due to external torques must be occasionally removed from the system via propulsive maneuvers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s missing in KSP you say? Reaction wheels can absorb any amount of momentum without reaching a maximum. We\u0027d need a mod for that. A display with pitch, yaw and roll progress bars would show the speed at which the reaction wheel is turning. After reaching the maximum, external thrusters would have to be used to ease on the reaction wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I don\u0027t have the time to make this mod.
