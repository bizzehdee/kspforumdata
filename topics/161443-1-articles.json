This is partly a legacy design from when the game was much simpler, although it\u0027s worth noting that resources themselves don\u0027t necessarily have a set volume - they can be compressible gases, incompressible liquids or solids, or something that doesn\u0027t have a volume at all (electric charge).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there is a volume key in the resource definitions. This is the number of liters per unit, and it\u0027s provided so to facilitate modding - resource-switchable tanks, etc. The stock resources are mostly 5 liters/unit, while most mod resources are 1 liter/unit.
