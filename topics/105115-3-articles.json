It is their first game and for them an unimaginable success.\n\nThey could have scrubbed the whole Project that is KSP years ago and yet you are complaining about a couple of bugs in a game for that you have paid 14-20 bucks in whatever currency months and years ago!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T09:30:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MalfunctionM1Ke**"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T09:26:01Z","Content":"I think it can be a reasonable position to say you love the game but it is missing basic features that should be in a first release version. You could also be validated in saying the time between alpha and release was far too short, shockingly so. Some would be valid in having suspicion as SQUAD have said things will or will not be in the game and have reversed their position on a few topics for apparently no reason in the past. This could cause concern about their statement to continue active development.\n\nMyself I will wait and see.\n\nMy opinion is that it has been shown by the makers of EVE and Scatterer that the game can be made much more beautiful without a great performance hit. The makers of KER and Mechjeb have shown how information screens can show a wide range of information and the makers of RPM, Vessel viewer, ship effects etc have shown what is possible in IVA.\n\nIf the stock game had a lot of the features from those mods I reckon it would be more valid to call it finished feature wise.\n\nThe actual \u0027game\u0027 part though, being career with the goals and mechanics involved might need more work, it might be better in 1.0, I\u0027ll see later."},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T09:28:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E TLDR, \n\u003E Squad: \u0022We baked you a cake!\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E Community: \u0022WHERE IS DA HYPERFANCY CREAM WE ASKED FOR?????\u0022\n\nI think you meant.\n\nSquad: \u0022We will make you an awesome cake with hyperfancy cream\u0022.\n\nCommunity: \u0022MMMmmm this cake mix is delicious\u0022\n\nSquad : \u0022I baked you a cake with hyperfancy cream minus the hyperfancy cream\u0022.\n\nCommunity: Where is DA hyperfancy cream you told me about?\u0022.\n\nSquad: \u0022Oh we will get to that later\u0022.\n\nCommunity: \u0022Ok, well is it ok if we just call this a cake then?\u0022.\n\nSquad: \u0022No, we are still calling it a cake with hyperfancy cream\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T09:32:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If KSP is such a bad game, why are you still playing it?\n\nProbably because it\u0027s the closest thing we have to \u0022the perfect physics space game\u0022, it\u0027s a genre that is so starved of titles it needs medical attention, with the only other notable games being just eye candy extravaganzas (space engine) or so dry the sahara desert says \u0022that\u0027s pretty dry\u0022 (Orbiter).\n\nKSP with addons is closer to their ideal, but the core game is still a bit \u0022lite\u0022 and they feel it appeals more to the casual end with only nods to basic physics than the guys like regex and romanstatuehead r4pt0r would prefer, so they and others feel a bit disappointed, and they are sure *others* would like a KSP in the way they wish it was, if only it existed.\n\nI understand their disappointment and can see that gaping hole in gaming for a fun space sim that actually teaches people real world physics.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T09:38:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T09:36:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think you meant.\n\u003E Squad: \u0022We will make you an awesome cake with hyperfancy cream\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E Community: \u0022MMMmmm this cake mix is delicious\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E Squad : \u0022I baked you a cake with hyperfancy cream minus the hyperfancy cream\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E Community: Where is DA hyperfancy cream you told me about?\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E Squad: \u0022Oh we will get to that later\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E Community: \u0022Ok, well is it ok if we just call this a cake then?\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E Squad: \u0022No, we are still calling it a cake with hyperfancy cream\u0022.\n\nDo you want your hyperfancy cream as a DLC you have to pay for or what?"},{"CreatedByName":"Harrekin","CreatedById":119965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T09:41:15Z","Content":"Still no multiplayer...\n\nHow many games nowadays have NO multiplayer on release?\n\nThis isn\u0027t the 90\u0027s anymore.\n\nLove KSP, kinda tired of playing it by myself tho and part of me suspects it\u0027ll never happen now that the Early Access obligations are fulfilled.\n\nMight play 1.0 when the mods are updated."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T09:42:24Z","Content":"now smileyfaceguy sal\\_vager, dont be mistaken, Im all about that stock, and I dont give a wit about physics.
