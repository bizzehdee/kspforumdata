Either the card is a form of program or firmware that needs to run on the unit. Or the card is a Sub Processing Unit that is doing its own calculations. I suppose there could be two \u0022resources\u0022 but I would not go much more then that. Those being an internal capacity and a CPU resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose two would offer some interesting possibilities as as with PC\u0027s it would be possible to add in SPU\u0027s that could increase the CPU resource pool but takes up space in the unit its self. This leads to some interesting paths for parts. I could see Flash Memory for Science storage, SPU\u0027s for analysis of data, Compression modules to reduce bit amounts (Reduce Bits, Increase Multiplier), management units that gives a boost to fuel or power efficiency (Say 5-10%, but enough to be worth having).
