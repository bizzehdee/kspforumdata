The second time it happened I actually witnessed it myself, as I had the map view open at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d switched to map view as I was climbing to orbit, just a few seconds before this image was grabbed. For a couple seconds the other vehicle (grey arc) was a nice 76km high orbit above Kerbin, when suddenly it changed to the suborbital trajectory in the image below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing just popped from orbital, to very much suborbital as I was looking at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Vo3LSgW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Vo3LSgW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo idea if this is mods related, but other than Orx I have the same set I\u0027ve used for many months without issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP version is 1.8.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone else experienced this or have an idea on how to solve it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
