Therefore every interested people have been forced to play KSP and it is better than nothing (and in my opinion, very good game even it is too childish and easy to be perfect for me). But it seems clear that there can be markets for few other games too. One could be as realistic as practically possible, which do now even try to get large success. Like Orbiter with capability to build ships and have technical resource managing and more other game elements. And one could maybe be very entertaining easy game with very polished graphics, explosions and so called fun stuff (maybe some large company will make it, when they see that KSP is economic success). And KSP would be between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I do not see the reason to fears and protests against realism. Most parts of the realism is very easy to program compared to graphical things, so that do not delay game development significantly. Realism is also very easy to config out. You can just change initial values by using couple of multipliers and game is as easy as you want. You give more ISP and thrust, so that player can choose transfers freely and use smaller and simpler ships. You adjust consumption of living and other resources to zero and forget them. You cancel out nasty aerodynamic effects and re-entry heating and forget them etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there are some people who want to play hard mode, because they want to feel themselves geniuses, but they whine that game should still be easy. They are really selfish and idiots. But probably it would be able to name easy as hard mode and realistic mode as nerdy mode, which you can enable by adjusting config file.

Programming of the realism of this kind of game does not need knowledge over advanced hobby level (maybe aerodynamics is only \u0022difficult\u0022 thing, but maybe Ferram would sell his experience to SQUAD). And it would also be easy thing to scale down for Whackjob et al., who want to fly with extreme imaginative vessels.
