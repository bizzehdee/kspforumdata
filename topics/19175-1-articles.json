Since i bought the game in the 0.15 that\u0027s all i had in my d/l folder and when i tried to update it, it always said \u0022Unable to connect to server\u0022. As an alternative i thought to d/l the 0.16 version directly from the website, but guess what? I couldn\u0027t figure out a way to download it without buying it again. Squad either never thought this part through or it\u0027s just hidden somewhere and is not easily accessible. If someone could help me out it would be awesome and a few suggestions for the site devs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* GIVE THE OPTION TO THE BUYER TO EASILY DOWNLOAD THE GAME AGAIN IF THEY\u0027VE BOUGHT IT ONCE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* MAKE THE SDK OPTION MORE READILY VISIBLE ! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou guys are great game makers but things like this shouldn\u0027t be overlooked by the Community managers and such and should be made user friendly.
