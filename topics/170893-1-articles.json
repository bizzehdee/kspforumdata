But i know what i find, we were the cause: the simulators weren\u0027t ready,\u00A0 our software in mission control didn\u0027t function. Procedures weren\u0027t complete nothing we did had any shelf life and no one stood up and said stop. Now from this day forward, mission control will be known by two words: tough and competent, tough meaning we will never again shirk from our responsibility because we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do. Competent, we will never take anything for granted - we will never stop learning - when you leave here today you will write these two words on your blackboard, tough and competent and they will never be erased. They will serve as a constant reminder to the sacrificial of\u00A0 Grissom, White and Chaffee.
