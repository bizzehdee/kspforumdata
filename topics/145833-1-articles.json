In my very first career mode, starting about a year ago, I really only did basic stuff with hardly any mods.\u00A0 No rovers, no surface bases, etc.\u00A0 Got to $65 million from contracts and 400,000 science from distributed MPLs, and relied very heavily on\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/62843-cupcake/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002262843\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/62843-cupcake/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cupcake...\u003C/a\u003E, and\u00A0@Rune to get me to other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, looking to try some harder things and decided to try life support, surface bases, and using other Science mods.\u00A0 Any input would be appreciated. Note that I am not looking to use any of the Roverdude \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mods, as he has announced that a large rewrite is incoming for 1.2 and legacy parts will be gone. Will absolutely look forward to make a separate 1.2 career using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E suite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E - required for anything complicated from the base building perspective. May need a separate sandbox instance to practice on Mun or Minmus\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. TAC LS - Seems to be the most basic choice and appears to have 1.1.3 support. Looks like it consists of things to consume, and things to generate.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Kerbal Planetary Base Systems - Very excited to try. It also looks like it needs less involvement from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, as many of the modules look like they have wheels to position instead of needing rovers and cranes. Also, this seems to need integration with TAC LS because both mods generate resources and consume resources, but in a different way using different modules. I would guess that ships/space stations use TAC LS modules to generate resources for the station and docked ships, and the surface base uses KPBS to generate resource for the base and ships on the surface.\u00A0 And, each can supply commonly needed resources like Oxygen for Kerbals to use, just using 2 different methods. Seems also capable of building complete self sustaining bases on certain bodies.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Station Science - Another interesting mod, but no \u0022official\u0022 1.1.3 support yet and only really used around Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Contract Configuration Packages - I used this later ingame on my first career, but looking to use it as a better progression experience.\u00A0 Not looking for BSTM, which is not very compatible, but cant really find a better choice that doesn\u0027t force a large change in gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a science perspective, it looks like if I use the stock science method of running experiments locally to the biome and returning them to Kerbin, using Station Science around Kerbin, and science generated in KPBS on the surface, this might be enough.\u00A0 It does leave a bit of a hole regarding science generation from space stations other than Kerbin. Is it possible to have a science lander that has all of the science instruments, executes experiments, and stores the data in a storage container that can return to Kerbin? Similar to the way that Kerbals can store/take data in pods for EVA/surface samples, etc.?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody see any issues with this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany Thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kar","CreatedById":122714,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-13T12:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think I never played KSP without mods!
