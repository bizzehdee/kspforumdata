It is the best for moving heavy payloads around in space. The aerospike is mainly a strong contender for Eve launches. The LV-T30/45 are usually preferable over the aerospike in the 1.5m category, because of the higher TWR of the 30 and the gimbal of the 45. The strength of the aerospike is that it retains thrust/ISP at much higher pressures than other rockets. However, only the bottom 5km or so of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is really thick enough for the aerospike to be any better than the other engines, and you don\u0027t spend very long there when launching.\n\nAs mentioned, the exception is Eve (or Jool, if you have some reason to be deep there), which has a much denser atmosphere that renders most engines exceedingly weak. The aerospike has the best ISP (and maybe TWR? I\u0027d have to look closer) in the lower Eve atmosphere by quite a bit.\n\nMany people also like the aerospike for its short profile that looks good on spaceplanes. However, from a performance standpoint the T30 is usually preferable (if you don\u0027t need the gimbal), since it is both lighter and more powerful (which can offset some of the ISP loss).
