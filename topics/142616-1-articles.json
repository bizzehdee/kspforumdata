Savefile A is at a Universal Time (UT)\u00A0of year 1, day 1 and Savefile\u00A0\u00A0B is at year 7 day 45. Both of these dates show up in the savefile selection menu.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, suppose I start in Savefile A and then load Savefile B, everything in B is as it should be except that the UT clock is at Y1D1, matching Savefile A.\u00A0Examining the FLIGHTSTATE section of the .sfs I find that Savefile B does indeed have a\u00A0UT of\u00A056180909.2327814 corresponding to the correct date. But when I play from B the UT clock shows Y1 D1, and the planets etc. are all in positions corresponding to that date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo: from where else could the game possibly be getting time value other than in the FLIGHTSTATE section?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am running several mods including Kopernicus, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and a couple of others but this seems like more of a stock issue.
