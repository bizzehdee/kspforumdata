Most people simply cannot afford to send up a secondary, non-profit (at least, no immediate profit) rocket up into orbit with a payload for the station. But some of use (myself included) do have a spare grand or two which we could spend on such missions, but this amount of money would never launch a rocket.\u003Cp\u003ENow of course we all could just save those few grands over 4 or 5 turns and then have enough for a personal rocket, but that\\\u0027s 4 or 5 turns away!

First this person must request the money for a pool in a forum post (to prevent multiple people claiming the same money) with whoever posts first gets the money. This money MUST then be spent, in the same turn as it is claimed, on a space-station mission. Whether it succeeds or not isn\\\u0027t the matter, it\\\u0027s simply that i see this as an easier way to set up mutually beneficial missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the pool is claimed, but the player doesn\\\u0027t do a mission (for whatever reason, i realise the RL has a tendency to get in the way of internet shenanigans! ) it is returned to the pool at the start of the next turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pool may not be spent on personal missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the pool (or however much claimed from the pool) must be spent in the turn it was claimed purely on a space-station mission (don would be able to confirm this by knowing the player\\\u0027s turn details (i assume ) )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers are morally obliged to spend some of their own money on a space-station mission when drawing from the pool (ie not to fund the mission purely from the pool, incase of failure so that pool isn\\\u0027t completely emptied for no success).
