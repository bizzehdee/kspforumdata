One spawns points of interest (physically) on the surface of a planet for you to inspect on EVAs, and the other asks you to deploy a satellite into an orbit that is shown on the map. The EVA contract may take some time, since it requires art assets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Biff Space\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Biff Space\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI successfully landed a ground station on the Mun, and was immediately rewarded with the contract completion goodies. But, I landed on the side of a crater, and a couple of minutes later the fine Munbase that they had paid for was a command module in a field of debris. Maybe you should add a time interval or a velocity check, or both, before changing the status to completed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m torn on this.

Would it be possible to add a \u0022manned\u0022 requirement as well, or perhaps if it has to have room for 6 crew then it must have minimum say 2 Kerbals on board to be completed? Could that even lead to crew rotation missions, a bit like the stock rescue missions I guess but to send up new Kerbals to an existing station / base and return the ones already there instead of picking up a random orbital Kerbal? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso since you mentioned spawning POIs for future EVA contracts that got me thinking, would it be possible to use the system that spawns kerbals for the rescue missions to spawn derelict ships or probes that need to be returned either to Kerbin orbit or even landed and fully recovered? And perhaps something similar using the smallest asteroids (or a custom rock type object) that spawns on a planet / moon surface or in orbit which has to be retrieved with the Claw and brought back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhodan","CreatedById":118102,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T19:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, i have a question about the Base-Requirements.
