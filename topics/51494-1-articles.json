The true visual glory still have to be the \u0022real\u0022 launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are staging, trusting or simply rotate the craft via RCS, the model could show how much mechanical stress each part has. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like in the game \u0022Bridge Builder\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Bridge-builder-game.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Bridge-builder-game.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECenter of mass, trust and lift could be showed here, too. Or a counter of DeltaV. Or whatever might be usefull to know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mode could be very usefull once money and stuff are implemented and a trial-and-error way of testing is too expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you start the simulator, there should be two options where the craft can be located/simulated: At the surface of a celestial object and its orbit. When you start from the surface you can still get into the orbit or vice-versa. Depending on the craft you wanna test it might be easier to start the simulator instandly in the orbit, so the option should be available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA extra could be to give the simulator at the beginning only the simulation-options of Kerbin: starting from \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EKerbings surface\u003C/span\u003E and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eorbiting Kerbin\u003C/span\u003E. And if you gain data by orbiting a new object, the simulator can be upgraded. Sensors like the \u00222HOT Thermometer\u0022 could/should be necessary for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats it.

I\u0027d like to see that in career mode as soon as budget/money is implemented. Even before that, it\u0027d be useful for testing concepts without having to put them in orbit first. (I know we can just hyperedit, but I usually avoid mods).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also like the part with expanding the simulator by getting new data about other planets. I think this would be a good use for a possible observatory: You get the orbit-option by studying the planet through observatory (or probe), but you get surface/atmosphere option only by providing actual data. Also you wouldn\u0027t be able to enter the atmosphere in the simulator (due to insufficient simulation data) before you unlocked it. It could just flash an \u0022insufficient data\u0022 warning and continue the sim as if there was no atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Urben","CreatedById":89151,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T16:40:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah thats what I had in mind. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Urben","CreatedById":89151,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T17:49:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditional idea: While in the simulation, you can load another craft to dock and simulate them.
