When a player starts a new game of any type, bring up a Kerbal Selection Screen, with the big four always available at the top of the list, and, say, 10 to 20 random kerbals, or possibly 5 random kerbals of each class. Allow the player to pick 3 to start with. You can always keep any of the main 4 kerbals that don\u0027t get selected at the top of the list in the Astronaut Complex, if the player wants to get them later, but it just doesn\u0027t make sense to always have those 4 kerbals every single game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-05T23:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can agree with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-06T00:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be a clean way to get rid of Jeb, who always tries to climb into every single rocket just to mess up stuff \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut since there are still new players around, a selection screen should still contain some restriction in the specializations so you have to pick at least one Pilot, Engineer and Scientist (maybe it can be set for each Kerbal).
