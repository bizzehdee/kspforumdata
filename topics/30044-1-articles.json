Either way you will eventually get an encounter close enough to be worth using... probably. That\u0027s assuming your craft can recharge the batteries. If not, back to the VAB I guess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my humbly pinion, I\u0027d say it\u0027s more useful to get into an orbit that crosses that of your target twice than to precisely match orbit with the target. I do this by having a periapsis slightly lower than the orbit of the target and apoapsis higher than the orbit of the target. While the craft is above the orbit of the target, the target\u0027s velocity is higher than that of the craft, so it \u0022catches up\u0022 with you. While the orbit is below that of the target your craft is moving faster than the target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly match velocities and orbit when you are within 2km or so, saves you a lot of monopropellant and a fair bit of swearing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CookiezFort","CreatedById":68364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T18:40:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk if i burn now i will have 137 km seperation or should i burn so i can just re launch the whole thing and try to do it better?

Just plant the node where your ship will be during closest approach and increase/decrease your orbit until your close approach is 1-2Km. Perform the necessary burn, making sure you have enough reserve to slow down and then begin rendezvous operations. Of course, this isn\u0027t as efficient as waiting it out, but I believe Scott Manley pointed out that you can always have a rendezvous if you have a single intercept and enough fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe double-intersect approach has the added bonus of giving you an idea of whether or not your catching up to or falling behind the target craft. I use the same technique in the double intersect as the single intersect, but I try to wait until the closest approach is within 10Km ahead of me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CookiezFort","CreatedById":68364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T19:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I just decided i will land this thing and do some modifications and relaunch it\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
