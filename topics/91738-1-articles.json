Below is a rough outline on how it could be done:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate a new scene that is outwardly very similar to the current tracking station. Lets call this the Mission Development Centre (MDC) for the sake of argument. Upon entering the MDC the game is effectively paused and a \u0027snapshot\u0027 of global time, orbits and craft/debris is created. Essentially a simulation, the player can now warp time forwards and backwards (though you would not be able to warp to before the time you entered the MDC). As it\u0027s a simulation, it will not have any affect on the passage of time in the actual game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where the Fine Print visualisations come in. Allow the player to create a starting orbit such as a zero-inclination 70x70km Kerbin orbit (or any other around any other body). From here they can add maneuver nodes at will, ultimately producing complicated mission plans such as grand tours at any point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a mission plan has been finalised it can be saved for use; when the player subsequently enters the flight/map/tracking scenes these future orbits and maneuver nodes will be displayed and in a similar fashion to some of the Fine Print contracts. The player will have to fly the maneuver nodes accurately enough to reach their next node at the correct time. The crux of this is that unlike traditional nodes these \u0027mission nodes\u0027 will not be affected by changes in your current trajectory and be more like keyholes in space and time to aim for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a system that\u0027s close enough in functionality to what\u0027s described above will give players a much more powerful tool for mission planning whilst largely removing the need for phase angle calculators; anyone can jump in to the simulation, create nodes and play with time until they get the results they desire. After fleshing this out I had a search on the forums to look for similar ideas and found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78377-Planning-Nodes-outside-of-flight-mode-for-interplanetary-transfers\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E - a very similar post from April.

Personally I think that a system that does this visually in-game is the preferred option for most players.

The simulation is about setting up transfer windows and slingshots, there\u0027s no need to fly it or watch a representation do it for you. It would all be done on-rails and without the ability to focus on a vessel, all the player would be doing is setting up maneuver node \u0027checkpoints\u0027 for use as a reference in a later, live mission.
