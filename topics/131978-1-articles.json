Is this a valid setup?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4)Fuel cells- do they shut off automatically if solar panels are providing enough EC, or do they run constantly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnakyLeVrai","CreatedById":135852,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-12T22:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) no idea \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) only the black containers can store ore, fuel tanks won\u0027t store it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) it doesn\u0027t matter where you put the tanks (fuel, ore, monoprop...), your drills can also be attached to the fuel tanks, it\u0027s ok\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) they only work when needed, if your solar panels provide 100% of the needed EC, fuel cells won\u0027t work.

Ignore the title of the contract (it\u0027s \u0022chatty\u0022 and can be misleading), just focus on the exact wording of the success criteria.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, there are two types of criteria that pop up in various combinations for these contracts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Extract \u0026lt;number\u0026gt; units of ore from \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022: just that.

Obviously this means you have to have enough capacity in your black ore tanks to hold that much. Note that it doesn\u0027t matter where the ore came from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, note that the contracts that want you to bring ore from A to B only require being in B\u0027s SoI, not necessarily landing there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, if a contract supposedly wants you to bring N units of ore from the Mun to Kerbin, you don\u0027t actually have to do that, if you read the fine print. Just mine N units on the Mun (don\u0027t have to keep it around or move it anywhere), then launch a new ship on Kerbin that has N units already on board at launch. Contract completes the moment it hits the launchpad, don\u0027t even need to take off!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-13T00:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) it doesn\u0027t matter,you can convert it instantly and will still count\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-13T00:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso: Fuel cells run any time your stored EC is below 95% of your full capacity.
