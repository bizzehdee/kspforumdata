Moho is in reference to Moholes as well as an \u0022M\u0022 name like its analogue. Eve is \u003Cem\u003Evaguely\u003C/em\u003E similar to Venus. Gilly could be someone\u0027s name. Duna is in reference to Dune, or spanish for dunes whichever you prefer. Ike is in reference to Eisenhower. Dres - parents or just a cool name. Jool is probably just a \u0022J\u0022 name with a ring to it. (Joolian moons) Pol because it looks like pollen.
