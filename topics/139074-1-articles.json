I\u0027ve got a pretty standard 6 wheel rover design, which seems to handle well, except that when I tell it to start moving forward, it will spin around in place 180\u00B0-360\u00B0 before settling and moving forward. This might be manageable if it were predictable, but it seems pretty random and then on top of that, attempt to correct the direction of the rover result in a repeat of the event, usually with crashy results. Is this a known issue (searching hasn\u0027t really found the answer), and if so, how can I fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T20:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWheels and the way they work now is totally broken no matter what anyone says.

I tried taking off steering inversion, and then only the two wheels opposite of the desired direction of turn work. I should mention that the middle wheels have steering off, so they are not supposed to turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: Apparently it had to do with the orientation of the probe core... I tried redesigning it with the core rotated 90\u00B0 so that it was stacked with the cubic struts and the spinning seems to have disappeared. There is still some funny wheel movement, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be affecting the direction of movement as much as I had thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Qx1AAs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00220Qx1AAs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-06T04:14:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2016 04:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T20:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it\u0027s all to do with the orientation of your control point. In your original case, the probe core pointing to the sky won\u0027t allow the wheels to behave as expected. In your edit 2 example, the wheels will be slightly better in that your probe is facing the horizon, however... it\u0027s still upside down (navball, blue should be on top). Flip your core around right side up, and you\u0027ll probably get more desirable results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
