I have vanilla 1.05 and when returning from from anywhere outside of near orbit, my chutes auto deploy around 20k and eventually burn up. They are staged alone, as the last stage, as they always are, and yet, I always have this problem when doing anything outside of near orbit.  These are the first two chutes you gain access too, mk16 and the radial one. Haven\u0027t unlocked any others. I can confirm that changing the pressure, as the gentleman above did, resolved the issue. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-29T16:40:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2016 04:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by matthomas7**\n  \nConfirmed comment"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T17:57:19Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums, matthomas7!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, matthomas7 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This, for whatever reason, isn\u0027t true for me.\n\u003E \n\nFrom reading your description, actually it sounds *\u003Cu\u003Eexactly\u003C/u\u003E* like it\u0027s true for you.

Your chutes then semi-deploy there (because you already staged them), and then they burn up, exactly as mekasha said they would.\n\nParachutes *\u003Cu\u003Enever\u003C/u\u003E* automatically deploy themselves.  They only deploy when staged.  They\u0027re deploying in your case because you did, in fact, deploy them before hitting atmosphere.\n\nMy impression as to where the confusion is coming from is that you\u0027re under the impression that you *\u003Cu\u003Edidn\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E* stage them, and that they\u0027re deploying anyway.  Correct?\n\nTherefore, the real question here is \u0022how are the parachutes getting staged, when I didn\u0027t intend them to be?\u0022\n\nSome potential explanations that come to mind:\n\n- The parachutes are grouped together with something else (like a decoupler) in the staging sequence, without your realizing or intending that.  (This is easy to happen in KSP; the editor tends to bung them in with other components, and you need to manually sort it out.)  So they\u0027re getting activated when you do that last stage, and you\u0027re not realizing it because nothing happens *\u003Cu\u003Eat that time\u003C/u\u003E*.  (Yes, I know you mentioned that \u0022they\u0027re in a final stage by themselves\u0022, but maybe something went off the rails somewhere and you didn\u0027t notice something.  I\u0027m just raising it as a possibility; it\u0027s something to double-check.)\n- You do in fact have the parachutes off in a final stage by themselves, as you say, but you\u0027ve accidentally hit the space bar (without noticing it) before you begin reentry.\n- You\u0027ve accidentally gotten the parachutes lumped into some action group for the rocket that got activated while you were in orbit.\n- You\u0027re running some mod that\u0027s automatically deploying the parachutes for you.  (You said \u0022vanilla\u0022, so I\u0027ll assume this isn\u0027t the case.  Just mentioning it for the sake of completeness.)\n\nHere\u0027s an easy way to tell that you\u0027ve already staged your parachutes before reentry:  What color is their icon in the staging UI?  A truly unstaged parachute should be the normal default white color.  If you\u0027re seeing a cyan-colored icon, it means that they have already been \u0022armed\u0022 (i.e. activated via staging) and are just waiting for the pressure to climb high enough to deploy.  So, if you see cyan when you think you haven\u0027t staged them yet, it means you *\u003Cu\u003Ehave\u003C/u\u003E* staged them at some point, somehow.\n\nSo, let\u0027s say you\u0027re in that position:  how do you fix it?  One way is to adjust the minimum-pressure setting, as the previous posters describe.  However, this is an old thread (you necro\u0027d it, the last post was back in May, long before 1.0.5).  Now that we\u0027re running 1.0.5, however, you have an additional option.\n\n1.0.5 added a new feature that allows you to \u0022disarm\u0022 a parachute that has already been staged, as long as it hasn\u0027t deployed yet.  Just right-click on the parachute and choose \u0022Disarm\u0022.  This restores it to its original, pre-staged state.  Then you can just fiddle the staging UI to put it back into a not-yet-activated stage, so that you can set it off via spacebar when you\u0027re down to where it\u0027s safe."}]}
