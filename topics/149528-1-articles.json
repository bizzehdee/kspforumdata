In my opinion it is bad thing that KSP have gone from nerdy side to popular side during development process. Of course I understand that it is the only way to earn money and Squad certainly deserves all economic success. I do not expect that any commercial game would be nerdy enough because most of potential customers do not want to entertain themselves by solving difficult technical problems because they get enough in their jobs. However, I hope that there will be some hobby projects. I could even take part of the development, but I do not have enough patience to make whole game by myself (I like to program mathematical algorithms and technical things but not user interfaces or such boring stuff necessary to playable game). Orbiter is a good example, but it is quite limited to flight, which is not very interesting without more complex logistical or exploration objectives. And I hope that KSP will not go any more into childish direction or at least it would be possible to disable any aliens etc. stuff. KSP gives quite good challenge with suitable set of technical mods and personal restrictions, but still I would like much more difficult and realistic game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if aliens you mentioned were a procedurally generated hot spot, for example microbes which can be found in deep cave under the surface of Laythe after several of hours of exploration with insanely expensive high tier equipment, I would like it, but I think that you did not mean that when you talk about kids. I do not also believe that kids would work like you think. At least my kids and almost all other I know cheat all new things in games immediately. If they were interesting in KSP and there were aliens in the game, they would look coordinates from youtube and hyperedit themselves to look these aliens. Or watch just videos. I have wondered modern kids. They are too lazy to play themselves. Instead they watch when others play.

It\u0027s my favourite game I\u0027ve ever played, but if I had tried to get into it when I was younger than I actually was, I probably would\u0027ve gotten frustrated and given up. It\u0027s a difficult game to get started with, and I think people should get into it when they\u0027re willing to persevere and fail spectacularly numerous times on the way to orbit and beyond. It\u0027s aimed towards adults (or in some cases teenagers) because that\u0027s the demographic who are most likely\u00A0have the patience to deal with the complexities of rocket engineering and orbital mechanics, and who might be inclined to learn how to do calculations in order to get things really precise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T06:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood comments, all. \u00A0I think I am asking too much for a game to be technical and still cartoonish enough for kids. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T10:53:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s more that you may have been overestimating the patience kids are likely to have for rocket science.
