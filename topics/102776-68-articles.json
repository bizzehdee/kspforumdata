Love KSPRC though, cant say that enough! but I work on making planets look the best they can with only kopernicus, and I get pretty awesome results. For a long time I\u0027ve focused on purely stock features only for planets (although i basically ignored NH) even going so far as to only use ground textures found in the assets, trying to make it look great without scatterer, without EVE, without anything else. If you check out KASE in my sig you\u0027ll see what I mean by the look NH2 will have.\n\u003E \n\nAh, but you see - the thing that draws me to KSPRC textures is not how realistic they look, but rather their resolution.\n\nStock Kerbin has a texture that looks agreeable enough from high orbit, but in low orbit or especially during reentry, it disintegrates into an awful heap of pixel mud. Especially coastlines. And Kerbin has a lot of coastline, even island chains and fractured coasts that end up looking like graphics glitches instead of terrain features. It\u0027s my biggest pet peeve about the stock graphics. When I look for replacement textures, I do it almost exclusively to avoid that particular behavior.\n\nAs such, I totally don\u0027t mind if you\u0027re not going for a hyper-realistic style.
