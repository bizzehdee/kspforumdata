Really fun. power5000, your aim is unreal! I prefer to use sunbeam lasers on my aircraft, for the autoaiming. In fact, I just built a helicopter for cleaning up debris around the KSC. I\\\u0027ve got another, dual rotor one with railguns for playing around with, but it likes to flip itself over for no good reason before getting anywhere meaningful. I see you\\\u0027ve got wings on there. Don\\\u0027t they destabilise the helicopter at high speeds?
