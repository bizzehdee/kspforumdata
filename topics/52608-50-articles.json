The IVA menu allows me to select celestial bodies however any orbiting ships do not appear under vessels and have to be manually selected from the map if I\u0027m planning to rendezvous.

It has a maneuver planner and a maneuver executor. Maneuver planner needs some means of controlling it from IVA which means another menu to code and numeric entry, maneuver executor is supported, -- there\u0027s even a button -- even though it might not be implemented in a particular IVA patch.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops, yeah it was the maneuver planner I was thinking of. Figured there was probably a bit more to it with that than some of the other MechJeb options since the maneuver planner covers so many different bases of control. By the way I noticed in the screenshots you have some type of geographical map displayed on some of the screens, is that through some extra mod I\u0027ve missed somehow?
