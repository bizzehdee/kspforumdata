I tested it five different times with a quicksave last night. Pushed all my fuel to the front, to the back, balanced, dumped out a bunch, it didn\u0027t seem to matter what my CoM was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI watched it on Flight Engineer\u0027s Surface tool. The plane keeps perfect attitude until about 69-70km. Then as soon as the atmo and drag data starts to populate in Flight Engineer at ~69km, wham -- doing backflips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has happened on two different SSTOs since the update. I can upload pics tonight, but just wanted to see if anyone had run into something similar, or had any suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what you\u0027re talking about. When you\u0027re \u0026gt;70km you exit the atmosphere and your control surfaces can\u0027t compensate for uneven thrust force. Make sure the CoG and CoT are aligned. Only tiny shifts will have huge impact at high thrust. Building a plane with non symmetric parts and wings, it is almost impossible to be perfectly aligned so I fixed this by using a rocket with gimbal (many don\u0027t). I use a rocket at the rear while air breathing turbines are on the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerram said your fuel distribution may be causing unbalance. That\u0027s another challenge but to a lesser extent in my case because I built a rather big plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes that help?
