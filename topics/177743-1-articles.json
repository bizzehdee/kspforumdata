I recently made a UAV predetor drone which wouldn\u0027t take off. I wondered why and after a while I check the center of lift, and it appeared to be below the aircraft and underground. I dont think this is an issue with mods because my friends who also play say they have the same problem and are saying its just the latest update. If anyone knows what its from or how to fix it It would be very helpful\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-21T23:03:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2018 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by More_Heat_Shields\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoE Smash","CreatedById":189611,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-22T01:19:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve built planes where the center of lift was displayed as just a blue circle with no arrows....no idea what caused it....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrowing away the build and starting over seemed to fix it....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s happened to me on more than one occasion....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may have happened once because I switched to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E with the button in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-22T01:21:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2018 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by JoE Smash\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-22T03:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it is from the latest update, try recreating it in a stock game.\u00A0 Then we can open a bug tracker and get the devs to fix it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
