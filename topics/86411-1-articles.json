Takes off real easy and flies quite nicely until you run out of fuel. Without power it\u0027s a lawn dart. It also has a problem with the toroidal drop tanks. The jets draw from the front groups but then switch to fuel in the main tank instead of going to the rear group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo something to fix the drop tanks, add a pair of canards to make it able to glide, ditch the crew cabin or cargo bay for more fuel and oxidizer and it\u0027ll be a serviceable spaceplane. Alternately, swap cabin or cargo bay for just jet fuel and lose the drop tanks and rocket engines for a fast atmosphere only plane - just make sure to land prior to running out of fuel, unless you like crashing nose first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
