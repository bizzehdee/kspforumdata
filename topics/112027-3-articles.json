Give me a min to post a pic.\n\nI don\u0027t have an image of the hot ship atm, but I do have a pic of the stage that I\u0027m talking about in the editor.\n\nAlso, the maxtemp of those hydrogen tanks is really low, no idea if that was intended or not.\n\n[![screenshot58_zpstyphwnah.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v214/smjjames/screenshot58_zpstyphwnah.png)](http://smg.photobucket.com/user/smjjames/media/screenshot58_zpstyphwnah.png.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T18:15:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hellrespawn","CreatedById":124138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T18:16:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E the only thing i noticed is, that when the radiators (or an other single part of the ship) is very hot and you timewarp really fast, the heat is distributed evenly to the whole ship ... which can be very destructive, when you have 4 or more nearly melting radiators ...\n\nWas about to comment on this. As soon as I go over 100x timewarp, things start blowing up. I\u0027ve tested this on a clean install with only Heat Control and Near Future Electrical (and HyperEdit, for testing purposes, but I doubt that\u0027s it), and it still happens. It\u0027s really easy to reproduce as well.\n\nTake a probe core, an MX-2 reactor and two XR-4500 radiators, put them in space, extend the radiators, start the reactor and increase warp to above 100x. The MX-2 overheats and explodes.\n\n**EDIT:** And you already commented on that. Is it possible to detect time warp? Maybe add a workaround that sets heat output to zero when using 100x\u002B time acceleration or something similar? I realize that would be more of an Near Future Electrical Issue, but still.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T18:23:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 06:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hellrespawn**"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T18:17:18Z","Content":"I\u0027m still a little confused about how this all works.

Dump the engine heat into the biggest mass you have available (ie. the whole rest of the ship), and then radiate away from that mass.\n\nIf you have multiple heat sources (like a nuclear reactor and also an engine), you may want an insulator between them so you can treat each one as an independent problem.\n\nKeep in mind that as you use up the fuel, the mass of the fuel tank will decrease, which might also complicate matters.\n\n(FWIW I\u0027ve done heat engineering in real life, but I\u0027m only starting to play around with it in KSP.)"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T18:49:39Z","Content":"I reproduced what I was talking about while over Kerbin.
