It was a 58 cm (23 in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennae to broadcast radio pulses. The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on \u003Cstrong\u003EOctober 4, 1957\u003C/strong\u003E. It was visible all around the Earth and its radio pulses detectable.
