(Of course I could just use the game time in seconds, but that is rather nondescript for humans.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess I\u0027ll have to write my own formatting method for years and days. This method needs values for the length of a day and a year of the games \u0022home\u0022 planet (so that people with modded solar systems and/or relocated space centers aren\u0027t left out). The CelestialBody class provides the data for the length of the day of a planet, but I can\u0027t find values for the length of the year?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have searched the forums and api docs but can\u0027t seem to find anything the would be helpful for me. The most relevant thing I could find were discussions about the discrepancies between kerbins solar and sidereal days and years...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf someone could point me to some information that helps me to calculate the length of the year of a planet, it would make me very happy. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-08T01:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use\u00A0the orbital period.
