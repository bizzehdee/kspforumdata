About four months ago, I announced that I had to take a break due to health reasons. Well, my treatment is on going but recently I\u0027ve taken a turn for the worse. Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s nothing life threatening. I haven\u0027t touched a model in about two weeks because currently I find it uncomfortable to sit in any one position for any length of time. So instead of leaving you guys wondering what\u0027s up with no status updates, I\u0027m leaving this note. I\u0027m not sure how long it will be, but I probably won\u0027t be doing any modeling in the near future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest case scenario would be a few weeks, I\u0027m seeing my doctor again tomorrow to see about having my treatment adjusted. Worst case scenario will be two or three months.
