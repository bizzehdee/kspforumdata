It will eventually house up to 8 controllable missiles alongside being able to carry up to four fighters, alongside this it will have a mining ship docked on the top for a full complement of support ships. Its crew will consist of mainly engineers and scientists for its primary goal; to explore the solar system and possibly beyond while defending its assets from asteroids, hostile organisations or other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WqMCZ_KkJVA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T18:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat first image looks like a goblin at the top...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to sound rude but do you know what you\u0027re doing? That thing has next to no armour at all and a single weak missile could destroy it, so it\u0027s more of a mining ship, or would be better for carrying utilities, armour is a requirement for military ships, of any kind except fighter, though a fighter could always do with a bit of armour, use 2x2 structural panels for high crash tolerance and wing armour if you want something more lightweight but less crash tolerant, I really like the design of the whole thing, though, especially the fact that it actually launches and I\u0027m taking a special interest in your style, if you want I\u0027d love to have you in my military company, as this seems promising and your other craft must\u0027nt be terrible. You\u0027ve achieved something I\u0027ve never been able to do - a carrier - so I am very impressed, but even carriers need a good amount of armour so as not to be a sitting duck, you have alot to learn but your design is very good so all you do need to learn is the ways of arming and armouring, which is arguably the most complex part of military craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T19:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAircraft parts have a higher impact than wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gonzo44v","CreatedById":88468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T19:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply, with KSP I doubt anyone truly knows what they are doing haha!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship would be pretty sound if it gets shot when squad fix the connections between MK3 parts, they have a 50m/s crash tolerance after all so the armour in terms of tolerance is far higher than a regular wing part (though they flex like a sausage).

If you\u0027re getting into close range combat with a carrier then you know you\u0027re doing something wrong. I think it would be interesting to see a carrier that\u0027s simply framework, that way you could carry more fighters and with a lower part count... though admittedly I still choose to build carriers with hulls, otherwise they\u0027re just no fun. I do however think that armour on battleships ships is extremely important, and there are some ships out there that can withstand pretty much all weaponry, even the most OP ones. Simply due to the way they\u0027re structured, not what they\u0027re built out of. Great work by the way Gonzo, I think people have overlooked that this thing is an SSTO, which is certainly the main feature of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-07T18:49:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2015 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HatBat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
