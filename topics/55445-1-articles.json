(Think of it as having a skid that magically pulls you across the surface when the bottom touches the ground. What you are basically doing is rotating that skid so that it faces straight up, making the bottom no longer touching the ground and no longer working.) This is the way wheels have always worked I unity, and has been in the game since wheels were added.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
