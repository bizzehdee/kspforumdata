Last time I saw him, Nine-O-Nine and The Dragon and His Tail (a B-24) were in town, and I went for a ride with him (he was flying) on the B-24. Or, rather, I tried to go for a ride, the prop governor went out, and I spent a few hours in the B-24 with the engines running, but no flight. Since they had to wait in town for a part, I actually had all the Collings Foundation crew that stayed in ABQ over to the house for dinner.
