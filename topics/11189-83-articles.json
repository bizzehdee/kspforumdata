No crew, no real wings, no batteries, one solar panel, and a single shock cone, it can reach orbit and back, but remember to disable the drone core\u0027s electricity when you don\u0027t need it, to save power. We also saved weight by emptying some oxidizer. Point at 37 - 40 degrees, and when the air runs out, switch to closed cycle until your apoapsis is over 70 km, and then circularize your orbit. WARNING: The Shock Cone has a high probability of exploding due to overheating.(And the Rapier)(AND the solar Panel)  \n\n6.5 tons, using a drone core, 1 solar panel, fuel tank, 2 winglets, and a rapier.  \n\nStrangely, you can stop the drone core from using it\u0027s electric charge, so it doesn\u0027t consume electricity, but you can switch it back on. That\u0027s like telling a probe to shut off, and sending a signal for it to turn on when it\u0027s completely off.   \n\nWith that, I saved the weight of 1 solar panel :D  \n\nI could probably make it lighter by using even lighter \u0027wings\u0027 and using 1 landing gear, but that would make it too hard.  \n\nI had to add a radiator, because I had already spent 3 hours, and around 12 flights, and the solar panel blew up on every single one of those reentries.  \n\nI sunk my SSTO to the bottom of the ocean and blew it up, but that was AFTER I landed safely.  \n\n[video=youtube;ID73NCrqr1w]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID73NCrqr1w[/video]  \n\nThis is also my second successful SSTO, too\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T01:00:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 01:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xiej**"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T00:46:15Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027boolybooly\u0027]Well then, with no further ado, congratulations on completing the K-Prize mission and earning your place on the K-Prize party guest list aka roll of honour for version 1.0.5, you are indeed a K-Prize winner :D[URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=2296221\u0026viewfull=1#post2296221\u0022]  \n\nJust Jim[/URL] Advanced Pilot Precision Award with She.  \n\nI improvised the name, not sure if I missed it but couldnt see one, feel free to supply a correction if you would like to and I will update it.[/QUOTE]  \n\nShe.... yeah..   \n\nI actually had a different name in mind, but don\u0027t change it!

Then went to see how small a craft had to be to get to the mun.   \n\nFirstly, I just want to note that this craft, while it does use some part clipping (Don\u0027t know if that is the correct term) it does so [B]fairly[/B] For example: The nuke is a long, ungainly and altogether unaerodynamic rocket motor. So I emptied a fuel tank out to simulate an empty fuselage and sunk it into it. This doesn\u0027t violate any rules of physics or anything. No clipping of motor \u002B fuel or anything, just makes it more aerodynamic: the sort of solution someone would use in real life.   \n\nSimilarly, the two side tanks are just slightly offset into the middle one in order to create a smoother, more aerodynamic shape. 40 units of fuel was emptied out of each tank to compensate for this; you can think of it as just welding the tanks together. Again, the sort of solution someone would use in real life.   \n\nThere is [I]one [/I]dirty trick I used for this craft; sticking the spike intakes on the RAPIERS (Borrowed that one from Rune\u0027s White Dart, very nice trick. Using it on all of my craft, mostly for aesthetics though : p ).   \n\nSo, here it is. A spacecraft with 2-2.5km/s of DV when in orbit, depending on how well you can fly. I\u0027ve flown this thing out to escape velocity, burnt retrograde, then gone and orbited the mun, with 100 units of fuel to spare. I\u0027ve also flown it two orbit twice, in a row, without refuelling.   \n\nI like it :)  \n\nSorry I don\u0027t have any photos of it taking off/ on the runway...

With no payload bay or docking systems it\u0027s not actually very useful, but in spite of the \u0022design flaw\u0022 it took off with a crew of 4, flew to a ~90km orbit, made a safe reentry without losing any parts (just to be clear: the right chine didn\u0027t burn off, it was never there in the first place), and landed back at the KSC runway after one orbit.

I am using it to haul liquid fuel and oxidizer to my refueling stations in orbit. (station seen here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCSrdbaCROs](%7Boption%7D)) It may make more sense to just use my mine on minmus, but I have special love for SSTOs. Take off, landing, and flight is deceptively easy, and it proved much more durable than I anticipated. I am getting some strange stability issues I still need to troubleshoot, such as unwanted rolling, but it is easily correctable.  \n\nLaunch Weight: 511.5 tons  \n\nFuel Supplied to Station: @225 tons   \n\nDocked in orbit, landed on runway.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-02T04:46:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2015 04:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EvermoreAlpaca**"},{"CreatedByName":"g00bd0g","CreatedById":74045,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T23:55:59Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027boolybooly\u0027]Many thanks to all for your mission reports.

Because Chrysler came up with this concept (their one is called of course SERV) for NASA\u0027s space shuttle bid. When NASA put out request for proposal for STS all the aerospace companies already know they had in mind some kind of spaceplane. Chrysler being makers of the Saturn V first stage only has experience in making rocket boosters so they came up with the lone proposal that was different:  \n  \n![Space_Shuttle_concepts.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Space_Shuttle_concepts.jpg)  \n![ChryslerSERV_1.jpg](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8DAL7gPYBiM/TRwPYzHQ1YI/AAAAAAAAArs/dPBgcX9i6gM/s1600/ChryslerSERV_1.jpg)\n\nNotice the size of SKRV compared to Saturn IB and the size of those other absolute colossal shuttle proposals. Just like in KSP spaceplane turned out to be really hard and had NASA picked SERV instead of the Space Shuttle that was eventually built the SERV may still be flying today.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T03:41:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 03:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar**"},{"CreatedByName":"EvermoreAlpaca","CreatedById":150540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T04:22:38Z","Content":"Didn\u0027t mean to post here, please delete\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T04:25:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 04:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EvermoreAlpaca**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T22:23:32Z","Content":"If there is a way to fix the internal links in this thread I would like to hear about it."}]}
