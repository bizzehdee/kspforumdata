Every single launch, no matter what craft. At 1min after launch, 6k up, 175m/s, 1.6g and flying straight, bang.... the craft becomes more exploded in a hurry with this being reported as the object the parts collided with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exact same craft can be moved over to a sandbox save in the same KSP install and flown (flown hard too) so it had to be the career save game file. I\u0027m using lots of mods so I doubt I\u0027m a good case to troubleshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T22:50:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bmyers831\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T07:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI asked in the squad cast and got this (sorry forgot his name): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E That\u0027s a Kerbal Foundries thing, should have been fixed a few versions ago, if it\u0027s still going with 1.9f, then post about it on the thread.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found I am using 1.9a, so I\u0027ll find out if that fixes it.
