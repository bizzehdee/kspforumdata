Enough to refuel Sarnus 2A, which wasted a considerable ammount of its fuel while base-hopping to reach a distance of 2.9km of the base. Unfortunately, the lifter not only was considerably far from the 2A, it was inside \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of the physics bubbles(save for Sarnus 1\u0027s), which meant I\u0027d have to drag it while suffering maximum lag.

But even then, at least this was easier since I only have to deal with two dimensions, unlike actual docking in space, where I have to deal with three.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HudwRcv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HudwRcv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter double and triple-checking, I had Anmund connect the rover and the lifter with KAS fuel pipes. Of course, no fuel is actually pumped, since the rover can\u0027t hold any, but hey, they do work great for towing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, I push the lifter at 1.1m/s. I was being extra-careful here, but thankfully, due to Duna\u0027s mercifully low gravity, I managed to push it up to 5m/s safely. Still, being paranoid like I always am, I never bothered to push it faster than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VyuBhcA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VyuBhcA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a long time of dealing with 3 FPS due to rendering all vessels on the Duna Base at once, I managed to push both the rover and the lifter out of the base\u0027s phyisics sphere, which upped the framerate considerably. Eventually, I took the fuel hose from the Duna Rover and put it in Sarnus 2A. But, unusually, KIS was being a jerk right when I needed it to work, and whenever I tried to get Dancott to detatch the hose with his screwdriver, it would not work, with KIS only showing the icon \u0022Grab\u0022 that does not actually do anything. I just decided to get on with it and use KAS\u0027 own ability and took the hose off without any tools, and slapped it on 2A. The mod author of KIS should look into this issue. Either that or I just made a bug myself by installing something wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, Dancott monitors the fuel transfer.

It will probably not use most of it on its way back to Kerbin anyway. Once the Fuel Rover arrives, I\u0027ll probably send a fraction of the fuel that now belongs to the 2A(while taking the ammount of fuel left in the lifter) and ship it off to Sarnus 1.

Unfortunately, I discovered far too late that ScanSat\u0027s MULTI scanner only operates up to 500km. Bummer. Of course, the probe still had more than enough fuel to go back to a 480km orbit(Duna\u0027s gravity is just awesome!), but that would mean the High-Res scanner would work at a lower efficiency. I just decided to leave it at its current orbit until it finishes mapping Duna\u0027s surface, then lower its orbit to scan for anomalies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo bad that the probe\u0027s lifter stage, designed to be 100% recoverable, won\u0027t be since it was designed to only haul satellites to Kerbin orbit, thus it won\u0027t make it back home from Duna, unless I somehow manage to rendezvous it with the space station(which is in a vastly different inclination from the probe), refuel it, and send it back to Kerbin. But hey, unlike the Rover lifter and the Station pusher, this one has batteries and solar panels, which means it can land safely on Duna\u0027s surface.
