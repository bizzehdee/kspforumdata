I am not trying to patronize you or anything but you just gotta accept the game as the buggy mess it is and enjoy it as much as you can.

When you get that kind of answer its generally best to ignore it until someone gives you a legitimate answer, like below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHe issue in question is caused by how biomes are determined. Biomes are created as a map of a planetary surface that is color coded. The color, as RGB code, is tied to the biome. Sometimes, because of compression, biome borders can register as a biome completely unrelated to either of the two biomes its sandwiched between. One of the most common occurrences is the transition between shores and grasslands on Kerbin. Simply heading west out of the KSC can register you in tundra for a brief minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also a plateau on Duna where highlands and midlands are mixed up (highlands on the edges, midlands in the middle), but that\u0027s not your issue. There may be a mistake on the biome map or you were caught with a fluke in determining biome. Its a known issue and there\u0027s actually not much Squad can do about it aside from cleaning up the maps (unless of course they\u0027re willing to fully recode how biomes work).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
