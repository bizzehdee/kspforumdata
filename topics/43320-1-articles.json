That way I can watch the curve more easily. I find it harder to judge pitch than yaw from watching the craft, so if I were going for a polar orbit, I would turn the camera. Of course, I\u0027m mostly just watching the navball anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@\u003Cstrong\u003EAmazonys\u003C/strong\u003E: The launchpad is a few arc-minutes south of the equator, so if you don\u0027t correct on your way up, your orbit will indeed be slightly inclined. You can use MechJeb\u0027s surface info readout to get your latitude; I know the runway is 2\u0027 24\u0022 S, and the launchpad is a little south of that, so maybe 4\u0027 S. But if you\u0027re ending up a whole degree off, it\u0027s because you\u0027re not heading perfectly east as you turn. Here again, it may help to use MechJeb\u0027s surface info; the centers of the markers on the navball tend not to be quite where they look like they are, at least to my eyes, but if MechJeb says my heading is 90.0 degrees (which is almost never) then I believe it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
