When you activate it the standard spinning dish will pop up along with the camera module (the picture on the first post of this thread shows this at the island airfield). The cameras will point directly at the nearest anomaly (though it only rotates in one dimension, so this works best if you mount the scanner on top of a rover body, or something equivalent), which in this case will be the KSC anomaly, the center of which is located about 30m below a point midway between the VAB and the launchpad. \u003Cp\u003EIf you try to collect data you\u0027ll be a little too far away, so an on-screen message will tell you which direction to go, the exact distance and directions will be printed in the debug menu.
