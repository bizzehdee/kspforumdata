Also, Minmus has large, totally flat areas that are very easy to hit by setting up a retrograde node that shows you coming down to slightly overshoot a flat. Then, when you are definitely above the flat, kill all your horizontal speed and just let it drop, braking as necessary. It isn\u0027t the most efficient way but the difference won\u0027t be very much and you\u0027ll still need far less deltaV than you would for Mun. To do multiple biome hits from a single landing you should try to land as close to the edge of a flat as possible so you can climb into the surrounding hills. After a few landings you should get the hang of it and try landing on less flat areas. Minmus is better for this as the lower gravity is more likely to allow you to right your ship just using the reaction wheels and/or rcs if you happen to fall over on the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T15:01:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022morph113\u0022 data-cite=\u0022morph113\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf I remember correctly you can only get 1 surface sample into the pod, but of course as much eva\u0027s as you want.
