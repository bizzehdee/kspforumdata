Sounds great and gives modular space stations a real purpose. Only concern would be that the space station would look a bit monotonous if it\u0027s just 6 science cans strapped together.

Each lab, during construction and/or landed on Kerbin, can switch between different set of equipment. Each sample can only be processed through an equipment once, and each time a sample is processed the transmission recovery rate is increased. So, if you so desire, you can build a space-station with enough science equipment that your transmission efficiency is near 99% (essentially, you\u0027ve the entire lab on Kerbin moved into space). You might get a ship that has a mass of a few hundred tons, but now you can move it all over the Kerbol system, doing science without every returning the samples all the way back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
