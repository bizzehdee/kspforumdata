For rockets, you\u0027re pretty much in the clear and able to hit the gravity turn with reasonable (maybe not \\*quite\\* optimal, but I haven\u0027t measured yet) efficiency once you get past 11km; start full-thrust until you start seeing white, then back off until you\u0027re at that 10-11km mark (at which point ramp up the thrust again).\n\nMost calculators probably haven\u0027t been adapted to the new physics model yet, so they\u0027re going to be off.

As others mentioned, rather pay attention to making a proper gravity turn to avoid wasting fuel on gravitational drag, and avoid going too fast and overheat.\n\nAlso, you can still travel at the most efficient velocity, i.e. terminal velocity, AND find yourself burning up.

Stay at that height long enough, and you get warm anyway.
