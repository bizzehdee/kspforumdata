It seems to be a result of some combination of the strange save (\u0022ships\u0022 in the persistence file that are not in the ships folder) and attempts to attach things to them, particularly with multiple points. But it doesn\u0027t manifest all the time. Even the second time I ran the scenario (for the video) and got glitches, when I was moving the spaceplane into place I had to reposition a couple of times to get more claws attached, and had no issues when undocking/redocking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wooks","CreatedById":101499,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T02:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allmhuran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allmhuran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...

The removal of the probe cores did help quite a bit, there are some other bugs that came up and some things were noticed. Any craft with multiple claws docking both or more at once seems to reactivate float glitching and having docked sections too close together sometimes caused glitchy explosions on any timewarp. Crashing to desktop became an issue with certain claw-enabled craft whenever attempting to return to space center after connecting to the Whackjobian parts. *Tries to remember other problems. File in brain is too big to process*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhoo, the completely accidentally and totally malicious destruction of probe cores DID help, with copious amounts of quicksaves and quick learning on what to avoid, we\u0027ve managed to struggle toward progress one CTD at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
