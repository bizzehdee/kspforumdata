If downloading from SpaceDock, CurseForge or GitHub you need to unzip the downloaded folder and then check what\u2019s inside- if the mod contains a GameData folder, drag that into the root KSP directory so it merged with the existing GameData folder (or copy the contents of mod/GameData into KSP/GameData); if not, copy the mod folder into KSP/GameData. Make sure you also include any dependencies such as Module Manager, some mods come with those but others don\u2019t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WelshManGaming","CreatedById":223924,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-01T09:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni have done all that but it is still not working\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
