The InternalSpace shader can be used from the old PartTools, however, they will need to be moved over to the SquadCore folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe changes needed are: Change shader name from\u00A0KSP/InternalSpace/BumpedSpecular to KSP/InternalSpace\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the copy the LightingKSP.cginc to the SquadCore folder to prevent any errors in Unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
