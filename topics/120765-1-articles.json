Well, that will depend completely on their orbit and current position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, but I believe mods that calculate this for planets rely on the starting positions of the planets on Y1 D01 0:00 as a datum for working out optimal phasing windows. For asteroids, you\u0027d need the relevant formulae and you\u0027d have to put in the asteroid\u0027s orbital parameters, which I\u0027m not sure you can access in enough detail (since they\u0027re randomly spawned).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m probably not the best informed on this, but I doubt whether that kind of mod or calculator is available, since there are so many variables to consider for a truly \u0027optimal\u0027 burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T22:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbits are defined by only 6 parameters, I think KER give them.
