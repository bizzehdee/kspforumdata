The categories seem to match up perfectly with their tabs in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, so much that I assumed that that\u0027s what they\u0027re for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I noticed that a handful of parts are in the category \u0022Propulsion\u0022, and now I\u0027m confused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that there is already a category for \u0022Engines\u0022 and another for \u0022FuelTanks\u0022 so this is not one of those. Nor is it for jet engines or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or anything like that. It contains - among others - the parts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Rhino\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMk2 Bicoupler\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNCS Adapter\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nS3-14400 Fuel Tank\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems on a first glance that this category is for all the SLS parts. Okay, fine. Weird, but fine. But how does the game know to put them in their correct places? The Rhino isn\u0027t in the fuel tanks tab and the 14400 tank isn\u0027t in engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the propulsion category for, and why is it inconsistent with the rest of the categories? And is there an actual way to - by looking at the part cfgs - determine what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E tab a given part will be in?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T02:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should be from before engines and tanks were split. \u00A0I think it was left for backwards compatibility with logic to put stuff in the right category (only guessing at the criteria, but presence of ModuleEngines or ability to hold fuel are two likely candidates).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T02:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh wow I totally forgot that engines and fuel tanks used to be in the same category.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
