I was contracted to build an 11-kerbal capacity space station, and place it in solar orbit along a class E asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went ahead and build my biggest space station yet, put it in the sky, did a low-orbit refuel and finally broke free from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I had synced up with my chosen asteroid, I realized something was off. All requirements for the contract were fulfilled, except for one. I needed to stick the station onto the asteroid, and I hadn\u0027t brought a claw..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I finally regained motivation, I build an unmanned claw capable of docking the station and sticking it to the asteroid. It went better than I had hoped for!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever.. My contractee seems dissatisfied.
