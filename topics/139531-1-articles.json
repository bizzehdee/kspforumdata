This planet may have formed on the inner boundary of the frost line and may have a large core. It also has a year of 125.6 days. Depending on the star, Kepler-539b may be in the habitable zone. Its neighbor, \u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-539c\u003C/strong\u003E, has a much longer year and was only found by radial velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-607b\u003C/strong\u003E has a radius just 7.8% that of Jupiter, making it just 87.36% as large as Earth. But this tiny planet whips around its star in just 15.3 hours! No matter what star, this planet is going to be quite a furnace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe star \u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-610\u003C/strong\u003E has two planets, and they may show the size of their parent. \u003Cstrong\u003E610b\u003C/strong\u003E has a year of about a week, but \u003Cstrong\u003E610c\u003C/strong\u003E has a year of 152 days. And no, 610c was NOT discovered by radial velocity. The star Kepler-610 is possibly an orange dwarf, because no known red dwarf has a transiting planet with a year of over 70 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-616b\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-616c\u003C/strong\u003E are two ice giants with 21.7% to 30% the radius of Jupiter, and are in a 9-1 resonance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-653c\u003C/strong\u003E is even smaller than Kepler-607b and has a year of about 21 hours. What\u0027s different is that it has a nearby ice giant with a year of about 2 weeks. This shows that the ice giant took Kepler-653c with it during its inward migration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-699b\u003C/strong\u003E may be a Super Jupiter. It has 1.26x Jupiter\u0027s radius and orbits once every 28 days. Either it\u0027s a hot Jupiter orbiting a large star, or a Super Jupiter orbiting a medium-sized star. Similar thing with \u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-706b.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EKepler-758\u003C/strong\u003E has one of the largest systems in this data set. It has 4 planets, all less than 23% the size of Jupiter. They have radii of 0.221, 0.151, 0.189, and 0.136 times that of Jupiter, and years of 12.1, 4.7, 20.5, and 8.1 days.
