I love them so much! I just designed a spaceplane that uses Infernal Robotics to tilt a docking port so I can retrieve and service old satellites. No longer do I deorbit them, they\u0027re all designed to fit into my spaceplane so they can be brought safely home. Goodbye Kessler Syndrome! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, I love the modding community for KSP. I love the amazing ideas they come up with and all the wonderful things we can do with it. Upon landing, I decided: Hey, I could use this and KAS, and I could make a crane to service the spaceplane, to remove the old satellite. Now, I have a spaceplane I refuel, I keep it sitting on the tarmac just off of the runway, ready to roll out and go save my Kerbals. I kinda wish there was a \u0027Rover\u0027 hangar, (it\u0027d work just like the spaceplane hangar though, so kinda redundant) but it\u0027d deploy rovers over inside the KSC, so my little Kerbals could roll out and load up onto things, or go do things, without having to launch on the runway or launchpad. Ohwell!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmnh. Perhaps a new mod idea there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T16:50:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConcurred.
