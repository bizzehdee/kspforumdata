Should be easy to find though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, having the wings up high makes the center of mass hang down like a necklace, which is stable, whereas having them low makes it balance on top like uh... something that balances on something else. Less stable. Less stable means perturbations such as turbulence will affect the flight more, but equally so will perturbations in the form of wiggling the control surfaces to make it go the way you want.
