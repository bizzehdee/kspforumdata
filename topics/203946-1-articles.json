When I was a child, my dream was to become an astronaut. I was planning to attend the Naval Academy at Annapolis until my family pressured me not to go into the Navy. My goal was to become a fighter pilot (F14 Tomcats at the time) and then, from there, become a test pilot for the Navy and NASA. Normally, this is one of the pools NASA chooses astronauts from. Again, family pressures and all, I didn\u0027t go. Years later, after serving nearly eight years in the Army, my body was too damaged to even be eligible to be considered for any military or civilian astronaut program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet, my goals for getting into space are unrealized in the physical world. But I can live them out through KSP. No matter how many times I dock with a space station, land on Minmus or the M\u00FCn, or even Duna, the excitement is still there. Since those early days, I have added OPM and a few other mods to add more planets to visit. Why? Because it\u0027s how I can explore space without any stinkin\u0027 health and physical requirements. Maybe, someday, I will live out my dream to get into space - even if it is just a suborbital trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve played in sandbox mode since sandbox mode was all that existed when 0.18 came out. In fact, I still exclusively play sandbox mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are literally challenges I have come up with that are, in my opinion, just as difficult if not more so, than the contracts offered in the career or science modes. I like defining my own objectives, setting my own limitations, and then creating my own craft to fulfill those objectives. And not every mission is successful - I have had to make several rescue missions because of a design oversight. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EGenerally speaking, I have more fun in sandbox mode games than I do following contrived story lines. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-23T16:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTricking people into learning aerospace engineering and orbital mechanics while they think they\u0027re having fun.\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBest,\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E-Slashy\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-24T16:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/38144-cloakedwand72/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002238144\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/38144-cloakedwand72/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cloakedwand72\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0The point of KSP is what ever you want it to be.
