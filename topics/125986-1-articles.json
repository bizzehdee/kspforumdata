Those two values are very close to each other so unless they are on opposite directions, it seems like a Moho vehicle that fills up nicely with ISRU can do a more efficient transfer to Eeloo than it would from Kerbin. I didn\u0026#39;t actually get any numbers for this and I don\u0026#39;t know if being that close to the sun would make the Oberth effect you get not worth it (as from Kerbin you start with Kerbin\u0026#39;s higher energy orbit), so can someone tell me if a Kerbin -\u0026gt; Moho -\u0026gt; Eeloo round trip may actually make sense? Or is a straight transfer to Eeloo more efficient? Keep in mind that I know Moho is hell to get to and there\u0026#39;s no way Moho to anything will save Delta-V much less when landing is involved, but consider ISRU and just a fully fueled spacecraft at Moho surface.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T18:32:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by More Boosters\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T16:52:50Z","Content":"\nThe way I understand Oberth Effect is that you can get more energy out of the same burn the more kinetic energy you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re already carrying, i.e. the faster you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going. So from that perspective, a craft landed on Moho has more kinetic energy than one landed on Kerbin because of Moho\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s higher orbital velocity, so the transfer to Eeloo should be more efficient, but not necessarily cheaper because you have to raise your orbit higher than you would if departing from Kerbin. Without any solid basis to say this, it seems to me the transfer burn would end up being more expensive overall.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn my experience, the best way to get to Eeloo is with a Jool gravity assist.

Instead of going straight back from Moho to Kerbin, I went to Eve first and then from Eve to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat wasn\u0026#39;t the most \u0022efficient\u0022 way-- it\u0026#39;s definitely cheaper in terms of total dV to go straight from Moho to Kerbin than from Moho to Eve to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, a direct Moho-to-Kerbin trip takes a [I][U]lot[/U][/I] of dV, and my ship was marginal in that regard. And also, a direct Moho-to-Kerbin transfer will cause an arrival at Kerbin with very high velocity, and there was some concern about whether my ship could handle aerobraking at that speed; arriving at Kerbin from Eve results in a considerably lower velocity upon Kerbin arrival.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherefore, I sent my ship from Moho to Eve (requiring much less dV than sending it to Kerbin); stopped at Gilly to mine fuel and fill up my tanks; then went home to Kerbin. Very poor \u0022efficiency\u0022 in terms of total dV used, and crappy use of Oberth effect, but the fact that I could stop in the middle to fill up my tanks more than made up the difference.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBe aware that Moho is very deep in the Sun\u0026#39;s gravity well. It will take considerably more dV to go from Moho to Eeloo than from Kerbin to Eeloo. ([URL]http://ksp.olex.biz[/URL] is a handy tool for this). So the question is whether you have the dV budget for it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn easier solution, from an engineering standpoint, would be to go home to Kerbin first, fuel up from a mining operation on Mun or Minmus, then go from there. I like Minmus as a refueling stop, because not only is it very cheap to land and take off from (really helps with mining economics), but also, if you\u0026#39;re leaving Minmus to go to another planet in the Kerbol system, you can get a pretty good slingshot past Kerbin for some Oberth love. Just takes a little finesse to deal with the orbital inclination.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T17:07:41Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Streetwind\u0027]Well, what do you want to achieve with a Kerbin -\u0026gt; Moho -\u0026gt; Eeloo trip?

I notice Eeloo\u0026#39;s longitude of ascending node is at 50 degrees and Moho\u0026#39;s at 70 degrees, so their orbits are not too far from coplanar. But...\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing Flyby Finder I see that, starting from a 20x20km orbit over Moho, and braking into a 20x20km orbit at Eeloo, the minimum start burn is about 4280m/s, and the minimum braking burn is about 1760m/s.

I wondered about flybys, but the minimum to get to an Eve flyby from Moho is around 1070m/s, while the minimum from Kerbin to Eve is about 1030, so no sequence of flybys can be better from Moho than Kerbin, though it could be close.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T19:59:36Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027More Boosters\u0027](...)\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: And as Snark answered, the \u0022free plane change\u0022 and Oberth effect you get from being so low don\u0026#39;t even come close to making up for the penalty of being so deep in the gravity well.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile nearly similar in inclination, the argument of the periapsis of Moho is 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and of Eeloo is 260\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, nearly the opposite.
