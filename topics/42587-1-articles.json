When you have enough materials in an area you can build a base. Now you can place the center building in the vicinity as long as it\u0027s flat enough. After that it works like a building sim. You can build VABs, launch pads, runways, mine stations, habitats etc. Many have made a similar suggestion for KSC. The difference from KSC is that you have to bring materials to the base to build things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe different celestial bodies have some unique minerals. They\u0027re more concentrated in some areas so colony placement is also important (And can add a challenge). Some parts need specific materials which can only be produced on those planets, which means you have to ship them back to KSC to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think of my idea? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T14:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, but this has been suggested time and time again.

However, I don\u0027t know how complex it\u0027ll be. There was a \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E good resource flow chart that they posted a while back, but supposedly it was deemed too complex and they more or less canned that idea. It would\u0027ve been PERFECT, though, not going to lie...and they could\u0027ve made it seem a lot simpler than it looked in that big flow chart by introducing some elements(water, oxium, propellium, etc..) first BEFORE introducing mining bits. Then you\u0027d only have to worry about one or two resources which is really simple...then after you understood those, adding another wouldn\u0027t be too hard to grip. Then another and so on until you\u0027re a master of the resource flow chart. Just like any game element that seems too complex for people to understand. I mean, that\u0027s what KSP is all about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, they\u0027d also mentioned potentially leaving expansive or complex mining operations to an expansion pack. They kind of said the same for colonization. We\u0027ll have bases and things like that, but not full-on colonization in KSP1.0. Of course, when they mentioned expansions/DLC, everyone went insane for a week....so I couldn\u0027t tell you what exactly they\u0027re planning in those areas for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you can bet that there\u0027ll be(and already are) mods for those types of things. So yay~\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
