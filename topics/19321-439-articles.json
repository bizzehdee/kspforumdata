All the data you\u0027re showing shows highly swept wings (with nearly the same, but not identical shapes) having nearly the same, but not identical lift slopes. The lowest manages 25 degrees AoA before stalling; the other 35 degrees. Those are both amazing angles of attack to reach before stalling and are absolutely correct. From what you actually showed (not much) of the earlier crafts, they all have identical wing configurations... which means they should have identical liftslopes and stall performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see any bug with the dev build, I think you\u0027re simply mistaking correct behavior for bugged behavior and vice-versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust one more thing - the chart\u0027s set to be out of 75 points.
