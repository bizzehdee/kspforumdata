They also do no damage. Missiles and bombs all work, but not guns. I have North Kerbin Dynamics installed. I believe I have the latest version of BDArmory installed. When using the last BDArmory before the most recent KSP update,\u00A0 bullets did not appear at all, and also did no damage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
