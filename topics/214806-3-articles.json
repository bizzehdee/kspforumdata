Whilst hardware has improved significantly, terrain remains the biggest source of frame delay in KSP1 (if you don\u0027t push partcounts). This has been known for a long time, as the last update to PQS was on \u003Cstrong\u003E0.20\u003C/strong\u003E, in the form of \u0022streamlining\u0022, and even then it was still easily noticeable that terrain and the PQS system in general was a problem.

I\u0027d like to clarify a few points here - again, from a non-specialist perspective, but based on what I witnessed as our terrain system evolved. While PQS\u002B does tessellate terrain in the same way that the original system did (that is to say, increasing the poly count when an observer/object gets close to the surface), it also does many, many things that the older system did not and is fundamentally a new system. Among the new requirements - it needed to support triplanar mapping, it needed to allow our terrain artists to intermix multiple distinct biomes in ways that looked good at all scales, it needed to support many octaves of detail so that artificial-looking patterns did not emerge at either high or low altitudes, it needed to support the addition of topology-defining decals for areas of high detail, and it required painstaking co-development with our environment artists to give them the tools to bring all of those things together in a way that looked natural and beautiful. I am actually quite proud of the progress made by our team on this system.
