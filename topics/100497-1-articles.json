Early on in the career game, before the science tree gets fully opened up, the contracts called for a range of lifters for orbit and Mun and Minmus missions. I\u0027d patched together lifters in the past but I wanted a more organised approach. Having created a payload I wanted to easily find a pre-tested lifter, with only partly-opened-science-tree parts, to get it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am aware that advanced players use \u0027delta V\u0027 to calculate things, and I could probably learn how to do that, but I do sometimes like to try doing things my own way. I did come across some formulae for calculating delta V, a complex one for multi-stage rockets and a simpler one for single-stage craft, both on this forum (on one of the threads with \u0027lifter\u0027 in the title). Kerbals seem like simple folk though, so I wanted something easily understandable. On reflection, my calculations end up being about acceleration and time, and velocity does equal acceleration by time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore starting this project, I did search all forum threads with \u0027lifter\u0027 in the title, ignoring the ones for \u0027heavy\u0027 lifters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome observations I\u0027d made underpinned my approach :-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Drag seemed to be a problem at 100m/s at 1000m, at 250m/s at 5000m, and much less of an issue above 10000m (these particularly noticed while using space planes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The faster the take-off (taking into consideration the drag) the more efficient the lifter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Engines used at 100% power seemed more efficient than those with lower thrust settings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Solid rocket boosters (SRBs) seemed significantly cheaper than liquid fuel engines (LFEs)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Almost all of my rockets had a payload which included a LFE at the base, so I wanted a lifter to \u0027nearly\u0027 get me where I wanted to go, then the payload could do the last bit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* There\u0027s an unexpected slow-down after dropping off a stage .. and after calculating/trialling some lifters, I found 3 stage lifters were more cost-efficient than 4 stage lifters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* After calculating/trialling some lifters, the 315 strength SRB wasn\u0027t all that useful compared with the 250 and the 650 SRBs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing trial and error I found the payload that the different lifting engines could lift, which would get the rocket to 100m/s at 1200-1300m. I measured how long each engine lasted at sea level (ASL) and above 10000m eg the 250 SRB can lift it\u0027s own mass (3.75t) plus payload 10.35t [Total 14.1t] at the required acceleration, and goes for 29 secs ASL and 31 sec above 10000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing those findings plus trial and error, I found the required time a 3-stage lifter needed to get the payload nearly to \u0027orbit\u0027 (~186 sec total lifter work \u002B or - ~3sec), \u0027Mun influence\u0027 (~214 sec), and \u0027Minmus influence\u0027 (~216 sec). Leaving Kerbin influence required very little added thrust compared with getting nearly to Minmus influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreating lifters, I made sure each stage could lift itself and the mass above it at the required acceleration (or \u0027close to\u0027, or better).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to Mun and Minmus influence I used the \u0027aim straight up, 45 degrees ahead of the Mun (or Minmus)\u0027 strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created a spreadsheet, which grew as much by evolution as design, to do most of the calculations. I allowed for reduced fuel levels in a stage to reduce weight/mass. The spreadsheet would provide the percentage power level required for each stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found I could predict the type of lifter and power levels required to get a certain mass up, with reasonable accuracy. I calculated the maximum mass each lifter could get up, then tested it. I noted the fuel required by the payload LFE to finally get the payload to the desired place eg to the altitude needed to get within Mun influence (if that was the target). I calculated cost per ton for each lifter to get the mass to orbit, for comparison. To get an in-between mass up, I could reduce the fuel in the 3rd stage (just prior to payload), and make a prediction using the evolving spreadsheet. I compared some of my patched-together lifters with spreadsheet-designed ones, and the designed ones did better. I created some lifters using the spreadsheet (lifters I\u0027d not created before) which was useful. I found I could \u0027get a bit more\u0027 by setting the 3rd stage to 100% power for orbit (not with the very low payload rockets), and the 2nd and 3rd stages to 100% for Mun/Minmus, and by setting the power a few percent higher (usually ~5% higher) for the 1st stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the tested payloads had only an OKTO as the pod and no added \u0027control\u0027 components\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the mass information near the bottom right corner in the rocket-building screen was very helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that my strategy to to get to orbit involves angling the rocket to ~22 degrees by around 10000m up, 45 degrees by around 22000m, quickly starting the move to get to 90 degrees when the \u0027apo\u0027 gets to ~52000m, and (except for the smaller rockets) delaying the firing of the 3rd stage until quite late (call it the \u00275 step takeoff\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that for \u00274S\u0027 1st stage rockets and larger ones, starting the angling around 2-3000m and doing it more gradually, and having a no-thrust break between stages, got a greater mass into orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite the feeling that overlapping stages in Mun/Minmus lifters seemed to help, with few exceptions the final results were better by just doing the stages one straight after the next (firing the next while releasing the one before).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that my Sepratrons tend to be tweaked to 60% power and 50% fuel for the 650 SRBs (or pairs or triplets of them)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** SPOILER ALERT ** If you enjoy making your own lifters, and working things out for yourself, don\u0027t look at my results (below) too closely\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st stage (power percent) [fuel percent], 2nd stage () [], 3rd stage () [] - Target - Payload mass (payload fuel needed to get to target) [Lifter cost, cost per ton]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E NB S = SRB.

As the previous poster pointed out, you seem to not be using something like Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb to get dV values calculated directly for each setup, which probably explains why it feels that you started your analysis from a lower base of understanding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of points which dovetail with what you have observed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The balance point between losses due to staying too long in the gravity well and going up too fast (thus loosing too much energy to drag) is called the terminal velocity. As you have noticed, in Kerbin it\u0027s around 100m/s at 2000m, 120m/s at 8000m and then onwards it quickly goes up to the point that it\u0027s not worth trying to reach it. One of the ways one can squeeze extra mileage of a build is to tune it so that climb speed is roughly the same as terminal speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t forget that another way of saving on costs is making recoverable stages. Thus for example my mid-sized launcher with a payload of about 25 tons has a liquid fuel central core (Skipper engine \u002B orange tank) and a ring of 8 boosters, and actually costs about 10k less than yours, simply because that central core is recoverable (it has a probe core, parachutes and a bit of reserve fuel for deorbittng) which gives me 33k back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- One of the reasons for wanting to have a liquid fuel component in a launcher is thrust control. The extra thrust from the liquid fuel engine can be used in the first 2000m to reach terminal velocity as fast as possible, then be switched off while the boosters propel you through the thicker atmosphere, and later switched back on above around the 10000m mark when both terminal velocity is much higher and the effective ISP of that engine is now much higher since it\u0027s closer to vacuum ISP. Also, when Apoapsis reaches the desired orbit hight, it\u0027s nice to be able to control thrust - your little scheme of \u0022onwards and upwards\u0022 to reach the Mun and Minmus is much harder to make work when you\u0027re trying to find the correct heading and speed for a fuel efficient Jool transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokmonkey","CreatedById":9319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T17:16:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood grief that is a lot of SRB\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, delta-V, if you really want to make efficient rockets, you need to learn it. It\u0027s critical. Simply put, delta-V is a measure of how much fuel you have. It\u0027s measured in velocity, seeing as how in space all of your maneuvers are just changes in velocity at different times. There are many guides out there that can tell you how to do that by hand, it is a very simple, if tedious, calculation.

They have no throttle, no control, and you can\u0027t turn them off. they are RARELY, and I mean RARELY used beyond your first stage.

One thing to keep in mind, \u0022flight time\u0022 is not the only variable you should be watching. You want to look at the velocity as well.

This would be less for different-direction orbits required by some of the Mun contracts. Going straight up takes less player time, which has it\u0027s merits when there are dozens of contracts ahead.
