I also have UKS/OKS installed, and there\u0027s a part that builds rocket parts, but it requires metals, chemicals and polymers, which I have no idea what those are.\n\nOr if I can\u0027t use the Karbonite resource, how do I get the metal ore that\u0027s used by EL? I tried to look for a SCANSat part that scans for Metal Ore, but doesn\u0027t seem like there is one.\n\nSorry, I\u0027m pretty new to the whole resource thing, so I\u0027m a bit confused."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T19:07:25Z","Content":"Probably want to ask in the MKS thread.
