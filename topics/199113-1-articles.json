However, upon arriving at Minmus with an engineer and the required part, there was nothing there. Is it supposed to be one of my own satellites? If so, how do I identify it? None of them are named anything resembling the name given in the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SLKiXsu\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002295.52\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 width=\u0022670\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/download/SLKiXsu/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-27T18:35:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have all the map displays on (different types of object)? It might show up as an unowned object (question mark) until you get close to it.

It was classified as Debris. Didn\u0027t think of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite a weird design decision imo. The thing had a working probe core, power, and antennae. And the quest lore characterised it as a working albeit ageing craft.
