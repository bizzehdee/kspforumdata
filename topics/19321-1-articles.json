Can you post a craft file that had this problem, since I don\u0027t think it\u0027s with my code (at least I can\u0027t replicate it from the description).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you don\u0027t have any of the autopilots selected (so that they show the k values) then they\u0027re off. It is possible you\u0027re talking about the 1/4 second it takes the control surfaces to fully deflect, which I\u0027m starting to think is a little to much. (Maybe 1/10 of a second? 1/15? *shrug*) It\u0027s supposed to be a smoother change in angle of attack for the control surface, more like a real plane, but I might have overdone it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, what other plugins do you have installed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027ll fix that error about \u0022plugin\u0022 instead of \u0022Plugins.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-21T19:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUm, the flight assistant spazzed out when the game went from the frozen \u0027loading\u0027 state in the flight scene to physics-enabled on the runway.

I\u0027m going to attach my output log; hope it provides and easy solution. Another bug I forgot to report with the GUI is that in the construction scene, sometimes the FAR Control Systems window is undraggable, and because its default position covers up the staging bar, it\u0027s somewhat problematic. Strangely, it seems doing something like using the scroll wheel wakes it up sometimes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: Right, weirdness happening now. I can only reproduce the bug when RF Lazor System\u0027s GUI is also drawn on flight start.
