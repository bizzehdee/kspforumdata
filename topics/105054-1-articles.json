Throttle up Engines and start engines**\n\n**2. Stay on runway until a minimum of 80 meters per second is achieved. Begin pitching up at 10 degrees**\n\n**3. Retract landing gears at an altitude 150 meters.**\n\n**4. Fly the airbus with its cargo anywhere you want.**\n\n**Landing Instructions:**\n\n**1. Align yourself with the runway.**\n\n**2. Throttle down to half (Should bring you to about 100 meters per second more or less)**\n\n**3. Upon 100 meters of the runway or just patch of land, kill the throttle (Stalling speed for this Airbus is around 60 meters per second)**\n\n**4. Pitch up until your reach your angle of incidence**\n\n**5. Slowly touchdown onto the runway and rejoice that you didn\u0027t kill 69 kerbals.**\n\n**Download the craft here:** **** [https://www.dropbox.com/s/e78iacxpxv6owv5/AirBus%20A319.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e78iacxpxv6owv5/AirBus%20A319.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Happy Flying!!** ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T22:34:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghostbuzzer7**"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:36:40Z","Content":"Nice plane!
