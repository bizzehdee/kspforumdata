Does the control key work if you press it outside of KSP? Check your control keybinds to make sure that shift and control are correctly assigned to throttle up/down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say StickyKeys is the most likely culprit in this case as it sounds exactly like what that\u0027s supposed to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
