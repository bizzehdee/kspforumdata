Couple of reasons: a) it makes it a lot easier to update the individual mods as their creators release new versions, rather than waiting for the big compilation to be updated and having to download the entire thing again just because, say, StretchyTanks got an update. Especially in the case of interdependent mods with tweaks applied through modmanager. Secondly, I don\u0027t necessarily want ALL of the mods that the tree is designed to be capable of using. For example, in this case, I don\u0027t use KW (which is a rather large mod) but I do use NovaPunch and AIES. It also supports multiple life support mods, but really you only want to have one of them installed at a time. I also don\u0027t use RSS due to issues it has graphically with my laptop atm - hopefully soon to be fixed when they get the textures and such sorted nicely though. Others might choose a different subset themselves. Having them all independent just makes it easier for me to maintain, especially when I make custom changes to the individual mods on top of the tweaks in this particular setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Stevron: I believe \u0022default\u0022 is actually what would be used there, but I forget. I didn\u0027t bother backing up the settings config file, because if it doesn\u0027t exist (like on a new install) RT2 will auto-create it with the default settings anyway. As for the angle issues - not so much inclination of the orbit (although a highly inclined orbit would make it worse) but how close to \u0022directly overhead\u0022 KSC the comsat is. If you right-click the dish antenna, and select target Kerbin, then activate it, you should have a pair of lines coming out from your ship towards the planet showing in your orbital map (assuming you have all of the default RT indicators still turned on) which are separated by 45 degrees and centered on the center of the planet. As long as KSC (which you can see from the big red dot) is between those lines - and assuming it is not blocked by the planet itself - then you should have a control connection to it active.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-21T21:53:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2013 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RaccoonTOF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stevron","CreatedById":85773,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T02:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sIcO3Xr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sIcO3Xr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe line saying that there is a connection is from a second Comms DTS pointed at mission control, if I turn that dish off I lose connection.

The first post says the tweaks are balanced for the KATO engines config in modular fuels, and I believe this leads to engines that are too powerful for the Kerbol system, correct? Is it safe to use the regular engine.cfg in real fuels, or does that mess with some tweaks? I\u0027m not determined to switch back to Kerbol-scale yet, but it is getting a bit tiring building massive 12000\u002B dV rockets just to lift a small satellite into orbit, which doesn\u0027t have good enough solar panels installed to do much with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome balance/ordering comments: As above, with the tier1 rocket and SRB nodes, it\u0027s extremely difficult to get anything other than a tiny probe into orbit, let alone a manned pod or a geosynchronous comsat. I realize it should be this way, as it\u0027s based off of early 1950\u0027s tech I believe- but the problem is that once I\u0027ve achieved that, I\u0027m having trouble getting anywhere from there. I believe that the mythically perfect tech tree is one that makes it worth your while to use some parts from every node at least once, and carries the player along a path of technical necessity so that the next thing to unlock is something that the player really needs, and will help them progress further when they use it. As an example: I shouldn\u0027t need need to unlock 5-6 different types of probe cores, some of which are meant for deep space probes/exploration of other bodies, before I can get a simple 1-man command pod, which technologically seems one of the simpler things to make in the progression of space technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther problems are that without supersonic flight, flying to other biomes on Earth-sized Kerbin is a chore. My probes are low on batteries and rarely in contact with mission control, so I\u0027m able to only get a few gravity readings in for science points. My rockets aren\u0027t powerful enough to get a Kerbal into orbit to control things and take readings and land wherever I please. I haven\u0027t done any of the custom experiments yet, so there\u0027s that to look forward to, but I don\u0027t many fun ways to get more science and progress to launching something heavier and more controllable into orbit. Also, I don\u0027t believe that control surfaces should be locked behind a 500-science hypersonic flight category; elevators and ailerons have been around since ww1. Finally, the order in which the mechjeb components are unlocked could be improved, in my opinion; I think that the SMART A.S.S. should be around from the beginning, especially since it\u0027s already around in a clunkier format in the RT2 flight computer. Having ascent and landing guidance around from the beginning is great, but with the 1950\u0027s tech, it\u0027s very difficult to build a rocket with enough dV and a reasonable TWR at the same time, and the ascent autopilot has big trouble controlling the turns. Who knows, maybe all my troubles above are just me being a bad rocket scientist?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, to sum it up, it\u0027s a great tech tree, tweak pack, and mod recommendation list; with the need for a few \u0022flow\u0022 changes, at least in the early stages that I\u0027ve played. 500\u002B science isn\u0027t much when you can do things like go to high Earth orbit or the moon, but it is when you can barely get into orbit, and that\u0027s where I\u0027m stuck at. For example, it\u0027s great that the tree forces you to rely on probes very early on, but since those probes are so feeble I can\u0027t progress from there. Maybe it\u0027s just me being incompetent- has anyone else had success in putting up more than tiny probes with the Basic rocketry and early SRB nodes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-22T16:26:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2013 04:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by andqui\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RaccoonTOF","CreatedById":84116,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T17:52:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you use the standard engine configs for stock-scale in MF instead of the KATO engines, you\u0027ll be fine. What you WILL still have to do though is to manually adjust your engine tech levels as you unlock them - so when you are unlocking the rocketry tree, when you first get an engine, make sure that it is set to the appropriate tech level when you install it. This can still result in some slightly overpowered engines in the very beginning of the tree (as some of the engines have minimum tech levels higher than 1) but you can either a) just not use those engines till you reach the appropriate tech level or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E use them at their \u0022minimum\u0022 tech level and only using the default fuel type for the engine until you actually get to the appropriate higher tech levels (which is the approach I am using - primarily because I\u0027m not using KW, so without doing that I end up not having some engine classes available at all until much later in the tree than they should be.

Everything was going great until I accidentally triggered the Kerbin braking boosters during Munar descent...which caused me to have to ditch the rover chassis before even landing it, and then basically spin a few thousand meters above the surface until the SRBs died out. Then I ended up needing to use my ascent/return fuel for the final descent instead...leaving me without enough fuel remaining to even return to Munar orbit. And, as I\u0027m using TAC LS...this means I\u0027m going to have to be mounting a recovery mission soon.
