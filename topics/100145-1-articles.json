FAR comes with a DCA (Dynamic Control Adjustment) option that limits the control surface movement the faster you go. I need a complete opposite of that - the faster you go, the more control you can exert. If I hold W/S most of my designs overreact and go into stall at low speeds as they have too much control authority but respond slowly (or not at all in high altitudes) at high speeds. Is there a plugin that does this?
