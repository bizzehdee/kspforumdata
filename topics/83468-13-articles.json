I\u0027ve been using KAS for a long time, along with many mods, with no issue at all. Yesterday I installed an additional copy of KSP onto my computer in a different location from the first, as I wanted a game to play with different mods than my stock game. After installing mods including KAS -- I found that every time I would go to launch a ship, the game pops up an error telling me that sound files cannot be located such as grab, attach, EVA grab, etc. When flying the ship, EVA and like sounds that are reported in errors are totally muted. I have repeatedly verified that the the reported-to-be-missing sound files are correctly located as .ogg files within GameData/KAS/Sounds. It\u0027s almost like the mod isn\u0027t looking in the correct place for the sound files. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve deleted and redownloaded/installed mod again correctly into GameData folder, deleted other mods besides KAS, ensures the game is running as administrator... and so on. Yet I am still getting this list of errors whenever I launch a new ship from KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s really nuts, is if I install KAS onto my \u003Cem\u003Einitial \u003C/em\u003EKSP install, it works fine. I only get this error when the mod is installed on a subsequent installation of KSP. Has anyone had anything like this before? Any tips or recommendations? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt certianly is most likely not this mods fault at all, but I\u0027ve been using KSP mods for years now and have never encountered this error/issue before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for any wisdom, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Holy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E::EDIT::\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: After getting help and wisdom from the KSP Kiwi chat, and a lot of testing, it seems that my computer takes issue with any KSP install after the first on the same hard drive -- regardless of the install location of the subsequent installs after the first. If I install my second game into a different hard drive, I register no errors. So my first install in C:/KSP/KSP install works fine. The second KSP install in C:/KSP/KSP install #2 gives sound files errors. So does other second installs in C:/games/KSP install #2 and C:/KSP install 2. However, a second install on F:/KSP/KSP gives no errors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is clearly not the mods fault and is some crazy windows issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigured it out, KSP will not load anything inside a folder with the \u0022#\u0022 symbol.
