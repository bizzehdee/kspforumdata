View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the news that SP\u002B will soon be made stock I thought I would show you my latest SSTO, the White Star. The White Star comes in 3 different versions: The standard capable of lifting 2.25T possibly more, the crewed version capable of lifting 4 extra crew to orbit and the large version capable of lifting 4.5T possibly more to orbit. I have never failed to get into orbit with either version as they are easy to fly and have plenty of fuel left over so it does not matter too much if you make a mistake in flight. I always use them to take crew to my space station and I believe you can get into orbit around the moon but I have not checked. I hope you like them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the assent profile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt about 65m/s take off (be careful as tail strikes are easy to get)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPitch up to 45 degrees until 10km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 10km pitch down to 30 degrees until 20km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 20km pitch down to between 0 and 10 degrees and gain horizontal speed \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 28km your engines should go closed cycle so get into orbit like you would any other SSTO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Toggle engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Switch engine mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Toggle intakes \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Toggle solar panels \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Toggle ladder\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: Toggle docking port\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7: Toggle cargo bay (if the ship has one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload link: Standard: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/e5ehegximsr9z9q/White%20Star%20Standard.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/e5ehegximsr9z9q/White%20Star%20Standard.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew carrier: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/xsyrpqrrx626qst/White%20Star%20Crew%20Carrier.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xsyrpqrrx626qst/White%20Star%20Crew%20Carrier.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0sld8gqcfhaa9n2/White%20Star%20Large.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0sld8gqcfhaa9n2/White%20Star%20Large.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you like them I think they are user friendly but with cargo capability they are still useful.
