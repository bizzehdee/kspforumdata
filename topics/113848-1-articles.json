All you need are spider engines for the hinge, and landing gears to push it down. In zero G, actually, the \u0022spring back into place\u0022 action when you release the landing gear is easier.

The landing gear and the lock mechanism can safely be on the sides, where they don\u0027t steal ramp width, and you get a ramp that is *exactly* the same width than the floor of the payload bay. Hell, you can use it to cross from one end of the bay to the other with the bay door open, so it could work as a drawbrige. With pistons. That actually looks like the real thing.\n\nRune.
