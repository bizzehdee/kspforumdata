Currently live near St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Just discovered this game a few weeks ago and am HOOKED! I actually studied Aerospace Engineering in college (and even graduated with that degree!) This game is basically what I dreamed my life would be like as a child, but alas, after a few short years working for LMSC, I had to make the move to IT (for the $$$). This game gives me the opportunity to exercise some of my rusty math and engineering skills and I LOVE IT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI probably won\u0027t post a ton - I usually don\u0027t anyhow - but I\u0027ll probably be hanging around...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Flying!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T22:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi CrashTestDanny.
