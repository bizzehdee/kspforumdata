(A touch over 3km/s from LEO.) It is, however, an incredibly complex mission that would take years. Basic Hohmann transfer is very simple, but requires you to burn to Earth escape, and then to establish transfer. Map from Redjoker\u0027s link gives an outline, but it has a completely wrong number for Earth-Mars transfer. Realistic number there is about 3km/s, depending on position of Mars at intercept. At any rate, that gives you a total of about 6.2km/s for a free-return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for a fly-by, you\u0027ll want anywhere between 3km/s and 6.2km/s depending on mission complexity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you plan to enter Mars\u0027 orbit, you\u0027ll first need to match speeds with the Red planet, which will cost you about 2.6km/s and then break for about 30% of escape velocity to actually make orbit. So that\u0027s another 1.5km/s. A lot of this can be saved via aero-braking, but you will have to burn it again to make return. The absolute minimum, therefore, is 3.1km/s, with 5.7km/s being more realistic, meaning a capture burn with aerobraking to circularize orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you are planning a safe, reliable mission to Mars orbit with a return to Earth, you are looking at about 12km/s. With high risk and long duration, you can bring it down to 4.5km/s using multiple fly-bys and aerocaptures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
