As you jump in the pool, you see that your thunderbird style pool has retracted without warning, revealing TB1. You land on a pile of canvases which break your fall.\n\nWhen you wake up you realize this is a another plot of Attila\u0027s to seek revenge, for you are his *mother* and you had a part in naming him. Suddenly Attila appears with a spear, luckily, because he is figuring out some insane plot for this post, you have time to roll away from the spear and run towards TB4, where you jump in and jet off under the water. Suddenly, a torpedo zooms by your port bow, and you look behind you, where you see another submarine right you, about to launch another torpedo. You take evasive action and dive. The other submarine dives too, and you keep on diving, hoping to go deeper than the other submarine. You continue to dive, and when you reach the max depth of your submarine, the other submarine is still right behind you. In a risky gamble, you continue to dive. The other submarine is still right behind you, when your submarine implodes.\n\nLuckily, you were able to escape in the escape pod, mere moments before you would have been crushed. You escape pod floats to the surface, where you are picked up by a passing ship. Unfortunately, the ship is a pirate ship, and they force you to walk the plank. Seconds before you would have had to jump to the sharks below, the ship explodes, due to a torpedo from Attila\u0027s submarine.\n\nYou are thrown clear by the blast, and land in the water, where you are invisible to radar and sonar because that the sharks mask you to the submarine. Just when it appears that you will eaten, you see that the sharks have cockpits, because they are shark shaped submarines.\n\nyou are picked up in a shark submarine, where you discover that the submarines are driven by strange beings called \u0022Kerbals\u0022 you say that they are aliens from a planet called \u0022Kerbin\u0022 you explain your plight to them, and they agree to help you escape to Kerbin. You are transported back to the shore, where they put you, along with a crew of Kerbals, on a LEO shuttle, where you will get on a mothership back to Kerbin. As you lift off, you discover the reliability of kerbal rockets. Luckily, the LES worked, and you and the kerbals were blasted to safety.\n\nYou realize that maybe escaping on a kerbal rocket isn\u0027t the way to evade Attila, so you bid the kerbals farewell, and stow aboard a oil tanker to get back to your house.\n\nWhen you get back, you discover a sign saying: I know you\u0027re still alive, Attila.\n\nWhew!\n\nI open a window.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T23:31:17Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mad Rocket Scientist**\n  \nAdded some line breaks"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T00:26:07Z","Content":"\\*claps\\*\n\nWell done, sir.

You get some tools and try to unscrew the window. Although it is quite hard, you manage to do it. As you pull the window away, all of your air is sucked out. Why? Because you\u0027re in space. And you forgot about it. The air gets sucked out, and due to the immense air flow part of your craft flies off as well, pulling you away from your spacecraft and putting you in orbit around the Earth, with a really high apogee. You struggle to get back to your ship, but your efforts are in vain. There\u0027s no friction in space to save you. You\u0027re stuck in it, spinning and spinning. You start to get dizzy, and you throw up in your space suit, covering most of the suit\u0027s visor. Bits of your puke fly into your eyes, effectively blinding you. As you panic, you hear a low voice in your radio. It\u0027s mission control. They said they are working on finding out where you are, and will try to send a rescue mission as soon as possible. Hope brings you happiness, despite the foul odor and being blind. Little did you know, that Mission Control knew that it would be impossible to rescue you alive. Hours later, you\u0027re tired. Your eyes hurt like hell. The radio is plain static. You\u0027re still spinning. Your hopes of returning to your family is little. You start to cry, what makes your eyes hurt even more. You can barely breathe because catarrh is covering your nostrils. Suddenly, you hear a beeping. And you know what it means. You have reached the end of your oxygen supplies. You\u0027re not coming home, your family won\u0027t see you again. Friends are left behind. Lives are ruined. You see your entire lifetime in a microsecond. All of the memories, good ones and bad ones. You start to feel the cold coming from the extremities to your brain. You have one last thought.*\n\n*Days later, a rescue ship rendezvouses with you. They have installed a camera on it, to record the first rescue made in orbit, although what the world saw was not what they wanted to. They saw a dead astronaut. They saw failure.
