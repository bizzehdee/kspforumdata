The first few attempts I was able to release all five crafts but unable to keep them close enough to continue flying them all. Eventually I was able to maintain three crafts for a long distance but only able to land two of them but damaged the engines. After landing I went back to the Tracking Station and noticed the Cargo Plane was still available to return to it and I couldn\u0027t believe what I found, the craft was still intact!! Then when I thought I had seen it all I tried a takeoff with one of the crafts by applying the brake and giving it full throttle, I knew from previous testing with this craft that it would be almost possible and then to my surprise it worked!!!! This is some of the craziest stuff I have seen and done on KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Small Crafts look like a cross between a Mig and an F14 Tom Cat so I named them \u0022Tommy Migs\u0022 these handle very well\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T04:03:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 04:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by castille7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
