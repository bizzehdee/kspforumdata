The exclusion zone is primarily off the coast, and there are numerous safety measures to minimize danger to people on land during any launch. All launches are confirmed to have a kill switch (for lack of the correct term), operated by the Range Safety Officer (a US Air Force Officer), where the rocket is destroyed if something goes terribly wrong. The orbiters were never equipped with such devices, but the SRBs and the external tank are. During the Challenger disaster, after the SRBs had begun their out of control flight, the RSO chose destroy them both rather than allow them to pose a threat to land. Another interesting factoid, the RSO is not considered a flight controller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027ve gone rather off subject....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was lucky to live in Melbourne, Fl during those last few flights and got to see them all, albeit from a much further distance than I would have liked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
