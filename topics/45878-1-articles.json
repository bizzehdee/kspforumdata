I\u0027ll get close to the target, then as I approach I line up retrograde (navball is in \u0022Target\u0022 mode, confirmed over and over) and burn to decrease relative velocity. Relative velocity drops to zero, and the target flies away at a speed that must be over 100 m/s. I bring the nose around, point directly at the target and burn like crazy to catch up, then again turn to retrograde and burn to slow . . . and the target flies away again. Back and forth, back and forth, I get relative velocity to 0 and the target is definitely not stopped in place relative to my ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried \u0022control from here\u0022 from various points on the ship and tried unsetting the target and setting it again.
