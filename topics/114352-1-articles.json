Unfortunately I often forget to activate the \u0027Place\u0027-gizmo again and instead of duplicating that part the translation arrows or the rotation circles appear.\n\n-\u003E I suggest that [Alt]\u002Bleft mouse click always duplicates the targeted part(s) and auto-activates the \u0027Place\u0027-gizmos no matter which gizmo is active.\n\nAlso when setting action groups the translation arrows or rotation circles appear on the selected part(s) when the correspondent gizmo was active before. It sometimes happen to me that I accidentally offset or rotate parts in that situation.\n\n-\u003E I suggest that gizmos are deactivated while the action group tab is open.\n\nRegards\n\n\\*Aqua\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T12:54:11Z","Content":"yes I agree with both suggestions (the first one in particular). It would make for a more fluid interface."}]}
