There IS a button to fly immediately, it\u0027s called \u0027simulate\u0027. Either you have an idea that isn\u0027t being expressed well or you are taking the advice of idiots. Design is tricky business, people don\u0027t really give it enough credit because sometimes a lot of what works is on accident, not through a protracted development and integration cycle like Apple uses. If your goal is to encourage people to use your system, designing a second one isn\u0027t going to help.

Time moves forwards, but really only explains the movement of planets around the solar system. Despite contracts, it\u0027s heavily underutilized because it rarely affects most players beyond using time warp. KCT attempts to turn time into a resource the player can manipulate. You know you need it for building and research and is therefore implied to be semi-finite by contracts can expire both in availability and completion, and the movement of vessels and bodies while it happens. However, sometimes you get decades to complete some of these contracts. In the grand scheme of time, does forty days REALLY have a significant impact? When you have ten years to make a four day journey, nothing shy of a year of building and research is going to put a dent in that. So, who cares if you have to simulate something in an excel spreadsheet or on the pad? At the end of the day, mechanically speaking, the only thing you are doing is making the player wait a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the player experiences, however, is more abstract. As a governing factor, time becomes something the player plans their actions around. They can manipulate and interact with it. Normally the only time a large amount passes is simulating a long mission in the vacuum. With the requirement of time to fuel building and research means that any time the player warps, they essentially \u0027lose\u0027. If it\u0027s not being applied on projects it wasn\u0027t being utilized fully. This allows the player to feel intelligent and involved when they click space center to queue up new research and designs while missions take place overhead. Allowing used parts to speed up craft allows them to be \u0027thrifty\u0027. Journeys that span a year aren\u0027t hampered by one day missions on the ground since they can spend months building and researching. The player can meaningfully multitask. So while the time you spend isn\u0027t necessarily more valuable in the sense of \u0027cost\u0027, it is still infinite, it provides more meaningful \u003Cem\u003Einteraction\u003C/em\u003E with time itself. The movement of the planets and the rotation of the bodies is now a challenge met by proper planning; you create ideal conditions, not wait for them. Time is still infinite though, the player can ignore all of this and still proceed but it provides a framework in which they can interact with time in more meaningful ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything, the system can be expanded and polished. For instance, interfaces that match the default Kerbal interfaces would be less jarring for the player to interact with. Better integrating your UI to match stock makes it a natural extension of the game. If there is one place you could stand to make bigger improvements, it\u0027s with the upgrade system. It works, and it\u0027s somewhat enjoyable, but it\u0027s just something you dump points into. Even if you were to get the same effects, more specialized options allows the player to feel like they are tailoring the system to their play style rather than just upgrading things because they need to. After all, you can do everything without putting a single point into the upgrade system, it just happens a little faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, instead of flat VAB/SPH improvements, why not allow the player to invest in various types of construction? For players who enjoy trying to recover all of their vessels, being able to refurbish the parts the save faster allows them to feel even more thrifty as they are explicitly rewarded for the behavior on their own terms. Those who don\u0027t might speed up constructing new parts so they don\u0027t feel penalized for not saving every part falling off their ships. Perhaps you can put limitations on the max BP that each hangar can handle? Or perhaps a gradient where bonuses to construction speed in the hangar is based on a base number of points it applies to and continues in a progressive curve beyond that? Small constructions could be very quick to produce without expanding your facilities, but players who enjoy very large builds could progress towards having the space to do so more easily. The point is not static limitations, but expressing the system in a way to allow the player to decide how to tackle the system. Heck, maybe after so many points you can pick a part specialization and you get a bonus on time building those parts, or bonuses like a refund on refurbished pieces so it\u0027s even more thrifty to save parts. Maybe discounts on parts from certain manufacturers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a long enough post so I\u0027ll leave it at that. You have to keep in mind that the best mods act as an extension of the base game and fill a hole in the experience.

I\u0027m not just patting you on the back when I say that KCT does a really good job of integrating with the base game, but instead of looking at ways to strip away things that work, I think you should be looking at ways to make it feel more like it\u0027s always been part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-23T20:03:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2014 08:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T20:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not just patting you on the back when I say that KCT does a really good job of integrating with the base game, but instead of looking at ways to strip away things that work, I think you should be looking at ways to make it feel more like it\u0027s always been part of the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHyomoto, thank you for that well constructed post (something I generally am not good at doing)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still feel that KCT-Lite has some merit. It gives you an introduction to the gameplay aspects that time as a valued resource brings about without everything else. Some people who want a semi-casual experience may find it appealing as it wouldn\u0027t require significant config reworking while you try to figure out how the mod works. I know that I don\u0027t always want to try out a mod and immediately have to start doing configurations of a bunch of things I don\u0027t understand (something KCT could certainly do better).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone suggested presets for the configs, and I think that might help a lot for newcomers. There\u0027d be presets for feature settings (easy disables reconditioning and tech unlocks, etc) and for time setttings (shorter, normal, \u0022realistic\u0022, \u0022reuse-centric\u0022). One or two custom presets would probably be good too. Click two buttons and you\u0027re on your way, no fuss with configs. Probably also something for quickly spending the first upgrade points (All VAB (1 or 2 lines), All SPH (1 or 2 lines), split evenly)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that the GUIs need improvement. One of my weakest abilities is making anything visual look good. I\u0027ve tried to improve their quality over time, but I\u0027m thinking it might be time to do a total overhaul of the system now that I have a better idea of what I\u0027m doing. I think something more minimal would be good, like Mission Controller\u0027s funds windows in the editor (pre 0.24) which are unobtrusive yet informative. Perhaps have the build list be like the drop down menus for resources/contracts in the stock toolbar (with a separate window probably for detailed interaction with it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding visual things and mostly unrelated to the rest of this post: Would anyone like to make a banner and/or flag for KCT? I need something nice to put up on the forum page and KerbalStuff and you don\u0027t want to see what I would come up with. It could be made from screenshots (preferably just stock\u002BKCT) or drawings or both (or anything else really).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpgrades could definitely use improvements and I don\u0027t know the best way of going about that, so thank you for your suggestions. I\u0027ll think about how to implement something along those lines. I like giving the player choices and having those choices mean something, and while the current system does that to a degree it\u0027s also kind of, well, bland. If I had unlimited time and resources I\u0027d love to integrate with Kerbal Konstructs to have physical building upgrades, but it looks like Squad is going that way themselves. I may wait for that to be released and then tie KCT upgrades to KSP upgrades, so better VABs can build faster/more ships. Either way, the upgrade system \u0022works\u0022 as is, so I likely won\u0027t make any massive changes to it for some time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have time off (I think) in mid-late November that I could use to make some larger changes to various systems.

I like how launch goes to build or simulate, and I haven\u0027t found any buttons \u0022You can\u0027t push or it will break.\u0022 like Mission Controller had. As for doing better, the stock toolbar is a big one but using GUI elements that match is also important and really what I\u0027m driving at. The basic unity \u0027smoke\u0027 skin (or whatever it\u0027s called) basically screams \u0027MOD\u0027! Building static drop-downs into the basic toolbar would make a lot of sense, integration wise. (Honestly, that\u0027s just theory as I\u0027d have to test it out to really get a feel for it, but I can\u0027t see the current space center window being a problem if it appeared under the toolbar instead). The floating window screams mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for simplicity, I watched your video before I installed KCT and despite being a bit dull, it does a great job of covering the basic aspects of the mod. I didn\u0027t feel overwhelmed at all. In-game tutorials are harder to do because like solitaire, it\u0027s easier to just SHOW someone what they need to do. But, making things easy and intuitive will help with the bull-headed or casual players who don\u0027t care for \u0027the instructions\u0027. Even so, some abstract concepts are and you just have to find a way to present them with more simplicity. I can give you a really good example: right now there is VAB building and VAB storage. Why? Is it not possible to show all VAB vessels under the VAB tab? If it needs to be built it could show a countdown, and if you can fly it, a \u0027launch\u0027 button instead. It\u0027s simple, avoids confusion and makes the system less obtuse. Even a simple \u0022No ships in storage or building, use the VAB to get started\u0022 message when a tab is empty encourages the player without explicitly instructing them should they be exploring the interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like that you want to keep things straightforwards for the player, but there are ways to simplify without damaging the integrity of what you want to do. For instance, some people like myself choose to start a new game with mods like this. If you want to make it less confusing for newcomers, consider giving the player less points to spend right off the bat. Hell, what about none? With fifteen you have to start asking \u0022Where do I put these?\u0022 You are immobile before you even began because \u003Cem\u003Eyou don\u0027t know what you want to spend them on\u003C/em\u003E. So, why not bring it up later? Like once the player has earned a point? That\u0027s another shortcoming is the system doesn\u0027t do a good job of explaining how to get more points. You can pay for them but perhaps a \u0022progress until next point\u0022 bar as well? A \u0027show me\u0027, don\u0027t \u0027tell me\u0027 rule is best for combating confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d like, I\u0027m willing to comb the interface and share some notes with you. I might even be motivated enough to throw together some mock-ups, but rest assured \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe basic idea of KCT is fine\u003C/strong\u003E. If complexity turns some people off, often you only need to find other ways to present the same information, not remove parts. Simplification doesn\u0027t mean dumbing down. KCT is a pretty succinct idea; it\u0027s ideas could be presented a little better, you might tweak the formula to favor newbies a bit more, but letting the player simply turn off parts they dislike is a slippery slope. Either a feature is necessary for the mod to accomplish it\u0027s intended role or it isn\u0027t. KCT can be improved, yes, but I strongly insist it doesn\u0027t have a lot of dead weight. Presently of course. Mods sit at #1 in the \u0027feature bloat\u0027 and \u0027needless complexity\u0027 categories of bad design choices. I respect the fact you want to make it more accessible but I have to insist that KCT isn\u0027t FAR and a lite version serves only to fracture your user base and increase your workload.

Should the added rollback time be reduced from the original rollout time (simulating that you can have both travelling at the same time)?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you implement option 1 above, IMO, you should have to spend time to rollback a vessel (perhaps just count the percentage back to zero at the same rate it was counting up) and then rollout the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you implement option 2 above, you should be able to roll out the second second one while the first is defueling or being rolled back (pretend you have multiple movers), but again, only 1 vessel would be able to use the \u0027recondition and fuel\u0027 queue at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets take 2 vessels as an example. Vessel 1 takes 10 minutes to roll out and 10 minutes to fuel. Vessel 2 takes 3 minutes to roll out and 8 to fuel. You choose to launch vessel one and send it through the system, but when you go to launch you realize that you need vessel 2 in orbit first (maybe it\u0027s a com satellite that\u0027s needed for the first). At that point you choose to swap the vessels. Vessel 1 begins to unfuel, taking 10 minutes to do so. Vessel 2 begins to be towed out, taking 3 minutes to reach the pad. At that point there\u0027s still 7 minutes left of unfueling for Vessel 1 so it simply sits there and waits. Vessel 1 finally finishes unfueling and starts being towed back to storage while Vessel 2 is loaded onto the launchpad and begins fueling. 8 minutes later Vessel 2 is fully fueled. Here, you could either launch, or be forced to wait an additional 2 minutes for Vessel 1 to finish its rollback (under the guise of safety, and not having 2 things at once). Because Vessel 1 was occupying the pad the full rollout (from storage to fueled) for Vessel takes a total of 3 \u002B 7 \u002B 8 (\u002B2) = 18(\u002B2) minutes instead of the base 11 so it gives you some \u0027punishment\u0027 for not planning, but it\u0027s not adding a full additional 20 minutes that it would take to store Vessel 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Schmonzo","CreatedById":5728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T20:51:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you soo much for making this mod, without it the game is only half as fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T23:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight this mod be compatible with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292-0-25-0-Flight-Manager-for-Reusable-Stages-%28FMRS-v0-2-03%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlight Manager for Reusable Stages?\u003C/a\u003E Has anybody tried it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking specifically of a launch stage that needs to be piloted through reentry and landing, so just adding a parachute and getting funds back isn\u0027t as good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T00:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been meaning to try it, but haven\u0027t gotten around to it.
