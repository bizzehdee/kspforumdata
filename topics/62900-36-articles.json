Feel free to add it into the ModuleTemplates.cfg file and post back what ends up working \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E You don\u0027t really have to if you don\u0027t want to, but it\u0027s not too hard to add any module you want reset to that file. Just open up a craft file in a text editor that has the \u0022pristine\u0022 state and copy the parts that need reset (for the stock parachute you just have to change DEPLOYED to STOWED, for instance). I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s too much to ask for a normal user to do, but it\u0027s actually pretty straightforward, so let me know if you do it and if you have any trouble with it. I\u0027ll probably write up a guide (with examples) before release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if I can fix the issue with ships being oriented wrong. The instant you pick them up they correct themselves, but they must be edited to do so, but that makes me think they\u0027re actually oriented correctly but the coordinate system needs updated. I might be able to apply a 90 degree rotation to ships going to the SPH, but then if you pick up the ship during editing it will rotate incorrectly I think (and then will point downward). It\u0027s a minor enough annoyance that I might release with it like that. The VAB orientation works properly, btw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t get a chance to add the build rate formulas to the config last night (a bit too much work at the time, I made some breaking changes to the math parser that took priority) so I\u0027ll probably get that done tonight.

There are absolutely no upgrade points in use, ever. All the rates are determined by stock building upgrade mechanics. Tech nodes take between 2 Kerbin days for the cheapest node, to 80 Kerbin days for the most expensive ones (but upgrading the R\u0026amp;D center early is a good idea). BP values are kept the same, but build rates progress with editor upgrades and R\u0026amp;D center upgrades (editor upgrades unlock more build rates, R\u0026amp;D center upgrades unlock faster rates). Here\u0027s the breakdown for that: 1 rate per editor level (so level 0 is 1 rate, max level is 3 rates). R\u0026amp;D lvl 0 possible rates are (1,0,0), lvl 1: (1.5, 0.5, 0), and lvl 2: (2, 1, 0.5). You also gain science for ship building as you level the R\u0026amp;D center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tested any of this yet, so it likely has some issues, but I got the actual code side working properly now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EKCT_FormulaSettings\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tNodeFormula = 9 * (1\u002B[R]) / 86400\u003Cbr\u003E\tUpgradeFundsFormula = -1\u003Cbr\u003E\tUpgradeScienceFormula = -1\u003Cbr\u003E\tResearchFormula = [R]^2/86400\u003Cbr\u003E\tEffectivePartFormula = min([C]/([I] \u002B ([B]*([U]\u002B1))), [C])\u003Cbr\u003E\tProceduralPartFormula = (([C]-[A]) \u002B ([A]*10/max([I],1))) / max([B]*([U]\u002B1),1)\u003Cbr\u003E\tBPFormula = ([E]^(1/2))*2000*[O]\u003Cbr\u003E\tKSCUpgradeFormula = ([C]^(1/2))*2000*[O]\u003Cbr\u003E\tReconditioningFormula = min([M]*[O]*[E], [X])\u003Cbr\u003E\tBuildRateFormula = max(0.5*([R]-[I]\u002B1), 0)*sign([L]-[I])\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: I added RealChute to the default module templates.
