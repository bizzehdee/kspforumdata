The readout from the turn coordinator is wrong. It seems to be set up as a poor mans navball, with the aircraft being assigned to roll angle, and the ball being assigned to the heading and velocity-vector heading. In reality the ball Should act like a bubble level, and the aircraft should indicate the yaw rate, such that when it aligns with the marks it does a standard rate turn, I.E. 2 min. for 180 degrees. Some also have roll rate added to this readout for quicker response.

Assigning roll to the ball is not at all right. It works like a bubble level, that is when you bank say, 60 degrees, and pitch up and use the rudders to keep in a coordinated turn (usually slight rudder in the direction of the turn), that is the forces work out such that you are only pushed down into your seat (which is the proper way to fly), then the ball will be centered. But if you fly wings level, but input full rudder, then the ball would be pinned to one side. For a simplified model it could use the angle between the local Z axis, and the resultant force vector in the X/Z plane. In an ideal world that is what the ball would display. Though it is of course a mechanical device, so it does not behave perfectly. In a Zero-G environment the ball should give completely nonsensical readings, basically just floating around. If you have to add something to make this work, I would be happy to help you work out the math.\n\nThe turn rate that the instrument measures is the local yaw rate. Again because of the way the instrument works, but since you know approximately what the bank angle is going to be you can calibrate it to give a sufficiently accurate readout. If you were in orbit, with a constant heading, and a bank angle of 90 degrees, and started yawing, the turn indicator would read non zero, even though you are not changing the heading. Just configuring it for the vessels yaw rate would be quite adequate."},{"CreatedByName":"theonegalen","CreatedById":71012,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-29T19:20:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 25 minutes ago, neistridlar said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sounds like it might be just a config issue then.
