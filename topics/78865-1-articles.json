For one, it is bundled with mods that do not tell you how to disable it prior to starting the game. So when you first start the game and get the message on how to turn it off, its too late cuz soon as you exit the game its going send a report. That to me at least is stealing. A simple button to opt out before anything is sent seems like a no brainer. But then everyone would opt out (which is prob why there is no such button). And the fact that unless you go through all mods and delete the dlls it will keep reinstalling itself.... kinda like the \u0022V\u0022 word. The way this \u0022mod\u0022 was implamented is very shady. Why bundle it at all? Just let people who want to participate get it directly. Me personally, I dont want some file that is doing nothing for me eating ANY system resources or bandwidth. Especially one that serves questionable use to anyone. I just hope that this is not a sign of what we can now expect to see come out of the awesome ksp modding community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T19:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Revolution-420\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Revolution-420\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo when you first start the game and get the message on how to turn it off, its too late cuz soon as you exit the game its going send a report.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt says right in the ModStatistics post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen are statistics sent?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plugin generates reports when the game closes and saves them to disk. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EThe next time the game starts\u003C/span\u003E, it attempts to send any outstanding reports to the server. ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T19:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re that worried about it vet your mods carefully and ensure that ModStatistics isn\u0027t hiding in a mod\u0027s folder somewhere \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E you load the game.

I say let\u0027s wait for SQUAD\u0027s say on the matter , and Majir\u0027s as well. In any case, I don\u0027t mean to be a back seat moderator but... \u003Cp\u003Echeers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it has been discussed. Please also reference the link above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sandworm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sandworm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETelling people not to talk about something like this doesn\u0027t help. Telling people that they cannot talk now, that they have to wait for some other person to wake up or talk first, says to them that their voice is less important than that other person\u0027s. This is particularly irksome when that other person lives a very different time zone and/or work scheduled. Regardless of whether these feelings are reasonable or not, my point is that locking each and every thread or banning discussion of the issue outright will not make the problem, the anger, go away.\u003Cp\u003ELock people out here and they may resort to more aggressive and disruptive means: Twitter, reddit or emails to the developers directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone tired of listening to this debate remains free not to read the associated threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody is being ignored. We do not think your voices are less important. This issue has been brought up and is being discussed. Please be patient. As you pointed out, people live in different timezones and this started on a Sunday. It\u0027s going to take more than an afternoon to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, I will be closing this since it has already been thoroughly discussed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your patience,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
