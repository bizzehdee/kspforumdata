Fly into those pesky cargo bays and get the view you want.\n\n![ViciousWellinformedCoati.gif](http://giant.gfycat.com/ViciousWellinformedCoati.gif)\n\n([http://gfycat.com/ViciousWellinformedCoati](http://gfycat.com/ViciousWellinformedCoati))\n\n**Download:** [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7121093/ksp-mods/KSP%5B1.0.2%5DWasdEditorCamera%5BMay20%5D.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7121093/ksp-mods/KSP%5B1.0.2%5DWasdEditorCamera%5BMay20%5D.zip)\n\nTested in 1.0.2\n\n**Usage: Move around with WASD keys, hold right mouse to look around.** Q/E for up/down. Space/Shift to move faster/slower. When you have a part selected it will follow you around if right mouse is held. Otherwise it will rotate the part as usual. Press 5 to switch between stock camera and wasd controls.\n\nKeys, movement speed, etc can be configured in config file. Config is reapplied when editor is entered. Use MM to reload config database.\n\n**Known issues:**\n\n- The workaround for issue [3838](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/3838) is a bit hacky and might break things. Compatibility mode for EditorExtensions is enabled by default, though.\n\n- The stock VAB camera doesn\u0027t have a horizontal offset. So when switching back to stock camera the pivot point snaps back to center. I tried to keep the camera in it\u0027s current position and only rotate the view.\n\n- When moving parts around the camera is clamped to editor bounds but the part isn\u0027t. If you clip the part through the wall you can\u0027t select it anymore. But undo will move it back.\n\n- Unity\u0027s Screen.lockCursor resets the cursor to screen center. Used native functions on Windows as workaround. Other OSs are currently stuck with snapping cursors.\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n- 2015 May 20 Initial release\n\nSource and MIT License included in download."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:35:45Z","Content":"Holy Jebediah... where did this come from? *Don\u0027t answer that, it\u0027s not a real question.*\n\nI just love it when things like this come straight out of the ozone and smack you where you didn\u0027t know you could be smacked.
