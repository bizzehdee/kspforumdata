I even tried to replicate it to give it a spin, and I think I\u0027ve got the essence right (70t, 360 thrust, dV of 2100), and it behaves pretty well flying around KSC if you keep the speed above 75 m/s. I just cannot get the Orange Knight working, I\u0027ll lose control and crash on the runway around 50 m/s, well before I reach takeoff speed, no matter what I try. In the end I just strapped a couple of big rockets to the wings and launched straight up, throttling to hug the sonic wall on my way up. Did you have to do anything special to overcome control issues on the runway?\n\nWow, that\u0027s quite a compliment, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve ever been \u0027replica\u0027d ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOrange Knight is darn tough to fly. Runway control problems are often due to landing gear placement, so be sure yours is in dead straight. I\u0027d debug by trying to lift off without the Hummlebee attached.

For instance, right now I have a plane on Duna called the DORK. On Duna, it flies amazingly well, even being able to get suborbital with just a prop engine. On Kerbin, however, it\u0027s a total pig, totally underpowered and squirrelly, barely able to reach 100m/s. Because of this, I highly recommend that you create a separate sandbox game as your designing and testing location. And get HyperEdit so you can teleport your designs to Duna to see how they work there.\n\nIn general, the differences how a plane performs on Kerbin and Duna are as follows;\n\n\\* Lift: Because Duna\u0027s air is much thinner than Kerbin\u0027s, you need lots more lift on Duna. Somewhere in the region of 1.4 lift per ton of ship works very well as it gives a stall speed below 50m/s even at relatively high terrain elevations. This is EXTREMELY important for getting the plane stopped on landing before some lump in the terrain kills it. You can go with less wing and rely on rockets or chutes for landing, but then you also need lots of horsepower to take off again before encountering a fatal bump in the terrain.\n\n\\* Drag: Most of the drag of a plane comes from the lift of its wings, but this is very much a function of air density. The way things work at present, a plane with 1.4 lift/ton will have a very low top speed on Kerbin due to gobs of drag, but on Duna there\u0027s hardly any drag at all so the plane can reach hypersonicc speeds. Also, because there\u0027s hardly any drag on Duna, airbrakes aren\u0027t very effective at all. You need way more airbrakes than you do on Kerbin.\n\n\\* Thrust: Because there\u0027s so little drag on Duna, and because the gravity is so much lower, you need way less thrust on Duna to achieve insane performance. A ratio of just 3Kn/ton is sufficient on Duna to climb steeply while still accelerating, reach any altitude desired, and exceed orbital velocity in atmospheric flight. But on Kerbin, the plane will hardly fly at all with this little thrust.\n\n\\* Control Authority: This is largely a function of both control surface lift values and air density. Thus, for crisp, responsive controls, a Duna plane needs WAY more control surface area, with as much leverage as possible, than a Kerbin plane. But even so, the controls will lose a lot of their effect at speeds above about 200m/s, even at lower altitudes.\n\n\\* Wheel Brakes: When you combine high amounts of lift, low stall speeds, and low gravity, you lose most of your braking power. Brakes only work when the wheel is on the ground and these factors make the plane float long distances between bumps with the wheels just above the ground. Thus, retro thrust is very desirable to keep stopping distances short. But OTOH, because brakes have little effect at all, they\u0027re not likely to flip you over, either, unless you get really sideways due to a bounce.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nDamn, Kuzzter, that\u0027s a great adaptation of the song ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T13:41:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Damn, Kuzzter, that\u0027s a great adaptation of the song ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nI got lucky--\u0027hydrazine\u0027 rhymes with \u0027magazines\u0027 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Heh, mind you flying it from KCS to the abandoned island runway, it did expose some of the challenges you could be facing landing back at KCS if that\u0027s what you had in mind, let\u0027s just say I\u0027m looking forward to seeing the next few pages.\n\nNot sure if you included these on your version, but never forget [Hummlebee\u0027s secret weapon!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122280-Duna-Ore-Bust%21-a-KSP-Graphic-Novel-%28WE-RE-BACK%21-Interlude-3-page-2%29?p=1996551\u0026viewfull=1#post1996551)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T13:46:58Z","Content":"That was brilliant!\n\nExcellent song choice, too.
