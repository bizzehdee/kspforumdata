This did allow a major expansion of the number of planned landings (to nine), albeit with the knowledge that budget cuts would doubtless curtail the landing program. The \u0022Apollo Applications\u0022 space station science program that eventually became Skylab was an entirely separate project that was intended to take over from the lunar program in the 70s to pave the way for a Mars landing in the 80s, and was to buy its own Saturn boosters (mainly IBs, though there was a proposal for a lunar-orbital station that would have required a Saturn V for the station and V derivatives like the Saturn INT-20 for the crews) rather than share them with the lunar landing program during the period when the two interlaced. (The original plan was to have either a Saturn V or Saturn IB launch for either Apollo or Apollo Applications *every month*, alternating between the two. Meaning a Saturn V launch *at least* every other month. This is why Complex 39 was planned for five pads, and built with provision for completing a third pad...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turned out, Apollo Applications never got much of a budget due to concentration on the lunar program, and while plenty of planning and design work could be done for both \u0022wet workshop\u0022 and \u0022dry workshop\u0022 configurations of the converted S-IVB Orbital Workshops (the \u0022dry workshop\u0022 was the version actually flown; the \u0022wet workshop\u0022 would have been launched on a Saturn IB to Earth orbit, or a Saturn V to lunar orbit, and would have still had its engine and been launched with propellants on board--i.e., \u0022wet\u0022--and then cleaned out and all equipment and stores installed in space by the first few crews. The only legacy of this was the \u0022grating\u0022 bulkheads used to separate compartments in Skylab, which would have been installed in a wet workshop before launch), and for ways to \u0022shut down\u0022 an Apollo CSM during the stay at the station (and for McDonnell\u0027s \u0022Big G\u0022 proposal as a more affordable and capable crew/logistics vehicle for Apollo Applications than the actual Apollo, hauling more people and more stuff on the same booster for less weight), there wasn\u0027t actually any money to procure any EQUIPMENT for it. Thus, when the Congressional budget cuts started on the lunar program, it was actually a boon to Apollo Applications. Indeed, the very first lunar program cut, cancelling Apollo 20, was specifically to free up its Saturn V for the Apollo Applications/Skylab program, to be converted into a Dry Workshop and a Saturn INT-21 booster to launch it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, the lunar program was still expected to continue to Apollo 19 and use up all remaining Saturn Vs and all but three of the remaining Apollo CSMs (after four were earmarked for Skylab, three for regular missions and one in a \u0022rescue\u0022 configuration that could be used to retrieve a stranded crew--something that came up most heavily in NASA thinking after the movie \u003Cem\u003EMarooned\u003C/em\u003E was released), so it wasn\u0027t really expected to be particularly wasteful. Even with the conversion of a Saturn IB to the Skylab configuration (wet workshop... ironically, using the Apollo 20 Saturn V\u0027s S-IVB, while the dry workshop launched used the converted Saturn IB\u0027s S-IVB!), there would have been enough of them remaining to send three crews to this second Skylab station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the budget axe fell again. Apollo 18 and 19 were both cancelled. This meant we now had two fully flight-rated Saturn Vs that would never be used. What\u0027s more, despite having a fully functional backup Skylab, your choice of two Saturn Vs to launch it, and three fully functional Apollo CSMs and Saturn IBs to fly crews to it--meaning that the cost of flying a second Skylab would have been minimal, merely the personnel and consumables costs that were a tiny fraction of the cost of each flight--the Apollo Applications program was cut back to a single station, to transfer money to the STS program... and even that station only flew because it had reached the point in the contracts where cancelling it would have cost more than flying it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more Apollo-Saturn IB mission did get added to the program, when a politically-motivated joint mission with the Soviets (Apollo-Soyuz) was scheduled to fly in 1975, but that was it. NASA was left with two surplus Saturn Vs, four surplus Saturn IBs, one surplus Skylab, four surplus CSMs (including Skylab Rescue one), and either four or five (I can\u0027t remember which) surplus LMs. In the end, one Saturn V went to Houston, while the other went on display at the Cape. One Saturn IB went on display at the Cape, one at a rest area/welcome center in Alabama(!), and I can\u0027t recall what happened to the other two. The CSMs went on display with the Saturn Vs and IBs, and the surplus Skylab is on display at the National Air and Space Museum. (For the record, the \u0022third\u0022 Saturn V, the one on display in Huntsville, was never actually a flight-rated booster; it was the \u0022battleship\u0022 test article, built extra-heavy for use in repeated static test firings, and was expected to be surplus at the end of the program because it was too heavy to actually fly. There was also the Saturn 500F, a full-scale test article with dummy engines and spacecraft, used for facilities verification at the Cape; IIRC, parts of it were used in both the Huntsville and Cape display articles--I can\u0027t recall why they used parts at the Cape, but in Huntsville, they used its second stage because both the \u0022battleship\u0022 second stage and its replacement from the dynamic load test article blew up on the test stand. The remainder of the dynamic load test article was, as expected, stressed to the point of damage in the load testing, and was scrapped after the end of the program.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, there was a certain amount of Block I CSM hardware that was surplus; the CMs tended to go to museums, but not all of them wanted the SMs, and as a result, several Block I SMs were sold to a Huntsville junkyard in the 70s (without engines), lingering in the back of the yard until they were finally cut up in the early-to-mid 80s. (Additionally SM-017, a Block I model, was destroyed when a propellant tank exploded in a ground test in 1967, and the wreckage was scrapped. The remainder of the Block I CSMs were at least partially converted to Block II configuration and used for ground trainers and unmanned testing; an example would be the CM at the Detroit Science Center, a Block I vehicle with interior converted to a Block II mockup and the main hatch converted to Block II configuration, used as an emergency egress trainer. IIRC, when it was donated to the DSC, they did cut the tip of the nose off and installed a mockup docking probe, plus added the mylar thermal insulation, so that it would more closely resemble a Block II spacecraft, though the RCS thrusters remain in the Block I configuration...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T15:22:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rhoark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rhoark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a brochure that lays it out with more style than I could: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/defense-space/space/sls/docs/sls_mission_booklet_jan_2014.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/defense-space/space/sls/docs/sls_mission_booklet_jan_2014.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow if I can live to see even a 1/4 of the things in that brochure... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rdfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rdfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E several Block I SMs were sold to a Huntsville junkyard in the 70s (without engines), lingering in the back of the yard until they were finally cut up in the early-to-mid 80s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s so sad, really ran a shiver down my spine when I thought about it being cut up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the write up though.
