One thing that\u0027d be super helpful is to have an indication of a craft\u0027s centre of bouyancy at current orientation (ocean configurable) in the OAB, as well as a waterline for working out how a craft would lie in the water without having to constantly relaunch it to test different positionings.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis\u0027d also be handy for boats, and probably stuff along the lines of seadragon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know these are mostly niche things to build in the game but it\u0027d still be nice to have some more support for them, to go along with already having the dedicated boat launch station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
