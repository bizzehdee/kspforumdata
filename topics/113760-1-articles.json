Adverts are generally blocked, or done in-shop to maximize profits, email is scanned repeatedly and filtered out before it even reaches you, trusted distributors maintain their trust by verifying files are clean before allowing users to download them. The problem isn\u0027t making a virus, just take a look at all the security updates you routinely download each week, the problem is getting a wide enough distribution before it gets shut down.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126288-Strange-iPhone-behaviour](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126288-Strange-iPhone-behaviour)\n\nThis brings up something very dangerous though... here is a fact for all of you poorly informed computer security n00bs: Unless you\u0027ve attached a debugger to the process and monitored the actions performed, you have no idea what it does. No ifs, no \u0022but I read\u0022, this is computer security fact, you cannot say something is innocuous until you\u0027ve examined all possible cases and determined it to be so, especially if it performs an action that is not intended.\n\nNow, regardless of whether this instance is benign it brings up a more interesting point in that **social media is a perfect distribution vector for a virus.**\n\nI know moderation may have issues here, but just reading about how willingly people spread that code around without asking \u0022does it do anything else\u0022 is the point I wish to make... what if it did? What if it used higher permissions to make a backdoor and now millions of phones are now infected? How do you actually, truly, know? Did you look at the source code? Did you do anything except say \u0022haha, other people are doing it, so I\u0027ll do it too!\u0022?\n\nLet\u0027s talk about something else for a bit too, in that windows xp had a strange... intent... in image rendering that allowed images to execute binary code (also known as MICE or metafile image code execution.) This was long patched but it was a vulnerability exploited often on 4chan boards to distribute trojans. Imagine now, with sites like imgur, uploading a picture with something interesting (like this [http://i.imgur.com/dNhrL.png](http://i.imgur.com/dNhrL.png) ;p)... before even looking up what it does to pose a retort, how often do people bother to ask \u0027could this be doing something malicious and using this effect as a means to get people to distribute it\u0027?\n\nTaking advantage of how willingly people would distribute a virus that did something \u0022interesting\u0022 while hiding its true intent seems like something worth noting the next time you think of following the crowd."},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T23:06:18Z","Content":"Woah, this is freaky...and interesting."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T23:13:30Z","Content":"Interesting...\n\nBut it would need enough people to click on it or download it.

Just look at rumors and gossip in a town or bar.
