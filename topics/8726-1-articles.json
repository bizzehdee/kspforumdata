With only stock parts, it\\\u0027s tougher than it sounds. So far, I\\\u0027ve managed to visit only two of the seas in a trip. Never enough fuel.

It would still be possible to do this with the bigger engine - jet not that lightweight like me. thanks to the small ones the last stage itself is able to jump two times and get home save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenging part was landing the first crater. My weight was waaaaay to big for those tree legs, the terrain made me cry and - of curse - it was the dark side.. with 97% fuel the sightseeing began. the next landing was waaaaay easyer with ~3 tons less to land and sunshine. 55% fuel was left on this one. the third was even a pure plesure to land an still had 13% fuel left. as i calculated to leave this stage here i was happy it gave me another accleration before the last stage landed in the next crater. the missing ASAS wasn\\\u0027t hard on this one so the rest of the traver was easyer than expectet. I had still 50% fuel in the last stage - enough for another crater too.. or just to go home without calculating hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edamn that was fun :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-27T02:40:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent work there!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
