So my question is what are the devs plans regarding bug fixes? do they plan on releasing an update (perhaps .92) that is dedicated to eradicating some of the most disruptive bugs? or will they, with each update include some bug fixes from pervious versions of the game? Which would be easier/more time efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T13:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETbh I\u0027d also like to see an official roadmap - googling has not helped with finding one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T15:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey squash some in every update, though sometimes new ones creep in, too.
