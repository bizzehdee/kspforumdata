I know that, because Kerbin is to the scale of 1:11, your delay is accurate. However, I think it is a little unbalanced. I think that, instead of using real life speed of radio waves, you should also bring down that speed to 1:11. That way, the delay will be more realistic. Keep up the amazing work! This is the only mod I use (Which is saying something because I don\u0027t like using mods).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how it was in The_Duck\u0027s plugin. He had the speed of light set to 1:10. I chose to sacrifice that realism in favor of playability. I\u0027m looking into adding a config file for the plugin itself in the next update.

But for that to be meaningful in the game the range of the dish should be reduced significantly, such that the total range of two dishes pointed at one another is just enough for a link between Kerbin and Minmus. That would mean a link between such a dish and an omni would be enough to reach the Mun (i\u0027m not saying that\u0027s desirable)...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESound like you have some really good knowledge there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is now, in checking if a connection antenna A and B is possible, i check if either the range of A or B is less than the distance between them. Only if both their ranges lie within the distance between them do i allow a connection to be made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do the same for dish antennae, just with the addition of checking if they are pointed at each other (or each others planets if they are orbiting different bodies).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gather that this way of doing the check is simpler for players to understand and work with in-game. So actually the satellite dishes included do just reach Minmus. They have a range of 50000 km, and with minmus AFAIK having a semi-major axis of 47.000 km, a dish placed on kerbin is able to reach a dish in high orbit around minmus, but not much further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the dish-antenna pairing. If I implemented that as the mean of the two ranges, giving a range of 27.500 for the dish - antenna pairing and 25.125 km for the dish - RC-antenna pairing, the short-range RC antenna would end up being able to have a connection directly to kerbin. Which wouldn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve even played around with exponential functions with no luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might simply implement it so that pointing a dish at an omnidirectional antenna would double the range of the omnidirectional antenna though. That would be simple and easy for players to get an intuitive grasp of in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you stumble on a formula for appriximating the effective range between an omnidirectional- and directional antenna.

The \u0022point at planet\u0022 system is in place mainly to make it more simple to link relay networks that are far appart. When you point a dish at the Mun, you\u0027re essentially pointing it at everything with Mun as it\u0027s mainBody.
