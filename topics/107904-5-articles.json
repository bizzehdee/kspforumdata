Will these missions be one-and-done, a threshold, or completion? I\u0027m a completionist (obviously) but I gather most people here aren\u0027t, so one-and-done probably makes the most sense? If so, losses via transmit wouldn\u0027t be a big deal. Takes away some novelty for KSC I suppose.\n\nI was thinking about Kerbin where it doesn\u0027t make a significant effort difference for the player, and I would rather they get the max possible (to reduce the amount that the contracts can be gamed). If it allowed transmit, they could sit in a biome, and keep transmitting over and over again until the experiment no longer gets offered. If I force them to recover then it makes it more difficult to sit there with one vessel.\n\nHowever, forcing recovery is a whole different ballgame for someplace like Eve.... I\u0027ll have to give this one a little more thought."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:34:14Z","Content":"Do the contracts require that the experiments be worth something to complete?
