Everything was fine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the plot of \u0022Gravity\u0022 happened... an old failed spaceplane project came out of of the black (ironically one of the shuttles I tried to use for my station missions). I remember it was a unmanned test probe, made it to orbit, but ran out of power and I had forgotten the solar panels. So it ended up floating around dead in space with no way of controlling it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking on docking a new part to my station when I see the cursed spaceplane approaching... first saw it around 1.2km away... next thing i know... KABLAMMO! Stations in pieces... Luckily nobody died, the second thing up to that station was the escape pods (which also luckily survived impact) so the 4 man crew was safely jettisoned down to kerbin. The shuttle on the other hand took a massive hit, lost 2 engines, one of its wings, and was pretty much uncontrollable, so those guys spent a few days in orbit until I could get up to them...
