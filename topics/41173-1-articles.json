I haven\u0027t paid anything for it at all and it doesn\u0027t feel too heavily pay-to-win. It just takes a little more time and effort to unlock everything naturally. The premium planes aren\u0027t too overpowered. My Airacobra makes short work of free and premium players alike. As with all games, check its wiki and search YouTube for it to get a feel for how it works. I play keyboard and mouse fairly well, but joysticks are a viable option and probably recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swiftgates24","CreatedById":22280,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E- Yes, but you start with enough money to buy your first plane. If you play enough, you can get early planes fairly fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I played for two weeks, then got sort of bored with it. Recently I\u0027ve gotten back into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Nope. Not at all. There are a few special planes that require something like $5 USD, but the aren\u0027t\u0027 really worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It\u0027s really fun, and easy to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the fact it\u0027s FTP, since I probably have it right now otherwise. Like I said, the pay-planes aren\u0027t really worth it (They only give a few XP bonuses).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:14:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne tip, turn off auto repair. There are two check boxes in the lower left you want the one for repair unchecked. All planes are repaired 10 times for free instantly and after that you can still repair them for free it just takes some time. At low levels you can play arcade with all five countries and by the time you are done the first set of planes will be repaired.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T20:24:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, all. Played about 5 games and checked this post, and I can definitely say that the game is fun! I love being able to upgrade my planes, and can\u0027t wait to get into bombers! I will turn off auto repair, thanks for the tip. I will most likely spend about $20 to start, as the game is free, and spending $20 is not really that bad, and will give me some extra planes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more question though: Do I really only have 3 deaths before I have to leave the game?
