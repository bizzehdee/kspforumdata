First of all, if you have Kerbol be part of a binary star system, you can have the other star be relatively close, say 10 or 20 Jool orbits away from Kerbol. Certainly not close, but not far enough to require a warp drive. Second, you can have STL interstellar drives that don\u0027t make interplanetary travel too easy. For example: consider we have an Orion drive that adds 10km/s delta-v per pulse. If we instead have it randomly add between 8 and 12 km/s to our velocity, then if we use it to get to a planet, we\u0027d still have around 1 km/s to kill with conventional engines. However, when going to another star, this would be a small price to pay. Combined with the fact that an Orion drive would probably be heavy, unwieldy, and expensive, this is enough to make an interstellar STL drive not be OP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dooz","CreatedById":74263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T22:12:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Any interstellar travel would require unrealistic means of transport such as teleportation or FTL drive.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot entirely true, you can slingshot off Jool to get on a interstellar trajectory and if done correctly Encounter The Star Using \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines we have now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will need Higher time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T23:38:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah... higher time warp and a cryo-sleep chamber for the Kerbals... or a multi-generation setup. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T23:58:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chaos_forge\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chaos_forge\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis.

Our sun\u0027s stellar neighborhood is not particularly dense. Life-bearing worlds could easily lie in a cluster a hundred times as dense or more. So if we take the 1/10th sizing of the Kerbal universe and make the Kerbal stellar neighborhood a further 100x denser, we could have the nearest star system be 1000x closer to \u0022Kerbol\u0022 than Alpha Centauri is to Sol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlpha Centauri A is 4.367 light years, or ~276,200 AU. So the nearest star in KSP could be ~275 AU away, or 3025x the distance from Kerbin to its sun. (1 Kerbin AU is 0.090909 Earth AU)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around 3000 \u0022Kerbin AUs\u0022 you could get there with conventional engines in KSP and well within Kerbal lifetimes. If you slingshot yourself into an escape trajectory going fast enough to average 20,000m/s for the trip (not too hard to do with LV-Ns), you could travel the 40 billion or so km in 2 billion seconds, or 65 Earth years. At 100,000x time warp, it\u0027ll take you about 5 hours, 45 minutes. It\u0027s quite doable, but still leaves a LOT of room for higher dV values from more advanced technology or larger multi-stage rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a rather elaborate (and initially tremendous) rocket built using highly advanced antimatter-powered fusion engines with an iSP of over 100,000 and built in 5 or 6 stages, with a payload fraction under 0.01% could accelerate to 1,000,000m/s and then decelerate upon reaching the star. Then the trip would take only about 1 year and 98 days. That\u0027s a little over 5 minutes on 100,000x time warp. With a ship like that, you might decide to go to a more distant star, or youmight just not go as fast as you\u0027re able to but instead save dV for a return trip. And this can be done with technology that has been demonstrated to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=======================================================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of the idea of making the \u0022Kerbol\u0022 system a binary (or trinary)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets use a 1/10th scale version of the Alpha Centauri trinary system as an example. Alpha Centauri A is the \u0022center\u0022, as it is the most massive of the three stars-though Alpha Centauri B is nearly the same mass and they orbit a common barycenter. Their orbits are eccentric and they vary between about 10 and 40 AU apart. Alpha Centauri C (Proxima Centauri) is about 13,000 AU from the barycenter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we wanted to give \u0022Kerbol\u0022 a companion star close, but not so close as to light up the night, it could be ~130 Kerbin AU from the sun. It could appear as the brightest star in the night sky, and be variable and flash at times-as most small stars are variables. This would give a nice stepping stone for intrepid interstellar travelers to get an early grasp of the kind of distances they are dealing with, and to become more acquainted with the idea that packing extra dV is important because you can\u0027t just raise the time warp speed high enough to do it faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-30T00:11:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2014 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
