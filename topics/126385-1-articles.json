The first one to come up is to Moho, and so I sent a probe. It doesn\u0026#39;t have much, just a thermometer and an antenna, but the window was there so I wanted to send *something*. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI notice now that I am getting contracts that see much more \u0022advanced\u0022 then I would expect. I have not yet landed on the Mun, but I am already getting contracts for \u0022Build a base on Duna\u0022, where I expect to be getting more missions in the Kerbing SoI. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo questions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Is this because of that probe? \u003Cbr\u003E\n2. If I terminate the probe will I get more appropriate contracts?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T22:37:00Z","Content":"\n1. yes\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. No\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T22:37:37Z","Content":"\nThis is because your probe went into interplanetary space. Because you hit that \u0022milestone\u0022 the game thinks you are skilled enough to accomplish those contracts. I don\u0026#39;t believe terminating the probe will do anything to rectify the situation. The best you can do is to ignore those contracts and pick ones you can actually accomplish.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T22:38:33Z","Content":"\nTo quickly answer the questions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Yes, this is because of the probe.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. No, this change is permanent(-ish, may be possible to change the save file to fix it)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe game saw you went out of Kerbin\u0026#39;s SoI, and is now assuming that you\u0026#39;re past The Mun and Minmus, and want more challenging contracts. This may or may not be true, but that\u0026#39;s what the game assumed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI imagine if you terminate the probe there\u0026#39;s something in the save file you might be able to change to \u0022fix\u0022 it, but I don\u0026#39;t know what that would be off the top of my head.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T22:51:00Z","Content":"\nI wouldn\u0026#39;t worry too much about it. You will still get contracts for the Mun and Minmus. Just ignore/decline them for now. They should come back later. Eventually you will get to a point where you start a new game and finish the entire tech tree LONG before that first Moho window shows up.\n"}]}
