I had refueled at my lunar orbit station so had plenty of fuel to slow myself down before hitting the atmosphere and for awhile during reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s where it all began to hit the fan. I noticed I was still going at a high rate of speed (about 1400m/s) at a worryingly low altitude when I decoupled my final stage in preparation to pop the chute. By now I\u0027m usually going slow enough to call it a job well done, but my speed had actually \u003Cem\u003Eincreased\u003C/em\u003E to almost 1500m/s at under 10km altitude. Needless to say, poor Val and a lot of valuable science made a hefty smear on a hillside, leaving me depressed as well as completely baffled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the latest version of FAR and have never once had a problem on reentry like this. Not only that, but I highly doubt an unadorned capsule\u0027s terminal velocity is above \u0022brilliant fireball\u0022 speed all the way to the ground.

I always quicksave well before a landing while still in orbit or in a position where i can change things. I know there are some people that thinks its a challenge to play without saving but i just find it foolish since in KSP its only a matter of time a game breaking bug hits you. Hope you have a save but im guessing you wouldn\u0027t be here if you did. My condolences for Val she was a good pilot and a proud kerbal. The kerbal kind will forever be in her debt.
