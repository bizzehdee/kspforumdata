The cargo bays are better, because you can open them in flight for access. \u003Cp\u003EThis is sort of what I do now. I use the Mk2\u0026gt;1.25m adapter, then put the 1.25m nosecone from B9 on it. But it\u0027s awkward. The black/white color division doesn\u0027t match, and the curves don\u0027t match up well either.
