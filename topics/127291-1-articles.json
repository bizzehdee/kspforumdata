Seriously, I\u0027ve been here since the end fo 2013, and I have seen maybe three random spambot threads on the KSP forums, \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three of them, I will point out, were in the last two days!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a very worrying development from my point of view, because it looks like the start of something I\u0027ve seen in pretty much every IPS-based forum I\u0027ve ever frequented. The technology as it comes out of the box is \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E vulnerable to automated account creation. And if the operators of the automated spam robots notice that they regularly get through the registration progress, they will shift more and more focus on the forum in question, and custom-tailor their scripts specifically to further improve their chances of success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCase in point: the forums of \u0022Feed the Beast\u0022, a popular Minecraft modding community, were at one point so inundated with spambots that over 60% of all threads visible on the first page of the general discussion forum at any given time of day, around the clock, were spam - as were \u003Cem\u003Eover 95% of all newly created threads.\u003C/em\u003E There was so much spam that the moderators simply stopped deleting the threads in order to have time to deal with actual issues of actual human users. And this happened not to an old, abandoned forum, but to a fresh and active community of over 150,000 users at the height of its popularity! It took the admins \u003Cem\u003Emore than half a year\u003C/em\u003E of trying various solutions to finally succeed in shutting this down completely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is one example of multiple identical cases I have witnessed happening to IPS-based forums. I don\u0027t want to see the same thing happen again here, but it\u0027s already starting as we speak. Therefore I urgently ask the forum team to pretty please with a cherry on top make effective spambot protection your number one priority. If the existing vulnerability is not fixed, it will be exploited on a massive scale, guaranteed. Better get a head start on things before we\u0027re at the point where you have to make use of the search function to find KSP-related content among the deluge of spam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T11:01:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is truely the case wouldnt this\u00A0have been one of the reasons\u00A0to not get this software if its susceptible to spam bots\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T11:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, you can make IPS4 perfectly immune to spambots.
