And for that you need a spaceport, with all the personnel working in it, and factories with the required know-how, and all that is, again, terribly expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, launching stuff in space is easy in the sense that if we want to do it, we can do it. but it has huge practical limitations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfinally, you may have noticed that the game has much smaller planets than real life. kerbin has 600 km radius, earth has 6370. kerbin orbit requires some 3400 m/s, earth orbit requires 11 km/s. On the other hand, engines and fuel tanks are less efficient, to partially compensate, and the net result is that rockets work similarly, but it takes a lot less time to orbit - else a launch would require half an hour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhowever, this allows a lot of exploits that simply would not work in real life. from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets with 20% payload mass - which would simply not be possible if you need 11 km/s to orbit - to spaceplanes - which take advantage of using jet engines to accelerate at orbital speed, because 2 km/s is orbital speed, while on earth you can still use a jet engine to reach 2 km/s, but that\u0027s nowhere near enough for orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, a lot of the more optimized ways of ksp are not possible in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Davi SDF","CreatedById":197335,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-14T19:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike it has been already said, KSP makes a lot of things much easier to acomplish than in real life.

I once made a stock parts replica of the Black Arrow orbital launch rocket, which in real life could put a ~150kg satellite into a relatively low Earth orbit; the KSP version had nearly identical delta-V in all its stages, but managed to send a ~500kg probe to the surface of the Mun and back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides the difference in scale, there are a lot of things about space travel that KSP doesn\u0027t include for the sake of making the game fun for more than the hardcore simulator-ists: ullaging, residual propellants, performance variation and engine failures, life support, speed of light delay for communications, crew health and radiation exposure, actually building and testing the rocket in the first place before launching it... There are plenty of mods out there to add realism in many different forms, but the learning curve for KSP is steep enough as it is without having to get to grips with all of that at the same time so they\u0027re not a part of KSP and to my knowledge won\u0027t be included in KSP2 either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jaunco325","CreatedById":198491,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-14T23:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was referring specifically to the ratio of payload to the total weight of the ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile I knew the planets here were smaller, I thought the engines would be nerfed to match.

Ion engines are 1000 times as high thrust as they should be and nuclear engines don\u0027t horrifically irradiate everything that strays past the shadow shield.

Even if EVAFuel is not cold gas but a more potent chemical fuel, getting ~600 Delta-V from that little fuel is impressive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n19. There is no risk of part failure or changes in material properties from normal variations in environmental conditions.

Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is conveniently about the right height for a rocket to burn constantly prograde to orbit, never stopping its gravity turn as it enters low orbit. IRL, the atmosphere is close enough to Earth\u0027s surface that most efficiently-designed rockets will lack the performance to do this, and instead will launch on a trajectory noticeably above their target orbit, then use the extra time gained from higher altitude to burn somewhat above prograde, trading cosine and gravity losses for lighter stage weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-16T21:48:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2022 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
