(Unless it\u0027s a steerable design - but are controllable through gliding, which\u0027ll give you horizontal velocity, so it\u0027s not suitable for landing on legs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMixing engine / fin steering with parachutes assist would prove to be quite unreliable - you only need a small random change in wind pushing the canopies away to overcome the rocket\u0027s other steering capabilities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, waters at sea are rarely calm \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E so an inflatable system would need to be able to cover everyhting on the booster to prevent salt water from getting in. (And if a tall thing like a booster would topple due to heavy seas, the booster would likely be very damaged with it\u0027s top impacting water at these kind of speeds (rocket boosters are not meant to handle much sideways forces)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterwards, a small emergency drogue chute (which could be cut before landing) could eventually help recover from bad boosters angles - but you\u0027ll need to cut it away after it\u0027s done it\u0027s job, to prevent it from interferring with the landing / postlanding.
