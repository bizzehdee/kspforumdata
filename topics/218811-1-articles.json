I just downloaded restock for KSP and it has been working great. I love all of the new textures and styles. The only problem is the engines are not working correctly. Whenever I fire an engine, it doesn\u0027t display the burn stream correctly. Instead of all the fuel coming out of the engine, the burning stream comes out slightly in front of the engine, leading to an ugly result. The restock website (space dock) said that the mod doesn\u0027t work fantastically on new versions of KSP, but I didn\u0027t think that would matter. Is it a mod issue or is there something I can do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContext:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP download method: steam (epic games)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmods: I\u0027ve downloaded a few visuals mods, kerbal engineer, and kerbal alarm.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
