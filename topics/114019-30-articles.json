If you lost those parts after you came to a complete stop then that\u0027s fine, but you also landed quite a ways from the runway, and I can\u0027t be sure if it\u0027s outside the limit. You\u0027re also missing a shot of yourself on the other side of the planet. If you can show me that you landed within 1.1 kilometers of the runway then I can get you a free pass, but until then I\u0027ll just have to wait and see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
