Similar to old Volcano.\n    - CE-10 \u0027Hecate\u0027 Cryogenic Rocket Engine: Vacuum engine with extensible nozzle based on RL-10-C2. 1.25m and Compact variants. Similar to old Chelyabinsk.\n- New 1.875m engines\n    - CR-0120 \u0027Erebus\u0027 Cryogenic Rocket Engine: Sustainer engine based on Energia RD-0120. 1.875m, Boattail and Compact variants.\n    - CE-60 \u0027Pavonis\u0027 Cryogenic Rocket Engine: Vacuum engine with extensible nozzle based on unflown RL-60. 1.875 and Compact variants.\n- Revised 2.5m engines\n    - CR-9 \u0027Fuji\u0027 Cryogenic Rocket Engine: Sustainer engine based on JAXA LE-9. 2.5m, Boattail and Compact variants. Similar to old Odin.\n    - CE-2X \u0027Ulysses\u0027 Cryogenic Rocket Engine: Vacuum engine based on Constellation J2-X. 2.5m and Compact variants. Similar to old Tunguska.\n- Revised 3.75m engines\n    - CR-68 \u0027Etna\u0027 Cryogenic Rocket Engine: Sustainer engine based on Delta IV RS-68. 3.75m, Boattail and Compact variants. Similar to old Mars.\n    - CE-602 \u0027Tharsis\u0027 Cryogenic Engine Cluster: Vacuum engine cluster with extensible nozzles based on alternate Constellation upper stage option. 3.75m and Compact variants.\n- Restock style engine effect model and emissives propagated to all new parts\n- New plumes for all engines\n- RealPlume support for new plumes, courtesy of Zorg\n- Slightly tuned most revised engines in terms of mass, thrust and Isp compared to their predecessors\n- CryoEnginesLFO Extras package has been tuned to match the new content (typically 70s of Isp loss)\n- New Extras package: CryoEnginesRestock\n    - Adapts the appropriate ReStock and ReStockPlus engines into cryogenic engines (Vector, Mammoth, Rhino, Skipper, Corgi, Skiff/Caravel) with significant balance changes\n    - Changes the plume for the Rhino, Skiff/Caravel and Skipper to be appropriately cryogenic\n\nHey look, I defined this as feature complete! This means new development is unlikely to occur. Because of the scope of this update, I do expect some bugs though, so report away!\n\nI\u0027m also looking at adding optional support for LCH4 engines as you can see from the changelog.

As far as RL engines go, there isn\u0027t much to add besides what you already modeled for NFLV, but there\u0027s just one you missed... the RD-0146. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)   \n![LM10-MIRA.jpg](http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets/Specials/Russian_Rocket_engines/LM10-MIRA.jpg)  \n\nOr, more specifically, the RD-0146CH, which was RD-0146 converted to run on LCH4 (as opposed to LH2 of the original). It should also have an extendable nozzle (the first ones are concepts for the LH2 version, but it\u0027s close enough):  \n![RD-0146D.jpg](http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets/Specials/Russian_Rocket_engines/RD-0146D.jpg)  \n![VUS-MYRA.jpg](http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets_1/West_Europe/VEGA-C/Gallery/VUS-MYRA.jpg)  \n\nWhile a Russian engine, the MYRA stage it was supposed to fly on (dunno if that\u0027s still the case) was for an upgraded version of the ESA Vega rocket. I would put it at the niche currently occupied by RS-18 in NFLV, while scaling the latter down to 0.625m (which would be more accurate, IRL it\u0027s basically an LMAE)."},{"CreatedByName":"Rock3tman_","CreatedById":158421,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-26T23:44:42Z","Content":"Loving the new update!
