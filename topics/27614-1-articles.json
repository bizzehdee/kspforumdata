For really big lifters that might have a substantial amount of fuel left after getting a heavy payload into orbit, I will sometimes include also a clamp-o-tron jr docking port, and leave it in orbit as an OFD for my spaceplanes to leech off of until it\u0027s almost empty, before de-orbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to interplanetary transfer vehicles, I will sometimes stage the smaller ones and just write off the debris they generate since it\u0027ll be left in a sufficiently eccentric orbit it\u0027s unlikely to cause problems.
