Also no SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically you can either make the payload smaller or the first stages bigger, the former is a bit trickier while the latter is fairly simple (also I figure you are more interested in that). For one I think you could cut the rockomax-16 tank and just leave the rockomax-32 on the command module stage. If you\u0027re using a mainsail (I don\u0027t think you are) swap it for a poodle or skipper. You don\u0027t need a lot of thrust on the transfer stage, although granted nobody likes sitting 6 minutes doing a transfer burn (like I did recently with my single NERVA setup). Either way the mainsail is rather heavy and mostly dead weight for a transfer stage, it\u0027s ISP is also meh (but it\u0027s good for the heavy lifter that it is if you need thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way I split up my tips into two sections for both shedding mass and making a better carrier rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShedding mass on the payload:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander, now I\u0027m unsure what I see there (don\u0027t have KSP on this PC to check the .craft). Is that a rockomax-32 tank or a hitchhiker storage pod\u002Brockomax-16 below (well above since it\u0027s upside down) the lander can? A rockomax-32 tank would probably be overkill, to get a 2-man lander can into munar orbit for a return rendezvous (20 km altitude is what I use) from the surface you need less than two FL-T200 tanks worth of fuel (or just one FL-T400) and a single LV-909 engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem though is landing there in the first place, but a rockomax-16 tank and a poodle should be enough for that. Still you want to get back and minimize mass you\u0027re taking back into LMO to rendezvous with the command module. You can do what apollo did and have the rockomax-16\u002Bpoodle as a descent stage and a single or double lv-909 attached to the minimum amount of fuel for the return/ascent stage. Or you can experiment with external detachable fuel tanks. Landing on the Mun is far harder than getting back from its surface when it comes to fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the command module if it has a mainsail swap it like I mentioned. If not you can experiment with the LV-N as its efficiency greatly reduces the fuel you need for a transfer burn but you don\u0027t need to if you don\u0027t want to. Also you would probably need two LV-N atomic engines to have decent transfer burn time, possibly more (if you dislike long burns). Side-mounting them is recommended as bi/tricouplers\u002Bfairings have a few issues (inner fairings crash into your engines) with the stack decoupler attached to the bottom of the fuel tank they\u0027re feeding from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECarrier rocket\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDouble orange rockomax-64 jumbo\u002Bmainsail is the way to go for liquid stages for those very heavy payloads. If they\u0027re still too heavy to lift that (having less than 1.0 TWR for 5-10 seconds while avoiding overheating is usually worth it, but longer is questionable). Do proper asparagus staging. You have 4 liquid fuel boosters all connected to the central rocket (unless I\u0027m blind and can\u0027t see how it really is), you should split them into 2 pairs for decoupling while retaining symmetry (you just need to drag individual decouplers into new stages so it doesn\u0027t matter you placed them in 4-fold symmetry and they got grouped automatically). Then connect the first pair to get jettisoned to the pair that goes second and the second pair to the main stage. So you stage and drop 2-2-1 and not 4-1. It\u0027s more efficient but you lose on some thrust (which is usually irrelevant but may cause problems if you\u0027re really on the edge of 1.0 TWR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRBs are your friends, strap as many as you can to the sides of your 4 outer liquid stages, symmetrically of course. Naturally have them all fire alongside your other lifting engines at launch, just throttle the thrust so you don\u0027t burn too much or accelerate too fast in the thicker lower parts of the atmosphere. I recommend putting a strut on the top of every SRB and attach it to the tank they\u0027re mounted on so that they\u0027re stable (assuming the rest of your rocket isn\u0027t too wobbly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s still not enough then add more rocket (also struts, space tape is very important). For my biggest payloads I launched them with 8 double jumbo\u002Bmainsail side-rockets (with SRBs) around the main one. All staging in pairs for maximum efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T15:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RawChicken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RawChicken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou need 4 basic steps:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1-Reach orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this phase, you need POWER.
