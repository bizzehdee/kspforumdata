Because of roleplay, and fun, I have been making a massive drive system in space with return capsule, lander rovers (done aerodynamically). Anyways, across the couplings, there is wobble. Is there something that can be modified in the stock parts settings that can reduce the amount of wobble? I cannot see a setting that stiffens up the stock part.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T21:52:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Markus Reese\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachtwind","CreatedById":41015,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T18:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there are mods you can use.

Is it occurring right at the link or behind the part? Not sure I get what you mean when you say it occurs across the connection, but that sounds like right at the link.
