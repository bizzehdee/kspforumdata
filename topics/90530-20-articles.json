This allows me to use the technode for the most exotic nuclear technologies which do not nessisary have to be \u0022\u0022super heavy\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Insteallar I\u0027m one tech short for the most advanced engines. I would like to have a second antimatter technode (10000 cost). You could call it Advanced Antimatter Power. This will also give players something to choose from. Right now there is only 1 end tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed a mistake in the name \u0022Large Nuclear Power\u0022which we already established to be called \u0022Improved Nuclear Power\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-02T12:40:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2015 12:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T11:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nertea\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nertea\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/9047187\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a Gliffy of proposed 2.2 changes, so far.\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain changes include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded a new command pod node (Specialized Command Pods)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded a new propeller/subsonic node (High Efficiency Flight)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded a new airframe/hull node (Adv.
