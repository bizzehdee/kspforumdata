This adds a new mode to the ISRU, and like the stock modes, total mass is conserved through the conversion. To make use of it, save the following in a .cfg file anywhere in your GameData folder\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     @PART[ISRU]{    MODULE    {        name = ModuleResourceConverter        ConverterName = LH2\u002BOx        StartActionName = Start ISRU [LH2\u002BOx]        StopActionName = Stop ISRU [LH2\u002BOx]             AutoShutdown = false        GeneratesHeat = false        UseSpecialistBonus = true        SpecialistEfficiencyFactor = 0.2        SpecialistBonusBase = 0.05        Specialty = Engineer        EfficiencyBonus = 1         INPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = Ore            Ratio = 0.5            FlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW         }         INPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = ElectricCharge            Ratio = 50         }         OUTPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = LqdHydrogen            Ratio = 8.7589            DumpExcess = false            FlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW         }         OUTPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = Oxidizer            Ratio = 0.87589            DumpExcess = false            FlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW         }    }}\n\n*Short answer: The numbers given by Chewie are correct, to the precision he gave them at.*\n\nOK, so I played around tonight and here\u0027s what I figured out:\n\nOre weighs 10 kg per display unit. Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer both weight 5 kg per display unit. LqdHydrogen weighs 0.07085 kg per display unit.\n\nSo 1000 Ore = 10 tonnes, 1000 Liquid Fuel or Oxidizer = 5 tonnes, and 1000 LqdHydrogen = 70.85 kg\n\nOK, given that, the exact numbers in this patch would be 5/5.7085 (which is approx 0.8758868) and 10\\* that (8.758868). That conserves mass between Ore and the LH/O 10:1 mix.\n\nIn order to conserve mass when converting directly to LqdHydrogen alone, the number should be 5/0.07085 = 70.57163\n\nThe following patch adds both modes to the ISRU and conserves mass between Ore and LH/O or LH.\n\n    @PART[ISRU]{    MODULE    {        name = ModuleResourceConverter        ConverterName = LH2\u002BOx        StartActionName = Start ISRU [LH2\u002BOx]        StopActionName = Stop ISRU [LH2\u002BOx]             AutoShutdown = false        GeneratesHeat = false        UseSpecialistBonus = true        SpecialistEfficiencyFactor = 0.2        SpecialistBonusBase = 0.05        Specialty = Engineer        EfficiencyBonus = 1         INPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = Ore            Ratio = 0.5            FlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW         }         INPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = ElectricCharge            Ratio = 50         }         OUTPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = LqdHydrogen            Ratio = 8.758868            DumpExcess = false            FlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW         }         OUTPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = Oxidizer            Ratio = 0.8758868            DumpExcess = false            FlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW         }    }    MODULE    {        name = ModuleResourceConverter        ConverterName = LH2        StartActionName = Start ISRU [LH2]        StopActionName = Stop ISRU [LH2]             AutoShutdown = false        GeneratesHeat = false        UseSpecialistBonus = true        SpecialistEfficiencyFactor = 0.2        SpecialistBonusBase = 0.05        Specialty = Engineer        EfficiencyBonus = 1         INPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = Ore            Ratio = 0.5            FlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW           }         INPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = ElectricCharge            Ratio = 50         }         OUTPUT_RESOURCE         {            ResourceName = LqdHydrogen            Ratio = 70.57163            DumpExcess = false            FlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW         }    }}\n\nNote also that the patch distributed in the NF Propulsion package has a \u0022@\u0022 in front of the word MODULE, and this deletes the stock LF/O conversion option! Also, the value in that patch (100, rather than 70.57162) adds total mass to the ship.\n\nFor roleplaying purposes, if you want to model some wastage of Ore mass in the conversion process, then you just reduce these \u0022Ratio\u0022 numbers in the output field. (Obviously if the same mass of Ore can be turned into kerosene, oxidizer, and/or hydrogen without any losses, then the ISRU is doing some kind of nuclear transformation on the atoms in the Ore. Nifty!)\n\nIf you want to assume that the Ore can not be transmuted, then you have to consider that kerosene is about 86% carbon and 14% hydrogen by mass. So if 1 kg of ore can turn into 1 kg of kerosene, then it should only be able to turn into 0.14 kg of hydrogen. In that case, rather than using 70.57162 as the output ratio, you could use approximately 10 when making LH2 (and 1.2 instead of 8.758868) when making LH/O mix. Of course you would be losing a lot of mass when you process the ore, but that would be carbon you dump overboard. (This still ignores that the Ore can be fully converted to Oxidizer or Monoprop.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T15:40:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 03:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison**"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T01:50:27Z","Content":"Does this work with 1.0.3?"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T03:43:35Z","Content":"Functional for me so far, can\u0027t comment on balance though.\n\nTry it and find out?"},{"CreatedByName":"cipherpunks","CreatedById":114858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T03:40:05Z","Content":"It just occurred to me that LE-7A a.k.a KS-01 \u0027Odin\u0027 Cryogenic Rocket Engine actually has worse performance than its predecessor, LE-7: it had Isp(vac) of 446 (438 for LE-7A) and Isp(SL) of 349 (338 for LE-7A).

The table in my prior post preserves your model-based volumetric measurements for determining relative capacities.\n\nAs an alternative, please consider the following values, which conform your tanks to the logic of stock fuel tanks. Basically, if a tank is twice as long, it holds twice the volume (e.g., FL-T800 = 2x FL-T400 = 4x FL-T200 = 8x FL-T100). If a tank has twice the diameter, it holds 4x the volume (e.g., X200-32 = 4x FL-T800). Personally, I like the simplicity of these relationships. The values I selected provide perfect correspondence with the volumes of stock tanks (e.g., Centi-3 = FL-T800, HI-M-21 = Jumbo-64, Mondo-60 = S3-14400), which guarantees good balance when using the fuel-switching patch. This version has the added benefit of producing nice round capacity numbers in all configurations (LH2 only, LH2/OX, and OX only).\n\n![kDqZNuk.png](http://i.imgur.com/kDqZNuk.png)\n\nEDIT:\n\nUpdated the table with rounded off dry masses.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T22:17:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"oniontrain","CreatedById":2465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T03:10:33Z","Content":"What causes the exhaust particles to be widely spaced like this?

It\u0027s a real physical phenomenon in atmosphere. I assume it\u0027s real in vacuum also, but I don\u0027t know for sure.\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/cYMvEx3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cYMvEx3.jpg)\n\n![573209.fig.002.jpg](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/aav/2011/573209.fig.002.jpg)\n\nps.
