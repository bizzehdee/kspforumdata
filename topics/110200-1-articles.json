I try putting a decoupler near the top and bottom of the booster, and in the VAB, it looks like it is attached to both, but once in flight, it acts like the second decoupler isn\u0027t there (the one I didn\u0027t attach to with the mouse pointer). And this is leading to stuff banging together that really shouldn\u0027t be. I am trying to make it so the upper decoupler fires with slightly more force than the lower, so that the top of the boosters spread away (kinda like a bloomin\u0027 onion) and don\u0027t hit the parts that I really wish would stay attached to my rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T00:04:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, using more than one radial decoupler to attach a booster usually doesn\u0027t work too well. It\u0027s going to act like it\u0027s attached only to the first decoupler, just as you observed. The best way to overcome this is the best way yo overcome all KSP problems: struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as flinging the boosters away after separation, I use Sepratons at the top and bottom of my boosters.
