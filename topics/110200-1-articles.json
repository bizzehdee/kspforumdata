I try putting a decoupler near the top and bottom of the booster, and in the VAB, it looks like it is attached to both, but once in flight, it acts like the second decoupler isn\u0027t there (the one I didn\u0027t attach to with the mouse pointer). And this is leading to stuff banging together that really shouldn\u0027t be. I am trying to make it so the upper decoupler fires with slightly more force than the lower, so that the top of the boosters spread away (kinda like a bloomin\u0027 onion) and don\u0027t hit the parts that I really wish would stay attached to my rocket.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T00:04:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:46:51Z","Content":"Yeah, using more than one radial decoupler to attach a booster usually doesn\u0027t work too well. It\u0027s going to act like it\u0027s attached only to the first decoupler, just as you observed. The best way to overcome this is the best way yo overcome all KSP problems: struts.\n\nAs far as flinging the boosters away after separation, I use Sepratons at the top and bottom of my boosters. The radial decouplers just don\u0027t seem to give enough power to reliably clear your center stage."},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:48:59Z","Content":"KSP uses a tree structure so only one decoupler will attach.\n\nthe only way around this is to use EAS-4 stut connectors. one of these at conecting the top of the booster to the center stack will hold it steady. If you still have problems with it colliding after separation you may need to use sepratrons."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T06:17:49Z","Content":"I always connect my boosters with 1 strut at the tip and keep the part count as low as possible and it works. No need for more than 1 strut. Don\u0027t forget to connect the strut to booster first so that when the booster gets separated the sturt won\u0027t stay on the main body of your ship. Its ugly \u002B why increase the part count."},{"CreatedByName":"Cebi","CreatedById":138242,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:17:38Z","Content":"Also throttling back during separation will prevent damage to main stack."}]}
