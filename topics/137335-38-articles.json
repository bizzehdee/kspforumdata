I eventually got it down by putting it down on the solar panels and gingerly rolling it onto its wheels for g. sake! Then I found that the wheels exploded if I went faster than 2m/s or activated warp on a mirror flat plain.

they were forced by prearranged events (Steam sale etc) and forum pressure given the storm around the pre-release\u00A0to release when they did even though they knew they had several hundred bugs still sat in the pre-release tracker alone. \u00A0In hindsight, I really wish they\u0027d done a Devnote Tuesday at the same time as the release, holding their hands up and saying \u0022Yup, it\u0027s still not 100%, prob 85%, we\u0027re working on it but it\u0027s still fun and it\u0027ll get better, honest\u0022 \u00A0Instead it feels like they dropped 1.1 and ran and hid for a bit which stirred
