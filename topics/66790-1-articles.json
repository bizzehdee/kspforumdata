Since I had only docked once before it was a bit of a challenge, but with a little help from a tutorial video and a few revert to launches I got it done! I think the funnest part was delivering the two landers, which came on one ship and had to be docked individually. which involved setting the delivery vehicle up to shadow the main ship and decoupling the landers and docking them individually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/9STLw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Last night, I just finished putting together a 30km polar orbiting Mun station (screens are on my home PC, sadly).
