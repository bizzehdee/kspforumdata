Just look for lines with \u0022AssetLoader:\u0022, each single bundle is conveniently listed and comparing timings you\u0027ll know if one in particular is giving issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf one takes way longer than others, chances are there\u0027s an issue with that file. Could be the disk is returning read errors, or the file is damaged. If read errors, would be better to perform a complete scan of the disk, it could be failing, anyway if bad sectors are found would be marked to avoid files being stored there. If a file is damaged, best to reinstall that specifically (method depends: if you use Steam, have the game cache checked and any file not matching will be downloaded again; if you have the zip from the KSP Store, you can extract that specific file from the zip).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you may wish to save on loading time losing the ability to consult KSPedia in game, just delete all files within /GameData/Squad/KSPedia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-01T19:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222971644\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157126\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488363573\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002293700\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022diomedea\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, diomedea said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you may wish to save on loading time losing the ability to consult KSPedia in game, just delete all files within /GameData/Squad/KSPedia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait, I can do that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever used it anyway.
