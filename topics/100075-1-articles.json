Many people think their rover has flipped, when actually they\u0027ve told it to roll over!)\n\nDocking mode will try to keep you pointed the same direction, with the same side facing up. This tiny rover is completely stable, despite having a narrow wheelbase. \n\n![V7CTcqc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/V7CTcqc.jpg)\n\nTurn to rotational docking mode, or flip SAS off in order to steer - and don\u0027t be going too fast when you do. If your rover hits a bump and ends up at a weird angle, just let your speed drop off, then disengage SAS to allow the wheels to settle back to the ground.
