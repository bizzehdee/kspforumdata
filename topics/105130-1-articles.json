A small return capsule allows the kerbal to return to Kerbin.\n\n[![NZjDrYjm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NZjDrYjm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/NZjDrYj.jpg)\n\n----------------------\n\n**Eve Lander**\n\n- 83.7 t, 155 parts Eve Lander with capacity for one pilot (Jeb, of course)\n- 8-stage asparagus design based on aerospike engine\n- 10706 m/s total vacuum delta-v\n- Designed for Eve ascent from 2000 m ASL\n- Parachute landing with brief engine assist\n- Mass-optimized design: cutting corners wherever possible\n- Launched to LKO separately; 538 t at launch\n- Cost (including launcher): 355,881 funds\n\n[![897O1SLm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/897O1SLm.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/897O1SL.jpg) [![TCd6E5nm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TCd6E5nm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/TCd6E5n.jpg)\n\n----------------------\n\n**Eve Transfer Vehicle (ETV)**\n\n- 53.1 t, 78 parts tug to transfer lander to Eve\n- 2094 m/s when mated to the Eve Lander\n- Puller design based on high-efficiency LV-N engine\n- Rendezvous with lander in LKO; 302 t at launch\n- Discarded in Eve atmosphere after deorbit burn\n- Includes one-man return capsule with 2000 m/s delta-v\n- Cost (including launcher): 227,401 funds\n\n[![0mdP77rm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0mdP77rm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/0mdP77r.jpg) [![j6HbolJm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/j6HbolJm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/j6HbolJ.jpg)\n\n----------------------\n\n**Target landing site**\n\nI selected an equatoiral landing site on the western rim of Eve\u0027s most prominent impact crater. The primary selection criterion was its altitude: between 2300 and 2700 m ASL, which is ideal for my lander design. Second was its flatness: according to [Kerbal maps](http://www.kerbalmaps.com/), the surrounding area has slopes no more than 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. It\u0027s also wide, spanning 18 km, which gives room for error.\n\n[![fz2d4Gem.png](http://i.imgur.com/fz2d4Gem.png)](http://imgur.com/fz2d4Ge.jpg)\n\n[![mBwyU5Ym.png](http://i.imgur.com/mBwyU5Ym.png)](http://imgur.com/mBwyU5Y.jpg)\n\n----------------------\n\n**Mods used:**\n\n- [MechJeb 2](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220221-mechjeb) (only for info screens and maneuver node fine-tuning, no autopilots)\n- [Kerbal Alarm Clock](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220289-kerbal-alarm-clock)\n- [Environmental Visual Enhancements](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55905-0-24-7-4-Sep-9-2014-EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements) \u002B [Astronomer\u0027s Pack](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220335-astronomers-visual-pack-v3-beta)\n- [Docking Port Alignment Indicator](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220299-docking-port-alignment-indicator-version-3-1)\n- [HotRockets!](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220207-hotrockets-particle-fx-replacement)\n- [Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60066-0-25-0-Toolbar-1-7-7-Common-API-for-draggable-resizable-buttons-toolbar)\n- [Texture Replacer](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220217-texturereplacer) \u002B [Rareden\u0027s Real 8k Skybox](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87311-Rareden-s-Real-8k-Skybox-for-Texture-Replacer)\n- [Trajectories](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104694-0-90-Trajectories-v1-1-3-%282015-01-25%29-atmospheric-predictions) (for aerobraking and landing guidance)\n\n----------------------\n\nI\u0027ve collected the rest of the details in a series of imgur albums below.

Yep, it\u0027ll probably get a few days to get reviewed, but I can wait.
