I made it so that when you press brakes, the airbrake and the ailerons swing straight up. By pressing B and pulling up it can do cobras and even backflips and other things that will end in tears. The post-stall control is rather good when you ignore the fact that the wings sometimes like to tip over and slam you into the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/wwIrY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/wwIrY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/wwIrY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/wwIrY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may have to find that part when I get home later and test it out, way better looking nose than what I am currently using.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sober667","CreatedById":116695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehummm i just used nuFAR dev and... no any FAR buttons where it was and on wings is not opening any context menu im doong something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FireFaced","CreatedById":141290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:51:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sober667\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sober667\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehummm i just used nuFAR dev and... no any FAR buttons where it was and on wings is not opening any context menu im doong something wrong?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roxette","CreatedById":84963,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sober667\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sober667\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...just used nuFAR dev and... no any FAR buttons ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re probably missing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118088-1-0-ModularFlightIntegrator-1-0-%28Apr-30%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis dependency\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amram","CreatedById":8067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enew dependency, modular flight integrator, you need it, and I bet you don\u0027t have it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....and ninja\u0027d\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FireFaced","CreatedById":141290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T17:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tested it yet, but that\u0027s probably why.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sober667","CreatedById":116695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Roxette\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Roxette\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027re probably missing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118088-1-0-ModularFlightIntegrator-1-0-%28Apr-30%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis dependency\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echecked.... no still nothing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh context menu is back....stock one no fAR buttons and sliders\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LuvSicGrl","CreatedById":125392,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:39:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis \u0022nuFAR\u0022 the updated version of far?
