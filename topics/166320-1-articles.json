This wasn\u0027t happening in KSP version 1.3.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a strange problem that was affecting my windows past few days, turning off several programs that depends on tasks to start, like aida to monitor hardware sensors, and other utilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took me a few days, worrying about viruses or hacking, or what not, before narrowing it down to KSP both 32 or 64 bits causing the issue, without mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if I\u0027m the only person with this problem, or more people are affected and not realized it yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beduino","CreatedById":81326,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-09T17:54:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually I just realized that every game that\u0027s listed on my Avast antivirus gaming mode is causing this. So this isn\u0027t caused by KSP itself, i\u0027ll remove the report from the bug tracker and go liquid on Avast that has turned into a piece of crap lately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
