This is OK, but it would be really great if we could get the warp function added to the Navball where the node info for m/s already displays.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:43:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thank you for adding the \u0022Warp Here\u0022 and \u0022Warp To Next Maneuver Node\u0022 functionality!
