I think the OP was using the result that the most efficient ascent speed (at a given altitude) happens to be equal in magnitude to the local terminal speed, i.e. when the drag force and gravitational force are equal in magnitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike in the real world, if you follow the optimal ascent speed vs. altitude, the instant of \u0022max Q\u0022 (maximum drag force) occurs soon after launch for most spacecraft in KSP, due to the weird mass-dependence in the drag model. As the rocket ascends, it not only encounters thinner air but also loses mass as fuel is used up. Even though the drag is proportional to speed-squared, those two effects more than offset that. (For my Goddard Challenge rocket when following this fuel-efficient ascent profile, max Q occurred at a mere 250 m altitude on the way up while at full thrust, and at about 8000 m when falling back down from 33000 m).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost craft will experience the greatest effect of drag (i.e. drag force per unit mass) on descent from orbit, around the 8-12km altitude mark, when their re-entry speeds get slowed from a few thousand m/s down to a few hundred very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-19T02:47:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2012 02:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by closette\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hubbazoot","CreatedById":21881,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T19:06:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo OP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to use mechjeb and want to do it manually, I usually do a test flight to see what engine\u0027s capability for lift is. Attach a small pod to however many fuel tanks you think that engine could lift off the ground (not necessarily accelerate, just lift). If it can lift it, attach more, if it can\u0027t, attach less. Most of the stock engines can lift 3~4 of their diameter fuel tanks. One large grey tank is equal to four of the \u0027bigger\u0027 small white tanks, in both mass and fuel content. If something can hold itself off the ground, it can generate one gee of thrust, and all you need is some solid rocket boosters to get it up to terminal velocity.
