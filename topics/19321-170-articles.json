I tried to make a piece of fuselage using the interstage adapter from procedural fairings. The problem is that parts within the fairings are not properly shielded. This occurs only if the fairing pieces are added individually *without* symmetry. In the VAB as shown here nobody would do that. But in SPH i cannot get that kind of symmetry. In fact i cannot even place fairing pieces with left/right symmetry. Anyway, symmetry on or off, the resulting mesh appears to be the same so i bring this up here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NCm3LR8.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/NCm3LR8.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPro Tip: Sub-assemblies created in the VAB can be used in the SPH and vice-versa!
