With RSSVE and the latest version of Scatterer, I don\u0027t last more than 15 seconds due to the memory leak, so I\u0027m confirming what is probably well known. I\u0027ll try to get a log posted if that helps.\n\n~~I also can\u0027t seem to find the last release either, version 0.2553? Or maybe I just don\u0027t know how to look in Github...
