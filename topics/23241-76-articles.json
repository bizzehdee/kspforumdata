And if you\u0027re having re-entry issues, have a couple of fuel tanks at the extremities of the plane \u0026amp; use TAC fuel balancer to shift some fuel around - having some far forwards for re-entry might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA passenger shuttle should be ok with a single Sabre M, if you\u0027re using the S2 parts still. I tend to use the Firesplitter Mk1 passenger fuselage, you can get up with a single Sabre S then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use SmartASS also, although even with tuning MJ\u0027s PID controller a bit it\u0027s still pretty rough for atmospheric flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: just took it up for a test flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/64324284@N05/9092619793/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3822/9092619793_6207167fd0_c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229092619793_6207167fd0_c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wing seems ok, the tail is not sufficient though - had dutch roll issues at high altitude, and then it pitched up and attempted to backflip when I turned the rockets off after transition, although that might be a fuel balance issue also.
