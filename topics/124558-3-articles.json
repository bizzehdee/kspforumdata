And that\u0027s just one earthquake, produced by heat causing convection in the mantle, which transferred its energy to the plates by friction, slowly building up stresses, so not a particularly efficient process.

Sea water is also highly corrosive, yet we have come up with ways of managing that. And you say that the solar plant you referred to is not complicated?
