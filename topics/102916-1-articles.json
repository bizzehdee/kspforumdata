From what I can tell, it would seem that fuel crossfeed is the most efficient staging technique for shedding weight fast and regularly. Why is the Falcon Heavy the only rocket that does it? Wouldn\u0027t fuel crossfeed serve the Delta IV Heavy much better than what they use now?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T16:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe Delta IV heavy throttles the center engine so that it uses less fuel on ascent. Then throttles up once the boosters have dropped away. I\u0027m fairly certain the Falcon Heavy goes full throttle the entire time, necessating the fuel cross feed, but providing more weight to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngusJimiKeith","CreatedById":101138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T16:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFairly simple reason, actually: in reality, crossfeed is pretty difficult, and costs quite a bit of money to develop.
