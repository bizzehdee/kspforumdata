From what I can tell, it would seem that fuel crossfeed is the most efficient staging technique for shedding weight fast and regularly. Why is the Falcon Heavy the only rocket that does it? Wouldn\u0027t fuel crossfeed serve the Delta IV Heavy much better than what they use now?"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T16:25:16Z","Content":"the Delta IV heavy throttles the center engine so that it uses less fuel on ascent. Then throttles up once the boosters have dropped away. I\u0027m fairly certain the Falcon Heavy goes full throttle the entire time, necessating the fuel cross feed, but providing more weight to orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"AngusJimiKeith","CreatedById":101138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T16:28:31Z","Content":"Fairly simple reason, actually: in reality, crossfeed is pretty difficult, and costs quite a bit of money to develop. Since no customers for the Delta IV have required the extra performance crossfeed provides, it hasn\u0027t been developed. There\u0027s no reason to.\n\nAnd, for the record, Falcon Heavy is the same way: last I heard, it was *not* going to use crossfeed unless some customer needs it, which gives a (monetary) incentive to develop it."},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T16:34:24Z","Content":"Huh, thanks for the answers, guys!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T17:35:51Z","Content":"Falcon Heavy is also not a real rocket yet, just a concept and some parts prototypes. Whether they get crossfeed to work properly on it remains to be seen.\n\nThe only real life crossfeed I know of is the space shuttle drawing fuel from its external tank."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T18:34:47Z","Content":"Making pumps powerful enough and robust enough to handle crossfeed, and making piping big enough and strong enough to handle the massive volume--yet able to be detached on staging--is *hard.*"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T22:52:19Z","Content":"... and yet long-range fuel drop-tanks have been used on aircraft for decades. This is not an insurmountable problem, just not an economic one."},{"CreatedByName":"sta7ic_matt","CreatedById":94063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T00:45:06Z","Content":"That\u0027s an apples-to-oranges kind of comparison, since jet fuel doesn\u0027t mix in oxidizer, nor involves cryogenic engine fuel.\n\nIt\u0027s also very much a reliability and complexity problem. It\u0027s possible to do crossfeeds, but it\u0027s another set of moving parts that can fail, in an environment where failures are often catastrophic and \\_very\\_ expensive."}]}
