A fueling station with a mining rover. A science plane for visits to other islands.

The KSP paid for construction of the massive vessel by accepting every single contract that had anything to do with Jool, figuring that they could all be completed at the other end of the journey . . . and if not, the bill collectors would have to travel a \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E long way to repossess the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Nv9OUP8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Nv9OUP8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody knew whether such a massive vessel, even one powered by a dozen Mammoth engines, could even get off the ground.

Also, the engineers were belatedly discovering that spending all that fuel moved Big Bridget\u0027s center of gravity back far enough that it could no longer maintain a stable trajectory at anything more than 20 percent thrust.

To make the most of their limited fuel, Big Bridget had to brake just enough to close orbit around Jool, then travel all the way to the apoapsis of its highly eccentric orbit before opening its cargo bay and launching its probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JSOtsv0.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JSOtsv0.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, it was time: Valentina gave the order to launch the probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tXliRhB.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tXliRhB.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there was an unexpected problem: For some reason, both the Jool and Laythe probes\u0027 fuel tanks were almost empty! What had happened? Bill Kerman, red-faced (which for a Kerbal signifies a degree of embarrassment that you and I can hardly comprehend), speculated that perhaps the probes\u0027 decouplers had been erroneously set to allow fuel crossfeed, and Big Bridget had slurped up their fuel during the braking burn. For the Jool probe, it didn\u0027t matter as much -- there was still enough fuel left to deorbit directly into the gas giant, albeit at a terrifyingly high velocity. But the Laythe probe couldn\u0027t even circularize, and certainly couldn\u0027t survive a plunge directly into the planet\u0027s atmosphere. It had to be written off. The other probes, however, circularized their orbits and completed their missions with spunk and verve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, it was also time for the Laythe base package to detach from Big Bridget, whose work was done.
