Sure, you can filter by type of craft, which already helps a lot. But because the list is sorted by mission time, it leads to confusing list orders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, if I improve a lunar rover base 3 years later by sending my fancy new designed rover there, the new rover will not be at all in the same place in the list as my previous rover was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMUN ROVER BASE 1 - 3 years ago\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMUN ROVER 1 - 3 years ago\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDUNA ROVER 1 - 2 years ago\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKERBIN ROVER 2 - 2 years ago\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....(more...).....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMUN ROVER 2 - few days ago\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince KSP is all about been organized and methodical, I believe it would be great to be able to manually sort this list and/or have more filter options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESuggestion 1 : filtering by celestial body\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the filter by craft type, the game could offer the option to filter by body\u0027s sphere of influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a drop-down list, the user could select a planet or moon defined in the game. Once that body is selected, only objects currently in that body\u0027s sphere of influence will be displayed in the list. The list obviously contains an option \u0022All celestial bodies\u0022 which disables the filter and is the default option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESuggestion 2 : \u0022custom groups\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E (could also be called folders or custom filter)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I use the example above, it would be very convenient for me if I could access all the rovers and separate buildings of my Mun base just by clicking somewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if those are objects of different types (\u0022rovers\u0022 and \u0022bases\u0022), and have been launched years apart, it would be great if I could regroup them in a custom group so that I can find them easily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA group could be created and renamed, and then objects could be added and removed from groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the example above, I would create a group \u0022MOON ROVER BASE\u0022. Once I select it, the tracking station will only show all objects belonging to that group. If I wish to, I can combine the group filter with the type filter and the celestial body filter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several options for implementing this in terms of interface, and there is probably discussions to do. But hopefully those features sound interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have worked as a developer and I can assume those features would not be very hard to implement, while at the same time being very useful for any player. Hopefully you will consider them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with the development!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T11:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like a good idea to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T12:08:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, some kind of filter/sort/grouping method beyond what we currently have would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T12:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIcons of planets with the clicked planet getting instantly focused would be nice even if it did not filter out other crafts from the list on the side. Maybe left-click to focus, right-click to switch filter on/off? I\u0027d definitely like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo prevent too many icons, a hierarchic approach might be possible. There\u0027d be always icon of Sun, all planets, and moons of currently selected planet.
