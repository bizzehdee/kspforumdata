Lets say this material is also perfectly reflective on the inside, reflecting every wavelength of light right off of it. What would happen if a small \u0022hatch\u0022 were to be opened to allow a small bit of light in but was closed before any of it could escape. Now imagine the hatch closes to magically have no seams whatsoever making the inside of the sphere perfectly smooth. What would happen to the light?"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T17:46:08Z","Content":"Well, light reflecting off of something is never a perfect redirection of energy. Some of it is lost as heat in the material.

Other entry angles will result in more exotic travel paths. I imagine that the beam will be scattered, as the mirror is not flat, and the photons will all want to converge on the centre of the ball.

I think I figured it out.\n\nEven though the interior of the sphere is a perfect reflector, the light trapped in the closed sphere would still lose energy over time. Each impact by a photon would push against the sphere, transferring some energy from the photon to the sphere. This would either cause the sphere to recoil a minute distance (causing the sphere to encounter air resistance, thereby losing energy) or cause the casing of the sphere to distort slightly (causing friction between the atoms in the sphere, thereby losing energy).\n\nEnd result: over time, the light would gradually decrease in frequency.
