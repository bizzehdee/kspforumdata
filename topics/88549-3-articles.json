I can\u0027t find any sources I can understand that detail the radiation they emit, but it does seem like larger black holes have less energetic accretion discs than smaller ones. The black hole in Interstellar must be much larger than stellar mass, since it is bigger, at least, than the planet shown orbiting it in production stills.

We don\u0027t need Star Wars-like physics to make the movie the least bit entertaining. All we need is a moving plot which will spin your brain on the turntable, great acting and creative ways to place the camera. Everything that could\u0027ve been done proper was done. The fact is: Chris is a genius. The movie is incredibly fresh and original and I haven\u0027t spotted a single cliche. Go see this movie on the biggest screen you can and with the biggest speakers you can to enjoy the fantastic visuals and Hans Zimmer\u0027s great soundtrack.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-07T21:44:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2014 09:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceXray\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-07T21:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust read Phil\u0027s sh**ty review.
