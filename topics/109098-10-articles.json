All of the air is going to a couple of the jets before the others get a look-in. I highly recommend installing the Intake Build Aid mod; it takes all the hassle out of intake placement.\n\nAs well as all that, there\u0027s the point that you shouldn\u0027t be using the heavy stack-mount intakes in positions where you can\u0027t take advantage of their inline air-shielding advantage. If you\u0027re mounting \u0027em radially, use radial intakes.
