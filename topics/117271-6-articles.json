Nonetheless, here it is. My 5th gen fighter demonstrator based off ADFX-01 airframe from Ace Combat Zero. It is very maneuverable and remarkably stable when compared to the XMF. It will probably be my weapon of choice in the upcoming 2nd tournament. I just wish i could add in the TLS weapon on the back. I\u0027ll have to discuss this matter with event organisers i guess. Anyway, this prototype version is free to download and evaluate as a demonstrator.\n\u003E \n\u003E **ADFX-01 Morgan [PROTOTYPE] specifications**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Length:** 15.1m\n\u003E \n\u003E **Width:** 10.8m\n\u003E \n\u003E **Height**: 3.8m w/gear deployed / 3.1m w/gear retracted\n\u003E \n\u003E **Type**: Air Superiority/Multirole\n\u003E \n\u003E **Mass**: 10.1 tonnes (dry) / 14.5 tonnes (full fuel load)\n\u003E \n\u003E **Fuel units**: 800\n\u003E \n\u003E **Powerplant**: 2x J-X4 Whiplash Turbo Ramjet Engines\n\u003E \n\u003E **Max speed**: 350m/s ASL / 800m/s at 5500m\n\u003E \n\u003E **Armament**: None (In combat version planned to include 20mm Vulcans, AIM-9 missiles and \u0022Zoisite\u0022 laser system.)\n\u003E \n\u003E **Takeoff speed**: ~40m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E Have fun flying anyone who decides to try this craft.

Otherwise, take it somewhere else. This thread is for entries and tourney discussion.\n\nBy the way, the laser isn\u0027t allowed in this tourney\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As inventor of the format, my original clipping criteria was that structural parts were fine (for looks and aerodynamics mostly), but not fuel tanks into other fuel tanks, as fuel can only be so dense, requiring one or both to be partially empty. I also avoided clipping control surfaces because that looks bad (though wouldn\u0027t legislate against it, because there are limits given the parts we have) and never even occurred to me to clip engines (unless its a tiny bit, certainly never overlapping their outputs, because real jets don\u0027t do that).\n\u003E Ammo, guns (as they\u0027re fixed) and landing gear make sense to clip, because real planes don\u0027t have those bolted to the skin of the fuselage either.\n\u003E \n\u003E This contest was created to find the best performing designs (originally my own) which still looked authentic, not to design ghastly, unrealistic winning machines.\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, people\u0027s ideas about what\u0027s acceptable will vary, so consensus is key. Alas, noses will occasionally end up out of joint.\n\u003E \n\u003E Btw, please confirm you got my entry?\n\nI\u0027ll add that to the OP.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T14:32:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketTurtle**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T14:34:48Z","Content":"Uhh, pixel?

The 1-A vs the XMF is basically Urkel vs Tyson ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) At least the 2-A can make him sweat a little.\n\nAlso disappointed my planes failed to fire even a single shot in three rounds :\\ Even in the \u0022draw\u0022 round... not a single shot...\n\nI know I\u0027m gonna sounds like a complainer (I promise I\u0027m not!) but errr are you sure you turned guard mode on for my planes in that battle? I know they\u0027re outmatched, but as near as I can work out, they completely ignored the enemies. Didn\u0027t even *try* to line up any shots... just maintained altitude and flew in a circle... not even a missile fired. I ran the same tests (same planes, same take-off set up, same AI) and my Falcons at least made an effort :S \n\nIf it\u0027s just bad, it\u0027s just bad I suppose... but to not even attempt to engage the enemy?
