Mods are essential to what is planned (hence why I am posting here)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A02. Continued support of those mods, or the ability of maintaining those mods would be helpful, and I\u0027m well aware of my capabilities as low as they are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd little background for reference: I\u0027m a Physics, Chemistry and Astronomy teacher for a high school district. I have some experience in C#. I also teach college level chemistry along with environmental science and sustainability when openings exist. I also need to be in a 12 step program for gaming if you ask my wife! With KSP I have well over 1000 hours clocked since it was in early release. Seriously I would be docking modules for orbital stations while we have dinner and she would protest. Usually with some sarcasm but also with interest about why.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plan:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to get to the meat of the subject here it is. I already have an astronomy club for the school, we use telescopes and various programs to enlighten students. This includes some planning and discussion of missions beyond what has already happened. What I would like to do is get those other students that have an edge in gaming and science to come over. I would like to create an X prize for lack of an original term and have students complete \u0022goals\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have gotten, through district lending and also personal purchasing, a number of workstations that students can use \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Efor Kerbal along with district approval to buy the program. These computers also are used for exoplanet discovery (through a program to analyze light curves) and\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003Eclass research. I had to purchase the video cards and memory upgrades (hey some teachers complain about buying paper and pencils so the least I could do). The trick here is bringing it past the \u0022gaming\u0022 experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor what I propose for students is to achieve certain goals (in minimum of groups of 2 and maybe more with design/control groups):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E1. landing on an orbital (around kerbin or other body)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003Ea. all delta v calculations must be made before attempt\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003Eb.
