After I create the Soyuz FG fuel tanks (yes, the ever so slight in-game difference of 0,2 tons per fuel tank is enough for my masochistic mind to go and create a new .cfg for it...because why not), which are finnaly going to give a point to the RD-107A and 108A, aswell as the 0124, it might be raised to 12, maybe 14 tons. And also, if I feel masochistic enough, I might rescale BobCat\u0027s shrouds (but at some point this rocket might have its very own shrouds...aswell as something bobcat\u0027s pack doesnt have...specially made for \u0022lonely\u0022 kerbals...(enough of the all-to obvious spoilering)), but I think the Fregat is plain impossible to adapt to this rocket, with 2kN of thrust, I plain fail to see how it could work in the extremly short amount of time for a Kerbin orbit...except if you\u0027d make a 200, or even 400km orbit...but then comes the question..how will the sustainer lift it? for now, as theres not much more to balance, I consider my job done...(but, if you take the spoilers into account...a release might come a bit later...and yes Im working on this mostly because of those spoilers...dunno why Im typing so much tho...*must...STAHP...TYPING...hnggggghhh*)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-29T15:32:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2013 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by dimovski\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dimovski","CreatedById":53976,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T12:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EComrades, it is my pleasure and honour to say that, with the help of comrade MrTheBull\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9VbhOZ9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229VbhOZ9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWE HAVE SUCCESFULLY CREATED THE 1ST .MU FILE OF THIS MOD!
