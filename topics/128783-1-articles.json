However, it makes ion thrusters - even the massively-overpowered ones that we have in KSP - so annoying to use that they\u0027re crippled.\u00A0I would propose enhancements to the rails physics system to fix ion thrusters (and then ion thrusters can be nerfed down to more realistic levels).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifically, with this system, thrust can be used while on rails (e.g. in time-warp) as long as....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA.

Using initial conditions (power generation plus location/velocity) you calculate the instant available power to the ion drive. Throttle it automatically to obtain the thrust vector.
