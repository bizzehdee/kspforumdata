I\u0027ve made my first stage of the rocket based on a dozen huge rockets (heavy lifting duty to bring a complete base from kerbin to eve \u0026amp; land correctly there). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added like around 50 parachutes to the thing, in such a way the craft is actually landing \u0022stable\u0022. Made them open at the same stage as when I decouple (and first a few sepratrons to clear it away). I did test this by switching vehicles after decoupling. - It landed correctly. However the problem is: the moment I do the full launch I don\u0027t wish to switch views, now each time the launch vehicle \u0022disappears\u0022, it just doesn\u0027t show up as debris \u0022landed at kerbin\u0022 (which it should).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat shenanigans are at work here?
