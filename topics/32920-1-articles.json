Landed 70 km from the base, with 50 fuel units left. Rocket tripped over on mun, but got it back up with gears and rcs. Really really proud \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my trip to the mun one of my Astronaughts dies and wanted to place a flag to show were. Went back to kerbal and ended flight as my remaining 2 astronaughts was safe in the water. Now the flag is gone? Did my flag go away because i ended flight or? Really sad that the site of a dead astronaught isnt there anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now im working on a Lander with rover/orbiting return craft design. I made a lot of testing on kerbal (lost 2 more astronaughts), but i cant figure out how to make a craft taking off get close enough to a orbiting craft to move crew from the one to the other (I couldnt get closer than 8 km). Can anyone point me in the right direction?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T18:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rendevous between two craft in orbit is one of the harder things to learn from scratch in this game (imo). I would suggest the wiki tutorials and lots of practice. (If you got within 8k you\u0027re already headed in the right direction.) In short: match orbits. The craft that\u0027s \u0022behind\u0022 should be in a lower orbit, with apoapsis of the orbit matching the craft you want to meet. When they\u0027re close (less than 1km at least), boost the lower orbit at apo to match completely. Then nudge the ships (RCS or whatever you have available) to get in closer. Just be patient. The \u0022target mode\u0022 on the map is your friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get the hang of it it\u0027s easy, but has a bit of a curve. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea what\u0027s up with the flag.

You have to launch at the right moment, circularize at the right moment and right altitude (lower than your target if its ahead, above if its before), be exponentially careful as you approach...

Only have to try it out now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut can see I was doing it completely wrong in my initial tries. Both crafts had just about same angle on the orbit but one with ap \u0026gt;100k and p 50 other craft was around 60k constant. So the 8 km was just one point and then both crafts shoot in different directions :-D.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T03:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
