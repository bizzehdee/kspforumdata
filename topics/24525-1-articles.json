I\u0027ve looked at the screenshots very closely and I think I\u0027ve got all the right parts, but the eight turbojets just aren\u0027t powerful enough to maintain velocity. I can see he\u0027s using the mainsail to get up to speed at launch, and occasionally during the flight but even doing that I can\u0027t get a moderate payload even close to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my .craft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1182463/Booster%20Core%20X1.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBooster Core X1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using Custom03 to toggle the main engine. It\u0027s not an ideal control setup, but should be good enough. Also my parachute setup needs tweaking, but before worrying about any of that I need to get this thing viable as a launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout a payload it can make it into orbit ok, but with as little as a hitchhiker module, some RCS and a probe core there\u0027s no way I can get it to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas? I wanted to do this myself, but can\u0027t get anywhere with it. I\u0027ve looked for a .craft of the original but no luck.

As long as you pulse that mainsail when you reach about 95m/s vertical, and switch off the jets at around 20,000 ASL to avoid flameout and thereby inducing a spin, you should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simonh","CreatedById":57952,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T19:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips. I\u0027ve got it sort of working. I can see the attraction of using the jet engines as they\u0027re pretty efficient for gaining altitude, but it\u0027s a bit of a nightmare to steer and manage the two types of engine. He used some solid boosters on one launch, I think I\u0027ll try that config when I\u0027ve got some time. It might help even out the atmosphere stage without needing to mess with the mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T20:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry using a mod that gives a readout of terminal velocity, going above that speed wastes fuel.
