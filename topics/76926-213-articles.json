The TTR/FCR radar locks up multiple targets as a designator (this is called multi-targeting and radars can lock up from 1 to 37 targets, depending on the model). The datalinked launch system selects one of the locked up targets to fire at - the system does not tell the radar which target to lock. So all you have to do is set it so a unit with a datalink gets a choice of targets to launch at, but doesn\u0027t actually get to tell the radar set which target to lock. UI-wise, the player would select the radar and click on which targets they want the radar to lock up, and then switch to the launching unit to choose between targets. You could probably have a tally for the targeting radar which indicates how many lock-ons are left; this would allow players to have multiple radars locking up multiple targets, and datalinked units would switch between radar sets for their target selection. This would allow for homeland-style radar chains and scenarios where a player has to punch through the chain to get at a target within.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re saying that a TTR/FCR unit should just be locking a bunch of targets by itself, then the guard that\u0027s linked to it should choose one of those targets to launch at?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would require a lot of rewrite though.

The \u0022TWS locking radar\u0022 is a combination of Target Tracking Radar (TTR) and Fire Control Radar (FCR) and it is supposed to get data transferred to it in what is called an EWR Passdown - that is to say, the EWR tells the TTR where to point, and whether to got active or stay quiet. In KSP\u0027s limited battlespace, the AI should keep the TTR off if there is an EWR present on its side. The much more powerful EWR continually scans the area, and the AI should only allow the TTR to go active when the EWR detects something within the search range of the TTR; the TTR then looks for the target, activates its FCR to lock up the target, and fires its missile/guns at it. If the EWR is taken out, or there isn\u0027t one present, or the system doesn\u0027t have a datalink (I can\u0027t remember what Baha called his datalink part... radar receiver?) only then should the AI should use the TTR as a search radar.\u003Cp\u003EOn another topic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current b-scope has the icons fade out after an azimuth sweep; because I was messing with stealth parts I assumed it was because the target was fading out of track due to RCS reduction. Turns out it does this for all targets. On a digital scope the icons don\u0027t fade out between sweeps - the fading out people associate with radar was because prior to LCD digital displays, they used old phosphorus tubes on the PPI screens, whose dwell time was long enough to make a pip stay on the screen so people could identify its position and bearing - making it popular in movies for displaying radar sets because the audience could interpret what they saw much more easily. On a real B-scope, the icon stays in its position until the next sweep - and will start blinking if the contact is lost at its last location for 3-5 sweeps depending on the radar model. Hopefully Baha will consider fixing this for the next update. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait.....

Interesting idea. It sort of works that work that way in real life but not really. Normally, post-1970s radars have several ground attack modes that interface with the RWR to provide radar ranging for A2G ordnance for attacking SAM sites and EWR installations and the like. If Baha ever decides to do A2G radar modes, then it would make sense to add such a feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"War Eagle 1","CreatedById":67109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T00:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to make the radar window small in size.

I totally respect that decision to keep people from getting in over their heads with kOS, and it probably does save the mod developers a ton of headaches. People will inevitably be snooping around doing all sorts of wacky things. kOS is just a really great concept however; it would be really cool if someday all the mods out there could be kOS friendly. I\u0027d imagine there is definitely truth in what you\u0027re saying about not being able to cater to several hundred mods. Generally it would seem that they should come to kOS rather than vice versa. And I would hope not, but don\u0027t know, if maintaining kOS compatibility during the development of any mod would impose limitations to what those mods could do; my hope is that it would, instead, expand possibilities even if only through compatibility with other mods that are kOS friendly. I also understand that a re-write would possibly be in order for guys like baha to make it kOS compatible, and would sympathize if such an action would be deemed too much trouble to execute if the aforementioned issues weren\u0027t already enough to avoid it. I\u0027m sure they have lives and I get to enjoy their work for free so I\u0027ll never complain. I just love so many of these mods and when I slap that little kOS CPU on to manipulate my stock parts, I can\u0027t help but wish I could program insane amounts of code for all the cool toys I have crammed onto my craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-05T06:16:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2015 06:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TronX33","CreatedById":109784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T06:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does the radar receiver work?
