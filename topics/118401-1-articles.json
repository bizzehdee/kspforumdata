Inside the .craft file you can often get away with changing the name. At least for similarly sized/shaped/defined parts like LF and LFO tanks. Other parts...results will vary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn flight, however, is another story. Changing the name of something like an LF to LFO tank won\u0027t necessarily automatically add the desired resources and fill them up. I can\u0027t say for certain for LF/LFO, but a lot of parts won\u0027t work right by simply swapping names (in flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T10:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was an identical size and shape piece and still in the SPH.
