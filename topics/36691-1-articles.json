But, if your planning on bringing a heavy lander, perhaps a rover, and maybe even visiting/landing on Ike as well, then the construction method is probably better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for parachutes, a good rule of thumb for Duna is to have 50% more parachutes then what you\u0027d need to land safely on Kerbin, however I\u0027d say the hybrid method is the best (safest) idea. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is soo thin that even at moderate altitudes above its \u0027sea level\u0027 its entirely possible that parachutes won\u0027t have enough time to slow you down before hitting the ground. This is why the skycrane method is typically employed here.

What I will say though, is that drogue chutes are much more useful on Duna than normal chutes. They fully deploy higher, and one or two of those will bleed off all of your non-vertical movement rather quickly. If you switch to surface targetting and lightly burn a low thrust engine directly at your retrograde with a few of those chutes open, you will have a very uneventful and easy descent. I find it far easier to land on Duna then on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a vessel to complete the round trip, as long as you\u0027re not looking to bring several tonnes of equipment to the surface of Duna, or do sightseeing on Ike then a single rocket can service the trip with ease.
