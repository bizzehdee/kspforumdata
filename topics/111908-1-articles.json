I wanted to try landing on these mountains, specifically in the area circled in the screenshot, for... science! However, after like 10 tries, I am having trouble! I always overshoot it, and end up so close, just beyond the mountains! I am trying to do this without going into orbit, and I am very unsure of how to land in that approximate area, and would like to know how. How do I?
