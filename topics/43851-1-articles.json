Whenever I plug the controller in (or connect the wireless receiver) before the headset, the sound is cut off. I\u0027m using a separate USB headset (Razer Megalodon), not the X360 one that plugs into the controller. This also happens the other way round, when I plug the headset in first and then the controller, the light ring in the middle of the controller just spins around and it refuses to connect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 3 of these controllers, 2 of them are the original Microsoft models and one is a Razer Onza Tournament Edition. All of them have this exact same issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else had such a problem? Any suggestions on how to fix this, apart from getting a non-xbox controller?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T10:55:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you looked up the latest drivers for your headphones and controller?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
