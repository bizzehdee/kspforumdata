I always figured id be the one controling it.. \n\nThis turned out not to be true.. as once SAS and RCS is enabled.. although built for aircraft and spaceships.. the course holding properties of SAS linked with RCS thrusters happily fired when the train jumped to cushion the impact of landing. .fired upwards when ascending a grade trying to keep the nose level giving added traction.. from the cab it all made for a beautiful symphony.. a dance of RCS jets flickering away with the terrain changes.. keeping in time with the RPM of the engines and giving life to the train like a heartbeat\n\n![wMbPN5R.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wMbPN5R.jpg)\n\n![5mBFi8J.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5mBFi8J.jpg)\n\nEverything was going well.. we made really good ground.. around 13km so far from KSC.. the engines had been running at maximum RPM for quite a long time, while the train was sailing at a powerful 34m/s its always best to settle to a nice cruise speed sub 30.. unfortunately the strange heating dynamics of KSP 1.04 means that things dont cool as fast as they did.. I backed the throttle off to 3/4... far outside the danger zone I only had 2mm of overheat on the engine monitors.. but its not something id want to disregard this early on.. more so on flat ground where this much torque just isnt needed\n\nwith all options open this early in the journey.. the best approach was to simply power down each engine independently.. running the train on a single engine at reduced power while one cooled.. then switch.. the terrain was flat mostly.. momentum of the wagons kept 4003 going more or less same speed as she slowly bobbed over the terrain.. \n\nas the engineer of this train.

She lived a long life of mostly local runs.. heroic rescued of doomed locomotives via fly-shunting a runaway train and yard shunting.. in her own away she racked up some kilometres in the elcano challenge.... although in all realism.. 4003 ultimately became a step in the evolution of the Kerbaliner Locomotive - 40 Class.. \n\nWith all that done.. it was off to cooltext logo maker and GIMP to make the class plate for her sistertrain..\n\n* * *\n\n**Introducing 4004**\n\n![fvP1Avb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fvP1Avb.jpg)\n\nStill a **40 class** in the basic shape.. she borrows ideas from the 44 class and earlier locomotives.. the front fuel tanks replaced with Pre-coolers in the hopes that it\u0027ll keep things a little more settled.. Intakes once buried in the hood now are mounted externally due to 4003 sometimes having a little problem with air intake not entirely covered by the rear fan\n\nShe carries a NSW State rail inspired L7 logo rather than the elcano challenge logo.. in efforts to keep away bad luck ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (**Sorry Fengist**)\n\nWheels also received an upgrade in that they have more torque but less speed.. Now also fitted with a more traditional 4-6 Locomotive wheel arrangement that works well on hills when all the weight of the train is pulling from behind.. KOS is also gone.. \n\nIve reverted back to using steering wheel pedals held down for the deadman and transmission gear as mentioned above.. everythings still controled via the throttle though with no change to how she operates \n\n**One of the more important yet traditional changes was in her cab.. the speed gauges were enlarged. something I did with early trains but forgot to do it on the last few**\n\n![3J1AWyk.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3J1AWyk.jpg)\n\nThe last change was the wagons themselves.. having their wheels modified and relocated.. angular drag was increased to 5.. they no longer sway randomly over rough terrain but track quite well\n\nAll up.. shes a good locomotive just like the other 10\u002B before her and I hope she lives more than 10km ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n* * *\n\n**PART 2 - 4004\u0027s First Duty**\n\nFollowing Kerbal Train Program traditions.. the first duty of a new train and her crew..is to pay respects to those who died to give them work.. such is life in this dangerous profession.. the lucky ones fly rockets to the moon.. \n\nThe Unlucky ones drive trains..\n\nHappily though.. the drive to the remains of 4003 was quite nice ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![KLMZKl2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KLMZKl2.jpg)\n\n**Eventually though.. the real purpose of her Maiden mainline duties came into view.. highlighted by 4004\u0027s improved lighting was the remains of 4003.. a somber moment made more so by my selection of music for such occasions.. played from launch of 4004..** \n\n**one that seems to blend flawlessly with the detriot engines, horn blasts and approaching the wreck of a former landtrain..**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1ryJDVuZ6k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n![71NmKHq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/71NmKHq.jpg)\n\n![up8rN62.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/up8rN62.jpg)\n\n**A Flag was planted - As a sign of respect and a marker for the Elcano Challenge..**\n\n**Some things never change too much.. this felt as real as when 4408, 4404 and others ended up the same way..

I noticed something...\n\n**Odd...**\n\nThe Pre-Cooler based hood seemed to be...pink.. more worrying was the fact that thermal display showed the entire front half of the locomotive where the engines were.. glowing yellow on the display.. a curious thing.. since the only \u0022engines\u0022 in the whole locomotive are the little black exhaust pipes.. modified sam hall turbines.. they only emit 300 heat.. but I did notice nothing overheated as fast as it did before with 4003..\n\nI never knew the pre-cooler actually did anything.. im still not sure what it does.. the configuration file doesnt say much.. but whatever it did.. \n\nit was doing it... either very good.. or exceedingly bad..\n\nMy mind settled on the later\n\n**I started to see it from the cab.. the hood of the locomotive slowly starting to glow pink.. until the vents made me question why I put headlights on the hood at all..**\n\n![cLFBi6E.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cLFBi6E.jpg)\n\n **it occured to me that I could roast something in there.. or maybe I was just getting hungry.. either way between the hunger of a long drive.. 4004\u0027s hood wishing to be kerbol II.. I grew concerned enough to shut down 4004 for the night and call it a day**\n\n**Once I finally stopped the train.. got out to plant a flag.. things from this perspective seemed quite scary..** \n\n**switching on the heat graphs showed just about everything had a meter on it.. although oddly not always.. more worrying was the front wheels also starting to glow..**\n\n**it was an odd sight indeed.. for the crew of a new locomotive just left the wreck of her sistertrain before her.. it was a bad omen**\n\n![FIEbkd6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FIEbkd6.jpg)\n\n**From there I shut the locomotive down for the night and saved..**\n\n**We\u0027ll see what happens tomorrow..
