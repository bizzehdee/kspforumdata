After several hours getting things configured, I finally booted up the game and have since noticed a few things, which are clarified below. If anyone has any insight, I\u0027d appreciate the help. I\u0027m relatively new to Ubuntu, but I\u0027ve tinkered in the past. Just as a note, I updated my NVIDIA driver to 346.35 and made sure that it is running. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The graphics look uneven and not very clear. As in, it seems that anti-aliasing isn\u0027t running properly (or well enough; set to 8x in the game menu). The textures also seem lower resolution than those I had in my Windows install (even the stock textures), even though I am not using Active Texture Management in Ubuntu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Can Linux/Ubuntu support 8k textures? I have the Renaissance Compilation installed along with Environmental Visual Enhancements, but it just doesn\u0027t nearly as good or as defined as it did in Windows (potentially related to #1). If I recall, the mod creator of the Renaissance Compilation said that Macs don\u0027t support 8k so they have to use low-res textures. Since Ubuntu and MacOS are both Unix systems, is this also true of Ubuntu?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SolarSailor","CreatedById":62439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T00:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you mean by uneven and not very clear? Some comparison screenshots would certainly help. Nevertheless, linux version is running in OpenGL mode (obviously), and some users can experience glitches or artifacts in OpenGL mode, depending on the driver quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntialiasing doesn\u0027t work on nvidia drivers in some games until you enforce it in nvidia-settings, that\u0027s a known problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
