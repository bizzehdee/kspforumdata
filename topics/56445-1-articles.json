A plane which flies normally while the engines are on can be very dodgy when they\u0027re cut off. I\u0027ve also discovered that some ships are very unstable at supersonic speeds, while others\u0027 noses drop like a brick when approaching the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question to the master aircraft builders out there (or anyone who cares to throw in their two cents) is: what are basic rules to follow when creating a glider, and how do they differ from conventional planes? The standard trick of placing the CoL behind the CoM doesn\u0027t seem to work very well, as it results in the aforementioned nose dropping behavior when approaching the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks, my kerbal test pilots will hopefully lead much longer lives due to your responses!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metl","CreatedById":82406,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T04:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry angling the wings upward so that the weight sits below and in front the lift. Also, add some small control surfaces to the front (but keep the CoM in front of he CoL, so it might require moving the main wings back some.)

That should minimise the automatic pitch effect caused by the distance between them. If there\u0027s a big distance between them, the CoM pushing down and CoL pushing up is always going to give a net pitch force. With a powered plane, I believe that the thrust and drag forces significantly counter that pitch force. If there are any fuel tanks included in the ship during its gliding phase, remember to use the dry CoM, not the fully fuelled CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real world gliders that I\u0027ve flown have always had the wings pretty much aligned with what should roughly be the CoM (by visual inspection/guesswork), but I\u0027ve only flown the things, didn\u0027t study the precise dynamics of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh, and I believe that \u0022flying brick\u0022 has been used to describe the real world Shuttle when it was in the glide phase of its flights, so perhaps you\u0027re close to accurate already. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T05:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that the CoM marker is off when you put the small gear bay on your spacecraft: the marker assumes they are 0.5t, whereas they\u0027re massless in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T06:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find that conventional planes (with the main wings in front) are more stable than canards (with the main wings at the back). It can help to get your controls far from the CoM to increase their leverage, and a conventional tail can help to accomplish this. Having control surfaces far back can also help to increase the stability of the plane (think of it as being fletched like an arrow). Most planes with a centered CoT will glide alright, in my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my SSTOs go through all of reentry and landing without engines. It is important to stay pointed very near prograde, especially at high speeds, to prevent flipping.
