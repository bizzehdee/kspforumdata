Doesn\\\u0027t have a connection node or something. There\\\u0027s also the Space Station Parts Pack, which has a LARGE amount of well-made solar panels that start up small \u0026 packaged until you reach their stage, in which they just sort of jut out all impudent and look like they\\\u0027re supposed to. That pack is pretty much just uses mumechjeb toggle in the module line to allow it to be toggleable on-stage. IF I replaced the module line with SolarPanel it works, but the huge-ass solar panels are always fully deployed.\n\nAnd awesome that they\\\u0027re talking to you about how to make this work with the new shit!

I\\\u0027m not sure what models you used for the engines and battery, but it looks much less silly than what I was using back when i was using ion thrusters.\n\n\u003E ![sillyrabbit.jpg](http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/6127/sillyrabbit.jpg)\n\n Just curious how you handled Ion thrusters. The real problem with them (aside from finite electricity generation and storage) in the real world is that their thrust:mass is a tiny, tiny fraction(~ 0.00002). The figures I ran when calculating KSP engine conversion parameters gave me something like an engine with 445.46 mass for 1 thrust pulling 523,560 KW and a part radius of 25-50m representing an array of ~52 VASMIR 10MW thrusters.\n\n The numbers are probably wrong, but I stopped working on it when I realized the scale of the thrust:mass and power consumption issues. Atmospheric engines give the same benefit of 10x fuel efficiency at reasonable dimensions, so I restricted myself to those instead.\n\n Just wanted to know how you went about implementing Ion engines in a KSP usable part."},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T14:36:03Z","Content":"I honestly didn\\\u0027t care about real values, I just wanted to replace that buggy and decompiledc old plugin.
