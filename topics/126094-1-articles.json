Please don\u0026#39;t respond with \u0022pure liquid oxygen isn\u0026#39;t reactive by itself...\u0022[/I]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo you need a Space Gun to holster in your Space Holster while you wear your Space Stetson hat and try to bring order to those scummy asteroid miners.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am aware that conventional gunpowder works fine in space, because the oxidizer is part of the package.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut, suppose the Space Bean Counters are trying to shave every gram. Heck, they want you to 3d print your space gun after you arrive at the asteroid belt, instead of hauling it in your luggage. Your Space Sheriff badge unlocks the 3d printer so it can print this restricted item using metal mined from the asteroids. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, could you make a gun, used while wearing a spacesuit in low gravity (so the mass and bulk of the cryogenic tanks isn\u0026#39;t a big deal - also it might draw from the same tanks that your RCS pack runs on), that mixes liquid hydrogen and oxygen together behind the bullet and ignites it when the trigger is pulled? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA preliminary glance at the requirements seems to suggest this could work - liquid oxygen \u002B fuel is an explosive in it\u0026#39;s own right, and burning hydrogen has a rapid explosion velocity. The space gun would be a revolver, naturally, with a mixing chamber behind each bullet, so you can rapid fire. Each bullet would of course have onboard solid propellant thrusters and be \u0022smart\u0022, obeying encoded instructions from the firing gun, so you can pick off those pesky asteroid miner outlaws from 10 kilometers away.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T20:24:03Z","Content":"\nA bit cumbersome but I do think it could work.
