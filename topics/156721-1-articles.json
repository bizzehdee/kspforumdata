The static thrust of the J404 is 130kN, \u003Cspan\u003E@ Mach 2.5 it is supposed to be 219.5kN okay that is as advertised\u003C/span\u003E when you try it out. However when I look at the curves the thrustmultiplicator of the J404 at mach 2.5 is 3.5. 219/130 is a mere 1.8-ish of the thrust that the curve says. I thought the atmospheric curves play a role in this and might explain the vastly lower thrust, but nope even with a constant atmospheric curve the engine still is not producing the amount of thrust.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat variable am I missing?

With stock engines I wasn\u0027t able to achieve 1400km/h at sea level, so I upped the thrust for the engine to achieve this speed. Upper in the Atmosphere I tweaked the atmCurve to reduce the Thrust at altitude so it doesn\u0027t go beyond mach 2 at 7000m. I am aware that the engine is not realistically running, however afterburining turbofans gain some thrust at speed again, because of the ram pressure effects at high speeds. Stats of the AL31 : weight 1.57tons, thrust 145kN (wet), max speed ~2500km/h in the SU27 (but that is airframe limited) my craft is very accurately modelled.
