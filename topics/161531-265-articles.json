I\u0027ve been playing this (with a bunch of other mods) for the last several weeks and on the balance I\u0027ve had a huge amount of fun. But as I\u0027ve gotten deeper into the tech tree I\u0027ve hit some game play balance problems that just don\u0027t make sense to me.\u00A0First off as of the latest version 1.9.11 how balanced do you guys consider the reactors / generators to be? Are they working as intended or are you still in the middle of overhauling values? I\u0027m asking because if your in the process of tweaking stuff I don\u0027t want to point out problems. If you\u0027re considering\u00A0this area to be WAD then... either I\u0027m getting some serious operator error another mod is causing\u00A0conflicts or interstellar\u00A0needs another balance pass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off on costs there is practically no way to justify the costs, or even achieve the funds needed for the\u00A0reactors in career mode. I\u0027ve played around a lot with the thermal engines and plasma engine using beamed power from low solar sats with relays around kerbin. And while it feels a little over powered considering I\u0027ve sunk about 6-8 mil in funds to establish that beamed power it feels fun from a game play perspective. And for any target from Duna inwards this network works well. And in all honesty even though nothing but the beamed power seems to really be working effectively that alone makes the game way more fun. (and yes I had to cheat and turn on transmit = true for several of the other transmitters that say they are supposed to be transmitters :P)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever now that I\u0027m wanting to start sending stuff to the outer planets I\u0027ve realized I need some power around kerbin or even further out so that I can still use a reasonable amount of beamed power. And here\u0027s where the first problem comes in. My solar sippers inside the orbit of Moho can produce several 100 megajoules. Even after I cut the costs of reactors by 1/10 and did the same to radiators there is no reasonable cost efficient way to get that kind of power generation except for with sun hugging solar blankets. Yes I just went into the mod file and lopped a 0 off the end of ever cost figure and the reactors are still unbalanced/overpriced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow part of the problem is that I don\u0027t believe the upgrade system is working. I\u0027m up to fusion power on the tech tree and my understanding is that my reactors should be mk3 or mk4. Because I\u0027ve suspected a bug I went in and modded the figures for the pebble bed so that the base power output for mk1 is the same as base power output for mk3. Guess what it almost makes sense to use this reactor now. Also I\u0027ve double checked this in sandbox and by cheating and giving myself unlimited science. None of the reactors generators or other parts show any improvement as I unlock the tech tree. This compounds the problem as mk1 radiators add to the cost as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother balance problem I\u0027ve found lie\u0027s in tweaking the size of the thermal engines. As long as I have enough power a .625m size thermal ramjet/rocketjet produces almost as much thrust as a 5.0m but the .625 has an isp over 1000 the 5.0m has an isp less than 200. Can someone else confirm this or is this a mod conflict?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve just now begun to play around with the engines other than the thermal and plasma ones... I can\u0027t seem to get the Vasmir to work and the nuclear light bulb can barely get itself off the ground even with only a few 100 delta/v of fuel (concidering the wiki says this thing should be able to put 100 tons into orbit something isn\u0027t working there) and the deadalus at 72 tons has so little thrust I can\u0027t imagine any application where it would ever be useful.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m fairly confident that my experiences are not limited tome or caused by another mod conflict. watch this series\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-vgoVjgUTW-WVJULZHORw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-vgoVjgUTW-WVJULZHORw\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u00A0particularly episode 4 and 5\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKVwmA0ZlBM?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand you can see him run into alot of the same problems.

In terms of power it\u0027s actually one of the weakest. There are many more advanced reactor which has easily solved all power and thrust problems you encountered. Note that most of therm require a separate thermal electric generator. \u00A0You would have easily found these parts if you had used the Interstellar Filter Extension (second last above Squad).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen he tried the launch nozzle, at one point, he didn\u0027t receive any propulsion because it couldn\u0027t overcome atmospheric static pressure. KSPI nozzles actually use real physics for calculating thrust. The problem was that besides using the weakest reactor, you use Hydrogen, which has highest Isp, but has the lowest possible thrust. If you had used any other propellant, like for instance Hydrolox (Hydrogen \u002B Oxygen) you would have had three times the thrust at only 62% of max Isp. There are even more advanced propellant available that give even higher thrust and isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Deadalus engine is intended for interstellar travel, to do this effectively, you need to supply with a stable power supply of Megajoules. The most effective reactors are other fusion reactor mend for electric power production, like a Magnetic Confine Fusion Reactor (in D-He mode) or Colliding Beam Fusion Reactor. Also note this engine has a time warp functionality. To activate, simple increase throttle a bit and accelerate, you will note you will shoot by Jool in a matter of seconds as it start to accelerate to ridiculous high speed, if you supply it with sufficient power and propellant you can reach up to half the speed of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Magnetic nozzle is technically one of most efficient engines if you know how to use it. First of, you need to be connected directly or indirectly to a reactor that generates charged particles, this can be a Fission Fragment Reactor, Magnetic Confinement Fusion, Antimatter initiated Fusion reactor or a Beam core Antimatter reactor. Second, you need to power it with Megajoule of power. Similarly to the original Vista, you can increase, and decrease thrust. At it lowest thrust setting, and therefore highest Isp, it will effectively not use any Hydrogen propellant, effectively making it run on fusion alone.\uFEFF\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-25T21:08:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2016 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sresk","CreatedById":167879,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-25T18:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose weren\u0027t my video\u0027s I mainly linked them because they are some of the only video\u0027s about KSPI from this year. Obviously scott manley\u0027s interstellar quest is way better but it\u0027s also very outdated. The main reason I linked it was as a reference that someone else is running into similar problems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince posting yesterday I\u0027ve been playing around more with the reactors in a new career mode (with liberal science cheats)\u00A0and hyper editing them into orbit to test things. I\u0027m confident that at least for me the upgrade system isn\u0027t working at all. Do you know of any other mods that conflict with KSPI\u0027s ability to upgrade as nodes are unlocked? I am using the CTT and installing everything through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E so I know \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E is up to date as well. So absolutely part of my problems that the reactors are under powered stems from radiators and reactors not getting any improvements... everything is mk1 which makes everything feel unreasonably weak in comparison to beamed solar power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 I\u0027m still going to stand by my opinion that from a purely game play perspective that all of the reactors are horribly over priced. I suppose it makes a little sense to build things in orbit ( I haven\u0027t tried doing that yet) but then really all that tells me is that the low cost to build things in orbit is over powered. IRL the cost benefit to building something in situ is the savings on the launch. You still need the materials. So\u00A0just because Kerbals don\u0027t have an economic model for the man hours and materials costs needed to mine and manufacture in space doesn\u0027t justify the horrible costs of the reactors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me it kind of feels like you\u0027ve tried to extrapolate the real world costs of a fictional tech and slap it into a fictional game, but you\u0027ve ignored the game\u0027s costs for everything else. For the game effects reactors give the costs just aren\u0027t balanced against other kerbal engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut back to the actual engines. I was able to get an antimatter reactor a little fuel and a magnetic nozzle up into space and get everything working. With no payload and a tiny fuel tank,95% of the crafts mass was just the reactor and engine,\u00A0I was able to get 100k\u002B delta v (which is nuts!) but sub .01\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E it was going to take a 2\u00A0DAY\u00A0long burn jut to get from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to solar orbit. Is that WAD? Did I do something wrong?\u00A0If that\u0027s WAD then it\u0027s poor design, it might be realistic but it\u0027s not fun and anything that needs that long of a burn is functionally worthless from a game play perspective. If I did something wrong it highlights how poor the documentation and tutorials are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly on documentation, I understand the design choice for creating the new resource megajoules. It makes alot of sense because of the huge powers we\u0027re dealing with and it\u0027s great design that it stops your engines and transmitters from draining your batteries dry. (although that does still sometimes happen and I have to energy cheat to fix things) But I don\u0027t understand the design choice for\u00A0having reactors produce Giga Watts of power and then have generators turn that power into mega Joules, not do I understand the extra part of the generator to begin with. You\u0027ve added 2 extra completely unnecessary parts (the generators) without adding any meaningful choices to players. the generators always need to be attached to get power and they always need to be the same size or things seem to break. So if there is no choice in having them they should just be included by default and build straight into the part. At best these parts create unnecessary complexity without adding game play depth.\u00A0At worst they are one more point of failure either in bugs or players ability to understand the mod. To compound this it makes designing reactors in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E very difficult. If I want to generate and beam 50 mega joules of power with solar I know that I will need 50,000 e/c that\u0027s easy to plan for. But If I want to accomplish the same thing with reactors I have no clue how many Gigawatts of reactor power I need and can\u0027t really find a way to figure it out without slapping something together and then doing a test launch. And of course this gets further compounded when we move away from power generation into nozzles. The nozzles themselves show an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and thrust. but that documented \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E and thrust is no where near close to actual performance once the rocket is launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\noh one other thing in the WarpPluginSettings.cfg file did you realize that thrust is misspelled as trust? and does that matter?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlobalThermalNozzlePowerMax\u003Cstrong\u003ETrust\u003C/strong\u003EMult = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0GlobalMagneticNozzlePowerMax\u003Cstrong\u003ETrust\u003C/strong\u003EMult = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0GlobalElectricEnginePowerMax\u003Cstrong\u003ETrust\u003C/strong\u003EMult = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0MaxAtmosphericAltitudeMult = 3.61912\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0MinAtmosphericAirDensity = 0.000001\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0ElectricEnginePowerPropellantIspMultLimiter = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0ElectricEngineAtmosphericDensity\u003Cstrong\u003ETrus\u003C/strong\u003EtLimiter = 0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhmm I just went back and reread that I genuinely hope that doesn\u0027t sound like a rant, I genuinely enjoy the concept of this mod and really would like to help make it better if all of my problems stem from not knowing how the game mechanics work so be it help me figure it out and assist with getting some better documentation/tutorials.
