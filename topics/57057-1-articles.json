When you engage the auto-rove, it checks the route for invalid inclines, ends the route if it encounters one, then divides the distance by the speed, and moves the vessel along rails at that speed? I think assuming each planet to be a sphere is close enough for everywhere but the tiniest of moons, and when you assume control again, it just moves the rover up or down to place it on land?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holo","CreatedById":39606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T10:54:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technicalfool\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technicalfool\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt doesn\u0027t until you\u0027ve run a mapping satellite of some sorts over the planet at a certain detail level/scanner strength/altitude/etc?
