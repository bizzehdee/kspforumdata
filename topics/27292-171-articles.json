I tried to put up an equilateral triangle of CommSats at KSO only to realize that my antennae didn\u0027t reach one another, so I reconfigured them to be four satellites in a square shape with one sat directly above Kerbin. However, my inner engineer kicked in and told me that if that keystone satellite were to fail then the entire network would go dark... So I reconfigured AGAIN by rotating the entire setup by 45 degrees, so that KSC would have a clear line of sight to two sats at any given moment. That way if one fails I\u0027ll still be able to run comms to my Mun base even if it\u0027s on the other side of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with that taken care of, I decided to add a new payload lifter to the fleet, rated to carry a 30 ton payload. That was the easy part. I pretty much copied the lifter for my Joolean MMP and added some moar boosters. What was more fun was what I did with it! Using my newly downloaded hullcam mod, I built a combination vislight observatory and interplanetary comms station with self attaching (using mini-probes) arms. One of the arms exploded in orbit because the dish that opened up clipped through all four of the big solar pannels during warp. That gave me a chuckle!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically I put up a comms system, changed it twice, designed a new lifter, designed a new self-assembling arm system, designed a big space telescope, and put it in a 50 Mm equatorial orbit just beyond Minmus.

I built several probes but only two made it anywhere near their destinations. Two of them were utter failures, one didn\u0027t make it out of the atmosphere of Kerbin and the other got stuck in Kerbol orbit with no batteries because I forgot to extend the solar panels before I warped. One of the successful ones was pretty standard and did a very far away flyby of Duna, it didn\u0027t have enough fuel to even attempt orbit due to my horrible calculations and I was probably on the outer edge of Duna\u0027s SOI. The other probe managed to meet up with Eve. I goofed and separated the \u0022main probe\u0022 from the ant probe without transmitting the data from outside Kerbin SOI that it had, but the ant probe somehow made it into orbit and subsequently onto the surface of Eve. It didn\u0027t survive, but I was trying to squeeze the last bit of data I could out of it (atmo pressure and temp). I tried to suicide burn but the little engine just couldn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally got my new computer built and running by the way, the game is running infinitely better.
