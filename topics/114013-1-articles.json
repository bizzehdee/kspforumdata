I am just about to send out my first Mun orbital probe, and was excited to unlock the SAS friendly Probodobodyne just in time. However, does it matter where on the ship it is placed?

For larger ships it can. Reaction wheels generate torque at the part. Joints may wobble depending on their strength and the torque applied. When you have multiple wheels, gimbals, and/or an offset control reference the completing forces can create a positive feedback SAS control loop. Without intervention, such loops can destroy craft!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne word of caution for probes. When you work with less than a tonne, it is easy to have too much SAS. A dedicated reaction wheel could give you too much attitude control and make it real hard to precisely manuver. Instead, just rely on the probe core SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T19:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne more tip: if a reaction wheel gives you to much attitude control... and a probe core alone does not give you enough... then you can use a reaction wheel and reduce the control input by turning precision control on (hotkey: capslock by default).
