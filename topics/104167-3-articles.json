Why are you repurposing an existing part at all, SQUAD? This strikes me as a bit of a poor choice. It indicates that you seem to have no desire to make new parts, for one thing. I understand that you\u0027re pressed for time and that you want to release 1.0 \u0022on schedule...\u0022 but using a part with the same appearance for a different purpose is sloppy, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Round-8 toroidal fuel tank currently looks nothing like any part used to store or burn xenon. It lacks both the texture, the color, and the general \u0027feel\u0027 of the Xenon tanks. In other words, to make it look compatible with all of the other parts, it needs to have its appearance adjusted... and if its appearance is adjusted, the reason for nixing the original Toroidal Fuel Tank is suddenly gone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, toroidal fuel tanks are very useful for storing a little extra propellant in a nonintrusive way. Many people have used them, and continue to use them, as an \u0027adapter\u0027 between 1.25m and 0.625m parts or at the top or bottom of stages to add a little flair (I really love putting the basic jet intake on top of them; the appearance is marvelous). Their gold color has graced many an Apollo replica and their springiness has helped with everything from lander suspension to scary glitchy toroidal springs of death. As you can clearly see with this thread and others, they are a rather beloved part that has found its niche. Repurposing it has been almost unanimously rejected by the community, and for good reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to throw in the following in general: SQUAD, as a marketing company, \u003Cem\u003Eyou really should be looking at feedback from others, both positive and negative, wherever you can get it\u003C/em\u003E.
