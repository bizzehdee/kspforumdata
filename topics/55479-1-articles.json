But here, at KSP, we get 2 sentences per week and 3 screenshots at best, and when the update comes around, things are buggy and half implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you\u0027ll come saying \u0022but 0.22 had a video about the science and the tech tree\u0022 and yes it did, but it contrasted with what the posts about it said. Systems were half-implemented and incorrectly planed/implemented. That\u0027s why we had day 1 \u0022tech tree fixes\u0022 and week 1 \u0022Science fixes\u0022. On top of that, the first comments on the video (which got buried by fanboys a la reddit downvotes) were complaints about the ********ness that is putting manned flights before probes for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, I\u0027m NOT complaining about wait times, I\u0027m saying that the priorities are wrong, the development and testing times are wrong (based on the final product), and that all of this could be avoided with more transparency of the development process. Wait times could be made easily tolerable by talking more about the game and showing progress instead of appearing after 3 months with half-implemented features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this will be my last post about this here because I think it is off-topic. Sorry if I sound offensive or something, English is not my first language. I tried to remain civil this time. And before you think otherwise, I was the one putting the asterisks, not the forum.

Changing the shape of the core and altering the mix of fuel allows engineers to change the thrust curve of a solid booster, so, for instance, you can have a booster with a massive initial thrust that tapers off rapidly, then holds steady for a while before dying away completely, or your could have a booster that starts hard and then tapers of evenly, or any variation between them. It is even possible to have a booster that starts at high thrust, dies down, then builds up again for a bit! All this can be done by using well-chosen combinations of different plugs within the same booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3d mice can be very useful for RCS manoeuvres - in one device you have three axes of rotation and three axes of translation all proportional, rather than on/off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
