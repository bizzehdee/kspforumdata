Simply put, I\u0027m trying to figure out if one is better than the other. When you have a bit too much TWR and you want to lower your thrust to more optimal levels, are there benefits from\u00A0lowering the SRBs\u0027 thrust over limiting your LFE\u0027s thrust? Is doing one more efficient than the other? Generally, I will lower my LFE until it reaches the my desired TWR instead of the SRBs. I do this because it would use less LF and seems to be more efficient and conserving of dV on the surface. However, I don\u0027t have any research to back this up, it just seems like the most obvious answer to me. Sometimes, I will lower both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I understand it, is that your SRBs are there mainly to get you up out of the soupy atmosphere without eating a ton of LF, like if it were left just to your liquid fuel engines to do so. By putting the brunt of the work on the SRBs, it conserves more fuel, and therefore more dV. This is why I usually let my SRBs always run at 100% thrust and lower my LFE(s) on that lowest stage. I find doing this is much more exact than leaving it at 100% and throttling down once in flight. Usually, once I ditch the SRBs in flight, I will slide the thrust limiter on the LFE back to 100%. I will also a lot of times throttle down a little though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this isn\u0027t ideal or you do it differently (I know a lot of people limit the thrust on SRBs instead), please let me know and why.
