They boosted \u003Cem\u003Etransmission\u003C/em\u003E. In other words, if your experiment transmitted for 50%, and your scientist gave you a 25% bonus for being level 5, it would instead have transmitted at 50 x 1.25 = 62.5%. Recovery would still be 100% in all cases. You cannot go beyond 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I believe this was introduced around the same time when the Mobile Lab was changed away from being a transmission booster, towards the thing we have today.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if you now say \u0022whoa, that is pretty underwhelming, when would anyone ever really make focused use of that\u0022... then you may have found the reason why it was deprecated \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-16T08:26:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2016 08:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CMH","CreatedById":142417,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-17T09:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve actually played from beta, but I stopped playing about 1.1 for a year or two, and just came back and totally forgot all the little details \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do remember the mobile lab being used primarily for resetting experiments (which was a pretty huge thing back then.
