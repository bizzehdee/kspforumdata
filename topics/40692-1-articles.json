I am trying to set up a satellite network around Kerbin. I have a launch vehicle capable of getting all 4 into orbit at the same time, but am at a loss on how to get them space properly, and preferably one over ksc.

Looked at what longitude I was over (53 degrees for these guys, i\u0027m sure that would change based on twr) quick loaded, did some basic math and did the maneuver again to get a geosynchronous orbit over ksc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hardest part was converting from east to west. kept forgetting longitude increases going east, decreases going west.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay!

I use RemoteTech and so getting the satellite network properly set up is particularly important. I have managed to get satellites nicely spaced into a (almost) synchronous orbit, but getting the orbit completely perfect has been a bit of an issue. Even with the tiniest RCS burst, I have not managed to get it 100% right, even though I make fully retrograde/prograde aligned burns at apoapsis/periapsis. The problem is the satellites will start to drift, and with a bit of time warp e.g. after going to other planets, the satellites end up all over the place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I ended up doing in the end is I cheat a little. I take the time to get the satellites into orbit as perfect as I can get it with a reasonable time investment, and then I let my \u0022control center guys\u0022 take it over from there. I.e. I figured out how to use the HyperEdit mod to manipulate orbits using the Advanced tab, and for me that is about as real as it gets. Real world space centers don\u0027t have one guy running everything. I am perfectly happy to cheat a bit to simulate not having to micro-manage everything. Means I can spend time on something else I\u0027d rather do ... it\u0027s a game after all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
