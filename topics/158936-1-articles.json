Then, they leave a challenge for the next poster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) You are teleported back in time with whatever you are wearing/holding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) You may not go up to a skyscraper and \u0022hold\u0022 it. The limit is anything you can realistically lift up. For example, you could probably lift a chair, but not a sofa. Not that you would want a sofa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) You always have five minutes to prepare. This is from where you are while you are reading the challenge. For example, if you are reading this on mobile and are in school eating lunch or something, assume what you can grab at school within five minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Assume you are deposited onto a random inhabited piece of land. Inhabited means not the ice caps, not on tiny islands, and not in the ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5)\u00A0No impossible tasks, please. For example, you cannot realistically get a million dollars in five minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) Assume we live in a universe where paradoxes won\u0027t result in the universe exploding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7) Don\u0027t be too unrealistic with your completion of the task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8) The task may also specify a specific location you will time travel to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9) If your timeframe is 80 years or so, and you are 80 years old, assume you get teleported back and your age is adjusted so you won\u0027t die of old age.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10) if you complete your task successfully you will be teleported back to present day, the same age as you were when you left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoster 1: In five minutes, you will be teleported back to a random location in the USA on January 26, 1986.\u00A0In order to return safely to the present day, you must prevent the Challenger disaster.

Um, I quickly grab my supply of emergency cash, download the Wikipedia article on the Challenger disaster, and grab my 80\u0027s nerd outfit. I grab my laptop and charger, and stuff that and a few other outfits into my suitcase. *WHOOSH!* Oh, cool! I ended up in Colorado! I\u0027ll use my cash to pay for a quick airplane ticket to Florida and buy a good winter coat. It will be interesting explaining to the cashier my 2012 dollars... Now, I change into my nerd outfit and sneak into Cape Canaveral (or was it Kennedy?) and casually raise concerns about the O rings. If this doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027ll do my best to find one\u00A0of the astronauts alone and tell them I was from the future, and that they are about to meet their doom. I would cite my laptop as proof I was from 2017. If that did not work, I would run out onto the launch pad a few minutes before launch and hopefully someone would notice me and stop the countdown and I\u0027d tell them about the O-ring issue. If this didn\u0027t work, well, then I\u0027d be locked away, and a day later I\u0027d be proven right, I guess... If I happened to be stuck back in time, I\u0027d go and watch Europe perform \u0022The Final Countdown!\u0022 for the first time, provided I got out of jail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf five minutes, you will be teleported back to\u00A0December 17,\u00A01902.

From there i hitchhike to orlando florida, where i sell most of my valuables (which should give me enough money to live for a year or two) and enroll in the unversity of central florida as an aerospace engineer (perhaps completing some qualifying exams beforehand). While i study and work to support myself, i keep the post-1969 rocket schematics a secret and patent them. Once i get my undergraduate degree, i reveal the rocket plans i have found, earning me enough respect in the aerospace field to get work in the Kennedy Space Center. After a few years, i create an amalgamation of various mars transfer plans (perhaps an SLS booster to send an ion-transfer staged merlin lander to the moon) and present it to NASA\u0027s advisory board. I might also send some rocket info to the russians before the soviet union collapsed to kickstart their\u00A0buran program, to fuel political tensions and make the space shuttle look like \u00A0much worse idea. If that didn\u0027t work, i\u0027d also say that i was from the future and make up some story about the russians and about how humanity\u0027s survival depended on going to mars, using my technology as proof (or i might just do that anyway to speed up the process).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first mission would be an unmanned ion orbiter to the moon and back, launched on an early shuttle launch, to demonstrate the technology worked.
