Sure you can simulate it like the life support mods, but they do it by hitting the vessel when you switch back to it. Not when it is on rails. There is another mod called background processing but again it\u0027s simulating/replicating the resource usage. It\u0027s a lot of work and Right now this mod does not support electrical charge usage for on rails or during high time warp. Because electrical charge was weird and flakey in .90 at high time warp. I haven\u0027t had time to check it out in 1.0.x yet. But I will, so high time warp, yes, on active vessel I would like to fix. but this mod doing resource usage for vessels on rails.. Not so sure. Once you d it for one part, why not all parts, etc. not sure how far I\u0027d like to go down that rabbit hole. Why are you requesting this feature? Perhaps if I knew that would help me form an opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T19:24:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teeton","CreatedById":115581,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T18:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewant to report a small bug i found. in ksp 1.0.2 if you put a command capsule and attach a battery to it. then open up the APM info panel then toss the command capsule and battery in the trash you get a never ending exception till you leave the VAB. thanks for the great mod and keep up the work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T19:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Teeton\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Teeton\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewant to report a small bug i found. in ksp 1.0.2 if you put a command capsule and attach a battery to it. then open up the APM info panel then toss the command capsule and battery in the trash you get a never ending exception till you leave the VAB. thanks for the great mod and keep up the work.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat version are you using? I fixed this bug in the latest version. Please check you have the latest version 0.16a from kerbalstuff. If you installed 0.16 you will still have the bug because I accidentally distributed the old 0.15 DLL in the 0.16 package but fixed it in the latest one you can download. See posts above.
