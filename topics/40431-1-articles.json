I started the third training mission, \u0022Oribiting 101\u0022, and I\u0027m able to reorient the craft after it goes into a spin, however when I hit throttle on the periapsis the apoapsis doesn\u0027t seem to change (I\u0027m facing prograde and I go full throttle, SAS is on). Is this an error in the training module or am I missing something? I\u0027ve looked at YouTube videos and that\u0027s what everyone seems to do in order to increase their apoapsis, however I haven\u0027t had time to make my own craft and try this out outside of the tutorial yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T11:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you run out of fuel?

I think the training module is messed up - there wasn\u0027t any fuel, however I could orient the spacecraft (I guess that uses monopropellant?), and no I wasn\u0027t in time acceleration while attempting to thrust. I decided to go to the next tutorial (\u0022Going to the Mun, Part 1\u0022), where I \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E control the spacecraft and change my orbit, however the camera started freaking out and I couldn\u0027t establish an orbit around the Mun (I suppose that\u0027s an issue with outdated tutorials, then).

The only thing I could think of were you trying to change your orbit height whilst in map mode and if you were, did you have the nav ball on view, as you can\u0027t control your ship in map mode if the nav ball is hidden.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T00:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFigure on a probe three stage design for a Mun mission. You can do this with the LV fuel tanks, LV -45 engines and LV-909 for the third stage. Do an onion stage design for the first stage or use 4 solid boosters. You should make orbit with a small burn of the third stage. Plan your maneuver using the maneuvering mode tool. Try to get a encounter with your apogee below Mun orbit. Do plan on a small correction burn midway there to fine tune the capture. Then, retro burn at the mun paragee once you get capture until you get an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, as Scarecrow88 mentioned, you fly using the Navball as your guide.
