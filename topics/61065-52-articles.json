Unfortunately I have done all my tests with a single game and without older quicksaves, so this bug get unnoticed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary: dont use 304 at all.

The log states that a halloffame.ksp was tried to load (because there was no FinalFrontierHallOfFameRoot in the save), but the file wasn\u0027t found (so, I think you have deleted it, which is a good idea if you don\u0027t load older saves). Without any data in the save file and without a halloffame.ksp FF assumes (correctly) no data present. The problem is: to load older files, we will still need the halloffame.ksp. Loading them and deleting the halloffame.ksp will get you in trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo an advice for others: Don\u0027t revert back to older games before 308 or keep at least the halloffame.ksp until you need those save files anymore.
