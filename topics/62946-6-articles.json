I talked with the author of KAC and I found that KAC works by abruptly changing the warp speeds, which ~mostly~ works in standard KSP. The problem comes when it does those abrupt changes at the vastly greater magnitudes allowed in TC. We talked about changing KAC to use a smoothed system like KSP does by standard, but I don\u0027t think anything came of it.\u003Cp\u003EFor now, KAC should still work as long as you reset the warp rates before using it.

Optimally, I would implement the jump feature with the limiter features I have planned, which could also include a rudimentary form of KAC. At the moment I am trying to get the hyper-warp feature done, but I\u0027ll see if I can look into this too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fixed this bug when PlanetFactory included extra time warps.

Thanks to Krag I have fixed the issue with SOI change warps causing explosions, but the in SOI warps still cause problems. The strangest part about it is how unreliable it is, some people report that it happens nearly every time, while I have to flip time warps numerous times to get it to trigger. Can you provide any input as to what situations you were in, other mods installed, anything that could provide a pattern or a reason why it happens more often for some people?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MegaUZI\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MegaUZI\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat\u0027s the matter whis this guy ?\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is indeed extremely useful for my beyond-Eeloo station for transfer time lasting over an hour \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI joke, his videos are wonderful, but perhaps my wording wasn\u0027t the best.

So, launched on top of a rocket). That being said, I did use a tiny bit of 4x physical timewarp on my way up to 10km. Long before the \u0022experiment\u0022, but if you think it may be a variable, I can eliminate that next time I\u0027m in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-16T05:35:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2014 05:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TeeJaye85\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
