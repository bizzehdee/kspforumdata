Looking very much forward to the \u0027finished\u0027 version (until the developments continue, LOL)...I joined this community in November \u002714, not long before .90 came out, and I have found it to be the most fun, deepest, ticking-every-box-in-my-space-geek-mind game EVER. I was born near the end of the Mercury program, so space has been a part of my life...and I am quite sure that some kids playing KSP right now WILL walk on Mars. It\u0027s a beautiful thing.
