I significantly increased thrusts across the board. I looked at this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_orbital_rocket_engines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewikipedia article\u003C/a\u003E and started rough-estimating thrusts for each size engine (and engine role).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want\u00A0keep the main KSP engine/mod engines sizes (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, also - 5, 7.5), give them \u0027about right\u0027 thrust levels for a realistic sized Kerbal system, and offer multiple fuel choices, and require as few part mods as possible to try to reduce the number of parts in memory (and KSP loading time). The only item that is planned to be released is a set of engine configurations (much like Realfuels-Stockalike), with hopefully only a few required mods to fill in the gaps where stock engine models\u00A0don\u0027t exist. Right now I am thinking that ModRocketSys, SpaceY (both packs), and Kerbal Atomics (optional, perhaps a second set of configs just for it?) will be the supported mods, and this would give a player engines from 0.625 to 7.5m, with the largest thrust being the Emu-IV\u00A0with\u00A03.2mN of thrust (4 emu\u0027s / equivalent of 4 F-1b\u0027s...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for gimbals, I\u0027ll probably just let all engines gimbal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would be interested to hear feedback/suggestions as to the usefulness of something like this.
