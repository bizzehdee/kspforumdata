Saving as much weight as possible will have huge payoffs in the end, especially when dV is critical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-For the reasons stated above: If all you need RCS for is a couple docking maneuvers, there\u0027s really never a reason to bring more than 2 of the small radial monopropellant tanks (and even that\u0027s too much, it just makes symmetry easier.) If you\u0027re tight on dV and are done with your docking maneuvers, burn the rest of it off! RCS thrusters have terrible isp. You might be tempted to save it as an emergency backup, but you\u0027ll get more total dV from your engines due to your ship being lighter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If you can, drop stuff when you\u0027re done with it. Why carry ladders and landing legs back to orbit? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I-beams make awesome landing legs, if a bit heavy.
