Today I finally docked my first space station expansion (called The Expension Pack) after a trillion attempts. Well actually it was about 30.

I never used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E for anything for instance and I placed my thrusters in such a way that by pushing up it went down and right and vice versa in all directions. This posed a challenge. But since I saved halfway through the manoeuvre I couldnt go back and change it. I saw the station fly by, fly into the expansion, I pushed it away so many times.
