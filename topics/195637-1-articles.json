I\u0027ve tried it with and without the full Realchutes, and it happens regardless of the realchutes settings..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve found and commented in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140589-parachutes-autocut-midair-only-over-water-realchutes/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E, about someone having the same issue and it being due to a specific part. I\u0027m pretty sure this is the same issue I\u0027m having, as it doesn\u0027t happen on all my craft. But I don\u0027t want to go through the hours of troubleshooting of replacing random parts, launching, reentering over water, etc. Has anyone had a similar issue, or can point me in the right direction?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
