I\u0027ve always been interested in aerospace engineering, and finding a sim game for space physics that isn\u0027t boring or confusing\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and more, erm... lighthearted than other technical space sims I\u0027ve tried certainly sucked me into the game. I played the demos, watched plenty of videos on it, and then finally payed a modest $20 for it. I\u0027ve been enjoying the thing greatly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a question: I need a plugin or mod that can tell me stats on a rocket such as the weight of each stage, its \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv for vaccum and surface, its TWR, etc. I\u0027ve seen MechJeb, which has all those things, but don\u0027t exactly... well, you know, \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eautopilot and stuff. All I want is the info. Any good mods for that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I am certainly enjoying the game and wish you all good launches and lower death tolls!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T23:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re looking for a decent MechJeb substitute that doesn\u0027t have the ever-so-tempting autopilot, I\u0027d highly recommend \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-0-22-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-1-4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E.
