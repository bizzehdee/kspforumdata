That should give us something to start with. Problems I can think of:\u003Cp\u003EIf MechJeb is in control during launch, that could be the problem; it doesn\u0027t know how FAR\u0027s controls work, so what ends up happening is it tends to over-control and over-correct the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the possibility that you\u0027re just asking for an absurd amount of force to be applied to the rocket to correct its trajectory; if you\u0027re flying at full thrust low in the atmosphere when you do this then FAR\u0027s aerodynamics will probably apply forces that would tear the rocket apart in a real scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility is that you\u0027re connecting a very heavy part (say a fuel tank) to a very light part (say, a decoupler) that happens to be right near the center of mass of the rocket; such joints are naturally more flexible due to the way physics works in-game and if you manage to get control inputs strong enough to flex the rocket that will ensure that the maximum amount of flexing occurs due to the large amounts of mass on either side of the joint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that MechJeb\u0027s ascent autopilot is fairly useless for FAR launches (surprise surprise), so I\u0027ve been flying with SAS to stabilize the roll axis while I adjust pitch and yaw. Your comment has lead me to redesign my latest launcher with more care into how the axes are controlled. I am using one large 1900kN KW engine for the core and locking its gimbal, then placing four \u0027vernier\u0027 100kN coxswain engines around it to control pitch and yaw in the lower atmosphere. I\u0027m also using four delta wings as fins for aerodynamic stability and then putting small control surfaces at the tips for roll control only. Even a slightly sloppy gravity turn was enough to get my 14T payload into orbit.

Good just keeps gettin better!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to thank you again for this mod and the fast fixes. As a player who enjoys massive builds this is an invaluable tool. This mod has cut my build times by 1/2 at least, not to mention a nice little part count reduction on everything. Also much more simple to trouble shoot and fix huge craft that are not flying properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome work, don\u0027t think I could go back to playing without this...not to many mods I can say that about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
