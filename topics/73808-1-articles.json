I put a kerbal into EVA on a suborbital Kerbin trajectory. Then I went into the persistent file and gave the Kerbal the same lat, lon, alt, etc... and orbital data as the ship. I then added something like 0.0001 to the longitude and then when I opened my save file he was floating right next to his ship and asteroid! Hope this helps someone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T06:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to use hyperedit\u0027s rendezvous feature to put the kerbal next to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T11:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are trying to edit the persistence file, you need to make sure you aren\u0027t in the game playing it at the same time. If you are, the game will overwrite it.
