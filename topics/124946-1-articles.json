Maybe a bit more, but not less. Therefore, hundredths of seconds won\u0027t work because they don\u0027t exist for the game. Tenths of seconds should be possible, but judging from my everyday experience, that would be kinda odd... usually, whole seconds or hundredths/thousandths are used, not tenths. \u003Cp\u003EStill, it would be a useful debug function to solve for the physical timesteps (i.e. in increments of .02 seconds if my assumption is correct)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T17:33:08Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 05:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T17:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes you\u0027re right, now that I think about it, there is a setting in the options menu which determines the time between each physics calculations (can\u0027t remember the exact name).

It probably is somewhere in the high thousandths or low hundredths, so it would be perfectly reasonable to show event times in thousandths. I doubt you\u0027d ever get samples every millisecond, but that doesn\u0027t matter. You\u0027ll get what you get, rounded to the nearest thousandth.
