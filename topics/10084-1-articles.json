I have no idea how to grab the cost of a part from within KSP, so for now, it reads a static CSV file that contains the part name, cost and title located in the Plugins/Economy folder named parts.csv.

For now, if you want the Accountant to work with custom parts, you\\\u0027ll have to add them to that file manually.

Achieving milestones nets you a one time payout, yes, but it would also boost public interest alot more. \u0027Yawn, another rocket launch\u0027 vs \u0027they went to the MUN!?!?\u0027. Payouts are essentially government subsidy or private benefactors supporting your successes, but public interest is like voters influencing politicians to devote more of the budget to you. Simply accomplishing something decent, like putting satellites in orbit for the first however many satellites it counts for should net a P.I. increase, but nothing like the first time you do something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA continuous depletion of P.I. Essentially you lose x amount every payday, and this needs to be offset by accomplishing something the previous pay day. It should be small enough that any successful mission that provides at least the lower P.I. increase can offset this for a couple of paydays, in this manner, doing nothing for long periods will begin to hurt your overall income, and take you a few good missions to recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you mention planning to include production and prototyping:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ean R\u0026amp;D duration, coupled with a development chain.

Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the things I am doing with public interest is relating the amount to the number of Kerbals involved in the flight (which can range between 0 and 3, though more may be possible, haven\\\u0027t tested 4\u002B yet) and increasing it when records are broken (highest altitude, speed, etc). So unmanned missions initially generate no public interest, however, since the command module is cheaper (no life support, seats, etc. needed), it is easier to add other parts and break certain records than with manned pods. I am thinking of keeping track of manned vs. unmanned records, so that manned records, even though they may be less than unmanned records, should generate a lot more Public Interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have implemented a kind of inactivity penalty to public interest for not launching flights, and all the variables involved (penalty amount, time for inactivity, etc) are configurable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER\u0026amp;D is on hold until I start Random Part Failure as I am not sure if I can stop someone from placing parts they have not researched yet, but prototype pricing is in (and configurable) for the next update.
