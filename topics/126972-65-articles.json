Up until now it had been solid, if perhaps a bit on the old and worn side. The atmosphere of Duna had changed that, thin as it was. At least the engine worked, though it too would occasionally sputter violently. Bad fuel? Probably. Given how long this craft had been in orbit it was likely that something had gone wrong. Between the violent objections from the engine and the aerodynamically questionable noises from the cockpit window, the craft seemed to be just barely holding it together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn alarm sounded and two bright red warning lamps flashed on the lander\u0027s display. A black-mittened fist pounded the panel, the quick thump causing the alarm to quiet. It was as though the craft itself had decided it was best to not disturb the pilot. The white-haired kerbal which sat in the seat was calm and collected, but also quick to mete out punishment to the things which crossed him. The racket from the window grew louder, eliciting another thump and an inaudible grunt from the pilot. He checked his helmet seals, the sixteenth he\u0027d done so since leaving orbit, then made a small adjustment to the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe planet-spanning dust storm was thinner where he was landing, but still not thin enough to see his target. Everything had the same ruddy hue, an endless ocean of rust. The only other colors were those of his red and gold-trimmed suit\u0027s reflection in the lander window. A small grey speck appeared on the surface briefly through the storm, disappearing again a moment later. His suit radio chimed and he again adjusted the craft\u0027s trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I see it. Going dark now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned off the radios. All of them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engine was still sputtering along as the lander made its final approach. The dust had thinned enough to see the target. A small aircraft, and what appeared to be a large rocket engine nearby. It was impossible to determine how long it had been on the surface, but it was unlikely the craft still had power for its radios. Not that he wanted the pilot to know he was coming. Assuming its pilot had survived, or existed in the first place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180808_ksp0671_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.83\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180808_ksp0671_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother violent kick from the engine bucked everything in the lander upwards, dislodging a toolkit and other supplies in the cockpit. It had no parachutes, this worn out rusty tin can. He could have rigged some from spare sheets, or robbed some from one of the other craft in orbit, but chose not to. The extra mass would have only made this operation more difficult. If something went wrong he\u0027d be stuck on the surface no matter what, so using his own personal parachute would be just as good as one on the lander. Not like parachutes would do much for something this heavy in air this thin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then he was down. Just a soft bounce. He idled the engine and suspended the computers to save power. It took a few moments for the dust to settle, but once it did he had a clear view of the relic. An air breathing jet, on Duna. Not too surprising, and not the first time he had found a test article on some distant body which made no sense. The large rocket engine was also strange, but well within the usual antics of the agencies of the past. Just fling something to the distant edges of the cosmos and wait to see if it works. If it doesn\u0027t? Well, that was data too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180808_ksp0675_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.92\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180808_ksp0675_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe checked his helmet seals for the seventeenth time and tugged at his mittens. The straps for the crash couch were unfastened with calm and precise motions, and the pilot made his way to the hatch. He slipped into his EVA pack and snared a power drill to his belt. The hatch was almost open when he reached back and pulled a shovel from a cabinet. Best to be prepared, right? He was down the ladder and onto the sands and fines with a single bound.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wind was wicked, the blown sand fierce. Too thin to have enough energy to knock anything over, but just thick enough to be annoying. Probably thick enough to destroy unsuspecting solar panels. A flag was lying flat in the dust on the far side of the aircraft. Was the blame his or the wind\u0027s? Not likely it mattered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was no greeting party.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180808_ksp0681_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.92\u0022 height=\u0022603\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180808_ksp0681_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe gave the grip of the drill a quick squeeze. Its low-frequency buzz echoed up through his suit. These were fancy drills, where one could dial in all sorts of settings such as torque, rotation rate, probably even the exact number of electrons one wanted to have pass through the windings of the motor at a time. Supposedly it took years of study to understand how to properly calibrate and tweak these drills for the job at hand. Somehow he\u0027d made it through all the work he\u0027d done without changing any of the settings. And so far nothing had exploded or stripped out on him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe clipped the drill to his EVA pack and pulled out his shovel, using it to steady himself as he made his way across the dune to the aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180808_ksp0696_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.75\u0022 height=\u0022601\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180808_ksp0696_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was not much salvage visible from the outside, but what he could see was something he would not leave without: a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. Power. This far from Kerbol such a power source was almost required. No idea if it was still at a good strength (unlikely), but the only way to find out was to remove it and take it back to his workshop in orbit. The other parts of the ship were either trivial, such as the small batteries, or useless to him. What good would air-breathing engines be in space? They would serve no more good in the void than they would here on Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cockpit glass was glazed over from the inside. Ice? He couldn\u0027t tell if there was a deceased kerbal resting in it or if this had been an unpiloted drone. He brushed some dust off the glass and peered inside, but couldn\u0027t make any more sense of it than before. He\u0027d get to that part of the ship in due time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180808_ksp0699_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.83\u0022 height=\u0022602\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180808_ksp0699_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket engine made no sense. It had a large reaction wheel attached to it, and near as he could tell there was no damage. Looked as though it had been deliberately detached from some part of the aircraft. And there were no fuel lines on it either. Had it been part of some other lander assembly? Or parachuted down to the surface? If that was the case, then where were the parachutes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there was no way he could salvage it. Or even move it. The engine itself was far too heavy, and he knew better than to attempt to roll it. Maybe the turbopump assembly could be useful? Maybe. He\u0027d look at stripping it for parts later.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180808_ksp0702_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002255.58\u0022 height=\u0022569\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180808_ksp0702_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest to start with the most important loot: The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.

He secured his shovel and stepped on the aircraft\u0027s wing, scrambling quickly onto the useless starboard jet engine. The drill was back in his hand and he was considering how best to acquire his loot when a buzzing noise started in his ears. He slapped at the side of his helmet once, and shortly after an ancient sounding heavily accented voice scratched across the suit\u0027s radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey!

Was it his own reflection? No. Didn\u0027t sound right. Different suit. Did kind of look like his old suit. Was this his own ghost? Unlikely. He blinked and the kerbal was still there, looking angrily up at him. OK, not his reflection. Maybe still a ghost. Or do reflections not go away when you blink? He shook his head and returned to sanity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Apologies. I was merely looking about, trying to decide how best to dismantle your ship. I don\u0027t suppose you have any suggestions?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah.

A few seconds of confused looks were exchanged before the exasperated ghostly resident of Duna continued.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You the rescue crew, then?

He wasn\u0027t even sure kerbals could be dissected, given their tendency to explode into a cloud of spores when punctured. To deflect from the question he motioned towards the flag, lying flat in the dust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re flag has fallen.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah?

I\u0027m just an old farmer.\u0022 He twisted his shovel and spun it by its tip on the aircraft\u0027s skin. He smiled, imagining the pleasing sound it would make were it not for the thin air and the heavy suit. \u0022Or I was, until the First Kerbal himself visited. Twenty-six years I spent on the M\u00FCn, tending my farm and growing the crescent m\u00FCnfruit. I was the last kerbal....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The what now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The M\u00FCn. It\u0027s Kerbin\u0027s largest satellite.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not that, ya daft clown. I know what yer M\u00FCn is. What this here croissant fruity stuff yer goin\u0027 on about?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah. It\u0027s a hybrid between bananas and the cacti that grow in the desert. As I was saying, I believed I was the last living kerbal anywhere in the universe, that everyone else had died in some great calamity. There I was, abandoned on the M\u00FCn, much like you\u0022 he waved his shovel towards him, \u0022abandoned here in the dust. No contact, no hope of rescue. In time I grew frail, feeble. Bad diet, bad exercise. It\u0027s hard to stay in shape with m\u00FCnfruit and recycled water and nowhere to get a decent jog.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And I continued to believe I was the last even after the First Kerbal and his ilk drifted into my base. Ghosts. They had to be. The First Kerbal been dead for almost a hundred years. Ghosts come to haunt and to rob. All of you. Ghosts. Ghosts.\u0022 He stared down at the strange new ghost for a spell, but it didn\u0027t run when confronted. Curious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Except those other kerbals weren\u0027t ghosts. Not exactly. But they hadn\u0027t come to rescue me either. They really had come to rob me. To take my radialogicals. My power. Except I got the jump on them. I stole their shuttle and I stole their ship and I left them to rot on the M\u00FCn. As had been done to me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Much like I\u0027m here to rob you. To strip your plane of parts, particularly that nice, juicy radiological device that gives you warmth. And whatever fuel you have left, of course. I\u0027d take the whole plane if I could, it\u0027s a nice-looking wreck. Such is the life of a pirate. Take what you can, give nothing back.\u0022 He paused, grinning wildly at the stunned old ghost. He let his grin slip to a smile before he continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u0027Cept I\u0027ve changed. I\u0027ve more of a heart now. I was space crazy, you see, stuck on that grey lump. The time that I\u0027ve spent in space has improved my health, improved my attitude, improved my mind. It was wrong for me to abandon those kerbals on the M\u00FCn, just as it was wrong for the OSD to leave you here, forgotten. It was the OSD, was it not?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Skunksworks, yep.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I won\u0027t repeat those mistakes. Neither mine, nor those of some corrupt and forgotten old organization. Going forward, no kerbal will be left behind. So maybe we didn\u0027t get off on the right foot. Please, allow me to correct that.\u0022 The old kerbal wedged his shovel into a gap in the aircraft before extending his old, very old mittened hand to wave at this very, very old ghost.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m Hallock Kerman, Captain of the Memory of Tomorrow. And I\u0027m here to free you from this desolate wasteland, from your forgotten space program, and to lead you into a new life. There\u0027s room for you in my crew if you care to join. Otherwise...\u0022 He raised his arms towards the all-encompassing deserts of Duna. \u0022Otherwise you\u0027ll be free to make your own way in this heartless universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what say you?

It would be a little departure from what\u0027s established but it might be a worthwhile compromise. Second, and since this is a major update to the underlying fundamentals of the Unity engine, I think you\u0027d be entirely justified in overhauling everything and consolidating. Delete part modules that no longer work. Maybe whole ships vanish. This reset was harder than the last few, resetting not just Kerbin but the entire Kerbal universe. At least, that\u0027s what it feels like to all of us with heavily modded saves that can\u0027t really be easily updated...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, there must be a way to keep things a little more separated. Maybe have one save for each group of ships and transfer between them to keep any one from growing too big? So you\u0027d have one save for Sieta and her crew, one for Thomlock and his, one for Jonbald and the current space program, and however many else. Then just transfer craft between saves as necessary to make it work. (Actually, that sounds like a good mod...) That would be a pain but it might make the game run a lot better. Actually, the new Unity engine probably would too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course you could just end it and I think you\u0027d be entirely justified in doing so, but I hope you do at least give us a story breakdown of what would have happened so we can imagine! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223695441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572152690\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269224\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cydonian Monk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Cydonian Monk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat unfortunately won\u0027t happen.

Some time during the summer of 2019 I broke apart my home PC, put it in storage, and dismantled the el-cheapo computer desk it once sat on. I almost sent the whole lot of it off to the recyclers and/or the rubbish heap back in February of this year. Then along came March....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt didn\u0027t take long for my office to switch to work from home, which we\u0027re still doing and plan to be for at least the remainder of the year. I\u0027ve become rather accustomed over the years to working on three large monitors while hacking at binary rocks in the software mines, so attempting to do any legitimate coding on my 13\u0022 MacBook went stale after about 12 minutes. While I indeed _had_ sent a bunch of old hardware and electronics off to the recyclers, I thankfully kept the old gaming PC. At first I set up camp in a disused corner of my bedroom, but quickly moved back to the livingroom, a location which provides the added benefit of using my TV as a (somewhat large) third monitor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also kept most of the parts of my rickety old computer desk, for reasons I stil can\u0027t fathom. Some time back when this whole mess started I used some scrap lumber to build a hutch / platform thing to raise my monitors up and give me some space to store work papers and the like. I accidentally built this right, because I included a 2 inch overhang on the sides, which I\u0027ve discovered is tremendously useful for clamping things to. And let\u0027s all be honest here - at this point who doesn\u0027t have three cameras, four spotlights, and a microphone attached to booms or snake-arms which are then clamped to a desk or some other flat surface somewhere in their home?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was only natural that I\u0027d be pulled back into this game at some point, that point being a couple weeks ago. In the interim I had entirely skipped KSP versions 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 and remember being thoroughly frustrated with 1.6. While KSP v1.10.1 isn\u0027t perfect (hello resource transfers!), I think it\u0027s quite possibly the best version of the game we\u0027ve seen since v1.0.5. It certainly runs better on my PC than everything released since v1.4.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yet none of what I\u0027ve written above is why you are here reading about this Forgotten Space Program. You want to know how well this save works in v1.10.1, right? And probably what happened on Duna? And whether or not the Jumble of Parts and the Jool Jester and their groups of wayward kerbals ever made it back to Kerbin, yes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re in luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter I went through the usual rounds of tracking down mods, getting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E set up (on v1.8), and then experimenting a tiny bit with JNSQ, I set out on what I thought would be the arduous task of restoring the Forgotten save. Turns out that took all of about 5 minutes. In the end almost all of the old and now long-unsupported parts mods this saves uses work just fine. And in one case the mod parts work _\u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E_ after having been broken by a KSP Unity update, oh, maybe four or five years ago. There are a couple new parts with broken old-style Unity textures, but they at least fail in ways that look good enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only, and I mean only, headaches I\u00A0encountered were some broken SpaceY parts which are now fixed thanks to a ModuleManager config (available over on one of those two threads), and a whole slew of missing struts and fuel ports from the obsoleted versions of Kerbal Inventory System.

Those changes can be explained away through story easily enough. And I do rather like the new suit picker in the base game, so if I do re-add any suit textures I\u0027ll almost certainly use that mechanism instead of using TextureReplacer or DiRT. And there\u0027s also something weird going on with the sandstorms on Duna and something \u00A0very very weird going on with Jool, both of which I\u0027ll take a look at here in the next few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they say, the proof is in the \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003Eblood\u003C/span\u003E pudding.

By this I mean things such as the modules used by the CommNet for communication. In older, post-CommNet versions of the game, this would leave the craft completely uncontrollable, which is the behaviour I would expect. Now I\u0027ve discovered that as long as they have a probe core (and a \u0022ModuleCommand\u0022 module in that probe core\u0027s instance) I can control them without a radio link. It\u0027s as though these craft have no concept of radio....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother are the various jet engines scattered across the wastes of the Kerbol system. In every instance, all of these old engines are \u0022running\u0022 and animated as though they are at full-throttle, yet\u00A0are entirely non-functional. This isn\u0027t anything new as I had to edit the craft in the \u0022Alone on Duna\u0022 post to remove this effect, but it certainly hasn\u0027t subsided with v1.10.1. Not really surprising or a big deal given these ships were in most cases launched in the pre-1.0 old jet engine days, but it still amuses me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the more frustrating things I\u0027ve encountered isn\u0027t even KSP\u0027s fault. For years I\u0027ve kept my saves and GameData folders on my DropBox (using symlinks), both for backup reasons and because I played KSP simultaneously on both MacOS and Windows. Something in Dropbox and/or Windows has changed recently, and Dropbox now grabs exclusive control over files until it can sync them, preventing KSP from writing to them again. And boy howdy does KSP like to save the persistence file often! For most normal and sane save games this wouldn\u0027t be an issue, but the persistence file for Forgotten is currently around 50MBs. Some times it takes Dropbox a while to get around to uploading it. So for now I\u0027ve moved the Forgotten save file back to my SSD and out of Dropbox. I\u0027ll lose the file versioning Dropbox provided, but at least it works again without having to wait for slow poke Dropbox to catch up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESo what now?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst up I\u0027ll work through the rest of the Duna story with Captain Hallock. I still have the screenshots from all of that, unedited as of yet, and I do need to do some post-effects on a few of them. Once complete, the business at Duna will bring Volume 2 of the Forgotten Space Program to a close, aside from a quick Epilogue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that I have some decisions to make. Some months back while working on what was going to be the final post in this thread, I hammered out the basic structure of what might have happened in the third and final volume of Forgotten. It\u0027s important to realize that while I\u0027ve always had a general direction of where I wanted this to go, I mostly let the game drive there and have adapted based on what results it gave me. So for example, had Thomlock died in some freak launch accident, that would\u0027ve been the end of him and I would\u0027ve needed to change his parts of the story.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not 100% sure how to proceed with the next Volume. I had originally considered playing the lot of it in KSP2 with the crews of the Jumble of Parts and the Jool Jester arriving back \u0022home\u0022 to find a vastly changed Kerbin. Unfortunately I\u0027m increasingly skeptical that KSP2 will exist in my life time in some form beyond nice screen shots and the occasional video from the dev team(s). And even if it does show up on its new schedule, that means it\u0027ll still be 18 to 24 months before it phase changes from vapor to liquid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for now we\u0027re still Forgotten in the good old world of KSP1, for better or worse. I have to admit the 50MB save file and its accumulated cruft does at times bother me. It\u0027s not that it\u0027s slow, it\u0027s more that at times it\u0027s VERY slow. VERY slow only serves to add frustration. And it\u0027s large enough that, for whatever reason, it drives KSP\u0027s memory usage perilously close to its ~24-26GB functional limit on my PC. Out-of-memory crashes also add frustration. And right now, especially right now, anything that adds frustration is the enemy of Good Enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we\u0027ll see. I still want to poke around a bit in JNSQ and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and play with some of the neat new mods that have been released in the years that I\u0027ve not been actively playing Kerbal Space Program.

Soft chirping sounds ping-ponged their way from the intercom, tones that announced the Captain was about to speak. Hallock leaned forward from the shadows of the \u0022Memory of Tomorrow\u0027s\u0022 cockpit and into the red glow of Duna, pulling himself closer to the microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeconds passed before a response, another soft chirp, this time in the pattern the Queen had chosen. The line was held open and silent, as was her style, the only sound an occasional pop of static as an interstellar particle released its energy into their ship. Finally she spoke.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Munths. We\u0027ve been _here_ for munths, slowly limping into our frozen graves. Have we found our doom? What inconspicuous event has caused us to arrive at a place where we were and yet were not before?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSarcasm. It was sarcasm. Sieta had never been one for direct questions, but he had to admit she was right. The transit from Kerbin had used every bit of fuel they could steal. Fully stocked, the ship alone lacked the potential needed to safely burn for Duna. Their fault for stealing it before it was complete. The tin cans of propellant they had lifted from a supply depot in Kerbin orbit had been discarded as they emptied, one now drifting forever in interplanetary space. Even then they were left with barely enough to complete the Duna capture, had they done it conventionally. Gravity assists from Ike to drop their orbit over a series of munths was the only option left. That, or drift past Duna and out into the airless cold depths of nowhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe ignored her sarcasm, and sifted through the list of contacts their cobbled-together computer system had built. \u0022Baile Speir\u0022, the station they had raided back at Kerbin, had provided a bounty of mysteriously still working electronics. They had taken all they could manage and put them to work. Sieta insisted these now formed a \u0022cycle-proof computer\u0022, though he had no idea what she was talking about. Still, the faint list of contacts was proof enough that it worked, even if they occasionally had to punch programs in by hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSieta spent her days listening to the background static as it scratched its way free of their radios. Occasionally she caught the spasms of existence as Cycles came and went, recording some on makeshift physical media. Impromtu records they had crafted out of bits of film and insulation. Some days she was completely lost in her trance, listening to the Cycles scream over and over and over. Hallock was now convinced she was a victim of Space Madness. And perhaps the only way to become the Queen of Space was to give in to one\u0027s own darker whispers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe list of objects in the Duna system was substantial. Most were in the usual equatorials, but there were a few comms and mapping satellites at higher inclinations, some of which still worked. A handful of things resembled stations or maybe fuel depots, and there were a few larger and suspiciously positioned ships in orbits halfway to Ike. And lots and lots of space junk. Hard to say what worked and what didn\u0027t, what were rocks and what had been built by the hands of kerbals. Only way to know for sure was to go take a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir first priority was fuel. If forced to he could take the \u0022Rock Spear\u0022, the small asteroid-grabber which formed the very tip of the Memory, and use it to investigate a target before moving the entire ship. Once the tanks of the Memory were full, then they could set about robbing these orbiting zombies of their useful parts. Maybe even find a few long lost kerbals, or more likely their corpses, scattered about hither and yon. Or maybe worse. Was it possible for kerbals to die, but not die? Are there undead spacekerbs? Here, at Duna? The old pulp stories thought so. More than any other planet, Duna played host to hordes of meandering mindless dusters. There couldn\u0027t be any truth to those tales, could there?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. Hallock shook his head. No. Nonsense. He had piracy to focus on, not silly daydreams of ridiculous old ghost stories. There were good odds the larger flares they\u0027d spotted in lower orbits were used in the past for crewed expeditions to the surface and back. If they were going to find fuel anywhere, it would be at one of those. A quick glance at the math caused him to grimace. Hundreds of meters per second to drop into an intercepting orbit. Another thirty or maybe fifty to make the actual rendezvous. They would be cutting it close, very close, really eating into their reserves. And they could very well end up stuck in low Duna orbit, but they had to start somewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe keyed the intercom again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sieta,\u0022 he paused, corrected himself. \u0022Queen Sieta, have you gained access to any of these satellites?\u0022 Silence. A chirp. A few more seconds of silence.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They sing to me. Soft beeps, sharp shrills. Sweet whispers in the dusky night sky.\u0022 Yep, she was in one of her states. Mad as a hatter. More days than not she was now lost to this insanity. And he had nothing to do but play along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good. I\u0027m marking two targets in a lower orbit. I think we\u0027ll find what we need there. Would you see if they\u0027ll, uh, sing to you? Mayhaps tell us how full they are?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I will sing to them. They will sing their song or they will BURN.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, he realized, then and there, Space Madness was the absolute prerequisite for becoming a Queen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGhosts and Stuff\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180807_ksp0476_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022666\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180807_ksp0476_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir first target was one of the brightest objects in low Duna orbit. In Hallock\u0027s experience visual magnitude was a good indication of size, so, they had a better than even chance of success. The burn hadn\u0027t been as severe as he first thought, a mere 110 m/s to drop to intercept, and another 115 m/s to match velocities. The initial separation was a kilometer and a half, but that was brought down with a short burn part way through the transit. The rest of the rendezvous Hallock was sure he could manage using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey came in slightly underneath the target, approaching out of the Sun. Blind their victims until it was too late. Hallock was more than a bit surprised when the Memory\u0027s computer lit up with a connection alert: close-approach and docking guidance from their target, which was identifying itself as \u00225-020 Seconee 1\u0022. This name meant absolutely nothing to him. He was hoping the navigation data was an automated process, but he also wasn\u0027t about to try to hail them either. No reason to give up the element of surprise, assuming they still had it at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180807_ksp0493_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.50\u0022 height=\u0022668\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180807_ksp0493_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was quickly apparent he had chosen correctly. As they drifted alongside, he could make out not only a storage tank for refueling, but also some landers and a shuttle in addition to a small habitation area on the station. Even if there was no fuel to be found, he could strip the rest of the craft for desperately needed spare parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe made one last quick course adjustment for the Memory, then went down to the airlock to suit up. Their closest approach would be in the dark on the shadowed side of Duna, as was only fitting and proper. He grabbed his shovel, some miscellaneous tools, and a spare drill, and made his way into the soon to be inky black void.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180807_ksp0497_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022666\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180807_ksp0497_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180807_ksp0498_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.25\u0022 height=\u0022666\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180807_ksp0498_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe drifted slowly at first, then moved quickly once the darkness had taken them. The lights were on in one of the docked shuttles, otherwise he would have been forced to find his way by memory and guesswork. As he neared he decelerated quickly, grabbed hold of the side of the station, and spun his way onto a set of grabs. He was near one of the windows of the habitation section, the outer skin of the station dimly lit from the cockpit of the shuttle below. It was as dark inside as it was out, no obvious signs of life. He waited a few moments, nothing moved. No lights. He climbed downwards towards the shuttles, peeking in every window he crossed. The same story each time. Nobody home, nothing on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all there were two landers, a small shuttle, a science station, the (hopefully full) fuel depot, and a space tug docked at the very pinacle. Loot, and lots of it. Just one problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo open docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe drifted silently back to the Memory and let some ideas run through his head. As it currently stood, the Memory of Tomorrow had two open docking rings. The problem is both were too close to the power armatures and the solar arrays for him to safely dock anything. The science station would fit nicely between the Rock Spear and the Memory\u0027s main habitat, and maybe the small shuttle would too, but the rest would need to be secured somewhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould he move the two docking rings? They had a plentiful supply of foam sealant, and he was pretty sure he could weld the inside hatch of the docking rings in place. If he could get them free without causing too much damage, he could even put one of them in place over the hab modules airlock. It would limit their access in and out of the ship, but if he did this right it wouldn\u0027t matter in the long run. The most difficult part would be convincing Sieta to move her court into the Rock Spear until he was done with the cutting and the welding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst order of business was to set up a station keeping orbit. No reason to let their quarry drift away from them. This was a task the Memory\u0027s primitive computer was more than capable of handling, especially with the telemetry data fed to them from the Seconee. Once he had both that and his royal diplomacy out of the way, he got to the hard work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPermanently closing the inside of the old docking port was easy. They were designed to seal from the inside, so it was just a simple matter of welding them permanently in place. That task took close to an hour, fully suited minus the EVA pack, just in case he did something very wrong and punched through the hull. Once the welds were complete, he fully vented the habitat and moved back outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving the ring itself proved to be much simpler than he expected. He just released a few bolts with the PGT, the drill, and it floated away on its own. The ring that is. He stuffed the bolts into a suit pocket, then maneuvered the bulky mechanism towards its new home.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180807_ksp0500_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002273.00\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180807_ksp0500_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220180807_ksp0503_MoT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.50\u0022 height=\u0022668\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20180807_ksp0503_MoT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting the ring secured into place presented a new issue. Where it had previously been secured using bolts driven into pre-tapped holes in the outer shell of the hab module, the new location had no such support. He could of course drill his own holes and attach nuts to the other end of the bolts. The downside to that plan was it required him to breach both the outer and inner layers of the hab module\u0027s pressure vessel. He could seal the bolts holes with foam, of course, but it just seemed slightly risky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only other alternative was to weld the docking ring directly to the outer shell of the ship. He wasn\u0027t entirely certain that would provide enough strength to keep docked ships from ripping the ring and the outer skin of the Memory away, so he decided to avoid such a weak construction. And the last thing he wanted was for a docked ship to break free and tumble along their side while under thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end he drove bolts the entire way through the hull, secured from the inside, the outer ring welded down, and everything sealed completely with foam. This seemingly simple task took the better part of a day to complete, but in the end he had moved the docking ring and had a fully working hatch inside of it. Unfortunately he had another of these to move and reattach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo days after the initial rendezvous and the work was done. Nobody had tried to contact them from the station, and surely any living kerbals would have noticed a pirate ship hovering off their port bow for the last couple days. Something was nagging him about the whole situation. Who had been here in the past? Had they gone back to Kerbin? Were they still here somewhere? Were they trapped on the surface of Duna? Were they dead? What if they were dead, but not dead, laying in wait on this dimly lit graveyard of a station? He could really use some backup right about now, an extra hand, but Sieta had to stay with the Memory. He couldn\u0027t trust her with so much as a stick to use for a weapon anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe locked his helmet seal and started the depressurization cycle on the airlock. Then checked his helmet seal again. Still locked. The cycle completed and the door opened. He nearly jumped out of his suit when he caught his own reflection in his faceplate. He blinked and it was gone. Were reflections supposed to do that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was dark outside, but it was usually dark. Hallock double checked that he had what he needed, a drill, some equipment to bypass the station\u0027s locks, his EVA pack, and his shovel. One last check of the helmet seal and he shoved off into the void.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe situation at Seconee was unchanged. Shuttle lit up like the Sun, darkness everywhere else. He checked the windows once more, this time shining his lights inside, seeing only his own reflection looking back. Empty darkness, cold and alone. If there was anyone here they were hiding exceedingly well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe decided it was best to enter at the point furthest from the fuel depot. The lander there looked roughly the same age as the station itself. Simple, just enough room for two kerbals and their gear on the inside. He was surprised when the outer airlock\u0027s controls lit up, still working after however many years. He was not surprised when it refused to let him enter. Thankfully this model of airlock, as all do, had a physical bypass. A small handle which could be rotated to vent the air and release the lock. He inserted a forked tool into his drill, put it to the bypass handle, and started it spinning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airlock controls had shown an atmosphere, which was draining slowly as the handle rotated. His mind inserted a slow \u0022hisssssss\u0022 sound, there was no way he could hear it through his suit. Not over the low-frequency \u0022whirrrr\u0022 of the drill. The PGT. The whatever. He felt a small tug as the bypass handle hit its limit and the drill tried to torque him around. The controls showed the airlock fully vented, but the low hiss sound was still there. There inside his head. He checked his helmet seal again, just to be sure, and pushed the outer door inwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmall pieces of debris drifted into the void as he moved inside. The door closed with a deep \u0022tong\u0022 sound, the automatic latch locking it in place. Inside was dark aside from the red glow of the controls near the interior hatch. They showed error codes and refused to auto cycle the airlock, angry over his forced entry. He spent minutes poking at them with his mittened hands before he successfully cleared the errors and started a manual repress. The hiss returned in force, growing louder as a new atmosphere filled the room.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a loud clack the red glow changed to green. Equal pressure on both sides of the interior hatch. He gave the door handle a spin with his free hand, holding on to the grabs with his other, and pushed in to the lander. More darkness. More silence. The pressure inside was less than that of his suit, but still within the safety margin. He decided to keep his suit on anyway, hanging up only his jetpack. What kind of pirate would take off his armor during a boarding action? More dust and debris were meandering about inside, their trajectories elucidated by his helmet lights. A disassembled EVA suit was secured near the hatch, its helmet rocking back and forth slowly. The lander\u0027s controls were dark, its computer shut down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly his helmet lights flickered and went out. Cold crawled it way up his spine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lah\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA whisper as soft as an explosion. He spun around, making sure he was still alone. No one. He quickly glanced through the window. A ghost, an old kerbal with white hair and wrinkled skin, looking back at him with fear in its eyes. His reflection. He shook these demons from his head and regained some composure. What sort of space pirate was afraid of ghosts? This was just his mind losing a battle with itself, and he was in control, not the other way around. He found the light switch and flicked it on, flicked it off, flicked it back on. Nothing happened. A thump from his fist and one light briefly blinked to life before fading back to darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe opened the overhead hatch and was immediately blinded by the light from the shuttlecraft. The inside was clean, very clean, very white, and very new. Almost too new. The fit and finish were better than anything he had seen in his life. No loose parts, no rushed patches, no stains, no sticky notes stuck anywhere. Like something out of a science fiction film.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd still no kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Keh\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere it was again, the chill, that whisper. Forget it. Just your imagination, inserting sounds into a perfectly silent environment. Hallucinations. Not hallucinations. Just nerves, starved of input, firing off on their own. Gentle reminders of sounds lost. The brain forcing an issue, demanding to know why the nerves have left their posts. The nerves protesting as best they can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next hatch was closed, but only loosely. Not secured. He pulled it towards him and drifted into the unlit space. A tube, round, small, no obstructions along its walls, passing through the lander\u0027s fuel tank. At the other end another hatch, also closed but also unsecured. He drifted into this new lander\u0027s cockpit, pulling the hatch below him closed and locking it. The light from the shuttle grew dim and went out completely as the hatch slipped shut.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarkness. Darker than before, his eyes having been blinded by the light. Flashes as random particles collided with his retinas. Nerves, firing in the absence of noise. Lights where there were none. Sounds where there were none. Sensory deprivation at its peak. He blinked, fumbled for his helmet lights, only to find they had been on. He was now in complete darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Weh\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe jumped again. That was no mild hallucination, something was talking to him. He turned his lights back on, moved, and suddenly a kerbal in an EVA suit was floating centimeters away from him! A scream!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pushed back violently, quickly, moving back down, back towards the lower hatch. His attacker crumpled into itself, drifted away, empty. The kerbal was his own reflection. His mind, twisting his senses inward upon themselves. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump. Quickly. His heart. Did kerbals have hearts? He clearly did, and his was racing. Crawling one step further up his throat with every beat. Sounds, blood, echoing through his body and into his empty ears. Thump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fearless space pirate reached out carefully toward the suit, tapping at it, pulling his hand back quickly as it started to spin. The helmet came loose, tumbled about. Empty. Just like this ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust like his sanity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe reached for his own helmet seal. Still locked. Only two more modules to go. He could do this. He had to do this. What was wrong with him? Nothing. This was perfectly normal. He\u0027d been confined for a year in close quarters with a munatic, a completely crazy kerbal who had convinced herself she was a queen. And not just any queen, but The Queen. He hadn\u0027t fought through decades of solitude on the M\u00FCn just to finally lose his mind here. No. No. No. He was in control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis lander\u0027s controls were just as dead as those in the first. He could attend to them later, once the ship was cleared. This was just an empty ship. This was just an empty station. There were not hordes of dead kerbals waiting behind the next door to kill him. There were no such things as zombies. No such things as ghosts. He pressed on into the next module, opening both hatches, one in, one out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore darkness greeted him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was just a regular old habitation module. Four bunks, four lockers, one airlock, two hatches. The tried and true hitchhiker. It was dark, and thin shafts of sunlight streamed in through the windows as the ship orbited underneath him. There was considerably more debris here. Dust, cloth fibers, scraps of papers, broken bits of pencil, a boot. One of the bunks had broken free and was drifting about aimlessly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe glanced through a window just in time to see Ike slipping in front of the Sun. The ship descended into total darkness. His sanity fled further away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Keh\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething pushed against his legs! He kicked reflexively, spun around, and kicked some more. He was fumbling with his lights when it hit him in the gut, strongly, and sent him spinning towards the window. His helmet slammed into the bulkhead, ringing in the violence, but he caught himself. He reached behind his back for the shovel, braced for another attack, ready to respond in kind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third attack never came.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis lights were back on. He wasn\u0027t sure how they had gone. The helmet was still latched, he had made sure of that, and turned to face his attacker. Nothing. Just the loose bunk, now drifting about with more force. It left a cloud of dust and debris in its wake, more scattering with each soft impact. He looked to the window once more, watched the distant and growing formlessness that was Ike. A green speck flickered in his vision, moving across the impossible darkness. The darkness was his mind, the speck his fleeting sanity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis attacker was his own mind. He took a few deep breaths, slowed his heart, and moved upwards once again. A short tunnel connected the habitat to the lab, various controls for the station\u0027s power systems crammed into its walls. The computers here had all failed in some cycle long past, but the physical control systems still worked. The docking radar still worked. Not much else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lack of lights and power was due to a long series of tripped breakers. Climate control, life systems, access controls, and the docking aids had remained online, but ancillary systems such as flight control, lighting, and the general purpose electrical bus had failed over the long years. He carefully worked through them, holding his breath as each system powered back up and showed as green on the board.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last two breakers were for the lights in this control tunnel and the power systems in the science lab. He flipped them both simultaneously. The hatch to the lab was painted a rich, bright red. A yellow note was stuck to it. He reached out and pulled it close enough to read.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do Not Open.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo not open? Not a chance. This was it. With the computers down, the only way he would know for sure that the fuel depot still had fuel was to read its gauges. He hadn\u0027t seen any on the outside, meaning they had to be in the docking ports. And those were only one accessible through the lab.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lab he apparently wasn\u0027t supposed to open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could be in there that would stop him anyway? These \u0022ghosts\u0022 hadn\u0027t done anything except run up his heart rate, and that was just his mind giving in to sensory deprivation. If there were space zombies surely he would have heard them by now, or would have spotted them through the windows. And besides, zombies are slow. If they even exist.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, this entire misadventure was just pure nonsense. A manifestation of an undercooked mind. This note wasn\u0027t going to stop him. It was probably a joke of some sort, left by the previous crew to mess with their replacements. He was the Space Pirate Captain Hallock. Nothing could stand in his way. Freedom lay on the other side of that door. The freedom to make his own decisions, to be what he was meant to be, to go his own direction. If he backed down now, he was as good as dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFear is the domain of the weak, and weak he was not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was the Captain. He was in control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe unsealed the hatch, pushed on it, and followed it in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven before he was through he could hear a new noise. A soft sound, not quite bubbling, not really crackling, but nothing his mind could connect to. It was just wrong sounding. This was interrupted by a growing hiss, a low rumble, and then a world-ending roar. Arms of smoke leapt forth, ghosts in the dust and haze. Visions of kerbals long gone, their arms reaching down from their heavenly graves to pull into their trap. Screeches, screams, tearing through his ears! There was no silence! No silence here! No redemption for one so lost as he!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe reflexively raised his shovel, swinging at these spectres, driving away his demons. The swipes and thrusts caused him to tumble, to drift further into the mist. Each parry brought him closer to his doom, each riposte further from his mind. He was spinning now, his motions becoming more agitated and disorientation took over. The blade of his shovel made contact, scratching here, smashing there, each time setting him tumbling a different direction. One particularly strong swing hit something important. The lights flickered, started strobing, ghosts flashed in front of his eyes for one instant, only to be replaced with another the next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a loud pop at some distant end of his universe. A flash of orange, some small cloud going up in a blaze. Fire! The glow was gone nearly as fast as it had appeared, just a thin blue halo remaining. Then another cloud lit up bright, burned quickly, faded to blue. Hallock reached out with his shovel towards a wall to slow his tumble, bisecting a ghost in the process. Another hazy arm reached towards him as he drifted back. He waved it away. This was serious, no time for this flailing about nonsense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow best to deal with fire on an unknown space station? He couldn\u0027t let it burn into the fuel. He needed that fuel. Vent the atmosphere? Probably. He could open the airlock in the hab module if he could prop the pressure hatches open. The not-really-bubbling sound had been growing louder. The strobing lights continued, which he recognized as some sort of fire alert. Terrible design. Another bubble of flame billowed from orange to blue and disappeared. Was there a vent in here? He looked around briskly while bracing himself against a rack of science equipment, spotting no obvious doors into the vacuum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sudden bright flash caught his attention an instant before a large projectile came hurtling towards him. He raised his shovel to block it, and the blade flew violently back into the glass of his faceplate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022TON\u0022!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis helmet rang and his suit slammed into the lower hatch, tumbling yet again. His body was still inside, but his mind was on the edge of chaos. Whispers, louder than artillery! That cold shivering embrace again! A fire ballooned out of control at the other end of the lab, burping forth from the source of this mortal threat. The strobing lights flashed their last, his world descended once more into darkness, illuminated only by orange and blue spheres. Droplets of fire rained from the heavens, falling down towards him. Towards the station. Only one thing to do. He sealed the red hatch and pushed off into the burning maelstrom. He had to extinguish its source or he would burn with it. \u0022Or they will BURN.\u0022 Flames licked at his arms as he sailed into certain death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that was when he saw it. Small, round, green. Lit only by the flames it belched forth. It stopped as he approached, the lab now in total darkness. He slapped at his helmet and the lights flashed back to life. It was right in front of him! Right there! Grinning!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the mystery goo sang to him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe screamed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe darkness screamed back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was no mere salvage, no wayward vessel abandoned by its gods. He had come here expecting to take what he needed with no opposition, to do as he fancied. And yet these craft were no simple husks, no empty tins. Inside each were the souls of those who had built them, those who had piloted them, and the scars of whatever darkness had claimed them. Where one, so went the other. He had come expecting to brush that darkness aside, to win over these spoils.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe darkness had won.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe goo smiled at him, cooed softly, then cocked its head to the side questioningly. It didn\u0027t have a head, not exactly, but he understood what it was trying to say. He lowered his shovel and the goo shifted slightly, ejecting a small cloud and moving towards him. It landed with all the gloopy grace one would expect from an amorphous green blob, attaching itself to his upper arm and sliding up to his helmet. In such close contact he could now hear that the not-quite-bubbling sound was more of a cute gurgling. It let out a sharp squawk before belching forth another sphere of fire, followed by yet more soft cooing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe held up his shovel to look at the goo in the blade\u0027s reflection. It seemed happy, perched there on his shoulder, and wasn\u0027t obviously trying to get through his suit. He pulled at his helmet latch anyway. Best to be safe. He poked at the goo with a mittened finger, trying to push it slightly to the side, and it laughed playfully at him. It wasn\u0027t dissolving his suit away either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would seem Hallock had found himself a pet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside Ike finished its eclipse, and sunlight came streaming into the lab. The darkness withdrew, and the lights came back on. Dimly, at first, but then brighter. Dark scorches marred the walls by a rack of mystery goo canisters, undoubtedly where his new pet had originated. The last of the globes of fire extinguished themselves. The deathly silence abated. The ghosts applauded in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe now he could get back to work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n--\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavigation: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/126972-forgotten-space-program/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=4000967\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENext Post\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-07T14:11:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2021 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-03T10:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome!
