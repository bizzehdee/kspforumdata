This new Kylon has proven itself capable of lifting up to 19 tons of cargo into LKO. Weight reductions and wing optimizations mean that it now flies significantly better in atmosphere as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CGX5iK5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CGX5iK5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w71Elko.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w71Elko.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets up to around 1400-1450 m/s before the RAPIERS switch mode on their own (love that feature).

I do have SSTOs that would have been able to carry the weight of your standard space station parts into orbit (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65968-Thunderlane-Mk-5-Becausethe-old-one-needed-an-upgrade\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65968-Thunderlane-Mk-5-Becausethe-old-one-needed-an-upgrade\u003C/a\u003E) but for the longest time I was unable to design a craft with a large enough cargo bay. The Kylon solves that problem quite nicely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(note that canards at the back of the cargo bay have been moved slightly back since I took the picture)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6JlfdUa.png\u0022 alt=\u00226JlfdUa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cCiZlQB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cCiZlQB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is very stable on reentry and handles very well in atmo once most of the weight is gone. The craft has slightly more Liquid fuel than it needs in order to get into orbit, this was a deliberate decision, as I sometimes undershoot KSC and I prefer to have the cross-range capability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tip for you if you if you want to fly it: The center of mass moves a further back than i the center of lift once you are in orbit. To correct this, after you have done your deorbit burn, transfer the liquid fuel in the wing engine segments forward (but still in their wing segments), and then transfer all oxidizer into the foremost tank in the middle. This unevenly distributes the oxidizer among your engines, but by this point you shouldn\u0027t be running on rocket mode anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecoming in for landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0SZkBLf.png\u0022 alt=\u00220SZkBLf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/332vmaD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022332vmaD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand landed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6ggq7QI.png\u0022 alt=\u00226ggq7QI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with all of the other SSTOs that I have shared, the fuel is pumped in such a way that it first drains symmetrically from the middle into the wings, preventing the COM from moving around much during flight and making it very stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI admit that it doesn\u0027t look much like the real Skylon, what with the wings being as large as they are. In my defense, it did look a lot more like the Skylon in the early versions, but the aesthetics had to be compromised in order to make it work, and I never got around to changing the name (in retrospect it wasn\u0027t that original a name anyway). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole thing is a Subassembly, since I find it easier to fit the craft onto a payload than putting the payload in (annoying tendency to not attach where you want it to inside the cargo bay). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome specs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart count: 201\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines: 8 RAPIERS, 2 Turbojets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload: over 21 tons \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: toggle Turbojets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: toggle RAPIERS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: switch mode on RAPIERS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: toggle some intakes (12/20)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: toggle all intakes (20)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart clipping was not enabled for the construction of this craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThere are no lifting surfaces hidden inside the body of the craft.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I did have the Stock Rebalance mod when I made it this makes very little difference, since it only means that the adapters and nosecones have fuel in them which I tweaked out anyway.
