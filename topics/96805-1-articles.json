(I could do it without both limits, grr)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I need to optimize the way to make this orbit happen, I\u0027m thinking specifically on the normal burn to match planes. With a required AP of 3.096mm and a PE of 70km, would it pay me in terms of Dv to make a big orbit of say 3 million meters circular, then do the inclination match and then change the PE to meet the requirements? I can\u0027t make maneuver nodes yet, so I have to do this \u0022seat of the pants\u0022, and I\u0027m NOT even considering trying to combine an AP and NML burn to match planes and AP at the same time, I want to do it in steps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m making the NML burn by making Kerbin the center of focus and lining up the AN and DN of the desired orbit, then burning when my ship crosses that plane.

You can save a LOT of dV if you launch into (roughly) the correct plane. Your tactic of lining up the AN/DN markers on the target orbit is a good start--do that prior to launch, so that you can time your launch for just a couple minutes prior to crossing the target orbit plane. Manually set your navball to \u0022orbit\u0022 mode before you launch, rather than the default \u0022surface\u0022 mode. Launch as normal, but rather than doing your gravity turn to the east (90 degrees, for an initial orbit of 0 degrees inclination), do your gravity turn directly onto ~27 degrees or ~153 degrees. It won\u0027t be perfect, but that intimidating and dV-eating plane change will be a piddly low-single-digit handful of degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip: trying to steer at an odd angle like 153 degrees is nigh-impossible to do well (manual piloting in stock anyway) if your craft\u0027s \u0027natural\u0027 axis is pointed North-South or East-West. You have to control two axes at once while eyeballing single-degree precision on a navball that\u0027s barely suited to 10-degree increments. Much better to launch, roll (while still vertical) so that your ship\u0027s natural axis is pointed to 27 or 153 degrees using the digital display at the bottom of the navball, and then your gravity turn is a pure pitch maneuver, while steering to stay on heading is pure yaw (and maintaining attitude so that those two activities stay completely separate is roll\u0027s job). And staying on heading is made vastly easier by using that accurate-to-one-degree digital display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love molniya and tundra contracts. Once you get the hang of them, they\u0027re dirt-simple and pay outlandishly well for the time and trouble invested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
