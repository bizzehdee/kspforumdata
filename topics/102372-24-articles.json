Tourism Plus will not accept a periapsis from 70000-74999m as sufficiently orbital as the contracts stipulate 75000m.  How about leaving them up there for the 1hour requirement?

Get orbital then flip retrograde and bring your periapsis to 69999 or less just before you hit the waypoint.

Not likely in your case, but I have also had this happen when moving vessels between docking locations on my stations too, as my pilot undocked to move a ship, while the tourists were on the station.\n\nIf you break the 75000m periapsis requirement, the contract will reset as well.  I\u0027ve done this by initiating reentry before the timer ran out.  Correcting afterwards was too late because pe dropped and the timer had already reset despite the ship never leaving orbit.\n\nIf I had to guess, I would say that physics time warp caused your vessel to glitch below 75km and the timer reset.
