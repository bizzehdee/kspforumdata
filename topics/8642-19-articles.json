I left the handling a little twitchy since its small and this way the Bigtrak stays as the big stable rover. Its most stable on the mun around 25-30 m/s, any faster and it turns into a big white foozball bouncing around. With the command pod force it\u0027s capable of popping wheelies in low gravity, and it can be drove on 3 wheels in most places which makes for some fun stunt driving. Reminds me of how the ambulances in GTA are top heavy but always mange to fllip back over on to their wheels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Bigtrak still does not have working brake lights or works with the Puddle Jumper. I spent over 3 hours tweaking things but still no go, its going to take a re-model. There\u0027s nothing on the PJ model that intersects the airlock but I think the game may be drawing a full box around the outermost parts of the Puddle Jumper\u0027s mesh which would then intersect the airlock. The upper rocket ducting will need to be lowered and maybe the nozzels moved more towards the back. While messing around trying to fix that I even put the airlock 10 meters above the hatch and it still didn\u0027t like it, for that matter neither did the Kerbals that fell from the sky thinking it was EVA time. But fixing that is a project for next weekend.
