So, this will be a long post and there is no TL;DR about this. If you want to comment with any degree of knowledge on the matter, you\u0027ll probably have to suck it up and read this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhy do we have WNTS?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is to prevent redundancy of suggestions. It doesn\u0027t forward the idea pool any to suggest something that has been beaten to death. Without WNTS, we would likely see lots of the same threads offering no new viewpoints and ideas, as well as highly controversial ideas which devolve into arguing and waste moderators\u0027 time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhat\u0027s wrong with WNTS?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we get to the problems. WNTS is inherently flawed for several reasons. First off is the ****-like enforcement of it by many moderators. Now, am I blaming them for WNTS\u0027 problems? For the most part, no. Rather, I\u0027m stating that moderators blindly adhering to and enforcing WNTS further dulls the list\u0027s effectiveness and, instead of keeping new ideas flowing, simply scares off people rather than allowing them to share their thoughts, even if it\u0027s a better take on something which has not been shared before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good example of this is N-Body Physics. This is usually talked about in reference to Lagrange Points. Now, I\u0027m sitting on a good idea for how to do that without being computer melting but I have not yet posted it since it would be a waste of my time. I\u0027ll bet money, name your price, that it will be locked, optimistically, in a week max, more realistically closer to 48-72 hours. Now, does that further good discussion on things? I certainly don\u0027t see how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EHow do we fix WNTS?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my eyes, it\u0027s simple. First, the list needs to be updated more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EUpdating\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource mining are currently on the list as not to be in KSP 1.0. Is that correct, almost certainly not. For the longest time Multiplayer was on the list as not to be in KSP 1.0. It was only after the devs realized how much the community really demanded it when KMP came out that they changed their minds. Before then, they would have never known since the WNTS list is enforced harsher than the forum rules in some cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESmarter Enforcement\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlindly locking threads with titles from WNTS does not enforce well, it turns the list from a way to guide suggestions into an iron curtain. Again, am I saying this is the moderators\u0027 fault, no. WNTS needs to be enforced smartly and the thread needs to make that clear so people aren\u0027t scared off. If a suggestion offers and alternative way of doing something which has not been said before, it should be encouraged to keep going, as it is not going around the same path and it encourages new angles on the same subject. Yes, it may create some repetition, but it will allow people to explore more options rather than being stomped on for addressing a WNTS topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBetter Derail Control\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, if a suggestion discussion gets derailed, it\u0027s usually locked after 1-2 warnings. That, however, only serves to bury a potentially good suggestion. I would encourage the moderation staff to be a bit more aggressive in stopping derails and resort to thread locking less than they do, and this goes for not just Suggestions forum, but for the majority of the boards, but that is a discussion to be had at a different time and place. I firmly believe that if a thread becomes derailed, especially a suggestion thread, it is more worthwhile to the community as a whole if that discussion can be brought back on track rather than be shut down and, as a result, buried underneath ages of threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDistinction between what not to suggest, and what not to discuss\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may seem trivial, but this is an extremely important thing to explain. Just because an item has been suggested to death the same way does not mean you\u0027ve seen it all in context to that suggestion. Rather, it\u0027s a good thing to encourage people to share different ideas on how something could be done, rather than simply saying, \u0027this has been suggested like this twenty times, so that\u0027s all we\u0027ll allow.\u0027 Again, we come back to my Lagrange points example. My suggestion involves limiting it to a 2-3 body problem where the third body, usually a moon, only comes into play when you get fairly close. I have yet to see any thread suggest using a 2-3 body physics system and that\u0027s a good example of a tangential suggestion which should not only be allowed, but encouraged, as it refined ideas to where it is agreeable to most, especially the developers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESuggestions Tracker\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is to the benefit of everyone, especially the devs. We need a suggestions tracker, even if it\u0027s just an actively maintained list stickied here on the forums. In the latter case, I have the time and am willing to volunteer it to create and maintain such a list. The list would include any and all suggestions which have garnered positive discussion and/or are very simple items which are really just things that are no brainers. This would create a place where people could look to find the hot discussions about different ideas and read through the discussions about others, while also giving the devs a quick place to go to find all the good suggestions the forums have offered up and review the relevant discussions without having to go forum wading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EUpvote, Downvote\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere needs to be a clear way to approve or disapprove of a suggestion. While there is the \u0027Rate This Thread\u0027 button, that simply shows an average opinion of those that have voted. Even a simple poll would work. Right now, the only good way is to post in the thread, which, if a person has nothing constructive to add to the discussion, yet supports the idea, is a waste of thread space. There should be an easy way to approve or disapprove of a post without cluttering the thread if you do not have any refinements to the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGood Suggestion Guidelines/Template\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, there should be a template/guideline for posting a suggestion, and this should include creating the aforementioned poll. As it is now, there are long, well thought out suggestions, and short, simple, sometimes not thought out suggestions. Creating a simple template which could be used by people would help make suggestions easier to read, more organized, and also help out pretty much everything that has been said above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it\u0027s about time somebody took the time to say all this, so let discussion commence.
