I already had this problem with my initial campaign on the day of the game\u0027s launch, and after messing with launch locations, the only solution I found was to delete the campaign and launch craft in a new save. However, I think I\u0027ll just keep this save around until a future patch addresses this bug. I\u0027m glad the community can aid in developing KSP2 by reporting bugs and gameplay qualms. I wish the devs the best and assure all that I am not complaining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
