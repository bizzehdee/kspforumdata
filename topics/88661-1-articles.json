It\u0027s based on the altitude at which the velocity an aircraft would need, in order to maintain deflection lift, reaches orbital velocities sufficient to maintain altitude via the centrifugal component of that trajectory.

What would you consider to be your \u0022Kerman Line\u0022? That is, when do you consider yourself safely in space, launching from KSC? It\u0027s hard to remember the exact altitude at which the atmosphere ends, and the game considers you to be \u0022in space\u0022 (69,078m, according to the wiki). Do you have some other number you use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027ve usually aimed to get my PE up to about 75km minimum over Kerbin, to consider it a \u0022safe\u0022 orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T14:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerman line should be at 70 km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T14:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E70 km.
