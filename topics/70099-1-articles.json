Convert meters/second to meters/hour by multiplying by 3600, then convert to mph by multiplying by 1/1609 , giving you a conversion factor of 2.23. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a check you can ask google for most simple cases and wolfram alpha for more complex stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"How2FoldSoup","CreatedById":82003,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T02:56:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes that is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to unit analysis...If for whatever reason you felt like converting those units to anything else here is how you would do it with only googling the meter-foot conversion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1m is 3.2 feet so we can say we move 1 meter per 3.2 feet in 1 second so (1m/s)*((3.2ft/s)/(1m/s))) which just is 3.2ft/s since it\u0027s being divided by 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we can change that to hours by asking how many seconds in a minute and minutes in an hour. So there are 60seconds/minute and 60 minutes/hour or 3600 seconds/hour(60*60)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027d get (1m/s)*(3.2ft/s)*(3600 seconds/hour) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally we have to find how many feet are in a mile which is 1mile/5280 feet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso you would have (1m/s)*(3.2ft/s)*(3600s/h)*(1mile/5280ft) which gives you 2.18miles/h.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see how all the units cancel from left to right and you are left with miles/hour. Also it looks like google\u0027s conversion is a little off \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this makes sense!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit:Clarity for miles\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GalaxiesFinestToday","CreatedById":60035,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T03:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.
