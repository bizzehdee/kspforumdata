No-one\u0027s entitled or irresponsible, they\u0027re just confused at the term \u0027dependency\u0027 because, as I said, they\u0027re not what people usually refer to as dependencies. Yes, you need them in order for KSPRC to function as intended, true, but it\u0027s also completely possible to not use some of KSPRCs settings and textures (for whatever reason. Personal preference, memory limit etc). None of us are suggesting that Proot provide bespoke installation instructions for every person, because if we have all the mods required for KSPRC, chances are we know how to pick and choose the bits we want. Also, chances are that we realise this will mean an incomplete KSPRC and we should be fine that.\u003Cp\u003EProot has undeniably done a fantastic job, but I and several others, think a clearer description about the \u0027dependencies\u0027 required for KSPRC would be appreciated.

What you (and others here) may not know or understand is that Proot has multiple settings and file changes throughout the whole of the compilation, it\u0027s not JUST visual enhancements...so installing only parts of the pack is a little more difficult than it may seem. For instance, Proot has created settings for ATM, EVE and Texture Replacer. Installing a different mod or suits or what have you will require one to change these configs. Should Proot be responsible for that? Should he have to walk people through how to do that or should they take responsibility to figure it out themselves?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to know how to mod the atmosphere to be more \u0022realistic\u0022.

IIRC, Proot had in an earlier post, stated the Blue atmo comes from the RSS pack. If you want to modify it, check settings in the RSS folder in GameData or go to the RSS forum and figure it out from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Correction, the Blue horizons come from the RSS pack, not the atmo. I believe the Atmo is controlled via EVE and would have to be modified in EVE.

Only the RGB color value. I don\u0027t know any mod for this game that can change the saturation or the contrast for the sky. That change is locked to the RGB color and some kind of transparency value for the gradients in RSS, the only mod i know who can change some type of value in that area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Proot","CreatedById":98932,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T15:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ignath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ignath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFYI to all: Just installed Texture Replacer v1.5 and everything within the KSPRC pack seems to continue to function correctly. \u003Cp\u003EI also noticed the changes in TR from 1.4 to 1.5 have decreased the load on my RAM a bit...my install used to run about 3.1G, now down to 2.7G.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was my real reason to come here now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the reminder!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003ENEWS:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#b22222;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETR has been updated to 1.5 providing some memory savings, please, if you want to update to the new version, just avoid the \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022EnvMap\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#b22222;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E folder and merge the rest of the new version with your installed version.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignath","CreatedById":77210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T15:17:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlad I could be of assistance Sir!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castun","CreatedById":4581,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T15:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ignath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ignath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYep, same is happening with the Soundtrack enhancements you\u0027ve added.
