But they won\u0027t last long, and they are HEAVY, so don\u0027t rely on them. Each capsule contains few of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Contain oxygen regenerator, which could be used to reprocess some of CO2 back into oxygen. Consumes a considerable amount of electricity, so be prepared to supply it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - From now on, when kerbal goes onto EVA, he takes RCS and oxygen from vessel\u0027s tanks. Upon return, any excess resources are returned to vessel tanks. \u003Cstrong\u003EBe careful\u003C/strong\u003E - if there is no RCS onboard, kerbal might not be able to return to the vessel!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - If you\u0027ll forget about that, system will notify you once oxygen level lowers below caution or warning threshholds. These thresholds could be modified on per-vessel basis, by default they are 25% and 5% of onboard capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - GUI added to just about any screen, which displays current O2/CO2 levels. In the Map and Tracking Station views, you can view that information for any vessel without having to switch to it. There is also summary screen which list all your vessels and essential ECLSS-related information about them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Package includes configuration file for ModuleManager that adds life support-related resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Package also includes tanks for both oxygen and CO2, and regenerator, cortesy of awesome BobCat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - and the KILLER FEATURE: ALL OF THAT is happenning AT ALL TIMES, FOR ALL VESSELS, INCLUDING INACTIVE, even when you are at the Space Center, or Tracking Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://bitbucket.org/asmi/ksp/downloads/LifeSupportMod.1.0.15.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://bitbucket.org/asmi/ksp/downloads/LifeSupportMod.1.0.15.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstallation instructions are as usual - unpack contents into your KSP root folder.
