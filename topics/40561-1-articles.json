In his latest video (at this time) of KSP, I noticed he had his very own customized flag (link at the bottom of the thread).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then got the urge to make such a flag on my own, but no matter how much I tried, the game did not allow it. I have the same dimension as the other flags, the same format, but when I enter the game to take a look at it, my flag is turned into a red question-mark. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis really bores me, so if there is anyone out there who know a way around this, please let me know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn behalf of the planet Kerbit, I thank you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UUs4br3aZLU0sOEM-3n0-6xQ\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atreiu","CreatedById":76950,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T05:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust create a new directory into GameData folder (name it as you want), create under this directory an other one named \u0022Flags\u0022, and under it, put your flag, a 256x160 png \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bajazz","CreatedById":77127,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T14:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Atreiu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Atreiu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust create a new directory into GameData folder (name it as you want), create under this directory an other one named \u0022Flags\u0022, and under it, put your flag, a 256x160 png \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunatly, this didn\u0027t work either, the flag I customized still shows up as a question-mark-flag in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helion1979","CreatedById":76436,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T17:16:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI looked for the other flags in the games by doing a file search.
