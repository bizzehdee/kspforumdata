Here\u0027s a list of the ones I enjoy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalAlarmClock is essential. I use it to set an alarm for sphere of influence changes or maneuver nodes and set it to disable Warp mode when it goes off. No more missing your nodes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb is nice. It functions as a sort of autopilot. You program maneuvers, rendezvous, launches, etc. with it and it calculates the necessary actions and takes them. HOWEVER--don\u0027t use this one unless you can already do most of it yourself. If you enjoy KSP for the feeling of accomplishment you get by safely launching a new vessel, or arriving at a new planet, don\u0027t use MechJeb. It\u0027s easy to let it do all the work for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupposedly KSPX is discontinued, but I like it. It\u0027s developed by someone who is now a member of the Core Team, so the parts integrate extremely well with the stock parts (if I remember correctly, some stock parts started out as a part of KSPX). Mainly I enjoy it for the smaller or larger fuel tanks/etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re into station building/resource management, Kethane is fun. It adds a whole new resource to the game, Kethane, which you have to find using scanners and mine. This is an entirely new element to the game, dramatically changing the gameplay. Now you\u0027re launching vessels with mining equipment and extremely heavy landers and such. The benefit Kethane gives you is that it can be converted into the standard fuel types. This means you can build outposts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe B9 parts are gorgeous and add whole new size classes of stuff you can build, but I ended up removing it because my slow laptop HDD takes long enough to load the game as it is!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, no links here.
