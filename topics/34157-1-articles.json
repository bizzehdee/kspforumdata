The design he used could accelerate at 153 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E and that design didn\u0027t seem to me to be the best design. So what I did was focus on weight and thrust to come up with the best design. Now I didn\u0027t test the \u0022good citizen\u0022 method but rather the cheating method (the one being demonstrated in the video). Doing so I decided I would need to use the lightest computer command moduel, the best SAS moduel that is about the same size of the command part, smallest fuel tank, and the most powerful rocket engine. This is the design here. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=154440031\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=154440031\u003C/a\u003E Now keep in mind this is all stock no mods to it and only using the infinite fuel cheat. Now on to the testing and math portion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest and math portion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there is two possibilities here. One being we will do the hard way being we stay with Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and close to the surface. The other is we do it all in space. We are also assuming that all values in the Kerbin system is similar or equal to those in real life. So we will start with the path in atmosphere. After some testing it was found that the spacecraft\u0027s average acceleration was 243.2 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E and the drag made it lose about 4.9 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E of acceleration. Now drag will come into play later. The good news is the rocket was able to fly perfectly straight which means all forces are on one axis (the y to be exact) so we don\u0027t need to do anything to the acceleration so we can skip straight to figuring out how long it will take to get to the speed of light. The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s. Using basic physics the equation we would use is t=V/a so lets plug in those numbers. 299,792,458 m/s / 243.2 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E = 1,232,699.3s which after doing some conversions we find that it would take \u003Cstrong\u003E14 days 6 hours 28 minutes and 48 seconds\u003C/strong\u003E to reach the speed of light. I don\u0027t know about you but I wouldn\u0027t want to wait that long nor do this within atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space we don\u0027t have to deal with gravity, friction, constant threat of running into something, or poor engine performance. So lets go back to that original number we started out with 243.2 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. We know that gravity and friction in atmosphere are both exact opposites of our forward acceleration so we simply need to combine the two values and add it to our forward acceleration. Kerbin\u0027s gravity is 9.82 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E and friction was 4.9 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E we would get 14.72 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E(I\u0027m not doing sig figs because I\u0027m looking for exact values) so adding that to the forward acceleration would give us 257.9 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. Once again we do as we did before t=V/a. 299,792,458 m/s / 257.9 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E = 1,162,436.8 s and with the help of conversions we get a total of \u003Cstrong\u003E13 days 10 hours 53 minutes 54 seconds\u003C/strong\u003E to reach the speed of light. That is only a 5.70% increase from within atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing nothing but stock and the infinite fuel cheat you can reach the speed of light using this design in \u003Cstrong\u003E13 days 10 hours 53 minutes 54 seconds\u003C/strong\u003E at best. Now there maybe a better design but this is the one I found best. I want you guys to test this and see if using only stock if we can possibly reduce that number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAll of the above was done through the Phemoral Space Program (PSP) results may vary.
