The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day and try it. All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it\u0027s going to hurt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is, it\u0027s going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. Most people fall to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard. Clearly, it is the second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It\u0027s no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won\u0027t. You have to have you attention suddenly distracted by something else when you\u0027re halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it\u0027s going to hurt if you fail to miss it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is notoriously difficult to prize your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most people\u0027s failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport. If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner. This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob and float, bob and float. Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher. Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful. They are most likely to say something along the lines of \u0022Good God, you can\u0027t possibly be flying!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWaft higher and higher.
