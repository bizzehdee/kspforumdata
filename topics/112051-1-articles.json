Someone beat me to the star multipliers but I was just going to update the wiki to say that the baseline ore production rate for a drill is 0.05\\*concentration, but since I\u0027m no veteran, I wanted to check that you all agree with my figure before I do. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T22:20:50Z","Content":"I just pictured someone landing a little mining rig on the wiki and drilling into it to extract wiki-ore..."},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T22:35:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just pictured someone landing a little mining rig on the wiki and drilling into it to extract wiki-ore...\n\nCan I get science for that? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T23:29:10Z","Content":"So if ore concentration in the area is 6%, you can expect an automated drill to get .003 ore/second? And you can expect a 5-star engineer to raise that to .075 ore/second?\n\nThat would actually explain why my drill was pulling so little out of the ground even though I thought the area should have decent concentrations."},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T23:37:12Z","Content":"That seems to right, at least on Kerbin and Minmus. My results didn\u0027t come out to exactly 0.05, but it seems to just be a discrepancy between readouts on the narrow-band scanner and the real amount, probably just rounding.\n\nMinmus is at 7.265%, rate is 0.00383, that comes out to 0.0527.\n\nKSC launchpad is 1.463%, rate is 0.000723, comes out to 0.0494"},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T01:11:29Z","Content":"Yes.
