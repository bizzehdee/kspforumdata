This is a problem for me only because I somewhat lose track of things when using tweakscale to scale energy consuming things, since the standard consumption will be scaled too and you cannot see anywhere (or can you?) to what value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone can give me a hint on a mod that I might have missed that does this or even better a function in the base game that I blatantly missed, it would be deeply appreciated :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDani\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-18T11:23:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2015 11:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DaniDE\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Esolved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T10:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFusebox is what you are looking for.
