They are not listed on the tracking center now, and thinking back to this morning, something seemed wrong about the number of flights listed on my resumable game menu, but it didn\u0027t set off enough alarm bells to make me think to check the count. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"apoch1999","CreatedById":58569,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T06:28:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis has happened to me more than once...i ive seen a few threads on it, with no answers from squad...which really sucks cause i REALLY like this game...but if all my flights are going to just keep dissapearing i see no real reason to keep on playing except for small 2 or 3 flights up to maybe 6 for colonies(one planet for each save)...ive lost 2 space stations(at least 10 lifts each) to this...its really frustrating\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T06:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a really old thread, but since you mention it, this has happened to me a couple more times.
