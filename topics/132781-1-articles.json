Your Lift/Drag ratio is a function of your Angle of Attack (AoA from now on). Low angle of attack, and lift is a big percentage of the total aerodynamic forces. High angle of attack, and drag grows faster than lift, to the point that you \u0022stall\u0022 (it\u0027s modeled derpy, but it works out surprisingly like the real thing). In fact, at really high angles of attack (\u0026gt;30\u00BA), lift in fact goes \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E, while drag keeps going up. With more wing, you can mantain a lower AoA for the same lift, meaning you see less drag at the same airspeed and altitude. High wing-loaded planes can see more drag at low airspeeds for this reason, if they have to maintain a high angle of attack to fly level. You can go the other way and have too much wing, of course, but that is mostly because wings do weight somewhat, not because of drag, or at least not aerodynamic drag.

I cannot stress that enough. Rocketry and flight are all about ratios, and given how KSP parts are scaled, everything part-relevant scales more or less linearly (twice the weight is twice everything else, like thrust in engines and lift in wings). If your small SSTOs work better than your big SSTOs, that\u0027s because you get the ratios in your big ones wrong(er).
