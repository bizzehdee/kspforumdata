Basically point prograde when you\u0027ve slowed down to about 1400 m/s and do a big flare at 1000m altitude. I did have to add airbrakes and make my ailerons work on the pitch axis though. However now I have to figure out how to land it at KSC. With a Mk2 fuselage plane this is rather easily done regardless from where you deorbitted. This is quite a bit different though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T13:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrag has two components, form drag which is mainly about the size of the aircraft pushing through the air, and induced drag which is about the generation of lift.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point where the drag, weight and lift vectors cancel each out will tell you your glide ratio (angle of descent),\u00A0however the faster you go the lower the induced drag gets, but the higher the form drag gets, so there will be an optimum speed at which you\u0027ll get your best glide slope angle.\u00A0 The bigger the aircraft the more form drag, and the heavier the aircraft the more induced drag, so generally speaking a\u00A0big heavy aircraft will fall out of the sky quicker than a small light one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModern gliders can have a glide ratio above 50, ie for every 50 meters horizontal travel they\u0027ll lose 1 meter altitude (apparently Seagulls have a similar glide ratio but always overtook me in thermals, so pilot skill makes a difference too :D), by comparison the space shuttle was about 4.5, which is around half what a Paraglider can manage\u00A0and only slightly better than a steerable parachute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoral of the story: don\u0027t be surprised that your Mk3 gliders come down fast.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaMensae","CreatedById":152463,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T17:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222400854\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131620\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455037045\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158054\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022storm_soldier2377\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/9/2016 at 10:57 AM, storm_soldier2377 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did have to...make my ailerons work on the pitch axis though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was a big part of your problem, those things are actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eelevons\u003C/em\u003E, a combo elevator\u002Baileron, and need to have pitch control enabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"storm_soldier2377","CreatedById":158054,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T23:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222402232\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131620\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455124372\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152463\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laguna\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Laguna said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was a big part of your problem, those things are actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eelevons\u003C/em\u003E, a combo elevator\u002Baileron, and need to have pitch control enabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am aware of that, but they were functioning as ailerons as I usually turn my pitch off in those make the pitch axis a bit less sensitive as to not accidentally pitch up too much during the ascent and inducing too much drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway I made a new plane where I managed to squeezed some more wings and canards and it\u0027s working much better now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T15:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nis it possible that he\u0027s a cargobay glitch, and the wings are counted as occluded, and all he has is body lift?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T15:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPress F12 to see the aero forces... helps a lot...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Araym","CreatedById":46343,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T10:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did a lot of costruction of \u0022spaceshuttles\u0022 with Mk3 spaceplane parts, using a reference Inigma\u0027s one (link on my sign, if you hover above the engineer patch), so I provide you some ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nShuttle-like designs (like yours, even if it has not external tank and booster, referring to the orbiter itself when it reenters from space) have very poor lifting capability.

In that case, you generally cannot recover, as in KSP \u0022inverted control surfaces\u0022 go nuts.

If it\u0027s not a design choice (I was looking to a clean shuttle-like design, unlike you, designig it more feeely) you can add some externa canards on the nose, to balance the lift, leaving them outside/not clipped, to help yourself to have some autoriti to raise the nose of your planes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI generally found any conventional design based on mk3 in the needs of some lift/control surface on the nose. Almost always. So the 2 options: clipped inside the cockpit or outside, they always work and generally are welcomed by any design.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"}]}
