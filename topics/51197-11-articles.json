So far the only mod that adds one is RLA Stockalike, and it\u0027s an extremely small one. How large is the one you\u0027re planning on adding?

How does it it achieve this gimbal? To my knowledge, the two ways to get a linear aerospike motor to effectively gimbal involves either altering the thrust of one side or ejecting gas from the spike to adjust the flow pattern.

The only engines that might be \u0022overpowered\u0022 are actually the OMS engines, which have incredibly high ISP and excellent thrust for their size. Pound for pound nothing can compare to their combined thrust/ISP/weight, either in stock KSP or most parts mods.

At least it\u0027s possible to hard cap the throttle at 90% with tweakables now, but even so the actual shuttle\u0027s engines were regeneratively cooled and capable of safely operating at up to 109% of original design specifications, so it might be nice to see the X3 capable of operating at least at it\u0027s design specifications.
