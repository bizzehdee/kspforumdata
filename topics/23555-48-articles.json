The instant stretch option only set the cable lenght to the current distance between winch and connector. So if you eject the grapple, and it go the maximum distance, (300m for you), using it will change nothing. However, it will be usefull if for exemple you eject the grapple and it collide with something near, so the distance will be lower than the cable lenght. (ejecting set the cable lenght to the maximum allowed) \u003Cp\u003EAnd for the magnet, I do not have this problem. If I fully retract a winch with a magnet attached it will lock. Maybe you have a heavy load attached so the cable can\u0027t retract as the distance between connector and winch are longer than 0.08 (default value of the lockMinDist parameter)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm... That test was conducted on the runway, and there was a pylon in front of the winch. I could see the connector on the ground in front of the pylon. When I activated the instant stretch, the cable got a few meters longer. Clicking it repeatedly had my 300m winch extended to 318m. Maybe a rounding error?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to issue 7: The magnet was not activated or connected to anything. I just dropped it on the ground, grabbed the connector, plugged the connector into the magnet, and then switched vessels and retracted it. The kerbal never even had to move in the process. It just hung down swinging slightly below the winch (which was a radial pointing 90 degrees from the ground). The GUI said it was fully retracted, but it just hung there. I know this is repeatable, so I\u0027ll try and get some screenshots for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vedrit","CreatedById":68294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T02:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I captured the log for the electromagnet flying off into the distance when grabbed: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/GYE4NCfc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/GYE4NCfc\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this helps, but better than nothing, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Playful1510","CreatedById":68786,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T03:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to grab and reconnect stock parts like batteries and solar panels?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T03:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Playful1510\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Playful1510\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there any way to grab and reconnect stock parts like batteries and solar panels?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust right-click on the part when you\u0027re controlling an EVA Kerbal.

Anyhoo, that\u0027s not the point, the point it, because of this it also occurred to me that it would be equally possible to store any other single peice craft in this manner, so i tried that too, which had mixed results due to size issues (some cheating involved, just trying the idea), crafts that i tried were BobCat\u0027s DEMV MK5 (worked well aside from the \u0022ladder\u0022 not working due to the hatch issues) and then last night i tried LLL\u0027s Salvage Pod which worked a lot better aside from knocking my kerbal around when i put it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to the point, have you ever considered taking storage up a notch? It would be entirely feasable to use your setup to handle internal cargo-bays or even internal hangar-bays (provided that the craft being stored is a one-peice) almost flawlessly, with larger cargo in this case the only problem is deployment and storing as a very large peice of cargo isnt going to be easy for a kerbal to carry, but if you created a cargo-bay that is basically an expanded container with a somewhat different method for retrieval.. i.e. it spawns and maybe even \u0022docks\u0022 the cargo or one-peice ship into a preset launch or loading/unloading position instead of spawning it attached to the Kerbal. I imagine that using some manipulator arm setup for retrieving and deploying cargo could work pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might think this would be cheating, but considering you already add the mass of the object stored to the container it would enable complex ships with incredible storage capabilities without the hassle of shifting the centre of mass into an asymetrical position. It would be possible to build space carriers that can carry a squadron of fighters, cargo haulers and exploration ships that could carry serveral rovers internally etc., needless to say i find that concept thrilling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E//Taros\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T14:15:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReading the changelog almost cost me an keyboard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUniverse will no more vanish sometimes after loading was funny. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnchor will now sink in the water was more impressive \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T16:57:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022greg12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022greg12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks you KospY, the developer of KAS.
