That update is taking longer than anticipated, and we came to a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epoint where a lot of content was ready to go through testing and be \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereleased on its own merits. With these parts ready we wanted to get them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E to you as fast as possible, and I think we have succeeded in a speedy \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelivery of this patch.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some of the highlights in this patch:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Contextual Contracts \u0026amp; Contract Changes\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contracts system has had a major overhaul with the goal of providing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E you with more varied and relevant contracts. In short, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve added contextual contracts and passive milestone rewards. Contextual contracts monitor your progress in the game and hook into existing existing spacecraft, whereas passive milestone rewards will reward more adventurous players for setting a world first without accepting the corresponding contracts. A new strategy in the Administration Building will boost these rewards.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thermodynamic improvements\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 1.0.5 features many improvements to the thermodynamic \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esystems. The thermodynamics system has been reworked to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecorrect the various issues encountered in 1.0.4, and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esupports differential skin-internal temperatures and non-instant changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E We\u2019ve also corrected some issues with the atmospheres of other \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecelestial bodies, and better tuned re-entry and aerobraking across the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eboard. Core heat was introduced, which allows for simulating things such as warm-up time \u0026amp; overheating without .it \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebeing directly coupled to the part temperature.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E New buoyancy model \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe water buoyancy has been completely reworked. Water is now less soupy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and it\u2019s very possible to build seaplanes. The density of oceans differs \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eacross celestials bodies, invoking new gameplay challenges. The impact tolerances take into account just the speed of the craft,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E but also the angle at which it hits the water.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew rocket and spaceplane parts\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;A wide selection of new parts is made available in this patch: from high-vectoring space shuttle main engines and a reskinned toroidal aerospike all the way to tiny and humongous jet engines and a cargo ramp for Mk.3 planes. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also added new stock vehicles to the game to go with these new parts.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Bugfixes \u0026amp; Tweaks\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 1.0.5 has many bugfixes: over 100 issues were \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efixed, including launch clamps following you to orbit, . And good news \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor anyone with a fine eye for detail: the black stripes on the NASA \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etanks now line up perfectly!
