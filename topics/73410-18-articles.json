But, also adds some alternate engines into the pot. And while we\u0027re here, does anyone have some suggestions? Any holes in their engine list they need filled? I\u0027m hopefully going to limit this to Stock/NASAMission, FASA, KW, and SXT engines. Possibly AIES. That\u0027ll give enough variety but doesn\u0027t break the bank mod-wise. I\u0027ve already got upgraded F1 and J2 in FASA (thrust/Isp bumps), and a smaller KW SPS engine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be fantastic, and definitely be a huge help as engine selection, even with KW, B9, and AIES, is severely lacking in many cases, especially for Kerbal 64k. One thing I\u0027d love, and I know it\u0027s just a pie in the sky dream, is a minor rebalance on some of the smaller engines to bring them up a bit closer to real values, just for usability in Kerbal 64k, or other non-10x rescales.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the real life Merlin 1D for example, which appears to be no larger than ~1 meter in diameter. It produces 620kN at sea level, and ramps up to 690kN in vacuum. The best 1.25 meter engine available between KSP, KW, and AIES is probably the KW Wildcat, producing a miserly 230kN of of thrust at sea level, and 280kN in vacuum, resulting in a maximum TWR of just over 80, compared to the Merlin\u0027s ~155.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis comparative lack of thrust on the smaller engines really hurts the ability to produce useful lifters using engine clusters in anything other than stock scaled Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually thought my clustering days were over until I stumbled into SpaceY, and its \u0027Kiwi\u0027 engine. That perfect little 1.25 meter engine produces 411kN at sea level, and 455kN in vacuum, while managing a maximum TWR of ~120. Still not equivalent to something like the real life Merlin 1D, but that\u0027s fine since I know that Stockalike isn\u0027t meant for 10x rescales, like RSS. In many ways, the \u0027Kiwi\u0027 feels like the perfect middle-ground for a 1.25 meter engine, since it compares a lot more favorably with the larger engines in terms of thrust to diameter ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the comparative weakness of the other 1.25 meter engines makes them kind of a hard sale. In fact, it\u0027s largely impossible to use any other 1.25 meter engine, alone or in clusters, on anything larger than stock Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I know that trying to go through and rebalance all 1.25 meter engines against the Kiwi would be quite a chore. Besides, maybe you\u0027ll include some new, more powerful 1.25 meter engines in these extra configs? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I do love the mod.

The config was originally written by Starwaster (if we\u0027re talking about the stock clone, and not Porkjet\u0027s newer LANTR), and I assume he didn\u0027t pull that number from nowhere. I just don\u0027t know where to dig this up, since Google is failing me. :shrug:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all above my pay grade, so I went to Atomic Rockets to pull data.

And to top it off, the thrust increase from NTR to LOX (111 kN to 303 kN) is an increase of 2.7 times, which is exactly what Atomic Rockets comes out with. So, given that I\u0027d trust Atomic Rockets to be accurate, I wouldn\u0027t change the numbers. If anything, I\u0027d fudge the thrust down a bit, since AR\u0027s numbers are 67kN/189kN for NTR/LOX modes, but I\u0027ll take the assumption that you could scale up the thrust with a bigger reactor and keeping the TWR near the same. As for IspSL, there are a ton of variables for that, not just atmospheric pressure. Again, I assume Starwaster pulled the numbers from some source, I just can\u0027t find anything good about LANTR on Google at the moment. So, we\u0027ll keep those for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the TL scaling, that\u0027s completely out of my hands. The RealFuels code dictates that, so you\u0027re unfortunately at the mercy of NathanKell to update the mod before any changes come about. The only alternative is to just make a TL8 (which exists for NTRs) LANTR or NTR with the given numbers. Heck, hit the webapp and plug stuff in and copy the resulting config out to test away with.

The example with MON3 stands: none of the major sources seem to differentiate between MON* and N2O4, so I can\u0027t find anything good for it. Other than arbitrarily saying \u0022this set uses MON3\u0022 and \u0022this set uses MON5\u0022, there\u0027s nothing really to work from. I suppose I could do that, but I\u0027d have to decide which \u0022groups\u0022 get what mixture. I don\u0027t remove them because I don\u0027t want to interfere at all with RealFuels proper. That\u0027s not the intent of the config set. I\u0027m already doing enough damage with the stinkin\u0027 catch-all config, I \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E don\u0027t want to try and support altering the fuel list. It shouldn\u0027t be that big of a deal, 90% of the time I use the autofill options anyway. It\u0027s not like you couldn\u0027t write a config to just remove them from your own install either. I\u0027m just not going to do that for this config due to the support problems it would cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to why they are there: because they are real fuels. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E It\u0027s really for the RO config set, IMO, so that different engines can use the proper fuels they were designed for. Others are there for nice what-ifs that you couldn\u0027t (or shouldn\u0027t) test in real life, like the flourine/chlorine mix. I don\u0027t plan on tossing in a fuel mix just because it\u0027s there. Almost all of the engines I know of use kerolox, hydrolox, or hydrazine-derivative/N204-derivative. There\u0027s a few methalox engines coming, and the Russians used some scary stuff (i.e. UDMH/IRFNA). Other than that, there\u0027s solid fuels and some monopropellants (helium, HTP, etc). All of those mixtures have at least one example in the configs. Granted, you\u0027d probably need 64-bit KSP on Linux to even load all of the engines, but you get to pick what mods you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich leads me to RE: Extra Configs - The reason I picked those is because, well, that\u0027s what I use. Selfish, probably, but I initially wanted to keep the mod-list to a minimum for that particular project. But, I can probably expand it anyway. I used to use NovaPunch a ton in my rockets. The only thing that bugs me is the artwork; NP just doesn\u0027t look right to me when compared with KW, AIES, and even stock. NP also felt a bit more powerful than they should be to me. I kept coming back to particular engines to use every time because I couldn\u0027t beat the performance with anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for types, KW, NP, FASA, and SXT have J2 engines, and even the 5-engine layout used for the Saturn V. (Ok, FASA doesn\u0027t have it, but you can make it) I like variety, so I make them all a bit different in my configs. FASA I try and keep closest to \u0022real life\u0022 because it\u0027s explicitly trying to model real engines in KSP. The KW Wildcat XR is essentially the back-end of the S-IV stage (which obviously is a J2), but it\u0027s not specifically the J2. If anything, they\u0027ve all ripped off real engines. (the Ariane engine in KW?!?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, since I don\u0027t use NP, I can\u0027t really test any upgraded versions at this point. I\u0027d be happy to add some uprated engines, certainly. If you want to set up some configs on the webapp using the original engines as a base, use the new submit function to send them to me. Just leave a note here or something letting me know which ones you\u0027ve sent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above goes for anyone as well. I won\u0027t say I\u0027ll use everything, but I\u0027d certainly appreciate some suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T04:15:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 04:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Raptor831\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarity...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"djnattyd","CreatedById":63737,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T10:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Raptor, quick question; does your most recent config support the new FTMN engines?
