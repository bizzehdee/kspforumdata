The 0.5% elite players might be clamouring for a more advanced aerodynamics model, but that\u0027s far from being a deal breaker for your average new player/reviewer!\n\nHere\u0027s some things that bothered me:\n\n\\* Tutorials/GUI. On several occasions I\u0027ve had to *leave the game* to google how some of the GUI worked. That\u0027s not the sign of a good GUI. For example, I didn\u0027t understand how some of the contract requirements worked, and couldn\u0027t figure out why I wasn\u0027t completing missions. Some terminology is foreign and never explained, like suborbital vs height requirements in the contracts. Again, I had to google it to find an explanation.\n\n\\* Science. What the heck is it? Where do I get it? Science painfully trickled in until - after googling (again) - I discovered you could do other things to gain science, like right clicking the command pod and selecting \u0027Crew Report\u0027. Who knew? Not me!\n\n\\* Tooltips. If I hover over a button with my mouse, like SAS, I\u0027d \\*love\\* if a tooltip could appear that would show you a little explanation of what it does, and maybe its hotkey. SAS? What the heck is SAS? Oh, it\u0027s stability assist, and I can turn it on and off with \u0027T\u0027. It\u0027d be really helpful if that was in the game, instead of having to search google for these things.\n\n\\* Automatic hints could go a long way to help teach players. For example, the first time the player attaches a jet engine, why not have a little popup to tell them that Jet engines will require the addition of \u0027air intake\u0027 parts to function?\n\n\\* Cancelling contracts - it turns out cancelling a contract is completely different from failing it. I didn\u0027t cancel any contracts for the longest time, until I was forced to cancel a contract because I\u0027d bitten off way more than I could chew, only to discover it was totally fine. Again, the game doesn\u0027t tell you any of this.\n\nKSP has a really big learning curve, and that\u0027s ok - but players need to be given tools and help to scale that mountain. If new players routinely have to google for help or controls it\u0027ll drive a lot of people away.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T14:32:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheHolyChicken**"}]}
