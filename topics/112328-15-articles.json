DeepFreeze is no longer using the old Ship Manifest hard-reference API.  \n\nDFInterface.dll has been removed as well, you no longer need this or SMInterface.dll.  \n\nThere is a bug related to Crew Transfers if you are using Connected Living Spaces and Ship Manifest that causes a kerbal to be lost if you are using CLS passable = NO setting on parts.
