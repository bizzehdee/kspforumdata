My current rocket design has its booster stage crash on Kerbin and its second stage has enough delta-V to crash at the destination, but I have a lot of parts from earlier designs orbiting Kerbin, and if I use my current lander design for orbital rendezvous missions I end up ejecting six radial fuel tanks per flight into orbit.
