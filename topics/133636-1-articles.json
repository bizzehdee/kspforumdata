Powered by 6 \u0022Goliath\u0022 turbofans, the 797 is planned to replace most of the existing long-range, heavy capacity aircraft, such as the Airbus A380 and the aging Boeing 747s. Boeing is planning to try to convince airlines to replace their 747s, most of the older ones are the specific target, though. They have said they do not plan on completely replacing the old 747s. The new 797s have twice the capacity of their previous jumbo jets. The cockpit has more crew capacity, so therefore, safer operations. They were heavily inspired by their competitors. In WW2 Northop Grumman created the \u00A0YB-35 and YB-49. The\u00A0were former was compared to the dominant bomber at the time, the B-29. With Boeing making more jet bombers, they made the YB-49 as the competitor. The Boeing 797 has a total capacity of 192 passengers and a very high top speed, best for slightly angled up flight. Boeing says this is the \u0022Commercial\u0022 prototype of the Boeing X-48.
