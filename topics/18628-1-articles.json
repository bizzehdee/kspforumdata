The thing is, the station is so massive it lags my PC to hell, to the point where I get 1 FPS avg. I had to speed it up in Vegas so you guys didn\u0027t die of boredom watching the video.\u003Cbr\u003EIt passes by so fast (and renders so slowly) that I couldn\u0027t even turn the ship properly. A touch to the thrust became 15 seconds holding Shift down in the game, which means I couldn\u0027t do anything but watch my station fly past me (in approximately 2 frames).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOne other thing: I noticed that, much like what happened to my \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/aXTkA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eprevious space station rendezvous operation\u003C/a\u003E, the station broke, without me causing it. This one broke in like 30 pieces, while my previous station had its mast break on its own (even though it didn\u0027t when I put it in orbit).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhat about you guys? Did this issue of big things breaking happen to you too? Did you ever make a big, cool space station and rendezvous with it?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dt890","CreatedById":8704,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T18:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post the mods you used?
