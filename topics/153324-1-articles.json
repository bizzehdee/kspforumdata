I\u0027ve already developed incredibly powerful rockets (1000\u002B tons, almost capable of breaking sun\u0027s gravity) without mods, but it\u0027s obviously inefficient to waste fuel on escaping Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. So, if anyone has a good system or equation to calculate any of this, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T22:13:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2,868,000 meters above the surface, as that\u0027s the only height geostationary can be at.
