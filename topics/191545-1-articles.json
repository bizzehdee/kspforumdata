One of the mods I previously had was Kerbal Engineer Redux, and one of my space stations had a part from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and wasn\u0027t loaded since it was missing the part. I downloaded \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E again but the station is still gone.
