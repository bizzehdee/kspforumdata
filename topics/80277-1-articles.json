Believe it or not, there are some health concerns to be aware of when riding in an airplane, but it\u0027s not the same as being the pilot. I would expect space tourism would be similar. As an example, it is difficult to be a pilot if you underwent any chemotherapy or radiation therapy to treat cancer. Even if you are in full remission and all signs of the cancer are gone, you may never be allowed to pilot a plane again (there are exceptions to this). However, that doesn\u0027t stop you from being a passenger. Another example is diabetes, a person with diabetes cannot be a pilot (here in the U.S.), but you can be a passenger.

The different levels of pilot license carry different medical requirements, but being medically disqualified for one disqualifies you for all of them. So a commercial pilot who loses his license for a condition that would not disqualify him from receiving a light sport aircraft license can never fly again, while the pilot who never held a commercial license with that exact same condition can fly legally. At least, this is how my father explained it to me (40 years of experience piloting, commercial, military and civilian).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty messed up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
