Our world became industrial mostly during WWI, and rockets were invented during WWII. But no company or governement today could sustain a space mining/colonization effort, especially after another world war. And if we don\u0027t start exploiting space ressources real soon, ours are gonna deplete faster and faster...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I don\u0027t say the privatisation of space is the solution for a brighter future, because if we need a super-industrial-goverment complex, I don\u0027t know if we must be hopefull or terrified about the future ^_^\u0022 .
