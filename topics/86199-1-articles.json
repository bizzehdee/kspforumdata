So I got my final part out of four around kerbin. I\u0027m trying to dock the final part and I was 70km from the rendezvous. So I Time-warp. I didn\u0027t time it that well and i approach it REALLY fast. In my panic i stop the time-warp, IN THE MIDDLE OF MY MOTHERSHIP WITH 800\u002B PARTS THAT TOOK ME FOREVER TO BUILD!!! The fourth part loaded inside my mothership and sent the pieces flying. I may attempt a second try...
