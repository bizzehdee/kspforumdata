It took me a while to complete this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my entry, the Stingray. My goal was to complete as many of the challenges as possible with one glider, so it took me about five iterations to settle on this. I ended up getting rid of any aerodynamic control surfaces since I grew tired of dealing with infiniglide craziness. It is all stock parts and aero, except for using MechJeb to show stats (it was unused for navigation or flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/MAlnm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I\u0027m pretty sure it wasn\u0027t in a dive as I tried to stay between 900m and 1000m while doing the speed run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDragon Challenge: I managed to load it up and carry 1.455tons of craft above 2km. It still wanted to climb, so it could probably do better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload Challenge: 1.855t max weight, 1.63t of cargo if you want to count the decouplers (1.58 if you don\u0027t). I think that was about the maximum weight I could carry. Any more and it would stall out. I think I lost count on the number of tries, and it took me about 20 minutes to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuckling Challenge: Crazy physics.
