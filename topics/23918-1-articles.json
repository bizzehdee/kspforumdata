I am currently trying to make a Russian Mig-15, and American F-86 Sabre but I can\u0027t get the right parts to do so, Could someone please edit, and give me an AV-R8 Winglet about the same dimensions as the Swept wings? Also could you give me another AV-R8 Winglet that\u0027s just a little bit smaller? And lastly, can I get a very small version of all the jet engines?? Thank you for the help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~ThatOneGuy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/9/99/AV-R8_Winglet.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AV-R8_Winglet.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://historyoflight.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/mig15-f86.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mig15-f86.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
