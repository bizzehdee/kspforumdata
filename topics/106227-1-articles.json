And this used to be such a fun community! Yesterday there was a flamewar going on about the pointer... the bloody pointer! I found it quite nice when I noticed it was there. And a transparent navball... yeah, good job, SQUAD. But every time I come in here, there is endless whining going on about this and that... To make things worst, now I have to whine about the whining. \n\nNow, let\u0027s be clear: there are problems with 1.0. Two big ones, in my opinion: pods turning the wrong way on reentry\\* and not having a way to dissipate heat (radiators are really needed). There are other things too: some bugs still exist, fairing confeti is silly and contracts need more improvement. Yes, this are concerns. \n\nBut I don\u0027t know what people expected. For KSP to remain in *beta sine* *die*? What would that accomplish? I would bet a finger that if a 0.91 had been released just to test the waters, people would have complained about a 1.0 release that added no new features. Besides, I imagine SQUAD wanted to launch with a proper bang, not just with a \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00ABoh, this is the same game we had at last update, only some bugs have been fixed\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BB. Maybe some people would like a lot more features in the game, like life support, but the team wanted to launch, and can\u0027t you understand why? They are a small indie team and you wanted them to slave away for years without being able to say *voil\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1*. I don\u0027t like getting personal on the internet, but maybe this calls for it: recently I finished writing a very large book. Took me years to write, and a lot of hard work. Of course, once the last page was finished, I had to look back and find all the \u0022bugs\u0022; but I can testify to the need of saying something like \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00ABthis still needs work, but after 4 long years damn me if I am not proud of saying it is done\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BB. \n\nNow, as for the trivial whining... and by trivial I don\u0027t mean complaints about the pointer; that\u0027s beneath disputing. People see something they are not used to and, no mater how good it is, they want to complain. Well, damn them. \n\nI have seen a lot of complaining about previous rocket designs not working any more. Of course, before that it was complaining about the soup atmo, but now let\u0027s complain because it\u0027s hard to get into space. People: it is SPACE! Ok, simulated space in a game, but how could you possibly complain about not being able to get into it by only using jet engines... The point of a game is for it to be difficult to master, for there to be obstacles to conquer. So if your cheesy SSTO doesn\u0027t work any more, make a better one. \n\nPeople complain about career. \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00ABToo grindy at hard settings!\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BB (easy solution comes to mind). \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00ABThe tech tree is hard to complete!\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BB. \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00ABI want fairings, but I don\u0027t have them yet!\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BB. \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00ABI don\u0027t want to build a rocket using ridiculously small tanks and lousy engines!\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BB. Again: a game, supposed to present a challenge. What I like about career is that I can\u0027t just build anything; I have to mind the fact that with the limitations of the early stages I can do only very few things effectively. I can\u0027t get more experiments and bigger rockets, I have to make a hard choice. Today I had to get some tourists into orbit... Failed miserably four times, because the rocket was hard to control. Of course, I cursed myself for not allowing reverts; but that is not SQUAD\u0027s fault! It\u0027s my own, because I set myself a challenge and failed. But when the tourist finally completed the itinerary, I was satisfied and had a lot of fun (of course, the \u0026%$/\u0022! contract set me back 40k, but that\u0027s not the point).\n\nI saw one guy complaining that he couldn\u0027t finish the tech tree with just a couple biomes at KSC. What? Well, he wanted to play sandbox, only with science and kerbals gaining XP. I think you can\u0027t blame the devs for not having that game in mind when they made KSP, can you... Maybe you have fun with that, but I must say it\u0027s rather unique, and can\u0027t be expected to be what the game should be. And you can always just work around that ading the science and the money in the save file. Same thing can be said about a lot of the complaints people seem to have about the current game. \n\nTo sum it up, because this is getting long: should we be critical? Yes, of course: that probably helps SQUAD to make the game better. But, please, good kerbonauts, stop with the whining. Maybe this is not the game you imagined when you where six years old and dreamed up the perfect game, but it\u0027s the game SQUAD dreamed up. You can play it if you have fun with it, and count your blessings, but if you don\u0027t have fun, find an alternative: mod it, be cheesy or just play something else. Don\u0027t be a killjoy. \n\nHave fun, people. Really. It\u0027s not that hard. \n\n\\*: A mod has fixed this already, for those of you still having problems. I solved it by putting nothing on the pods except the heat shield and then just manually keeping it stable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T06:26:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 06:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Musil**"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:20:27Z","Content":"You\u0027re definitely right.

There is a big difference between a challenge and just doesn\u0027t work right.\n\nThe parachutes are insanely overpowered in 1.0 in the old game I would have to slow my ships down to about 800 m/s before I open my chute or they would be ripped apart, now I just punch it as soon as I start falling and nothing bad ever happens. \n\nSAS is totally buggered now, turn it to any of the navigation modes and it just flips out, my engines gimbal so fast you see double or triple nozzles flicking back and forth.\n\nAtomic engines are unusable and there is no way around that. I like the idea of giving them special challenges to use right, but why add a part that creates so much heat and not add any parts to radiate it? Why nerf their thrust at the same time? It seems someone just said, \u0022hey, lets totally ruin the most important engine in the game and make it so you can\u0027t do anything about it?\u0022\n\nBugs I can handle, bugs are just what it means to play games.

I love the equpiment bays, no more ships that just look like someone stuck a hardware store all over them. I love the fairings (although would love them more if they didn\u0027t turn into confetti) The new areo seems pretty nice, although I may be biased just because its so much easier than it used to be. \n\nAnd the game crashes less which is always a good thing.\n\nBut people have the right to be pissed when there is a 1.0 release and there are so many things that seem like nobody ever tested them. I mean how in the name of god does the broken re-entry model get past anyone? Its something you find on your second or third flight.

If we just take the recent AMA on Reddit, the reason the dV readouts didn\u0027t make it, is because they are a part of a bigger system that they\u0027re implementing. A system that involves scientists and engineers to have more skills. They didn\u0027t put dV readouts in the game, because the experience system with your crew that allows for this isn\u0027t ready for release yet.\n\nI think Squad were brave not to put it in - Now that I know it\u0027s a part of a bigger and different picture than I thought, I\u0027d rather they wait until it\u0027s done.

Don\u0027t forget, we already bought the game, its not like we can punish the devs by not buying it. The only way to *make* them do anything is to push on their emotions, hoping that the knowledge that they upset a lot of people with their choices is enough to make them make different choices. Being rude is the only leverage we have, and since this is the internet and only about 100th of normal empathy flux can flow through it compared to real life, you have to use words much more forcefully than you would in real life. \n\nOn thing I forgot to mention on my list of likes, the new way the science labs work...that is a wonderful change, maybe my favorite thing about 1.0"},{"CreatedByName":"andruszkow","CreatedById":104911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:56:38Z","Content":"\u0022... someone decided that they wanted to force what they thought looked cool on thousands of people without giving them a choice.

However, no doubt Squad and all the testers did a great job with 1.0, and Ted makes an important point about software testing, which is that the test team is there to cull away the most serious bugs, like crashes, save file corruption, etc., not these minor bugs people escalate to an uncalled for level.\n\nKeep it fun!"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T08:55:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Being nitpicky about something as silly as a mouse pointer is just...

Changing a pointer from your computers default is like changing the keyboard layout, its reaching out of the game and screwing with the way you interact with the computer.

The most important thing to appreciate in software development is there is no such thing as bug-free. It doesn\u0027t exist. Version 1.0 of *anything* will contain a few bugs. The heat sheild bug is irritating, but I have only died from it once, after that I figured how to fly a re-entry that can cope with it. Launches are harder to do than before, but once you figure the technique for building rockets, and the technique for launching them, it\u0027s no harder than any other aspect of the game. In terms of the mechanics of the game, it\u0027s definitely as good as any 1.0 release I have encountered.\n\nThe other criticism that lots of people have is regarding the actual game play. First off, I have to say, the new atmosphere model makes the game *way* more fun than before. It feels fast and exciting in a way the old soup-o-sphere never did. Launches and re-entry feels exciting in a way it never did before. In terms of career mode, go back to the forum history from the days of 0.24-0.90, and look at how many people complained about how it was possible to max out the tech tree in a handful of launches. I think there was a Scott Manly video showing him maxing out the tech tree in career mode in something like two launches. That really was game breaking. Sure, the new career has the potential to be a bit more of a grind, but I have no problem with this. When I started my 1.0 career, I knew it would be a bit of a grind. I didn\u0027t go for \u0022hard\u0022 for this very reason. I chose a version that would give me enough funds and science to keep my career moving at a pace that I would find fun, and you know what? It\u0027s fun. Sure, I have had to build a couple of launches with a ton of smaller tanks and rocket motors I wouldn\u0027t chose if I had the full tech tree unlocked, but that\u0027s part of the game: getting where you want to go with the tools available to you.\n\nIn essence, I think the developers have done a great job bringing this game to where it is, and I think they have achieved what they promised us. I think the testers have done a good job of making sure the game works well.\n\nI have to say I have been really annoyed with the negativity I\u0027ve seen on the forums in the last week. If you are having a problem with the game, please try to find a *constructive* way to express your frustration. If something doesn\u0027t work the way you expect it to, and you want to post about it, ask \u0022why is this happening\u0022, not \u0022this game is terrible, the devs suck, this must be a bug\u0022."}]}
