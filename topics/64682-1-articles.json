Not wanting to risk crew, we decided that Dres would make a good proof-of-concept for our mothership design. While it is further from Duna and has no atmosphere to perform an aerobrake with, Dres is small enough and close enough that we feel confident that we can reach it and return with a decent safety margin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mothership consists of a core of a Mk II lander can, a habitat module, and a science module. Large docking ports were placed on either end of the stack, and medium docking ports were added to the sides. A robotic drive module of dual LV-N\u0027s is docked to the top of the core, and acts as the primary thrust platform. This pulls the bulk of the ship along which greatly increases stability while under thrust. A lander with four science pods was attached to the top of the drive platform. Below the core module two large fuel tanks were docked with the bottom tank having an LV-N attached to provide extra TWR during the outward burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launching of the modules and orbital assembly went smoothly. In fact, it went so smoothly a conundrum arose. The lower fuel tank with the LV-N was able to dock with the inner ring of its booster stage intact but empty:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C5I8lID.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C5I8lID.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERefueling the booster stage would give the craft over 20,000 units of fuel! Should we proceed with the original plan, or should we go for the gusto?

Thus, another mothership was launched and assembled while the first ship was sent on its way to the kethane refinery around Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe window to Dres opened, and we flung our brave crew of five through it. Maybe flung is too strong of a verb. Gradually sidled through it may be a better term as the outbound burn was 20 minutes long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/shad1uJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022shad1uJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0iapUsf.png\u0022 alt=\u00220iapUsf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the initial burn was completed. Jebediah, Milmore, Deshat, Bargel, and Franklin were on their way to Dres! Jeb is, of course, mission commander and lander pilot. Milmore and Deshat oversee operations of the core. Bargel and Franklin are the scientists assigned to the lab. After transferring fuel up from the bottom fuel tank and undocking it, the Dres Explorer was in cruising mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mcs3W0J.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mcs3W0J.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a midway course correction, an intercept with Dres of roughly 600,000m was obtained. Jebediah retired to the habitat module and passed the journey to Dres pleasantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TKVdXx7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TKVdXx7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the Dres Explorer reached Dres. It came in on a retrograde orbit, so some fuel was used in order to flip the orbit around. Milmore and Deshat proved able pilots and were able to bring the craft into a 30km orbit. Data was collected in this high (for Dres) orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2gW4Err.png\u0022 alt=\u00222gW4Err.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb climbed back into the lander, and undocked.

Three cheers for our (over)engineering staff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalfway home to Kerbin, Franklin performed the plane change and final insertion burn. Again, things went smoothly, and a periapsis of 5Mm was achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cGWP7om.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cGWP7om.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter another month of travel time, the big day arrived. The entry into Kerbin SOI was obtained. The 49 degree inclination was burned down to 4 degrees. Now the question remained: What height should the aerobrake bottom out at? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarious simulations were ran on the aerobraking maneuver. The initial thought of 37km did not phase the head of steam the Dres Explorer had picked up on its long fall from Dres orbit. Another simulation was run with 34km. Again, it was not enough. The third run of the simulation was at 31km. This did the trick! Ground control instructed Franklin to burn his periapsis down to 31k, and then waited anxiously for the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFranklin complied with ground control\u0027s instructions, and the Dres Explorer plummeted down Kerbin\u0027s gravity well. The Dres Explorer hit the outer reaches of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at speeds just shy of 4km/s! As the plasma of re-entry bloomed about the Dres Explorer, everyone held their breath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LEUnQWM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LEUnQWM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simulations were good! After shedding its terrible velocity and climbing out of the atmosphere the Dres Explorer had an apoapsis of 600km. The barometers on Kerbin recorded the spike in air pressure as everyone let out that breath they had been holding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter raising the periapsis back up to 80km and circularizing the orbit, the Dres Explorer and its intrepid crew were finally home!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zm5D8WE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Zm5D8WE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bold vision of Porcine Avionics once again delivers a success!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-07T21:45:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2014 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArmchairGravy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T14:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It was well planned, and well executed mission.
