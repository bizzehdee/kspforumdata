misunderstand.\u00A0 It\u0027s not a question of missing nodes or encounters for the outer planets, it\u0027s having time advance far enough for these alarms ever to go off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou install\u00A0OPM because you want to see those new planets.\u00A0 So you plan a mission to one of them and discover the trip will take 10 years (and that\u0027s just for the closer ones).\u00A0 So you launch this mission.\u00A0 Now 10 years of game time have to elapse before you get a chance to play with the OPM mission, which is the whole reason you installed the mod.\u00A0 You have a choice of how to spend that in-game time.\u00A0 You can either warp it away or play with other missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you decide to play with other missions, the only viable choice is really to launch a mission to another OPM planet as they don\u0027t interfere with each other\u0027s progress.\u00A0 Launching a\u00A0mission to an inner planet (which includes Jool), however, will greatly slow the progress of your OPM missions.\u00A0 By that I mean how many real hours of gameplay you have to sit through before the OPM missions arrive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay, for example, you decide on a mission to Eve after you launch the 10-year (1-way--it\u0027ll be more years coming home with at least 1 year in the system) OPM mission.\u00A0 And you go complex with it, landing and returning multiple Kerbals from the surface, exploring most of the planet with rover and/or plane, the works.\u00A0 This means you\u0027ll spend several entire multi-hour play sessions just designing and testing the hardware, most of which will be in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E where the in-game time does not advance, and any in-flight time\u00A0during tests (only at 1:1 time) will be reverted anyway.\u00A0 Then this complex mission will take at least several more play-sessions to complete, all of it at low warp or even real-time (especially the roving/flying around parts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus,\u00A0depending on how much free time you have to play KSP, this mission to Eve will consume anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple months of your real life.\u00A0 And when it returns to Kerbin, less than 1 year will have passed on the in-game calendar.\u00A0 Which means your OPM mission still has\u00A0over 90% of its trip to go.\u00A0 Despite all the time you spent\u00A0playing KSP,\u00A0 you\u0027ve made no significant progress towards seeing the new OPM planets you installed the mod to visit.\u00A0 If you do many more such missions to the inner planets, a game-breaking update will happen long before your OPM missions ever get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why I say, if you install OPM, then commit yourself to doing ONLY OPM missions once you feel you have the tech for them.\u00A0 You have to start with the inner planets, of course, but don\u0027t develop them at all.\u00A0 \u00A0You simply can\u0027t afford the time required to frequently tend to complicated infrastructure and colonies at them.\u00A0 Just go there quick, grab the necessary Science!, and leave nothing but relay satellites behind to help you talk out to the OPM planets later.\u00A0 Once you have the tech and the relays, completely ignore ALL the stock planets, including Jool.\u00A0 Otherwise, you\u0027ll never get to do anything at the OPM planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited
