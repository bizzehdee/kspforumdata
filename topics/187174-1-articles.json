Black Holes have been proven to exist, and they are very abundant throughout the universe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. First Theory. Everything that goes in a black hole stays there, all mass all matter is still intact. And it will eventually hit critical mass, A.K.A.The Big Bang. Which gives rise to the Expanding Contracting Universe theory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n( laws of thermodynamics and conversation of energy or intact)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 Second Theory. Everything that approaches the black hole as energy is converted to heat, which mathematically is The Heat Death of the Universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0However the Laws of thermodynamics and conservation of energy are still preserved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Third Theory.\u00A0 What goes in must come out. (Worm-Hole) This as well will preserve the law of thermodynamics and the conservation of energy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 recycles the universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 kills it and Everything\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 all good\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T02:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199407-gamedaddy22/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022199407\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199407-gamedaddy22/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@gamedaddy22\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve moved your topic to science and spaceflight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T04:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think of it as being like when I flush a toilet.
