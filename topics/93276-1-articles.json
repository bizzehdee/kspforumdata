Even on Normal, it turns the game into a tedious grindfest to churn out enough Funds to get your facilities upgraded to a level that makes them even marginally useful. On Hard it\u0027s just absurd, since not only do you have double the cost of the already-too-expensive Normal building upgrades, but you\u0027re getting about half the funds from contracts, meaning it\u0027s actually three or four times more tedious (not to be mistaken for three or four times harder, which it\u0027s very much not). Just getting the Space Center up to a level where a typical player could reasonably attempt a Mun mission costs almost a million Funds simply in upgrading facilities on Normal, which grinding out from contracts around Kerbin will take hours of tedious repetition of quickly-tiresome Kerbin-centric missions and part testing contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u0027s not really very fun this way is what I\u0027m getting at here. I think the missing building tier would probably help quite a bit with this problem (the jump between tier 1 and tier 2 space center facilities in terms of gameplay option expansion is often jarringly huge right now), but even that would not change the fact that you could run a full-scale mission to Jool and all of its moons for less than it costs just to get R\u0026amp;D up to tier 2, let alone get your VAB, launchpad, mission control, astronaut complex, and tracking station up to par for a basic interplanetary mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T03:28:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, the problem isn\u0027t the building prices. It\u0027s the default difficulty settings, and the fact that building prices are tied to \u0022Fund penalties\u0022 section. Penalties and costs should be two different things entirely... and imo all costs should scale together. IE: if \u0022cost percentage\u0022 is increased, then building costs, research costs (if enabled), and part costs should all increase by the same amount. Also, the default percentage settings need to be tweaked to reflect the changes in game play due to the new mechanics. Personally, I like to set fund income to a higher percentage and then increase failure penalties to twice the percentage of income (so I\u0027ll set income up to 150% and penalties up to 300%) because what\u0027s the point if there\u0027s no risk? Alas, this makes the R\u0026amp;D building cost 1.5 mil for the first upgrade, which is just ludicrous (sense right now building cost scales with penalties setting). This has the effect of making it very hard to find a nice balance where it isn\u0027t overly difficult or grindy... but not so easy that money is pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dunno, I like all the new features... but it just seems like they completely forgot about difficulty settings. I\u0027ve played KSP long enough to feel very comfortable in the game, so I like to have a lot of risk (and hard setting on the previous version did this, you could make money... but not if you mess up)... unfortunately that means that you only bring in smaller amounts of money at a time, and combine this with increasing building costs (due to difficulty) makes it a serious grindfest that isn\u0027t really worth the effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-17T03:31:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2014 03:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by impyre\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T04:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be less of an issue if there were more tiers and more gradual increases in the weight limit / part limit of the VAB/SPH/Runway/Launchpad (in particular).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith six tiers, it could be 10k, 20k, 40k, 100k, 200k, 400k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVAB/SPH unlocks could be 30 parts, 60, 100, 200, 300, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunway/Launchpad could be 20t, 40t, 100t, 200t, 400t, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignamious","CreatedById":60779,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T04:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf i remember from a Tuesday neb note a month ago, there is supposed to be another stage to the upgrade but they didn\u0027t finish it in time, and rather then delay the update or push a poor product the decided to hold it till the next beta patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SQUAD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SQUAD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://31.media.tumblr.com/0ff9377afa68dc3ad3fe6844aaf1bd38/tumblr_inline_newgmkVhgw1rr2wit.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://31.media.tumblr.com/0ff9377afa68dc3ad3fe6844aaf1bd38/tumblr_inline_newgmkVhgw1rr2wit.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMax (Maxmaps):\u003C/strong\u003E .Had a veritable mountain of feedback to sort through after the building showcase.

The problem isn\u0027t contract payouts or building prices... it\u0027s having building costs linked to failure costs. For those of us that want a more risky game (hence turning off quicksave/quickload) by decreasing payouts a bit and increasing penalties for failure, it turns into a grindfest because building prices scale way too fast. Since those percentages can\u0027t be changed once the game starts, you have pretty much two choices: 1) turn up payouts, in which case the beginning is more reasonable... but then when better contracts come in money quickly becomes an issue of the past... essentially making all the upgrades just one more thing to spend endless funds on, or 2) turn up penalties... in which case the later game makes more sense, but the beginning is unbearable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply unlinking costs and penalties would do the trick... and it\u0027s an easy enough fix. One variable and one extra slider. This way you could increase penalties for failure and reclaim the feeling of risk that made hard mode so great in the last version, without introducing grind-fest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, I personally think it would be nice if there were also a contract difficulty setting that could decrease deadlines (based on the location of the task) to actually create some risk of failing contracts... as right now it\u0027s pretty much more than enough time to get any contract done... even if it takes you 20 tries or more (at which point it really becomes more about cost vs payout and less about failure vs success).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Sorry if that sounded argumentative, it wasn\u0027t meant that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-17T08:47:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2014 08:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by impyre\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T13:23:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRender\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRender\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow exactly are building prices reasonable when I can run a full-scale mission to Jool and all of its moons for less than it costs to upgrade just the R\u0026amp;D facility to level 2?

The rest of the buildings provide support and functionality, but are not critical to mission building or handling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put the launchpad is the hardest one, and by far the most important. For the most part your left with Sub-Orbital missions and Orbital missions. I personally got creative and did a flyby of the moon to pay for a majority of my Launchpad upgrade. And Probe landings and Satellite missions to pay for the VAB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo no its not unresonable pricing, its totally possible to play the game on moderate. I consider myself a solid KSP player but no pro. I took some chances and enjoyed the fact that if i screwed up (I actually had to redesignated a Moon mission due to lack of Delta-V) I Would be set back a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise the early game does need tweaking. Your space center is very strapped for cash early on, and you really need to focus on what you do early as every move and mission is critical. It doesn\u0027t hurt to do something very daring early (like my 3 moon missions before the VAB upgrade) but it also makes things much more gridy if you don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI totally believe another tier (which is in development) would help smooth out the early transition. As once you get those three buildings upgrades things get much easier. 125 part count is a huge jump from 30, and allows you to do almost anything inside the Kerbin System with ease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end even on normal it shouldn\u0027t be so easy as you can get through most of the career early on without much trouble. I believe Career has been to easy. And this update changes that by forcing you to pay to get better functionality out of your facilities. Things still need to be balanced out, but until then things are still good enough to play through. If anything the game can only get easier from this point on until Squad adds something totally new to impact career progression.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-17T13:27:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2014 01:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MKI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddenis","CreatedById":89784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T16:17:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see any sense in arguing about the prices of buildings... because we all play with different difficulty settings... at least without adding your settings before you words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE.g. mine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B5AFHZ2IgAIx_ko.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B5AFHZ2IgAIx_ko.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpgrades cost:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunchpad - 104 000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVAB - 420 000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracking station - 280 000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER\u0026amp;D - 1 020 000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Control - 64 000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve started with 10 000.
