Make sure your model is unwrapped correctly. UV islands should have a few pixels space between them.

Select \u0022Raytrace\u0022, Contant QMC, Increase samples to 15 (Lower numbers give you more grainy results)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Select your object. Go to Edit mode. Select all.

Save the image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way is to import the AO map as a new layer in your image editor and set the layer mode to \u0022Multiply\u0022. You might know that colours on computers are stored as RGB numbers with black being #000000 and white being #FFFFFF. If you multiply something by 000000, you get zero, which is black, and if you multiply something by FFFFFF you get the original colour. Multiplying by something grey (e.g #808080) gives you a shadowed effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-09T17:19:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2014 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.
