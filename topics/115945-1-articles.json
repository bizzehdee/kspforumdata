There\u0027s a feature that you can\u0027t get accurate information from the orbital scanners for any given biome until you \u0022unlock\u0022 that biome by taking a surface scan there. (This is by design.) The usual progression looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Put a satellite with the medium-range scanner (the big clamshell thing) into a polar orbit so that you can see the orbital map. This gives a general overview of what the resource density is, but it is only an \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E for each biome, and won\u0027t tell you what the concentration is at any given spot. If this is what you\u0027re working from, you\u0027ll get a rude surprise when you land, because the actual concentration will likely be quite different. (At this stage, using the hi-res scanner is useless.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use that map to identify which biomes have high average concentration. For any biomes that interest you, land a little lander that has the surface scanner on it, and click the \u0022run analysis\u0022 button. This will \u0022unlock\u0022 that biome, and now the orbital map will give actual concentrations that you can use for planning where to land your miner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Ignore the hi-res scanner, it\u0027s pretty much useless. Yes, it will give you a hi-res piece of information for any given location (after you\u0027ve unlocked the biome), but there\u0027s no way to save that information or do anything useful with it-- for example, it doesn\u0027t update the orbital map, or anything useful like that. Unless it gets redesigned, it\u0027s pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to be aware of is that resource mining depends on engineer skill level. Put a high-level engineer on the ship, and it\u0027ll mine ore fairly quickly. Don\u0027t have an engineer (or try to mine unmanned), and it will mine very very slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso I think areas near the poles tend to be more inaccurate due to pinching effects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:15:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think op is talking about 1k ore in half a second... that should be by no means desired behavior regardless of concentration/engineer.
