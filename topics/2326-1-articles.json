It fixes a few long-standing issues with the atmospheric model, and changes the folder structure for the Mac version, so that now a Mac version of PartLab is possible and mod install procedures are the same regardless of platform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=2547.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe full changelog can be found here.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oneinsider","CreatedById":2540,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-13T23:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Woo!

It opened early (~750m instead of 500) and didn\u0027t slow the capsule down as much. The warning light was blinking on and off pretty regularly until I got below 150m, then the velocity finally dropped stably below 13.3m/s and the light turned off. Landed safely at 13.1m/s, which is still nearly a full m/s faster than in the old atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
