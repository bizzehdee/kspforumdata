Then, put one of those side attacher thingys ( what ever the thing that is currently under your docking port, forget what those are called) under the docking port, and build the rover from there. Then your can save it as a subassembly and the attachment point will be on the top of the rover. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Erebus","CreatedById":101587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T01:31:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor some reason it duplicated an image instead of posting the one where I attempted that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting from a decoupler and a radial attachment you still cant connect the rover body horizontally to the attachment point which you can kind of see where I tried placing a fuel tank under the lander\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T02:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you try turning the part with wasd? or shift wasd for smaller?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T02:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always use a Modular Girder Segment as my Root part for anything I want to turn into a sub-assembly. This gives me the proper orientation that I want to build in, and I can plop on a docking port (Or anything else for that matter) and I am guaranteed to have a free node. As for the radial attachment thing, you are going to need to point your camera straight up beneath the docking port. This is done by moving your craft to the top of the VAB, and rotating the camera such that it is looking up and zooming out a bit. Then place your part (It follows the mouse pointer) and you will notice that it clips through the port, at this point just use WASD to rotate it into place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Erebus","CreatedById":101587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T19:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks taki, the bit about looking straight up was all it took.
