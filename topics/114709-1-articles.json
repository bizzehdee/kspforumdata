And in particular, manned ones?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Asteroid Day mod requiring that the telescope be located in Kerbolar orbit, it made me wonder about the real life applications of such orbits besides debris dumping. Obviously the real version of the Sentinel is one such application. But then I wondered about space stations, and what purpose one would have, especially if it was manned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, it seems like keeping it supplied would be even more difficult than it would to supply bases and stations in orbit around other planets (because you don\u0027t have that handy planet with a nicely sized SOI to get captured by), and outside of fuel depots in the outer planets I just don\u0027t see what else you could do with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T00:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA solar station is 90% pointless.

The gravity is rly low and it might be safer and more fuel efficient (since you need correction burns) to just anchor with it or only visit it with small crafts and keep the station away from the dust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut sure, I don\u0027t see why a station can\u0027t orbit an asteroid.
