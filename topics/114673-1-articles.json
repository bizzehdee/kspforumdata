Since I don\u0027t want a converter on the part I\u0027m making (and because data isn\u0027t a resource, sadly), it seems like I need to make a plugin to allow me to see how much data is stored, as well as to handle the data management. Unfortuantely I don\u0027t know the API hooks. \n\nThe current KSP API website seems out of date, and the only references to data are to the pre-1.0 mechanic. Could anyone point me in the right direction?\n\n(Sorry if this is an unreasonably difficult request and/or I\u0027m missing something very obvious; I\u0027m new at this.)"}]}
