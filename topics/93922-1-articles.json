In a rendezvous mission, there will be an object to target. In the missions that reads \u0022put such and such an object into such and such orbit\u0022, then the orbit is indicated in the star map, but there is nothing to \u0022set as target\u0022.

Wait till the KSC is under the target orbit, then try to launch into the correct inclination right from the start - you can watch from map view and adjust your direction north, east, south, west, whatever, till you\u0027re at least nearly matching. Once it is matching, just keep ascending in the direction of your prograde vector; just make sure it\u0027s in orbit mode. It\u0027s slightly complicated by the fact that you have some eastward velocity already, but watching the map view you can correct it pretty close to what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T18:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Habalabam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Habalabam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, they are shown when you have a target orbit.

I found it more efficient to do radial or planar maneuvers high-up. I did a lot of orbit jobs recently and found them rather trivial once you get hang of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get to circular LKO \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Open map view, center on Kerbin and move view until An/Dn nodes on target orbit overlap. Click on your orbit at point where they overlap and set up maneuver node. This is to project An/Dn on your orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Burn at that node to raise Ap close to target orbit An or Dn, only a bit lower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When close to Ap, do a plane change to match target orbit. (you may again do an/dn-overlap trick to better see point of intersection)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When you tackle inclination, immediately do a circularization burn until you get an intersection with target orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Small radial burn slightly before intersection point will align both orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.

Only initial Ap-rising need to be done with some accuracy, maneuvring high-up is cheap and its easy to pack up small sat with lots of spare delta-v, so don\u0027t be afraid to just try things.
