Just upgrading the lowest-tier buildings to second-tier costs over 2 million Funds, which is WAY in excess of what most new players are likely to be able to make with the limited options available to them with such entry-level facilities. In fact, the pricing scheme is about (by my estimate) 10 times too high for new players to handle. That said, some particularly dedicated players are bound to like the excessive challenge presented by such high upgrade costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus my suggestion is both simple and elegant: drop the default prices for building upgrades by 1000%, and implement a slider on the Difficulty screen that allows you to adjust building upgrade purchase prices the same way you can rewards and penalties.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T03:49:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 03:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SkyRender\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T03:49:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe building upgrade prices already scale with difficulty, but don\u0027t have a visible slider.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T03:52:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Supernovy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Supernovy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe building upgrade prices already scale with difficulty, but don\u0027t have a visible slider.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Be that as it may, a slider definitely needs to be implemented.
