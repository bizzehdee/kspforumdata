I think a better alternative would be to remodel the smaller two to make them thinner. That\u0027s the big reason I use the 2.5m stack separator over the decoupler on my service modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think with career mode and money, stack separators should come first and be cheaper. While decouplers would keep space cleaner, they\u0027d be mid-latish tech and be expensive compared to stack separators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just my balance thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T17:23:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think a better alternative would be to remodel the smaller two to make them thinner.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not clear to me in what sense would making them thinner be a better alternative. Thin or thick, they\u0027d still make a piece of debris after separation. My point is to get rid of that debris.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
