For the most part it\u0027s been smooth and I\u0027ve gotten fairly good at it, but today (while working with the single simplest model I\u0027ve made yet) I ran into an issue with normals in unity. The model looks fine in 3ds Max and sketchup, but even after normal smoothing in unity it develops harsh, warped seams apparent both in unity and in game in most lighting conditions. No amount of normal smoothing/other alteration to the import configuration has proven to resolve the seams regardless of what else is damaged. They will remain present even with 180 degree normals.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022P0ILkw1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/P0ILkw1.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Jc5K5f9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jc5K5f9.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe seams seem to correlate with where the triangles get narrower to deal with the curvature in the windows, but I\u0027ve never had this problem to this extent before and never with a model that didn\u0027t have a huge number of awkward faces. Note that the pod attached to the part in question fits the formfactor (the faces on both match properly with standard 2.5m parts), and its normals are fine despite far more complicated geometry. The only explanation I\u0027ve been able to come up with is the boarder between the broader, simple triangles and the complex ones. I\u0027m skeptical as to that actually being the problem, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be noted that while the windows are inset\u00A0into the side of the fuselage, the model is otherwise a normal, linear cylinder with flat faces like any fuel tank. As such the issue at least \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E have anything to do with actual geometry, as even the complex triangles should be coplanar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to the\u00A0cause and/or resolution of the issue? I\u0027ve only seen it one other time, in which it appeared as a minor imperfection on one side of a very complex pod. This case is much more severe and at least appears to be symmetrical based on the angle of lighting. Presumably I\u0027m doing something wrong somewhere, but I\u0027m not sure what it could be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther details:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe windows and fuselage are skinned separately (planar vs cylindrical), but the seam appears to be consistent across the two anyway.

I suggest doing some more reading up on Normal Maps before attempting to utilize it. Specifically Tangent Space Normal Maps, which has the characteristic Blue back ground. There\u0027s maybe 1 in 1 million occasion where you attempt to create a normal map by editing RGB channels manually, the other 999999999 times it\u0027s tantamount to mental suicide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe short of it is the R channel pushes the pixel\u00A0normals left/right; G channel pushes up/down; blue pushes in/out. Problem is every 3d package and game engine have some different way of implementing Tangent Normals and some use R-255 for Right, some use R-255 for Left, same goes for Green. And for the most part, game engines don\u0027t even care about the Blue channel. Good thing is game engines can handle the internal conversions it needs as long as you give it the correct normal map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
