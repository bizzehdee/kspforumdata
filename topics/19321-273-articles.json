If you\u0027re going to get these pitch-up problems, you\u0027ll have bad pitch derivative numbers and a misplaced Cm line. Just the AoA sweep that you posted alone is enough to say that it was going to go heavily unstable at moderate AoA; you can get away with a hint of Cm inflection if you\u0027ve got sufficient pitch authority, but once it starts shooting up like that it\u0027s game over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you had a poke at the \u0022How to use FAR graphs\u0022 part of the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbodyne\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E build tutorial?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Too much\u0022 vs \u0022too little\u0022 is always tricky. There does seem to be a fair tendency for KSP builders to err on the side of \u0022too much\u0022, though. Too little wing means high AoA, high takeoff speed, slow turning. Too much wing is excess weight, excess drag, excess fragility and possible aerodynamic complications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a general rule, the more conventional the airframe, the easier it is to get the aero right. There\u0027s a reason they built them that way. The benefit of a delta is that it\u0027s very good at maximising lift while minimising drag; the tradeoff is that deltas have crappy stability. You didn\u0027t see a lot of successful deltas in the pre fly-by-wire days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make most things work with enough fiddling, but when in doubt, use the design clich\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also helps to think about the problem in terms of basic forces. If it\u0027s pitching up, there\u0027s too much lift at the nose and not enough at the tail. So, either remove lift from the front, add lift to the back, or extend the nose or tail to alter the position of the lift relative to CoM (thereby increasing or reducing the leverage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, if it\u0027s yawing, you need more tailfin drag at the back.

When the aerodynamics are highly non-linear, this leads to situations where the CoL / CoP / Aerodynamic Center shifts heavily with angle of attack, and definitely cannot be expected to stay in the same position for all angles of attack. This is especially true for hypersonic flight; in subsonic and supersonic flight, Lift \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C2 AoA.

The Voodoo flies well, until you get it into a high AoA spin, in which case it\u0027s a deathtrap (which seems accurate, woo hoo!).
