Using what looks like an incredibly complicated setup, scientists have not just figured out how to transport information using the quantum highway; they have actually made it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, such teleportation experiments were either slow, or there was information loss in the process. This new experiment procedure eliminated both of those concerns; the team transported a \u0027cat\u0027--Schr\u00C3\u00B6dinger\\\u0027s cat to be exact. No, it wasn\\\u0027t a real cat, but instead were wave packets of light which represented Schr\u00C3\u00B6dinger\\\u0027s cat, a paradox in which something has two states at the same time (the cat is both living and dead)--a condition called called quantum superposition. Quantum computers work (or will work) by storing data as quibits which can represent one and zero at the same time; this would allow them to solve multiple problems simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do this, the researchers developed a \u0027broadband, zero-dispersion teleportation apparatus\u0027 and a whole new set of \u0027hybrid protocols involving discrete- and continuous-variable techniques in quantum information processing for optical sciences,\u0027 along with some other things that I completely do not understand. In the end, the researchers managed to \\\u0027remove\\\u0027 the quantum information from space, and it was resurrected in another place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only did the \u0027quantum information\u0027 exist in a state of quantum superposition, but the transfer was quick. Check Science (you\\\u0027ll need a membership or you\\\u0027ll have to pay for the article) to get all the nitty-gritty details!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe research was led by University of Tokyo researchers from the Department of Applied Physics, with some intercontinental assistance from the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology at the University of New South Wales.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElanor Huntington, a professor at the University of New South Wales who participated in the study, says that \u0027one of the limitations of high-speed quantum communication at present is that some detail is lost during the teleportation process. It\\\u0027s the Star Trek equivalent of beaming the crew down to a planet and having their organs disappear or materialise in the wrong place. We\\\u0027re talking about information but the principle is the same--it allows us to guarantee the integrity of transmission.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs she saying that not only will we be able to transport information on a global scale almost instantly but that we might also be able to transport objects? It sure sounds like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuntington goes on to say, \u0027If we can do this, we can do just about any form of communication needed for any quantum technology.\u0027 In other words, quantum computing is just around the corner!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I am very excited for this new discovery. Just by looking at the picture above you can see the insane amount of effort and intelligence that must have gone into producing this study. In other words, the future is bright for humanity!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT! This is not \u0027true\u0027 teleportation in a physical sense, it is simply a \u0027theoretical teleportation\u0027 needing an actual A-to-B bridge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, now scientists can, for example, control the Mars Rover with a joystick constantly instead of having to input a code every 5-20 minutes. Instant internet. Can you imagine it? We could send a ship into space and give it energy from here. Or HD television for astronauts in other planets. It is the future happening before our eyes. Another example: you are an astronaut on Mars and had problems with your command pod. You don\\\u0027t have to wait until they send you a recording every 20 minutes, it is isntant communication. And there also is quantum computation.
