In fact, turbo boost clocks up to that by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, My I5 2500k is sitting at 4.8 GHZ on air, with temps at load around 72C*which is safe. 80\u002B range will start to be bad.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Big benchmark is Intel Burn test or Prime 95, but be warned, it CAN kill your processor if your cooling isn\u0027t up to snuff. Those two benchmarks are for testing stability of an overclock. My processor tops off at 87C on intel burn test, but is stable. Average load is fine. Prime 95 tests your processor\u0027s ability to calculate large algorithms while at the same time pushing its temperature further with higher and higher memory buffers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, if your pc is ONLY using water and a radiator, and no fans, there is a problem with that as well, as the radiator can\u0027t disperse heat very fast. Works great until it heats up, then gets worse and worse, until it performs less than air equivalents. using canned air to get the dust out of that will do wonders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, temperature does not seem to be the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final note, 300 fps is technically impossible for your monitor to display. FPS limits are directly linked to your monitor\u0027s refresh rates. Most monitors nowadays are at 60, while more expensive monitors reach 120 Hz. When Vsync is off, that limit is \u0022emulated\u0022 by the video card. you will never physically SEE it go higher than your monitors refresh rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to re-install unity, maybe it is corrupted in some way.

I don\u0027t think any benchmark would\u0027ve been able to reveal this though, owell.
