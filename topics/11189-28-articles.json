After that I leave kerbins orbit and once I am 1/3 to 2/3 on the way to Duna I adjust my vector so I get close enough to Duna but also make sure I intercept at the equator. This usually dont cost more then 13-70m/s of delta V. Then when I intercept Duna I make final adjustment and it will cost very little to. Thats the way I do it with my Falcon X Jumbo or any other craft. Witha good intercept of Duna 11.5Km altitude works well most of the time for arobreaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Time warping slower especially when ever your about to intercept a planet will reduce the floating point errors and your Pe will end up closer to the predicted vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that annoys me with the current engine and intake setup in KSP is that its even more unrealistic then intake abuse to some extent. First off a jet engine is not 1m long its at least 5-6 times as long. Second is the fact that you dont use ram air intakes for a jet engine. You use a nosecone or similar for high speed craft or a intact duct that will reduce the incoming air to subsonic speeds for it to work with the Jet engine. So raimair makes 0 sense because a jet has its own compressor and it requires subsonic speeds. Even sens they added intakes they used no known logic behind it at all. Also the fact that engines are limited to intake air with some bucket system rather then Temperature and altitude makes even less sens. Real jets at Mach 3 have problems with temperature first of all but also the fact that they need intakes that reduces the airspeed to a working subsonic speed so ramair makes no sens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what we actually need is proper intakes that are altitude limited first of all that would make intake abuse well not working at all. Sure if you had on intake for two engines you could get a less well preforming craft but once your at say 2x intakes per engine there is no more gain to be had. Could also differ from intakes to intakes. Would be smaller once where two equals one big etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we would need a precooler to even make efficient SSTO spaceplanes realistic. Thats whats needed IRL and thats whats being tested for the Skylon. Part exist in KSP as fare as I am concerned but it has 0 use atm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see that jet engines overheat and either explodes or shuts down when exceeding mach 3 for longer periods. Going past this would require t his precooler part that would be 1m long at least and 1-2 tons sens its the heaviest part of a precooled jet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I use intake abuse I use it because KSP stock wont allow for efficient SSTO spaceplanes the way they the once under development IRL would work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntakes atm are unrealistic and counter productive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least when I stack 10 of them in a row with cubes and have a jet behind it I get a total size at least closer to a real jet engine and I have to make room for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo intake abuse might be more efficient but if you just dont stack intakes on the same intake giving the same volume as one it still requires some added engineering and the howl power plant requires more space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also much against intake abuse before I gave it a closer examination but the fact that the way intakes works now is at least as unrealistic as intake abuse if not even more and I dont realy see why one should not use it if one can get more work done with less engines etc. Only real problem with intake abuse is the big part count that comes with it and the fact that engines dont overheat at high speeds due to the 1000C intake air on would have at mach 5.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have no problems with people not wanting to use intake abuse. I didn\u0027t either and I still dont like it but I dont like the stock idea of intakes either. Its like they say, its crap either way because both are just as unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can just hope for more realistic intakes and precoolers in the final stage of the game. If not Im probably going mods by then to solve that problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-20T01:13:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2013 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carazvan","CreatedById":73074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T03:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPresentation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 stock SSTOs for your enjoyment all weighing in about 7t (weight on runway) with 3 different propulsions to complement the turbojet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlea (Ion), Fly (RCS), Mosquito (fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/BVb45\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I hope that in the future versions of the game they will add in Ram and Scram jet types, since those are the only type of engines that would be suitable to use on SSTO\u0027s for high altitude supersonic speeds. The fact that most of those jet\u0027s can\u0027t function without air being \u0027rammed\u0027(hence the name) into them, is an interesting challenge I would very much like to try out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pa1983","CreatedById":58328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T07:31:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I recall, scram jets are pretty inefficient and requires high speed just to fire up.
