I had tried to add in some shots of a cool barrel roll from both inside and outside the cockpit. I just couldn\u0027t make it look right. Even using the camera mod to manage the roll, it just looked kind of weird. The whole project kind of stalled when I discovered that Blender craft file importer script (now addon). It is my new obsession ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) Maybe sometime soon I can do a major rework using Blender to animate extra scenes into it."}]}
