I leave the engines running throughout the whole maneuver, meaning from the runway into full circular orbit while keeping the spaceplane nose as close to the prograde marker as possible. This is essential to build up speed when going with a low TWR of about .60 to .70. A spaceplane with more TWR is usually a fuel leech. Using this technique i get cargo of up to 35% of the launch mass into 85 km orbit... meaning a 100 ton of launch weight from which 35 tons are cargo. I have never done that with a more aggressive spaceplane (not with one, that has actual use and is not designed for a challenge run - there i have seen 50%...)\n\nThe trick is, to circularize very early, say at an altitude of 55.000m. Then you need VERY low thrust (below 10%) to increase your orbit. On multi-engine setups it saves fuel when you can switch off engine pairs during the insertion burn.\n\n[Edit] However, i am curious. What craft:payload ratio do you get into orbit and what is the TWR of your craft?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T09:23:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 09:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frank\\_G**"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T10:28:40Z","Content":"So far i didn\u0027t lift anything into space with a spaceplane (i mean in 1.x), and this thing barely manages to lift itself into orbit.\n\n![GriePQ9.png](http://i.imgur.com/GriePQ9.png)\n\nBut, interesting, when you say you circularize in the upper atmosphere, maybe you could try to lift your apoapsis from 55 to 75 just with a change of angle of attack and use the engine to then lift your periapsis out of the atmosphere .... will play more with that :-)\n\n(and then 1.1 resets everything ...)\n\nk\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOk, i changed the tanks and now have plenty of delty-v for orbit and back.\n\nBut to the lifting force effect: it\u0027s definitly strong enough to lift the apoapsis from 60 to 68 km just by coasting at 2000m/s with an AoA of 20-30 degrees between 40 km (engine cut off) and 60km altitude.\n\nAm not quite sure about the consequences to the ascent profile though ...\n\nk"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T12:35:25Z","Content":"I usually target an apoapsis of 85 km, as i park my orbital stations and construction sites there. At the moment i am trying to build a miniaturized version of my Delta II spaceplane which lifts 41.25 tons to 85 km orbit. This here is the prototype of the miniaturized version. Currently it lifts everything you put in it beyond a 100 km orbit, but i have nearly nothing left for orbital rendezvous...\n\nThe ascent profile is like this: \n\nThe spaceplane takes off at 130 m/s, nose pointing at 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and then climb to 15.000 m. Then the nose is pushed down slowly, so the plane levels at 21.000 m to go beyond 1.600 m/s. Then it switches to the closed engine cycle and the spaceplane gets pulled back up to 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and throttle is rapidly reduced immediately. I hunt the apoapsis at roughly 40 seconds distance until it runs off, after periapsis appears... then i continue the slow burn until i am in orbit.\n\nYour configuration isnt much different from mine concerning engine power and fuel mass. Try exchanging a long LFO tank for a short LFO and an LF tank if you like. This will give you the chance to build up more speed in jet mode in the upper atmosphere. This is pretty essential (at least for my type of ascent profile).\n\n![4LEoX7u.png](http://i.imgur.com/4LEoX7u.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T12:55:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E The ascent profile is like this: \n\u003E \n\u003E The spaceplane takes off at 130 m/s, nose pointing at 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and then climb to 15.000 m.

I\u0027m only just starting to mess around with spaceplanes in 1.x and I\u0027m surprised this approach works so well for you ... I shall try it and report later. In 0.90 and earlier it was certainly worth doing a flat, low-thrust, burn to circularise in the atmosphere, but that was making the most of jets\u0027 fuel-efficiency. In 1.x, once on rockets (or closed-cycle rapier) I would have thought you\u0027d want to gain altitude as soon as possible to get out of the draggy air, then circularise. With rapiers, especially, TWR isn\u0027t an issue as they\u0027ve got to have the high-drag jet punch anyway, so must have enough rocket power. The main thing is not to climb so steeply that you lose the horizontal velocity you\u0027ve previously fought to gain of course. Again, I shall check what results I get with a flatter rocket-stage climb.\n\n(to be slightly baffled by the failure of the SPH engineer, KER and MJ to recognise that my wing-mounted fuel pods do, actually, feed the engine so I have plenty of dv, thank you very much computer ^^).\n\n========================\n\nETA, for below: yes, I understand the low TWR, but rapiers (as I see in your ship pic) have a higher TWR as rockets than jets anyway, so I would have thought you\u0027d have the punch for the climb. I\u0027m hoping it works for me - always keen to get better results :-)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T13:19:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 01:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T13:05:25Z","Content":"A shallow ascent is essential for my type of spaceplane design, as i usually go with a very low TWR (below .70) which makes them very fuel efficient.

I start the main acceleration, once the plane reaches an altitude of 8.500 m. Getting through the sound barrier can be tricky at low TWR though... with some designs, you first climb to 12.000 m, then enter a shallow dive to punch through the barrier. After reaching 350 m/s acceleration is no problem anymore. This way, you use less fuel and carry less weight, because you need fewer engines (and lesser fuel mass). However, i am talking about heavy cargo spaceplanes here. It might be easier for a light and tiny craft to just go by raw power.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThe main rule is... To fight air pressure, go as slow as possible - To fight gravity, go as fast as possible. So as long as your plane is in a somewhat horizontal position, going slow is more efficient. Once the air gets thinner, the acceleration kicks in automatically."},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T14:22:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi there,\n\u003E normally i\u0027m more into rockets than spaceplanes but every now and then i try one.

The gains in apoapsis you are receiving are not free. I would bet that you are paying for it with angular momentum. That is, you are not also increasing your periapsis at the same time. You may get to space today, but your circularization burn will cost you more dV.\n\nOn a side note, 30 km is about the altitude I flatten out during my *descent*. Many folks talk about lowering your periapsis to 30-40 km and then killing your velocity with airbarkes. I use a burn that places the ground intersection of the orbit at KSC. I spend little time in the higher ranges of the upper atmosphere and keep my AoA around 20\\*. By the time I hit the thicker air around 30 km, my orbit appears to be taking me directly into the mountains west of KSC. And I would hit them without the lift at that point (probably burn up first, but the end si the same). \n\nAngular velocity is exchanged for vertical velocity as drag and lift equalize, and the orbital path begins to \u0022flatten out\u0022, raising the periapsis and pushing the orbital ground intersection past KSC and into the sea. My horizontal velocity remains about the same during this, but my (negative) vertical velocity is drastically reduced.

The R.A.P.I.E.R.s rapidly loose thrust at altitudes above 18.000 m. Try to go in more shallow and build up speed in the denser atmosphere between 16.000 and 20.000 m of altitude. You should easily break 1.500 m/s. And it is no problem to go in a shallow dive if you are above 20.000 m... trade 500 m altitude for 100 m/s velocity and you saved a lot of precious delta V, when switching to rocket mode.\n\nAnd yes... too bad with KER.
