They are quite snappy and responsive to the mouse, and the editor is lag free. I suspect you may have some other issue, such as graphics settings too high for your system, or a bad GPU driver, or something about what you are doing. KSP is quite playable on that old system, if I choose appropriate and reasonable graphics settings, giving 50 FPS and green time dilation for simple scenes (e.g. single medium complexity craft in active flight, but many flights on rails).\n\nSome more detail on your system, your mods, and just what sort of craft you\u0027re editing is in order, I think, if you want to be taken seriously. Do you have problems with graphics options turned down, no mods installed, editing a small to medium sized craft, with a small payload fairing? If not, which of those factors has to change, and by how much, before you experience problems?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T06:01:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not a problem for me, so there is no problem at all.\n\ndisagree with your logic, sir.\n\nif there was an option to disable the animations, I would."},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T06:31:14Z","Content":"The fairings are working fine for me too, without any lag.
