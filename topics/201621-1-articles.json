His cursor was still there, but the blue dot that showed where a maneuver node could be placed was absent. They were very confused, and even switched to other vessels to see if this was just the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPioneer\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E problem. But it wasn\u0027t. No vessel could make a maneuver node!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Turns out I\u00A0just broke the f\u0026amp;%#*ng\u00A0game. No idea how.
