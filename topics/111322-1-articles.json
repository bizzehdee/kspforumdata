After 6 months on the game I never even tried to do anything useful. Today I decided to try and finally make the leap. I read the tutorial on the first page of the tutorials section, and got into orbit on my 5th attempt (\u002B Mun flyby ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)*just)*, but I have a load of mechanics type questions now.\n\nFirst, this is my success/failure:\n\n![cH0TsUq.png](http://i.imgur.com/cH0TsUq.png)\n\nNo matter what I do, those RAM intakes keep overheating, I was lucky not to lose them all. Is this bad flying or design or what? Maybe I can solve the ascent but the decent is hopeless, then burn up every time. How were they not made for this?\n\nThe second question is: how am I supposed to know how much air the intakes will give? The engine stats say 5.354 units of air per second for each engine. But then the RAM intakes say 1.0, what does this mean? It can\u0027t be 1 unit per second or all the tutorials would be wrong because we\u0027d need 5 per engine (!!!!). Also in flight, when I right click an intake, it says 0 units on the green bar, but the engines are still functioning (in fact thrust is increasing). Confusion is rife. This is the main question of the thread, I\u0027m the kind of person who can probably just get it if actually given the numbers.\n\nNext problem was actually designing the thing to have 4 intakes, the above is so ugly, and the radial intakes aren\u0027t good enough to just have 2 RAMs.\n\nThen it\u0027s the flight plan, I\u0027ve read how to do it and it seems hit and miss when I try, sometimes I can\u0027t get up to speed, sometimes I burn up. Most frustratingly the RAPIERs like to switch to rocket power at 15000 or so, which is earlier than the tutorial says, and sometimes it goes at just 13000 - I know I can do it manually, but surely this means that the engines had lost most of their power quite early because I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s how they choose when to switch.\n\nAngle of attack is a big puzzle.\n\nAs I said before, the thing I just can\u0027t avoid is overheating, how to I do reentry???\n\nFinally, the general structure, how much wing do I need? That is one of my biggest problems, I find it impossible to judge if I\u0027ve got enough lift. Thrust you can judge by speed etc. I don\u0027t know how to work that out.\n\nAnd what proportion of LF to LFO should I use? One tutorial said half the entire weight of the craft should be LFO!?\n\nMy theory so far is to have the CoL 10% behind the CoM with fuel roughly evenly dispersed and ideally the cargo and variable mass parts should go as close as possible to the centres. This good? I\u0027ve just be guessing as best I can.\n\nThanks in advance. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T23:56:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 11:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MathmoRichard**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T00:57:31Z","Content":"Use airbrakes to ease the reentry process, it makes it much easier to slow quickly enough that you don\u0027t overheat.

One intake per engine is plenty in my experience, if you want more you can use the inline intakes that hold fuel, like the precooler.\n\nFor wing area, with a Mk2 fuselage you need very little as the body lifts as well, your design looks to have about the right amount.\n\nFor LF:O ratio, I find having about 20% more units of LF than O to cover the airbreathing portion of the ascent to orbit works well.

That is the same emissive constant as other good radiator parts like wings and solar panels.\n\nReading why the heat model works the way it does is like reading tea leaves. However, I think the precoolers are best near the intakes because they are getting small overall of amounts of heat but the intakes still tend to explode, so the nearby heat emission helps them not explode so much. Meanwhile, the engines generate much more heat internally and seem to be better when in closer contact with a larger fuel tank to act as a thermal sink.\n\nIt wanting to come in forward but you leaning into the wind is what makes the cobra entry bleed off speed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T12:27:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 12:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T20:35:45Z","Content":"So I would love to give more updates, but this happens so much I can\u0027t do anything!! ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n![lI9cZxl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lI9cZxl.jpg)\n\nIt just falls apart whenever I put it on the runway now ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T20:58:58Z","Content":"Yeah, the Mk3 joints are made out of silly putty.

My strut plan on planes is currently:\n\n1) Stitch together the outer edges of the wings if using the component wings\n\n2) Struts to transfer load from the back gears to the body\n\n3) Struts to secure the cargo\n\n4) A couple of 2x symmetric struts may still be needed in key places to hold the body together.
