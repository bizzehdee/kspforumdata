I say limit it to 1 engine but give the people the ability to use whatever they like to as long as the engine only uses LF. If you ask me clipping is a part of game and i really don\u0027t understand why people are so against it? Besides now that we have new aero you can\u0027t really clip intakes one after another. Even intakes that are half clipped inside the craft gives appropriately less air and drag as some of their portion is blocked and the game simulates that. Clipping creates clever and innovative design choices that improves the performance. Did you know that keeping your landing gear open creates less drag? I would rather clip the landing gear than keep it open to gain performance due to a dumb bug.

So you end up using the controls to constantly pitch down a bit (for my entry I couldn\u0027t leave it alone for more than 15 seconds or it\u0027d start gaining altitude like crazy), which, at least for me, is the most fun thing to keep doing for 10 minutes.

The first one was kinda a combination of a small aircraft while doing it as fast as possible. This time I focused more on efficiency. It is still a mere 3.1 ton, but have a few changes. Larger wings that are also angled a bit up, and another intake that I drained of fuel (to minimize the weight, but could be even less after seeing the amount I used.\n\nSo I landed in about 13:16 (The 1 m/s speed is because I landed up a hill, and forgot to put on the brakes and it rolled backwards. I was confused and did it 10 seconds later.\n\nBut more importantly the final fuel consumption ended up with 67,66.\n\nBy strategy was: Slower accent to 22.000 \u002B- meters, at around 1/3 thrust to minimize the huge amount of fuel needed for ascent. Flying at a pretty stable height of 21.500 - 23.000 meters, with a speed of around 1340 m/s \u002B-. That combined kept the fuel efficiency at around 0.06 to 0.09 units per second!\n\nAnd at last I cut the thrust quite a bit before landing to save fuel descending through the atmosphere again! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![screenshot191_zpsvrle7bn4.png](http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot191_zpsvrle7bn4.png)\n\n![screenshot201_zpsa07w4jxq.png](http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot201_zpsa07w4jxq.png)\n\n![screenshot195_zpsrga7coaj.png](http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot195_zpsrga7coaj.png)\n\n![screenshot197_zpsbuogzaeb.png](http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot197_zpsbuogzaeb.png)\n\n![screenshot198_zpscexshvbm.png](http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot198_zpscexshvbm.png)\n\nPS.
