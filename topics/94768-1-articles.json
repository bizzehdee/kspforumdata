The problem I\u0027m having is that the settings.cfg file isn\u0027t being followed. After getting this bug with only editor extensions installed, I figured I\u0027d go back to basics with a fresh Install, I checked the camera sensitivity inside the vab \u0026amp; on the launchpad; in both cases normal. With no changes to settings made, I launched ksp again, only to be blasted by the music at 1000% (that\u0027s what it said in the options menu). After reducing ALL audio settings back to the previous value (all values were at 1/100th of the faulty value, so I set the music volume back to 10%), I entered the VAB and did a sensitivity test with the camera. I\u0027ll just say it wasn\u0027t anywhere near stock. What would have been a 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 change in perspective, became almost a 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 change (checked mouse hardware sensitivity, to ensure that that\u0027s not the cause). Same glitch with the camera on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, it\u0027s like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efresh install\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st launch of ksp; all is normal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd launch of ksp; volume beyond funny and camera sensitivity nowhere near acceptable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured that perhaps ksp somehow changes the settings file upon closing ksp. So I did another fresh install, launched ksp, checked settings, did resolution change, pressed both accept and apply, and then, without closing ksp, set the settings.cfg file to \u0022read-only\u0022. Despite this drastic measure, KSP still boosts the volume to extremes and the camera sensitivity problem still persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValues of the influenced settings (at least as far as I can tell) as they are in the config file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVAB_CAMERA_ORBIT_SENS = 0.04\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVAB_CAMERA_ZOOM_SENS = 0.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFLT_CAMERA_ORBIT_SENS = 0.04\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFLT_CAMERA_ZOOM_SENS = 0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHIP_VOLUME = 0.40\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMBIENCE_VOLUME = 0.30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMUSIC_VOLUME = 0.10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUI_VOLUME = 0.30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVOICE_VOLUME = 0.20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Update: Problem solved thanks to vexx32\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T11:56:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 11:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by halrick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EProblem solved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T11:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might need to be launching KSP with the LC_ALL=C command; see the main \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELinux thread\u003C/a\u003E for details. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"halrick","CreatedById":74306,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T11:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou might need to be launching KSP with the LC_ALL=C command; see the main \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELinux thread\u003C/a\u003E for details. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!
