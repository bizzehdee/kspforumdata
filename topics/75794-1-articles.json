For some reason if you delete crew from the Crew {} section \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E your career is already underway it causes a completely unrelated bug to occur - the R\u0026amp;D building is closed and you can\u0027t run experiments (you get the message you would in sandbox mode). It seems like a really weird connection and I couldn\u0027t figure it out immediately because I had made several non-science related launches between deleting those 3 and trying to do some science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was only because I started keeping a backup at the end of each mission to guard against the kraken that I was able to run diff on working vs not working save files.

I removing differences one by one but the only difference that had an effect on the R\u0026amp;D facility was the crew list. By adding back the 3 deleted crew members the R\u0026amp;D building suddenly worked again.
