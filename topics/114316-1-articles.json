You are making money, growing in popularity, more streamers / youtube channels each day etc.\n\nWhy are you messing with the physics at this point?\n\nNo-one is suggesting Chess have new pieces 2000 years after it was invented. In your game Physics is the game. When you mess with the Physics you are changing the rules of the game. I am a member of a small community of players who love your game, and I\u0027m the only one who is currently playing it because of all of the problems with the physics that have been introduced. In 1.02 you changed the Drag. This made half the rockets no longer work, and you were supposed to change it back in 1.03 but you didn\u0027t we still have to go into the cheat menu and turn the drag from 8 down to 4. Now in 1.03 you added a broken heat mechanic. My rocket that I launched to minimus before the patch now just blows up on the launch pad before I do anything, and when I rebuilt it and got it to minimus, it then blew up when I left the ship to spend some of the obtained science, and came back. Hours of work blew up, and I\u0027m forced to either go get mods to edit the freaking save files or start all over. I understand you have a whole list of features you want to add. What I\u0027m telling you is that the majority of us are not Scott Manley and we don\u0027t freaking need more physics we need more to do with the existing physics that we understand. Give us more planets, further out, more game options, a bigger universe to explore, more science to research, etc. Don\u0027t give us more physics problems to solve! This is not science class its a game.\n\nMany developers play with mechanics to prevent players from burning through content too fast. If this is what you are doing, we see it and we know it and we dis-approve. Instead of writing a few routines that noone asked for which simply blow up our rockets on the launchpad, why not work on actual Content. You know a story line, more reasons to build more complex rockets etc.\n\nSorry for the Rant, I love the game and do not like where you are going with it. People who want realistic physics can go into their back freaking yard and build their own darn rockets!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T05:28:07Z","Content":"For every person demanding a stop to revising an aspect of the game, there is another person insisting that that aspect is unacceptable in its current state and absolutely must be changed.

However, when you fundamentally change what happens in the first few minutes of play (over...and over...and over again) for every single iteration of the gameplay experience post release, I do believe people are warranted in having a few complaints. Folks have invested major amounts of time both in creating vehicles, content, and tutorials on the basis of Squad telling us the game was ready for prime time only to have that rug ripped out from under them repeatedly.\n\nAnd yes, I played Terraria extensively. I consider what Squad is doing with KSP to be much much worse.\n\nAnd the strange thing is: I actually agree with many (not all...I think the new heat system is an overcomplicated mess) of the changes Squad is making. However, I think they should never have been made post-release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T07:09:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 07:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild**"},{"CreatedByName":"Megan","CreatedById":145770,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T07:09:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E KSP\u0027s frequent tweaks over updates past 1.0 are as nothing compared to the likes of what Terraria did and is still doing... no matter what your stance may be on KSP\u0027s frequent tweaks, it could be a lot more excessive.\n\nUm, seriously? The effects of Terraria\u0027s updates are *nothing* like the effects of KSP\u0027s updates, which is what the OP is complaining about. Whether you agree with him or not, that\u0027s just about the worst comparison I can imagine.\n\nI still have a savefile with the very first Terraria house I built. The walls are still standing in 1.2, and I\u0027m absolutely certain they\u0027ll be standing a week from now if I load it up in 1.3.
