Currently with 1.0.4 I get the 99.9% complete loading bar and then crash due to running out of memory. I also updated several mods to coincide with the new version so it could be a combination of the update as well as mods that are for various versions. KSP could also have been peaking at 3.9GB in 1.0.2 for all I know and then immediately stepping back under 3, there appears to be a threshold at the end of loading where the memory skyrockets before leveling out again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T14:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel playing KSP has taxed my memory a great deal.
