But when launching multiple lifters that were previously tried and true, they are now overheating and exploding before hitting 30,000 meters. And that is on less than 50% thrust!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspected that it was because Interstellar puts much more importance on waste heat, and offers a bunch of radiators to deal with it. However, the Wiki says nothing about conventional engine waste heat, only that from the mod parts. In practice, I stuck a bunch of radial heatsinks onto the lifter-- no effect; they are reading zero heat load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027m missing?
