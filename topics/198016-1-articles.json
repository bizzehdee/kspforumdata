This problem also expanded in to two of my other Unity based games from Steam (Hardspace Shipbreaker and Subnautica) but not for any of the others I\u0027ve had (like Battletech, Two Point Hospital), something I tried on a hunch after reading through the crash logs. I did not have any driver or Windows updates in between the last successful playthrough and final crash, and I\u0027ve since updated my GPU drivers, updated Windows, made sure there are exceptions for KSP in my antivirus software, made sure DirectX is up to date and I have the latest version of VC_Redist. I\u0027ve spent the better part of a whole day\u00A0trying to find the issue and have searched Google for every reference to the UnityPlayer.dll violation I\u0027ve seen in the crash logs, but there appears to be no solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have the remote desktop software that people with similar crashes have been getting, and I\u0027ve not had any memory errors detected. I have uninstalled and reinstalled KSP several times by now, using different hard drives and install locations outside Steam with no success. Rolling back KSP to an earlier version does not have any effect. Turning down my monitor\u0027s refresh rate to 60hz does not have any effect. Restarting the computer did not have any effect. Forcing KSP to use anything other than DX11 does not have any effect. Running the game as an administrator does not have any effect.\u00A0Human sacrifices to my desktop have also had no effect other than staining my carpet. The use of a professional exorcist has also had no effect other than finally removing the tormented spirits of the restless dead from my closer and ending that racket they would make every night.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLiterally nothing seems to work with this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DXDiag.txt is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/0mKMuvRr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, the error.log is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/i35MTGTw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and the player.log is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/qWP2uisd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.
