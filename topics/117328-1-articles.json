I\u0027m working my way through the tutorial and im currently doing the docking section. I have managed to get right up close to the stranded vessel within about 50m but can\u0027t get near it, i seem to keep missing it and go between 100m and 50m i use the sas on target ship as im so close and i seem to get almost upon it then it starts moving away. I am around 5m/s in relation to target and im going around in circles like a ballet lol. Please any tips how i can get myself stable to the stranded vessel, should i not target the ship in sas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for such a newb question but i\u0027ve been trying for a couple of hours and i just cant get that last bit done.

Just a note, it would be super helpful to include of picture(s) of your current ship/situation to let everyone help you a lot better but I have some general advice. First 5m/s at close range is much too fast, you want to be going ~1m/s max. Second, make sure you are in Docking mode by clicking on the middle tab in the lower left by the staging UI and have RCS enabled by hitting R. In docking mode you\u0027ll be able to much more finely control your movement using the keys you can find in the settings menu (forget them off-hand precisely enough for ya right now sorry) and should make things a heck of a lot easier when you get closer to other stuff in space!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T18:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo move toward the target burn on the target prograde \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/1/14/Target_prograde.svg\u0022 alt=\u0022Target_prograde.svg\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo slow down relative to the target burn on your own retrograde \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/0/02/Retrograde.svg\u0022 alt=\u0022Retrograde.svg\u0022\u003E with the navball in Target mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not necessary to burn on the target\u0027s retrograde \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/e/ee/Target_retrograde.svg\u0022 alt=\u0022Target_retrograde.svg\u0022\u003E, attempting to do so will have you flying circles around the target unless it is already aligned with your own retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T18:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOTOH the alternative to stopping dead by burning retrograde is \u0022chasing the markers\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMove quite a bit away, ahead of the docking port, then rotate towards the target, burn towards it and see where the prograde marker shows up on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing RCS controls (I,J,K,L) you can change your \u0022side\u0022 velocity - as result, \u0022pushing\u0022 the prograde marker around the navball.

You might need to adjust slightly when you get close, depending on what angle you\u0027re coming in at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!

Keep at it though, once you get a method down that works, it starts getting easier and easier to pull off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from the other advise already offered, the biggest thing I\u0027d suggest is patience. It\u0027s very easy when docking to constantly over correct because it can be hard to see the relative motion of the two vessels unless you really hit the gas, which you don\u0027t want to do. You want to ease your way in. If you\u0027re fifty meters or closer, you really should be keeping your relative speed under 1m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso when first learning to dock, I\u0027d suggest only adding velocity along one axis at a time. Be sure you\u0027re in target mode and use your retrograde marker to zero out your relative speed before closing to dock. That way if, for example, you translate right at 0.2 m/s, then you know you can come to a relative stop by translating 0.2 m/s to the left. If you add 0.2 m/s left, then 0.3 m/s up, then 0.1 m/s right, etc etc it gets very easy to lose track of exactly how your moving relative to the target and what you need to do to stop it again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course left and right are relative directions, which brings to mind the camera. Hit V to switch to chase mode so that up, down, left, and right are relative to the camera, which is always helpful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal bit I can think of is to make sure your target isn\u0027t rotating, which can lead to a lot of running circles around it chasing the docking port. If you know, or think even, that the target vessel is spinning, a brief moment of time acceleration will stop it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, you\u0027ll get it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Simmer","CreatedById":149132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T19:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid it guys, thnx for all the quick replies.
