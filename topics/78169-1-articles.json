The game thinks a test is complete by only firing the engine even without consuming any fuel. This idea came to me while testing the Rockomax 48-7S. I placed it underneath a science can fired the rocket and when i reached the test altitude/speed i only had to activate the engine without throttling or placing/consuming any fuel and the test was a success. This of course means you can save \u0027\u0027funds\u0027\u0027/parts when testing engine parts. My suggestion is when testing engine parts, especially liquid fuel engines/jet engines there should also be a time/fuel/resource requirement. Of course if you like role playing you can add resources to the engines but it just doesn\u0027t feel right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T12:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, that\u0027s designed in.

I have one where I have to test the parachute between 15000 and 19000 feet \u0026amp; going 300-500 m/s. Such a pain. The other one, which was really annoying me, was testing an engine between 16000 and 19000 going, iirc, 350-550 m/s, and I was failing it because I\u0027d be running the engine to get to that altitude \u0026amp; speed -- Didn\u0027t know I needed to activate it within that range, just thought I had to meet all the listed requirements (made everything green, didn\u0027t finish it, went wtf). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for a suggestion, some of the requirements could be a bit more specific in what needs to be done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and for a 2nd suggestion, a way to make the tool bar menus bigger (active contracts, resources, etc....the stuff in the top right corner). For me, it\u0027s a bit difficult to read and scroll to see all of the requirements mid flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027m off to get a booster up to 84000 feet and fire it off in a sub orbital trajectory....0.24 is awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T13:58:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Test confirms that engine will not run without fuel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Test confirms that jets will not work on Minmus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Test confirms that the PB-ION will not work without solar panels or fuel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Test confirms that parachutes deployed at hypersonic velocity in low atmosphere will tear the craft apart.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEtc, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
