Right now I\u0027ll start off with something simple: Dance of the Holyman.\n\nI did this recently, about 1.8 cycles ago. It\u0027s from Castlevania IV, but only arranged on piano, so not quite as impressive as the original.\n\nPlease give feedback on how this sounds to you. Don\u0027t be afraid to let me have it. An artists\u0027 growth depends on accurate feedback.\n\nHere\u0027s the link: [https://www.noteflight.com/scores/view/bf2215340671f0474f1f775bc7931e7a24a73072](https://www.noteflight.com/scores/view/bf2215340671f0474f1f775bc7931e7a24a73072)\n\nIf you have an account, you can also tell me there."}]}
