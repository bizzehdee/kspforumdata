Right now I\u0027ll start off with something simple: Dance of the Holyman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did this recently, about 1.8 cycles ago. It\u0027s from Castlevania IV, but only arranged on piano, so not quite as impressive as the original.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease give feedback on how this sounds to you. Don\u0027t be afraid to let me have it.
