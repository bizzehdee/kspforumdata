When I switched it back to VAB mode, adding or moving wings stopped changing the blue lift marker... but only in some situations, not sure how to explain that part... I went back and rebuilt the second stage using only VAB mode and that stage started flying correctly, but my top stage was still uncontrollable. The only mods I have here that are not built for KSP .25 are TVPP and KineTechAnimation but i removed them and still had the issue so its not them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm wondering if there are any issues like this with... even less moded games than i have here....
