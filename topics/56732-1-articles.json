I was hoping someone here could answer a couple of questions about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How many Newtons of force can it withstand?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What is the tolerance to radiation/ what effects might radiation have on it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What is the mass per cubic centimeter/ meter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Is there any way this could be transported in modular segments and built without the bonding substance I read about?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus additional information in layman\u0027s terms would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T18:40:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecould you maybe provide a link to where you saw this material?
