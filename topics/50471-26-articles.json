It took a dozen tries with most attempts either shooting out of the SOI or the entire stack coming apart because of stress. (and I dont even have DR installed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly enough as I type this, the probe core is still bouncing around on the surface so it may yet \u0027crash\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm... I haven\u0027t been to Laythe with RSS (and I haven\u0027t had a chance to even see v5 if that\u0027s what you\u0027re using) so I don\u0027t know what\u0027s a normal orbital speed around it. You might be able to reduce your encounter velocity a bit. Make sure that you\u0027re encountering it in a prograde direction and from a low inclination. The closer you are to a tangential intercept the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also be able to do something else here. Don\u0027t worry too much about getting captured in Laythe orbit in one shot, but try using its atmosphere to get a capture around its parent body (depending on version either Jool or Dres (Saturn)). Go out to apoapsis and use minimal fuel to get another encounter. Keep doing this and slowing down incrementally at each pass. This will obviously take a lot longer, but eventually you should have a more manageable encounter velocity. If there are other moons (so at Jool), you could also get a beneficial slingshot from one of them. NASA does this sort of thing all the time, for instance in the Cassini mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that you can try turning the vessel to its side while you\u0027re at the high part of the atmosphere to get a bit more drag, just make sure to bring it back to a stable orientation before the aerodynamic forces become too much to handle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
