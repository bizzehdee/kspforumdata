I\u0027ve been trying to use the Zenith launchers I\u0027ve found on the Spacecraft Exchange, but they can be a pain I have found to work with. Some of them have the probe on the top node of the ASAS so anything that you put on top is balanced on the probe like it\u0027s the head of a pin, making securing the cargo a pain. I went through sever iterations and even after I fixed the wobble I ran into another problem: The ship won\u0027t pitch during the gravity turn. Because of some weird torque on the cargo it stays stuck facing directly up. I do a whole re-do of the design, I try to launch and the game crashes and I never saved so I have to start over \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually I say **** it and use LAztec\u0027s Falcon 9 to try to launch it. I build the thing and discover to my horror that the launcher has an off center of lift, even without the cargo.
