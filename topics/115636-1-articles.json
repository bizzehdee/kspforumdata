Think about it like this, no human has ever traveled farther fr om the earth than the far side low lunar orbit of the apollo missions, a week away from earth. The longest station deployment IIRC is around a year.\n\nI managed to get maxed ou Kerbal sci in Normal mode in one kerbin year, with Valentina spending a majorty of the year going back and fotrth to the mun a minmus (Jeb minding the sci fuel station), kerbin year is 400 days but 6 hour kerbin days so that is roughly 100 days the pair spent in space. A Mars mission to a returnable mienos would take 2 or more years, you prolly could do a venus flyby in less time but such a mission is pointless. A mars landing mission proper assuming that fuel could be synthesis on Mars would take a decade. A ceres mission might take 5 years, but current rockets lack the effeciency to execute a direct hohmann transferi, landing, and direct hohmann return. So realistically we are prolly talking abou a 15 to 20 year mission with of Pe-gravity boost on Mars and earth to to get there and back. This mission is currently not poosible for biological reasons. The currently propsed mars missions are all suicide missions. IOW, a one way trip, no prospect of expanding a colony no prospect of having reproductively fit offspring. \n\nnote that the early apollo missions were dangerous, and 2 of the Russian astronauts were aphixiated when the capsule failed to sustain pressure during reentry. \n\nKSP would follow a model of a militarized space program.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What about being assigned to pump gas on Vall for all eternity?

IOW, a one way trip, no prospect of expanding a colony no prospect of having reproductively fit offspring.\n\nNot to mention that until we develop propulsion to the point where LEO is effectively on the surface, so that we can actually send the equivalent of immigrant ships (hundreds to thousands of people with all their household goods per ship with hundreds of such ships leaving annually), and actually have jobs and home lives for colonists when they get there, the whole notion of humanity colonizing space is ludicrous. This is what the dreamers fail to realize. There are all sorts of good ideas for moving stuff in high volume from LEO to anywhere we want. Some of them might actually work. But getting meaningful quantities of people and their stuff to LEO is never going to happen, even with foreseeable technology.\n\nGet used to Earth. There ain\u0027t no leaving it except for meaningless flags and footprints.\n\nTOPIC SAVE: And this is why I enjoy KSP, because LKO is no big problem. I have no idea at all why anybody plays it RSS or any other rescale because any step in that direction just clips the wings of an imaginary universe where meaningful space colonization is possible.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I was thinking the same thing, vagrancy laws followig the onset of the little ice age....the use of petty crimes to colonize undeveloped regions of the world.
