Consider, for example, the SLAM / project Pluto / the flying crowbar involved a 600 Megawatt reactor at nearly 1300 \u00B0C being used as a 35000 lb thrust ramjet, comparable to the engine of the F-35 on full afterburner.Th\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003Ee reactor was 1.5 meters across, so I think making a 150 kN nuclear ramjet at 1.25 meters and several tonnes is pretty reasonable.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EWith regards to putting it at the endgame, maybe for a nuclear aspirated rocket, but if we\u0027re going for realism here, the Convair X-6, powered by a reactor running props, flew by 1955. The Tu95LAL, a similar aircraft built by the USSR, flew in 1961. The fully functional Tory-IIc engine was tested in 1964. All of these projects were shut down due to the development of practical ICBMs. Far from being endgame tech, nuclear jet engines were around before we got to the moon. Additionally, chemical jet engines are finicky by comparison. A chemical jet engine needs to atomize a\u00A0fuel stream and mix it into a fast- moving airstream in such a way that it efficiently burns inside the engine\u00A0and leaves sufficient oxygen for the rest of the fuel. Combustion instability is the single most significant reason Scramjets are tricky to make.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EBy comparison, a nuclear turbojet is little more than a sophisticated hairdryer. Heating elements heat up whatever goes in, exhaust is used to turn a fan to suck more air in, and the cycle continues. No fuel flow, no combustion instability, and a number of mechanical parts you can count on one hand. Technically, you could literally just strap a nuclear turbojet to the outside of a plane and it would work, although in practice, you\u0027d want to allow monitoring and control of the reactor by the pilot.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-25T01:17:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2016 01:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSgt Baloo","CreatedById":154529,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T01:21:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelevant:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Pluto\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Pluto\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso relevant:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_Low_Altitude_Missile\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_Low_Altitude_Missile\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, also, also relevant:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://jalopnik.com/the-flying-crowbar-the-insane-doomsday-weapon-america-1435286216\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://jalopnik.com/the-flying-crowbar-the-insane-doomsday-weapon-america-1435286216\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T01:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222377778\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130628\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453679490\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002224430\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temstar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Temstar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDual-mode nuclear engine is a good idea, problem is it makes certain really challenging aspect of KSP (eg: Eve ascent) really easy.
