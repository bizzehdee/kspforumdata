The Circular Intake appears to be a slightly inferior choice, however not so much so as to dictate design - if you prefer the Circular Intake for aesthetic or other reasons you will not be hobbled by your choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radial intakes seem to show the same clear results in this test as in the first - a pair of XM-G50 radial intakes appears roughly equivalent to the best you can expect of a single inline intake. The new Structural Intakes appear to be a substandard choice but again not one that would cripple a design - indeed the slim form factor of the Structural Intakes perhaps opens up other design possibilities, for example one may be able to fit more of them under a wing than the XM-G50 radial intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFinal thoughts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA weakness of this test design lies in the flight profile chosen: it\u0027s quite possible that different intakes will perform better or worse under different flight profiles. I reached upon the 0.1/70/1/20 flight profile after three test flights to tweak settings and purposely wished to limit my fine tuning of this profile so as to avoid inadvertently tuning the test to best suit a particular intake choice. Nevertheless the first two test flights were performed with the Shock Cone Intake and a third test flight was required with the Structural Intake to tweak the flight profile such that it could achieve a 75km orbit with any delta-v to spare. Thus it\u0027s possible I\u0027ve advantaged the Shock Cone Intake and the Structural Intake by tuning the flight profile to favour these intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/313-Beta-Than-Ever-The-Future-of-KSP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP devs have noted\u003C/a\u003E that future updates will be steering more toward balance tweaks, and include a fresh look at the aerodynamics system in use.
