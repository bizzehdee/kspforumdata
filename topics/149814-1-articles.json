Make your lander squat and wide, especially the landing legs.

Have a decent Mun \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Not excessive, because it gets hard, but landing a BIG ship on one Terrier, or using the ion engine to land is hard. Generally though, 1 to 3 Terriers is a plenty for Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. First inefficient thing: nix your horizontal speed. When in Mun orbit and above a place you wish to land at, click the Speed display to switch it to Surface mode, then burn towards the horizon in retrograde direction until it stops dropping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Nix your horizontal speed totally. Again, inefficient because braking this early IS inefficient, but it takes the burden off your head later on. With most of horizontal speed removed, you start falling. Switch \u0022Retrograde\u0022 on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on, and throttle gently up - enough so that your speed still keeps growing (gravity stronger than engines). Your retrograde marker will be crawling towards the center of navball.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Keep a safe speed. When your altitude is \u0026lt;5,000 throttle up so that your speed slows down below 100m/s. Try to keep the speed (in m/s) roughly at 2% of altitude (in m), using the throttle. Err on the safer (slower) side if you see the ground close. Generally at all times use the throttle to keep the speed from growing or dropping too fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Orient the camera to the sunlit side of the craft and observe the ground for shadow. When you can see the shadow, you should slow down to some 10-15m/s and keep it there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. As the ground approaches (shadow gets closer to the ship; plumes of dust rise) reduce the speed to 1-2m/s, then throttle down enough so that it\u0027s RISING very slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Touchdown at ~2-4m/s and shut the engine off immediately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0- Do NOT try to touch down at 0 speed. Your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is in retrograde mode, and as soon as your vertical speed is zero, your retrograde marker goes into whatever microscopic remains of horizontal speed are there, somewhere around the horizon. And \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E follows.

Vertical crashes are far less frequent than tumbling. It\u0027s the primary reason of crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- vertical speed is easy to keep in check with fine throttle use. Keep your fingers off these X, Z. Only Shift and Ctrl, and only gently!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Overreacting is the second cause of most crashes - a situation that is perfectly survivable if not optimal (say, ship descending at 6m/s the last part of the drop) can be turned into a disaster by overcorrecting. You press Z, your ship shots up, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E turns you retrograde = towards the ground, BOOM. The ships on the landing legs side are sturdy, they can take some punishment. They won\u0027t survive running full throttle into the ground upside down though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Once you touch down, switch the engine off - even if you do bounce. Use reaction wheels, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, whatever, but keep the engine OFF and make sure you\u0027re not fighting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Correcting after a bounce using the engine is very difficult and very easy to botch. If your lander isn\u0027t a spindly tower, gravity will do all your stabilizing on its own if you only let it - by switching the engine OFF.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- there IS such a thing as too much thrust. It may be difficult to keep the precise control of throttle if you have too high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.
