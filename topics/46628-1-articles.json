However, as the developer of Kethane, I\u0027d prefer this \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E be done by the stock game. Remember, the stock game \u003Cem\u003Ealready\u003C/em\u003E has a common map interface (hint: it\u0027s the one Kethane, RemoteTech and MechJeb all use).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is something addon developers can do as needed. Since ISA is currently unmaintained, I\u0027d argue it\u0027s not currently needed. If someone wants to create a 2D map view and integrate it with other mods, they should speak with the developers of those mods to work out the details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] To elaborate on why I\u0027d prefer the stock devs not touch this: Adding a stock system would \u0022lock in\u0022 mods to using that system for fear of otherwise being incompatible. Given that addon devs can\u0027t even agree on a common system (yet) and the market for such a system is quite small, I think it\u0027s much better to let it evolve naturally. If we ever reach the point where \u003Cem\u003Etoo many\u003C/em\u003E implementations exist, that\u0027s when the stock devs can build something into the game.

Kethane abandoned the 2D map view because it was unintuitive and the texture format was highly problematic. Even if another mod starts using 2D maps, that\u0027s just \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E because ISA isn\u0027t being actively developed anyway, so there\u0027s no way for it to integrate with the new mod. Like I said, if we start getting too many systems, we can work on merging them. For now, we have two distinct methods (2D and 3D). In the 2D case there\u0027s only one contender, and in the 3D case the use cases are so wildly different that there\u0027s no unified API to build anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T03:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eo.0 Conforming Kethane grid?
