I mentioned v0.17 supported your own parts (that had no internals) but V0.18 has broken this support. I am about 80% through fixing the code to allow you to create your own internal-less freezer parts. But on a side note to that, there has been a fair bit of discussions about 4 kerbal, 6 kerbal, 8 kerbal parts. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to happen. You have to think about gameplay balance and the size of the parts..To be able to create a 4 or 6 or 8 Kerbal freezer you are looking at a part bigger than the CRY-1300 and smaller than the CRY-2300 (but not by much). Weight-wise there isn\u0027t going to be much difference. Now that being said, the original plan was for a 1,4 (which was changed to 3) and 10 kerbal parts. Once I fix up the next version you can go ahead and create your own X kerbal parts (although with no internal). But also there is a forgotten part here. Our original plans was for one more part. Which is a 1 kerbal RADIAL freezer. The idea of this part was you can slap it on the side of another part to change your vessel\u0027s freezer capacity. IE: Attach two of them radially to a CRY-1300 and ta-da you now have 5 kerbal freezer capacity. and so on... so given these two things I think there is more than enough support for everyone\u0027s DeepFreeze capacity needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Better support for texture replacer - I haven\u0027t started work on looking at this yet. but soon...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the older issue of Life Support Compatibility:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Life Support mod compatibility with DeepFreeze Continued....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far it is KNOWN that DeepFreeze works with Snacks!

As far as TAC LS goes - TaranisElsu has had my fix for several months and said he will look at it, but I have heard nothing. I do know he was working on a major upgrade to TAC LS, but not sure when that is due.

I mentioned v0.17 supported your own parts (that had no internals) but V0.18 has broken this support. I am about 80% through fixing the code to allow you to create your own internal-less freezer parts. But on a side note to that, there has been a fair bit of discussions about 4 kerbal, 6 kerbal, 8 kerbal parts. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to happen. You have to think about gameplay balance and the size of the parts..To be able to create a 4 or 6 or 8 Kerbal freezer you are looking at a part bigger than the CRY-1300 and smaller than the CRY-2300 (but not by much). Weight-wise there isn\u0027t going to be much difference. Now that being said, the original plan was for a 1,4 (which was changed to 3) and 10 kerbal parts. Once I fix up the next version you can go ahead and create your own X kerbal parts (although with no internal). But also there is a forgotten part here. Our original plans was for one more part. Which is a 1 kerbal RADIAL freezer. The idea of this part was you can slap it on the side of another part to change your vessel\u0027s freezer capacity. IE: Attach two of them radially to a CRY-1300 and ta-da you now have 5 kerbal freezer capacity. and so on... so given these two things I think there is more than enough support for everyone\u0027s DeepFreeze capacity needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Better support for texture replacer - I haven\u0027t started work on looking at this yet. but soon...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the older issue of Life Support Compatibility:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Life Support mod compatibility with DeepFreeze Continued....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far it is KNOWN that DeepFreeze works with Snacks!

I don\u0027t know if there is some conflict arising with one of the many mods I have or what but figured I\u0027d drop this in here for you. Just for info\u0027s sake, I tried each one of the freezers after getting this initial error and it repeated for all parts. None of them are working for me at all.

But why it is happening I cannot tell just from the error message.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d guess it\u0027s some mod conflict to do with IVA\u0027s or the actual Kerbals given no one else has reported this error.
