I have to go to bed now to be up early for an interview, so that will be something I\u0027ll tackle tomorrow afternoon. As far as testing tonight, it looks the water splitter in TACLS is able to use the resource, the water in the KSPI tanks are valid for TACLS, and the Refinery will collect water when splashed down in the ocean by KSC. I did not get the Ammonia\u002BWater -\u0026gt; H2Peroxide reaction to work after making the above changes. I tried transferring in some water and ammonia to the actual refinery to see if that made a difference and it still wanted water. I don\u0027t have any more time to fiddle around with this tonight, but I\u0027ll tackle this tomorrow.

Not sure about it yet so just thought I\u0027d throw it your way but the cargo bay doors in the B9 pack are only half working regarding your awesome idea of allowing the doors to act as radiators. The HL cargobay is working and showing up information in the game, but the S2 normal and the S2 wide cargobays are not. Not sure if it\u0027s just the information in the VAB missing or if they are plain not working? I\u0027m running 4.0C before it\u0027s been updated to 0.23 compatibility but even so one would expect them all to show the same info. I\u0027ve taken some screenshots for you to check out.

My code is correctly requesting the amount of Lithium to burn but the stock method simply returns 0, meaning it is not giving me any Lithium despite a connected supply being available. By time accelerating so that the amount I am requesting becomes larger, the method begins to work properly. Only thing I can do to fix this is to disable the code that turns off Tritium breeding if you have no Lithium - this won\u0027t fix the problem at low timewarp speeds - you\u0027ll still get nothing but it will, at least, allow non-focused ships and ships at high timewarp to generate Lithium.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it will be fine, most of ingame time is spent at high timewarps, and considering those fusion reactor changes a lot of people will do this on non-focused ships...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW tritium in fusion reactor is not decaying to He-3, but if i transfer it from reactor to external tank it does.
