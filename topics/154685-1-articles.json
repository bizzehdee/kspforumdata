One thing I\u0027ve noticed as I add mod part pack upon mod part pack is that some Mod designers just dump everything in one category or scatter their parts across a number of places. Currently I seem to spend a lot of time looking for parts when I\u0027m building a new rocket because the parts aren\u0027t where I\u0027d expect them. Is there a set of standards that define where a part should go?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd one other thing - could Mod designers say where the parts appear in the tech tree when documenting their mods? I like to find a part in the tech tree just to see whether I\u0027ve loaded the Mod correctly and saying where I can find the bits would help greatly in my search!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hypervelocity","CreatedById":136426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-08T15:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey mate!

That is what I\u0027ve mostly been doing. The problem is that modders don\u0027t seem to consistently place their parts within the appropriate \u0027bucket\u0027 - so what one refers to as payload, another might define as something else.
