You can find x64 enabled versions around, but ferram\u0027s dropping of x64 support is justified. The Win64 version of KSP will basically crash if you glance at it the wrong way, and that\u0027s with no mods. Many modders (including ferram) were getting flooded with support requests for which they had no solution because problem was with KSP itself and not with the mods.
