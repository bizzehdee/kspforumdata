I have been playing for 2 weeks now and have done alot of stuff such as landing on Mun, minmus etc but the stock visuals for the planets looked like crap so i downloaded these mods. Stock Visual Enhancement, Environment Enhancement, planet shine, scatter and Terrain Enhancement. When i try to load the game it works and loads up the main menu and i try to choose my save and when i click on it its taking more than 45min to load. It just shows the word loading and the three planets revolving around the sun. I know my pc can handle the mods but for some reason its been more than 2 hours and the game still hasnt loaded. There are no crash reports either and i have disabled other network adapters. Any help would be appreciated\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"something","CreatedById":157505,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T20:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume you do mean \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E when writing \u0022Environment Enhancement\u0022. Not sure though, if you are talking about the mod \u0022Scatterer\u0022 which adds realistic atmospheric scattering to KSP or if you\u0027re talking about the terrain scatter slider which adds rocks and trees (in the settings menu).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I know there are different files to download, depending on whether you use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E alone or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E in combination with SVE or similar mods. That might cause some issues, though not sure on that one. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E page states that it might create issues when using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E config files with another \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E based mod using different config files...so make sure to download the correct files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure all mods are combinable? Sometimes multiple mods cause weird stuff...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, you could always remove one mod at a time and see if that solves the issue at some point (if yes, then you most likely found the mod that caused the trouble)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, SVE, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and scatterer have \u0022some\u0022 impact on your system performance (depending on the system you use) - are you sure your system can handle the load, or are you maybe running out of RAM or something similar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
