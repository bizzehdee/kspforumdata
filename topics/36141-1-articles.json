The background: I have been taking care of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGerman Wikipedia article about KSP\u003C/a\u003E for the last months. Some days ago some sort of WP-Admin/WP-Fanboy decided to delete parts of the article (the \u0022Easter Eggs\u0022 section, to be precise) and mark the \u0022Vereinfachungen\u0022 (ger. \u0022Simplifications\u0022) section with a sign indicating that this section needed more citations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe had some discussions wether if these edits were done in an adequate manner, as I don\u0027t think that plumply deleting stuff isn\u0027t such. But I assume that everything I do to the article will be deleted if I don\u0027t do it exactly as WP rules require. I am sure that he has a point, though. And maybe, with your help, I can restore the information that this person deleted in the way it is unassailable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI plan on drowning this article with citations.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this purpose, I need links to written publications anywhere online but anything hosted on squad servers (because this could be counted as advertising).
