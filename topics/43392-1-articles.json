Sometimes adding a smaller fuel tank directly above your engine helps too.

BUT, some thoughts off hand: check engine size and placement, if they are too large and too close they heat up quick. also, and I had this issue using mainsail engines and those rockomax orange tanks over heating, if you put a smaller tank, same diameter between the main fuel and the engine that could help too. Guber K. makes some great suggestions too. also, try for a wider lander lander to spread everything out. beyond that pictures would be nice so we can fine tune our help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T05:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat everyone above wrote is good advice. Just want to add that another good reason to throttle down a little (max of about 80 to 90%) is that your fuel use will be stretched a little longer. This is true for any engine. As the others have asked, one or more pics would help us see exactly what you are experiencing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T10:40:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the engines on your lander are overheating then I would suggest that you are using bigger engines than you actually need. For a 3 man capsule, I find the Skipper engine is more than enough to get them to the surface and back again, and doesn\u0027t suffer from overheating. As to tipping over, try and keep your lander as short as possible to keep the centre of mass low, and fix your landing legs to give as wide a footprint as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
