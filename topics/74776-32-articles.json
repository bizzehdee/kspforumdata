Too silly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSS Kerman is a relic of days done by, one of 12 still in service to defend Kerbin from one of the greatest threats the world had seen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was once a period of Kerbin history where all of Kerbin kind was in fear. A world divided, this period was called the Kold War. It all started when two ministries had met up \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor diplomatic discussions over tade, airspace and what would be for lunch on Tuesdays. The argument had just gone from Tuesdays to Wednesdays and why Thursdays were such a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebad idea when someone let one go. That someone was Kold Kerman, he had meatloaf in the cantine, and it was a Friday. The smell was so horrific that many of the dignitaries \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epassed out from asphyxiation. The talks about lunch ceased there and then because everyone was just so put off. Soon after word got out about the stench a mass hysteria rose up \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the community about post lunch Fridays, meatloaf and the outcome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone stated pointing fingers at everyone else, even the lunch staff in the canteen, most fingers were pointed at Kold. The opposing ministry, the one who preferred Wednesdays \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eover Tuesdays, started accusing the other ministry of suicide farting. As a result, many were afraid of either side using stench-chemical weapons in retaliation. Many economists were \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eworried about the cost of all the millions of tons laundry that would have to be washed should either side use a WMS (Weapon of Mass Smelliness). No one moved, no one dared to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebreath, the world was silent. Then someone farted... a great war broke out all over Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeapons were made and stockpiled, ships were mass produced, aircraft were rolled out onto airfields, and meatloaf was off the menu for good. Then one grave and frightful Monday, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eafter a smelly war had ravaged the face of Kerbin, a geat being appeared in the sky. Attracted to the foul odor, the enormous leviathan descended to the surface warping physics and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecausing havoc all over the world. Planes would suddenly disappear with out a trace, ships would spontaneously combust, and pens would spill ink all over shirts. It was then, a brave, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esmelly, and ink covered Kold would load all the remaining meatloaf into a large rocket. Into the great maw he would fly the suddenly disintegrating craft, personally guiding the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelicious warhead to its final destination causing the Great Space Kraken to blow off flatulently off into deep space, never to return. With Kold Kerman a hero yet lost forever, every \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst Friday was deemed Kold\u0027s Day. The two ministries joined back together forming the now United Kerbin and decreed that Snacks were the official food for lunch everyday.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-27T20:35:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2014 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Eskandare\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T21:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo that\u0027s not remotely silly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T21:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...
