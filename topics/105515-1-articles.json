Though the additional information should be added to the game regardless as it is pretty essential to making a proper rocket without complete guess work and yoloing it, which is honestly not very user friendly. \n\nThat being said, for everyone who says \u0022oh but but Mechjeb is cheating!\u0022 Uhhh no, not really. I consider it another form of simulation and role playing. You see. IRL the pilots, engineers, scientists, and even ground control have what you call Mathemticians who give them the coordinates, burns, and all that jazz Mechjeb gives you... So no it\u0027s really not \u0022cheating\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T04:41:21Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure mechjeb is trying to kill my kerbals. \n\nIt\u0027s been doing weird things, particularly on the ascent guidance.

Launching a few times manually to get a feel for things with a new rocket design is crucial before jumping to automation. \n\nAlso, some of MJ\u0027s commands are interesting. \u0022Limit to terminal velocity\u0022 in launch guidance does strange things - because drag (and therefore terminal velocity!) goes up when turning a rocket, this command makes the rocket cut thrust when turning. This can either be annoying or deadly, depending on your design and launch settings.\n\nI\u0027ve been having problems though - MJ refuses to display windows (\\*most\\* of the time.. sometimes it works) in the VAB, which makes assembly harder.

It can be quite effective (depend on the ship design) and make orbital rendez-vous trivial if you use it as a robot. If you want to play manually it can provide a lot of interesting data (delta-V, apoapsis, periapsis, true altitude, vertical velocity etc) allowing to fine tune your ships and missions.\n\nMechJeb only remove challenge ... if you want it to."},{"CreatedByName":"3Dave","CreatedById":102832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T15:20:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I still think its important to learn the fundamentals of the game.

Is the game still challenging?\n\nIt\u0027s as challenging as you want it to be. \n\nThe way I look at it, you wouldn\u0027t catch NASA sending a crewed vessel on an interplanetary journey without computer-assisted flight controls. Sure, they could do it all themselves if they *really* wanted and were *really* careful, but it\u0027s a lot easier and safer to just input a command or two and let the computer pull off the manuever. I can do pretty much everything myself (though my interplanetary transfers are usually pretty bad and need lots of adjusting), but using Mechjeb makes it less work and more game. I fully understand and respect the desire of some for an intensely realistic hardcore experience, but personally think that experience stinks, much as they would think my easy mode experience stinks. It\u0027s just a matter of preference, although you will encounter some who label mechjeb users as heretics who should be burned at the stake. Don\u0027t mind them.

Certainly not the whole bundle.
