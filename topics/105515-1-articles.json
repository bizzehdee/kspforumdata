I can do pretty much everything myself (though my interplanetary transfers are usually pretty bad and need lots of adjusting), but using Mechjeb makes it less work and more game. I fully understand and respect the desire of some for an intensely realistic hardcore experience, but personally think that experience stinks, much as they would think my easy mode experience stinks. It\u0027s just a matter of preference, although you will encounter some who label mechjeb users as heretics who should be burned at the stake. Don\u0027t mind them.
