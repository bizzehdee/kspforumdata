This is a simple misconception. In terms of length, they are exactly the same size. I scaled them down to 60% to fit with the scale of the stock game, as a lot of other mods do. The reason they seem like the wrong size are because the T404 trusses are like three times the size of the ISS integrated truss. The equivalent of the ISS integrated truss would be closer to the T202 trusses.\n\nTo be honest this wasn\u0027t the original intent when I started KP. I just wanted some large hollow structures to attach crafts to and took inspiration for the design only partly from the ISS truss. However, that changed as the mod progressed, leading to the T404 standardized version. To add to the variety of designs I added the T202 line which is simply half the diameter of a T404 segment. The intent at the time was to put most of the emphasis of the mod on T404. But recently, I have wanted to move away from that and instead move closer to the ISS truss system for various reasons that I\u0027ll explain shortly. For now I\u0027ll just say that I plan to narrow the purpose of T404 trusses to be what they were in the beginning of KP, serving as docking bays or shipyards.\n\nI plan to add more parts to T404 that increase its capacity to do just that. T202 will be much closer to the ISS truss system, but a little different. The ISS various truss segments like the S0 or P1 vary in diameter between 4.2 to 4.8 meters in diameter.  So, at the low end that would transition in ksp to 2.5m to 2.88m at the high end. I could round up or down. I decided to round up. This way the established size of T202 (a 3.75m octagon) remains the same. T404 and T202 are octagons instead of hexagons to allow for 8 points of symmetry.\n\nIt\u0027s my belief, that when you build with T202 parts the solar panels will feel just right. When you build with T404 I want you to feel like you\u0027re building something massive, and not just a scaled up version of T202. That said I want T404 to make the leviathan solar panels look average in size. That way you know you\u0027re building something BIG. I don\u0027t plan to scale up everything to that size, because I think the contrast will make for a better experience of scale. T202 won\u0027t be just an ISS replica part, however. I want to appropriate the thinking behind the design of the ISS. The ISS truss purpose is to be a structure and an unpressurized storage system. The other modules like Destiny or Unity are pressurized. So, we could say, unpressurized things on the ISS look angular, and pressurized things look round. So, I want to change things a bit going forward to reinforce that thinking. The CM1 then should be round (yeah, I know. However, the change won\u0027t be coming until after 1.1).\n\nThere are people that really like perfectly symmetrical designs when they build, they also like when things perfectly match or align. I personally don\u0027t need things to match, but I\u0027m not judging. I think contrast is interesting so I don\u0027t mind a square peg in a round hole. Kerbodyne Plus is informed greatly by my personal aesthetic. I like industrial structures like oil rigs and 1970s era hard sci-fi like Silent Running and Solaris. So, it\u0027s no surprise to me that I ended up making a mod that has a lot of emphasis on big clunky utilitarian forms. And, looking back on the progress so far, I think that is exactly what\u0027s cool about this mod. There aren\u0027t many mods that have a focus on structure. I want to go further with that. Hopefully you guys do too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-03T23:01:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2016 11:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bonus Eventus**"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T19:08:18Z","Content":"I\u0027m enjoying this mod, so keep it up.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)  (Though, if you\u0027re making a nearly 4m octagon, could you match the size to the USI parts?

So, my plan was to provide attitude control gyros for T202. I think adding monoprop storage would make sense. As for T404 I want to do something else less streamlined for attitude control. Not sure how that will work. \n\nAs to other mods, I want to avoid doing that as much as possible. It really complicates the design process when you try to match other mod designs (a constantly moving target) and color schemes. However, this is where having obvious and different transitional parts can help. For example, going from a octagon to a square to another type of octagon. That\u0027s part of the reason I\u0027m adding another bulkhead type T101.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-03T19:28:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2016 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bonus Eventus**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bonus Eventus","CreatedById":115722,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T19:40:50Z","Content":"On a different note.
