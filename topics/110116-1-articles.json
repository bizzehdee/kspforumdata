It depends on your CPU of course. Dual core doesn\u0027t mean twice the power, that is the misconception people have, but never the less running KSP on 4 or 6 cores is going to show some noticeable improvement over running on one core. The specific areas of improvement will be areas where calculations are time constrained. A CPU core can only process one thing at a time and everything must wait its turn to be processed, with 4 cores you can calculate 4 things at a time. Time constraints usually result in either lag, such as part count lag (caused by the computer attempting to calculate physics on everything in the vicinity and not being able to get it done fast enough) or bugs, which developers call \u0022Race conditions\u0022 because two process are racing to finish first and when noticeable it is because the wrong process won. An example of this is the one where time warp moves faster than the game can calculate physics resulting in messing up your trajectory as you cross sphere of influence (which was fixed by other means in 1.0 btw).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, you should notice some improvement.
