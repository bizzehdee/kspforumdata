I duly built a rescue vehicle, launched it, got to the Mun, and no Bill, no dead vehicle. No, wait, Bill isn\u0027t even on the missing list. He\u0027s right back in the launch rotation. This is not the first time it\u0027s happened. Under what circumstances does the game harvest what it sees as \u0022dead\u0022 missions?

There are some bugs that cause NREs, which effects the game\u0027s autosave ability. If that happened and even if you managed to quicksave, if the persistent file didn\u0027t update then your game might appear the same as before you ever launched. I\u0027m not sure if you happened to keep track of the kerbal date when you landed to see how that compares to the current date...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlowThought","CreatedById":109317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T16:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not yet met the kraken (that I know of).
