(And then never went to college. Sorry, Dad.) One of the courses I took while I was there was Foreign Relations. The subject for our course term paper was to summarize the foreign policy engagement between the United States and a randomly selected country since World War II. I drew the People\u0027s Republic of China, which even in 1985 was no small feat to summarize in a four-page paper. So, of course, me being me, I left it to the day before it was due. (I mean, come on. I was 17 years old. I was on the other side of the country from home for six weeks. There were girls everywhere. I had \u003Cu\u003Eway\u003C/u\u003E more important things to do than write term papers! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) So I formulated a thesis for my paper, went to the campus library and checked out an armload of books on United States relations with China, and went back to my dorm room to start writing. I started pouring over the books to get cites and references, and I gradually start realizing that there is nothing in these books that is supporting the points that I want to make in my paper. I finally come to realize that these books are completely useless to me. Just in time to look at my watch and see that the library closed five minutes ago. So I said, \u0022Okay. Well. What can I cobble together from what I have.\u0022 So I start going over the books and trying to put together something to turn in. And it isn\u0027t working. I\u0027m throwing away outline after outline, getting increasingly desperate. Finally, at about 12:30 at night, I\u0027ve been at it for ten hours, and I have nothing. My brain was totally fried. And I just said, \u0022You know what, I don\u0027t know what else to do. I\u0027m just going to go to bed. Maybe I can come up with another plan in the morning.\u0022 So I went to bed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI woke up at 4:00 in the morning. I bolted straight up in bed. It was like the Knowledge Spike had streaked down from Heaven and struck me in the brain. I literally woke up with a fully formed outline for a paper that was completely supported with the sources I had right at the front of my brain. I went to my desk, wrote down the outline, then started writing. I finished the paper at 7:45. I had barely enough time to pull on some clothes and run across the campus before class started at 8:00. I got a C\u002B. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E That was probably the most extreme case of procrastination I ever got away with.
