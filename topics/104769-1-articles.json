I made a copy of it in another folder and started trying to tinker with it. I play with a lot of mods and they aren\u0027t really fitting together well in terms of when parts were being introduced in the tech tree and when different contracts are popping up. So I\u0027ve been trying to figure out how to shuffle things around to different locations and playing with a probe first arrangement. I\u0027ve also been looking at the balance of different parts. Just tinkering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question. Looking at the CFG files for the engines, is there a way to control their restart capability? Basically I was looking at ways to distinguish first stage booster engines and upper stage engines. It\u0027s not trivial to make an engine that can restart in flight at zero gravity. It was a significant innovation in tank and engine design. Not all engines are capable of multiple restarts. Is their a way to set an engine so that it can be started on the launch pad or while under positive acceleration but then not restarted once it has been shut down? Why? Well it kind of separates the later upper stage engines higher in the tree. You can still do things earlier in the game with small solid fuel upper stages which is historically accurate in terms of the early satellite launches. Even the second stage of the titan Gemini had to be started while the first stage was still running to give it positive g\u0027s. It would just fit in better with my probe first tree that I\u0027m playing with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T17:22:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERO (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99966-0-90-Realism-Overhaul-8-3-1-2015-094\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERealism Overhaul\u003C/a\u003E) does this, so yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51880\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEngine Ignitor\u003C/a\u003E does it (marked for 0.25, but it works in 0.90).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T17:26:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 05:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
