Then work your way tracking the unknowns. If it\u0027s not the right size, untrack it. If you have several of the desired size, look at their trajectories and see which one looks most convenient. Leave the track for it and untrack the others. Then go catch it. Once finished, repeat the above steps if you want to catch another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroids can be totally ignored if desired because they do no harm.
