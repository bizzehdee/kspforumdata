This requires two separate crafts (seaplane \u0026amp; boat). Make sure that the docking ports of both crafts are the root part. This is important! If this is done, just open the seaplane in the editor, click \u0027open craft\u0027 again and look for your boat but instead of loading the boat, you choose the \u0027merge\u0027 option.
