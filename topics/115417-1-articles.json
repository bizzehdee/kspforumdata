Its not an issue of lack of SAS / reaction wheels, since you can still manually steer correctly. I also seem to remember it did a decent (but not perfect) job at holding the current heading, but prograde / retrograde didnt work at all. I dont know WHY this happens but can confirm its not an isolated incident in 1.0.4. I\u0027ve also had a similar problem as this in 1.0.2, making me think this is a long standing bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont think this it tied to a specific SAS unit, as when this happened to me a lvl 2 Jeb was piloting and I didnt have SAS iirc. It also doesnt sem tied to RCS use, as I had RCS off (asnt even on this craft) and it still happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that fixed this for me was actually returning the flight to kerbin and recovering and launching a new flight.
