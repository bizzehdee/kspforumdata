I originally got my PC as prebuilt over 4 years ago now. To be fair I was kinda dumb about PCs still and it was on a deep discount. So, it only had a Ryzen 2400G and a GTX 1050. I\u0027ve already upgraded the RAM (8 to 16GB), GPU (GTX 1050 to a GTX 1660 super), and a whacked out PSU from Best Buy that I\u0027m frankly surprised hasn\u0027t blown up yet. Only compounded by the fact I was gifted a new 1080p 144hz\u00A0monitor. My 1660 super can just barley run Ultra 60 FPS, let alone 144FPS. Being a prebuilt I\u0027ve done pretty much everything I could to upgrade it. I was hoping to last a little longer with my current system, but this might just push me over the edge. Still I can\u0027t wait to buy KSP 2 day 1 and try it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LHACK4142","CreatedById":208897,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-18T08:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224234190\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676708042\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is probably enabled only on high settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen why haven\u0027t we seen this kind of detail in months?
