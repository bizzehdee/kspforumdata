Uncommanded roll in any KSP craft is usually caused by structural flexing due to improper strutting or bugs. The common roll often seen with asparagus staging is because the parallel stages are flexing back and forth, causing the thrust vector to change, causing roll. Every rocket with parallel stages will roll a small amount, regardless of struts. The problem is, because KSP\u0027s gimbal algorithms only calculate pitch and yaw, most rockets that rely on engine gimbal for control have dramatically less roll authority, too little to counteract the roll caused be flex.Almost every single KSP aircraft rolls slowly to the left. This is caused by a bug in KSP that makes the left part of a symmetrical group have lower connection strength, making that part bend more, because in KSP, connection stiffness is proportional to connection strength. It is more apparent in large, heavy aircraft, where the structural flexing is more pronounced. To reduce the roll, strut your wings more to reduce flex.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T18:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMOAR SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aP4z0XI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aP4z0XI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously though if it\u0027s spinning you need more things that can apply torque to correct the spin.
