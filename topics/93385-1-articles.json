I love it, it works great for me, and it sucks that it has that bug right now. To be fair though, I play career near stock so I can safely run on a 32 bit without memory crashing. Another important thing is that the devs are not in control of that. The instability lies within Unity itself, not KSP, and is something they can\u0027t actually do anything about. We\u0027re all holding our breath for Unity 5 which think we might see as early as late January, and we hope will have a stable Win_64 client. Until that time though, the devs CAN\u0027T make a stable 64 bit because the instability lies in Unity. Its like if modulemanager didn\u0027t work in a version. Every mod dependent on it would be broken. Its not that the devs don\u0027t want to work on a 64 bit game, its that they CAN\u0027T work on a 64 bit game, and that sucks because we (and Squad) are effectively at the mercy of the guys at Unity, and I wouldn\u0027t hold your breath on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for difficulty, Squad has to know that it\u0027s flawed with the number of threads making our complaints known. I expect to see a rebalance of building prices and stuff as early as next update if not a hotfix. Additionally, I do think your thoughts have merit in the department of toggleable building upgrades. You\u0027re right, we have so much customization on difficulty as it is that giving us that toggle (or even choosing a starting tier) would be a huge perk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also go as far and say that when starting a new game, the system should make the default difficulty preset \u0027easy\u0027 rather than normal, because normal is actually a bit challenging. I play on normal because I choose not to grind hard mode, but I\u0027ve disabled crew respawn and auto-hire. I can\u0027t get to the Mun unless I upgrade my tracking station, my VAB, and my launchpad, and thats just for a flyby.

As we indicate in the readme, KSP Storefront and a few other places the win64 platform is incredibly experimental and is the absolute bleeding edge of the platforms we support for KSP. To put it concisely, we offer win64 for those that want to give it a go, but can\u0027t guarentee that it\u0027ll work for all or at all. We find this to be a good middle-ground between having a community-led initiative for the win64 platform and the eventual full support from us for the win64 build/platform. In my personal, not professional, opinion it seems somewhat unwise to not play a game absolutely and miss out on new content due to an unstable optional platform, I would simply just use the win32 option until the win64 one was stable enough. However, opinions are just that, everyone\u0027s is different. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bigred\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bigred\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you guys worked hard on this update and I congratulate you on what you\u0027ve achieved, but to be bluntly honest I do not like the whole \u0022upgradeable building\u0022 thing at all.

I completely understand and appreciated what you\u0027re saying. Up until now you\u0027ve played KSP in a certain way, with a certain flow, but now that flow has changed. I can only really say that this is a side-effect or \u0027drawback\u0027 to Early Access sandbox-based games. Essentially, because you\u0027ve played the game somewhat backwards, starting with sandbox, then having career mode come about and create a mehanic of progression for the player. In most cases this allows the player to go from basic, barebones gameplay and evolve to playing with the complexity of the sandbox mode. Obviously there is much more that comes in over this time, the framework for a career mode namely, but at its core this is the main mechanic that changes as development progresses in the game and it appears to be the main mechanic that \u0027jars\u0027 most players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to think of it in the following manner, feeling that this somewhat validates the above hypothesis: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you (the player) started playing KSP when 0.90 was released with the upgradable facilities mechanic, would you find it odd or would you dislike said mechanic? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the above were false, then that would suggest that it is in fact that you have become accustomed to the gameplay mechanics that you had available throughout career and while the upgradable facilities mechanic isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Einherently bad\u003C/em\u003E, you dislike it because of the lack of familiar mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s definitely something to think about for all, I think. Not in terms of conclusions to draw from it or gameplay changes that need to be made, but in what it says about in-development games and how the player reacts to changes to the game that were planned from the start, but fundamentally change the way it\u0027s played.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bigred\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bigred\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENodes....another thing I\u0027d like to decide whether or not to start the game off with and not have a choice in the matter.

While it\u0027s beneficial to a new player to not solely rely on the nodes to play the game (as is the case with Pilot UI as well), it\u0027s also extremely beneficial for new players to have the nodes there so they can use them as a learning mechanism. To me, both are equally important and both need to be equally satisfied with an implemented solution. Currently, I think that the former benefit is more satisfied than the latter and this isn\u0027t necesserily a bad thing, but something that \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E be tweaked in the future development of Career. Cases where we could tweak them would be if we had another, earlier, level of facility in the Space Centre, that allowed the player to unlock nodes earlier - only ever doing basic sub-orbital or orbital mission on Kerbin without them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, it\u0027s a good example of an mechanic that can be moved about and still have its benefits wherever it is, but it\u0027s about finding the point where it benefits the most players and fits in well with the gameplay progression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bigred\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bigred\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe careful listening to those on these and other forums who constantly demand more challenging experiences/realism, we are not all super-players here with multiple space stations around every celestial body or wizards at creating monstrous and or unique crafts.

Unity, the SDK and game engine we use to develop KSP, is in fact a 32-bit environment to begin with! The editor is a 32-bit application on all platforms it\u0027s available on (only Windows and OSX currently) and so naturally when we\u0027re testing KSP in-editor it\u0027s a 32-bit instance of it. To go off on a slight tangent, this is one of the reasons that it\u0027s so difficult to track down win64-specific issues - the editor is a very key part of the debugging process. Anyway, I would disagree with the statement that it\u0027s both 4014 and 32-bit programming is \u0022legacy\u0022. One could say that C programming is legacy as well, but it greatly depends on why you\u0027re programming in C - it\u0027s only legacy in certain applications, just like 32-bit programming. I\u0027ve not seen the numbers in all honesty, but back in about 0.19 when we had Windows 32-bit OS specific issues, there were a suprising number of players that encountered these issues and were thus likely to be on a Windows 32-bit OS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while that\u0027s only two components of any discussion that would relate to supporting win64 over win32, we can see that already there\u0027s significant reason not to go full-steam with win64. The issue of the Unity editor being 32-bit is a very, very significant one and there are numerous other hurdles that we\u0027d have to jump over to solely develop a win64 build, tossing out win32. As usual, an initially simple-looking issue is actually composed of many, many complicated and difficult issues to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, thanks for the post and I hope I\u0027ve answered some of the questions you had, while providing some nice information about KSP\u0027s Development. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* When I refer to win64, I mean the win64 build of KSP, not the Windows 64-bit operating system. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigred","CreatedById":119304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T19:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for responding in kind and taking the time to elaborate on how KSP functions in light of Unity\u0027s limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, keep up the good work. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rant because I care. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shadowfax","CreatedById":3742,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T20:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bigred\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bigred\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy suggestion to you in the next update would be to offer those of us the option to start a career mode game without the need to upgrade buildings, just like all previous versions (.22, .23, .24, .25...).

The guy\u0027s trying to play the game on a relic of a computer - hell, I haven\u0027t had that little ram in a computer since probably before the turn of the century, and he\u0027s angry that his system can\u0027t handle it. The unfortunate fact is that not everyone can afford a great gaming machine, and not everyone has a 64 bit OS.

I maybe be not the brightest of bulbs, but still. It was a confusing experience to me when career mode was first introduced and it\u0027s an even bigger confusion nowadays. IMO, it seems a bit sad that most of the basic stuff in KSP that shouldn\u0027t need explanation at all has to either be fiddled around or requires a tutorial from someone else outside of the development team that had more patience to tinker with it and figure out how it works than me. The game looks nice enough when you see Scott Manley playing it...Then you try to do the same thing and...the experience is different. Of course, this is about career mode, not stuff said YouTuber is capable of doing naturally because of prior astophysics knowledge or something like that. So, my point when mentioning Scott Manley is not about orbital maneuvers and things like that. Those have a \u0027recipe\u0027 and a series of tasks in order to be executed properly. My point is about hard things that shouldn\u0027t be hard at all, like figuring how to play career mode without relying on external sources. A game shouldn\u0027t require prior knowledge of itself in order to be played, or else only people that play the game already know how features work, while new players get frustrated trying to figure those out, because it lacks documentation or its documentation is so vague that is the equivalent of not being there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
