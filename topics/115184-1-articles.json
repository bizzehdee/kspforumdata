Just Kerbin and Mun sicence, and science in space around Minmus. And that\u0027s not counting asteroid missions and the mobile processing lab, both of which generate a practically infinite amount of science. So yes, this is by design - normal difficulty throws science at you ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nOne solution is to reduce science payout in the difficulty options when you start a new game.\n\nIf you\u0027d rather expand the tech tree, there\u0027s two different approaches. One is the Community Tech Tree, which keeps the stock tree intact and tacks on (a lot of) extra nodes for modders to put parts in. Alternatively, there are several other custom tech trees, but they all throw away the stock tree completely and go custom right from the start.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T09:48:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 09:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T09:52:30Z","Content":"\u003E Is it supposed to be this easy.

It might be good if you\u0027ve found some way to farm science in kerbin\u0027s SOI, but many of us have not, and find typical playthroughs to be sufficiently challenging to acquire science. Personally I have launched 20-30 missions and still haven\u0027t unlocked half the tech tree. I usually get experiments on all the KSC biomes, i have been to the mun 4 times, minmus once, and have been everywhere but the polar caps of kerbin, and i have earned at MOST a total of 2k science. \n\nSure, if i want to throw up the science module and hit ............. then sure, science is easy. I try to roleplay a bit, and not leave my space center inactive for any period of months or years while i farm science, and therefore in the short term, without fast-forward, science absolutely does not need to be nerfed.\n\nIf you\u0027re going to just time-adjust the game simply to farm science you may as well not play career mode. I mean i realize you play the game the way you want but you\u0027re essentially just playing the game to fast forward through orbits. \n\nFurthermore, if you have made trips to 9 biomes on minmus and not gone interplanetary, you are actually spending the \u0022end game\u0022 just cruising around on minmus. the science module is supposed to (afaik) be a late game tech to help you slowly generate income with a sufficiently leveraged science\u003Efunds strategy to fund your operations with less grinding.\n\nIf you head out into the kerbolar system when you are first able (before the second 500 tier r\u0026d upgrade), then you will be challenged to see new things and get science in new places. If you choose to farm science on three objects there is nobody else to blame.\n\nPersonally, If they \u0022nerf\u0022 science any more, I will have to complete 20 missions just to unlock the tech to build a plane. another 10 just to get docking ports. That\u0027s a grind, and that just sucks. \n\nI play on normal, and if there is a way to clean the tech tree in less than 20 missions without time adjustment, i\u0027m all ears. If a mission takes .75 hr thats 15 hours just to unlock tech, and many of the higher upgrades are essential for \u0022workhorse\u0022 crafts. That\u0027s 15 hours in the SOI, followed by how many hours of potential subsequent interplanetary colonization? 45? 75? How long should I be grinding until the potential of the game is available to me?\n\nWe shouldn\u0027t be fighting to unlock \u0022essential\u0022 science the entire time we play the career mode. I like the balance as is, it certainly shouldn\u0027t be any *harder.*\n\nThey have rebalanced r\u0026d mods for people who want to grind for the 1000 unlock tiers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T08:10:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 08:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Violent Jeb**"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:20:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E thx I think I\u0027m gonna do that, trying to keep mods to a minimum cos of updates.\n\u003E I gues Im going to have to start another playthroug\n\nMake sure you don\u0027t hit a wall in your playthrough though.

Lately, I\u0027ve been having fun with UKS (RoverDude\u0027s \u0022Kolonization\u0022 mod) for making it challenging to set up self-sustaining planetary and orbital bases. Aside from the fun of the mod itself, it adds a bunch new parts which have a bunch of new tech nodes, including some that are way out at the right side of the tree (I think the most expensive one is something like 2250 science).\n\n- You can play with your \u0022rules\u0022: KSP is very much a \u0022dollhouse\u0022 game, where you can set your own rules that you play by. \u0022Get the most science per body\u0022 is one way, and I think fairly common (this leads to strip-mining the Mun and Minmus and maxing out the tech tree before leaving Kerbin\u0027s SoI). But there are lots of other ways to play. \u0022As early as possible, get to Duna\u0022 (or Eve, Or Jool, or whatever) is another way-- i.e. don\u0027t wait for maxing the tech tree, try to go out into the great beyond as soon as kerbally possible. Designing a Duna mission with limited tech makes for a fun challenge. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- You can focus on other challenges besides \u0022max out the tech tree.\u0022 To go with the aforementioned UKS mod: it\u0027s set up to make a self-sustaining base quite a challenge, especially if you do it in concert with something like TAC Life Support. If you\u0027re focused on an engineering challenge as your goal, rather than \u0022finish the tech tree\u0022, then the tech tree just becomes one of the tools en route to the goal."},{"CreatedByName":"ringerc","CreatedById":128140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T01:52:17Z","Content":"I find that about 20% returns on science is reasonable - you can mostly complete your tech tree with exploration of Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike and Gilly, plus some high capture data on Eve.
