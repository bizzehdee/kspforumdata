It might be good if you\u0027ve found some way to farm science in kerbin\u0027s SOI, but many of us have not, and find typical playthroughs to be sufficiently challenging to acquire science. Personally I have launched 20-30 missions and still haven\u0027t unlocked half the tech tree. I usually get experiments on all the KSC biomes, i have been to the mun 4 times, minmus once, and have been everywhere but the polar caps of kerbin, and i have earned at MOST a total of 2k science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, if i want to throw up the science module and hit ............. then sure, science is easy. I try to roleplay a bit, and not leave my space center inactive for any period of months or years while i farm science, and therefore in the short term, without fast-forward, science absolutely does not need to be nerfed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going to just time-adjust the game simply to farm science you may as well not play career mode. I mean i realize you play the game the way you want but you\u0027re essentially just playing the game to fast forward through orbits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, if you have made trips to 9 biomes on minmus and not gone interplanetary, you are actually spending the \u0022end game\u0022 just cruising around on minmus. the science module is supposed to (afaik) be a late game tech to help you slowly generate income with a sufficiently leveraged science\u0026gt;funds strategy to fund your operations with less grinding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you head out into the kerbolar system when you are first able (before the second 500 tier r\u0026amp;d upgrade), then you will be challenged to see new things and get science in new places. If you choose to farm science on three objects there is nobody else to blame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, If they \u0022nerf\u0022 science any more, I will have to complete 20 missions just to unlock the tech to build a plane. another 10 just to get docking ports. That\u0027s a grind, and that just sucks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play on normal, and if there is a way to clean the tech tree in less than 20 missions without time adjustment, i\u0027m all ears. If a mission takes .75 hr thats 15 hours just to unlock tech, and many of the higher upgrades are essential for \u0022workhorse\u0022 crafts. That\u0027s 15 hours in the SOI, followed by how many hours of potential subsequent interplanetary colonization? 45? 75? How long should I be grinding until the potential of the game is available to me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe shouldn\u0027t be fighting to unlock \u0022essential\u0022 science the entire time we play the career mode.

Aside from the fun of the mod itself, it adds a bunch new parts which have a bunch of new tech nodes, including some that are way out at the right side of the tree (I think the most expensive one is something like 2250 science).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can play with your \u0022rules\u0022: KSP is very much a \u0022dollhouse\u0022 game, where you can set your own rules that you play by. \u0022Get the most science per body\u0022 is one way, and I think fairly common (this leads to strip-mining the Mun and Minmus and maxing out the tech tree before leaving Kerbin\u0027s SoI).
