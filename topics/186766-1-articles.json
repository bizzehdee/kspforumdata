Doctor Kouse Kerman suggested I start making these to help settle my thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy name is Tamara Kerman, I am a mission pilot, and this is, uh, year 6, day 158 since the beginning of our space program. I still can\u0027t\u00A0sleep. Not after what happened on the Mun. It\u0027s been... three years? No, four. Four years ago I lost my friends and colleagues, Danburry and Tanburry; mission engineer and mission scientist, in a manned roving mission. I was driving the rover when it\u00A0happened. Everybody at\u00A0the KCS keeps saying that it was an accident and that I mustn\u0027t blame myself, but they weren\u0027t there. *sigh* This is still too painful to talk about. Maybe later, when my mind is more at ease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, right after the accident I thought I would never ever go to space again, but it turns out being a space exploration pilot is all I can do. And I decided I have to do good. I cannot give life back to my lost friends, but can hopefully save those who still can be saved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack on the Mun, when I was rescued, it was a crew I knew only briefly. Cernard, Isarick and Urrigh if I remember their names right - they\u00A0came for me and saved me from suffocating to death. They went on a long mission to Laythe afterwards, not long after the Mun disaster. The last message we got from them said they landed safely on its surface, but ran out of fuel and their mining system couldn\u0027t find any useful ore underneath. They went to cryo-sleep in order not to run out of oxygen and food, and hopefully, they\u0027re still there awaiting rescue. Our technicians finished some upgrades on Umbriel, the space ship Cernard and her crew\u00A0used as well, so hopefully the rescuing crew won\u0027t come to the same fate. Who\u0027s gonna rescue them if not me? After all I\u0027m the most experienced pilot around here. I\u0027m only sorry for Melfel and Haydos, as I won\u0027t be taking them with me this time. I cannot risk their lives, they\u0027Re the only friends I have now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002259t4Qp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/4788/59t4Qp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022N8gSUe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/8193/N8gSUe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-27T14:21:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2019 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aelipse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aelipse","CreatedById":197170,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-27T12:11:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What in the Kodin\u0027s name is she doing?

Time - year 6, day 159.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI landed on the Mun near\u00A0the rover crash site. The skeleton of the vehicle is still there, flipped on its back, like a bug that fails to turn back on its feet and dies of starvation. It will probably remain here for thousands of years to come as there are no means of disposing of it. A grim reminder of what happened here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still remember the day as it if was yesterday. Maybe because I relive it in my dreams over and over again, almost every night. The mission was simple. Test the new rover\u0027s capabilities and, while at it, visit as many of the mysterious arches as possible. I drove it for what seemed like endless hours, covering over eighty kilometres a day. Danburry, the mission engineer and my good friend, was sitting right behind the cockpit in the habitations area. She loved watching films. She took a whole collection of them here with us to pass time when she wasn\u0027t performing maintenance or adjusting the mining drill to maximise its effectivity. Tanburry was sitting in her science lab back at the rear of\u00A0the vehicle, examining the readings and the samples we\u0027ve gathered. She was so excited about her findings she wouldn\u0027t even come join us when Danburry and I took break and played some games over a cup of coffee. Tanburry had always dreamt\u00A0about having her own science lab, and getting a moving one on the surface of the Mun must have been a dream come true for her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have visited the remaining arch, Tanburry of course spending hours gathering data, while Danburry couldn\u0027t help herself not to fly to the top of that thing with her jet pack. When we were done here, Tanburry thought we might as well head back and explore the monolithic object just a day\u0027s drive from there. She was so excited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a few minutes of driving south we came upon two craters right next to each other. It would take hours to go around them, so I decided we might as well try to navigate across the narrow ridge in between them. I was careful, but the terrain there was much more treacherous than I had anticipated. The slopes were all of a sudden too steep to move safely in any direction, and when I tried to turn, the whole rover started slipping sideways, down into one of the craters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was then when everything was lost. Equinox, as the rover was called, gained speed despite all my effort to bring it to a halt, and then it flipped and rolled and... I heard explosion. Many explosions actually. Everything was upside down, the cabin was shaking and I thought those were my last moments. After what seemed like an eternity we came to a halt, reaching the crater\u0027s bottom. I heard Danburry\u0027s voice on the radio and saw her knock on the window from the outside. I pressurised my suit and got out as well. Danburry was alright, but Tanburry\u0027s science lab was gone. There was no trace of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was in tears and those would have been my last if it wasn\u0027t for Danburry. She thought fast. She first noticed that one of the other destroyed parts was the nuclear reactor, and the solar panels, formerly mounted on the roof, were of course gone too. We had enough supplies to last us ten days, but the electricity required to keep us warm, dispense water and food from the storage and most importantly run the oxygen dispenser, was only gonna last for a couple of minutes. We were doomed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started writing my farewell note, knowing that my time was\u00A0up and I would never leave this place alive, but Danburry had a different idea. With oxygen worth just a handful of minutes, she rummaged through the storage module, which miraculously survived even after being blasted away during the crash. She found spare solar panels and attached them to the chassis of the rover\u0027s remains. The empty batteries in the rover started filling up with power; or so we thought. What we didn\u0027t realise at the moment, in all that shock and confusion, was that Kerbin was partially blocking the Sun, and the solar panels didn\u0027t manage to gather enough energy to run the pressurising system again. Danburry went inside first because she had only seconds of oxygen left in her suit, but when she took her helmet off... There was nothing I could do. I watched helplessly from the outside as she was suffocating inside the cabin. When the Sun appeared again and the life support started running again, she was already dead. I tried resuscitating her, but to no avail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to spend five hours in the cabin next to her dead body before the rescue crew arrived.

Year 9, day 168.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI woke up from cryo-sleep a couple of hours ago and my head is still throbbing. The take off from Mun wasn\u0027t exactly a piece of cake, but I managed. Wouldn\u0027t that be a stupid way to go?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, we\u0027ve reached the Jool system. Melfel and Haydos are still in the freezers, as they like to call the cryonic chambers back\u00A0home. I think it\u0027s better to let them sleep for now. We need to conserve our supplies, especially in case something goes wrong and we get stranded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of which, I was looking at the radar and could\u0027t find the ore detection probe Haydos talked about. Maybe it\u0027s just not responding to our signal, but there is no reason why it should go into hibernation or cut off all comm channels. Something must have gone\u00A0wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are currently on our path to Tylo\u0027s sphere of influence. Umbriel\u0027s flight computer made a correction burn, which I thoroughly checked and it looks good. I did some calculations and if we perform a deceleration burn at periapsis with Tylo, we\u0027ll fall down under Jool\u0027s escape velocity. Let\u0027s hope there will be\u00A0enough fuel left to slow us down before entering Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. I\u0027d do the math, but I still feel like a zombie after two years of sleep. And the coffee in zero gravity is killing me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf everything goes well, the next log will be from the surface of Laythe. If not... well... then this is a goodbye.

The moons Tylo and Laythe were fortunately aligned in a such a way that it only took a couple of hours to reach Laythe\u0027s sphere of influence. But the speed at which the space ship was approaching\u00A0Laythe was beyond all previous estimations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a tough choice to be made. Set the trajectory for the highest layers of Laythe\u0027s atmosphere and risk escaping the moon\u0027s gravity, inevitably falling into the planet Jool, or go for the low altitude trajectory, which, at these velocities, would probably mean melting the ship and destroying everything - and everyone on board. Tamara looked at the screen monitoring her two frozen companions and friends, and she felt her throat going dry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re not going to burn,\u0022 said Tamara stubbornly to herself to boost her confidence as\u00A0she turned the vessel retrograde, preparing to lower the periapsis. \u0022Twenty thousand metres altitude. If that doesn\u0027t slow us down, I don\u0027t know what will.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was only a handful of minutes\u00A0before Umbriel reached Laythe\u0027s exosphere, soaring at over three and a half thousand metres per second, but to Tamara they seemed like an eternity. Her face was covered in sweat and her hand was already cramped from holding the joystick, when she finally hit the atmosphere, nose pitched wildly up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cabin started to shake violently and all monitors except those essential for flight control were now ablaze with overheat warnings. Tamara held her hand firmly on the side-stick, keeping the space craft at the best possible angle of attack, while glancing from monitor to monitor. She saw the values for vertical speed exceed negative five hundred, then caught a glimpse of the temperature gauges, which were flashing\u00A0ninety five percent and rising, while another screen informed her of parts of the ship being already lost due to overheating and dynamic pressure. Her chest now felt tremendously heavy, as the g-forces were quickly rising up, and she gasped for breath. She turned her attention back to the navigation panel and\u00A0realised with a pang of horror that the ship was slightly inclined to the right and just about to fall into a\u00A0spinning stall. The acceleration was crushing her body, and she, in a desperate attempt not to black out, turned her head to the right. The\u00A0faces of Melfel and Haydos in cryo-sleep, now strangely\u00A0dormant and peaceful, were the last thing she saw before everything went dark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hPVWwp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/4510/hPVWwp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-30T11:10:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2019 11:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aelipse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xendelaar","CreatedById":139535,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-30T12:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwow, your designs looking really stunning! you put a lot of effort in them, and the story as well!

She blinked twice to make sure she wasn\u0027t\u00A0dreaming and a quick glance at the monitor before her told her the ship was\u00A0cruising through\u00A0the air, slowly descending towards the sea. The ship\u00A0must have stabilised itself\u00A0on its own when she was unconscious.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe instinctively checked the readings from the cryonic chambers, which seemed to be nominal and untouched by the fiery entry, and then proceeded to open the radar map. The space craft was indeed plummeting towards the huge body of water, somewhat gliding on its large closed wing. The altitude was seventeen thousand metres and the descent rate over two hundred metres per second. Tamara quickly reviewed the options in her head and started to search for the closest dry land on the radar map. She found an island not too far from her current position, and to her surprise, it was the island where Cernard\u0027s crew landed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hasty check of the fuel status followed, revealing that the few drops of fuel she saved for the atmospheric cruise were\u00A0still intact and ready to be used. She switched the atomic vacuum engine off, while turning the atmospheric turbo-ramjets on. A brief test of the engines. They appeared to be working fine. Another quick glance at the map. The landing spot was 340\u00A0kilometres away. Tamara grabbed the joystick, rolled the aircraft to the\u00A0starboard side\u00A0and started\u00A0pitching up. The altitude was now twelve thousand, but as the wings leaned into the air properly, the descent rate plummeted to zero and the ship\u00A0even started\u00A0to ascend.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTamara switched the breathing engines on again and this time brought them to their full throttle. Their powerful hum carrying through the hull made Tamara feel alive again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022OK, we have enough fuel to gain us proper altitude and speed. If we can reach high atmosphere and hypersonic speeds again, it shouldn\u0027t be too difficult to glide to the destination even without the engines,\u0022 Tamara told herself, aloud as there was nobody around to hear her anyway. She realised that without the detailed scans of the ore deposits they\u00A0could easily end up stranded on a barren piece of land with no fuel to move anywhere. Just like the crew they were trying to rescue. Despite that, she remained hopeful. They had survived the most dangerous part of the journey and there was still room for more luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engines have indeed soon gulped down all the liquid fuel they had left, but not before they brought Umbriel into a graceful soar some\u00A0thirty thousand metres above the sea level at four times the speed of sound. Tamara had vast experience with gliding the hundred-ton weighing colossus, as that had\u00A0always been her favourite part of every mission. Umbriel\u0027s\u00A0large wing kept her in the air with no difficulty, descending along a rather gentle slope, and after almost 200 kilometres Tamara had to start pitching down not to overshoot the island.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was larger than it appeared on the radar, and with some rather tall peaks as well. Tamara quickly decided for a landing spot near one of those peaks. If the soil really proved to bear no ore suitable for mining, she might get another chance by releasing the brakes and sliding into the valley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe surface was still engulfed in dark when she extended the landing gears and got ready for landing. Five hundred metres above ground. Four hundred. Three hundred. Looking out of the front window, she could just barely make out shapes of the surrounding landscape. Two hundred. She checked the speed again. It was below 150 metres per second. Almost safe to land. She pitched up a little to slow down some more. Umbriel was now flying almost horizontally, but as she was approaching the highest hill she could find, the ground level underneath was rising, coming closer and closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hundred metres. The spotlights from the landing gears now lit the dunes below with light and revealed the slope ahead. Tamara raised the nose up some more to ease the space ship gently on the ground, deployed the drag-shoots and a moment later the craft was sitting safely on a mild slope of one of the Laythe\u0027s islands. The moment of truth was still to come, though. Tamara opened the cargo bays, deployed all the cooling systems, started the nuclear reactor and lowered the drill. She was watching the monitor\u00A0nervously as the drilling device was slowly biting its way through the soil. Still zero percent. The screen flickered a few times and all of a sudden the ore concentration jumped to positive figures.
