My RAM usage wasn\u0027t above 2.5GB on startup with an average around 1.5GB while playing. Normaly it starts at around 3GB and slowly increases until the game dies. With this trick the RAM usage also increases slowly so memory leaks are still present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT after some time with two instances runing the game behaved realy strange. It freezes at scene changes and show just a grey screen but after a few seconds it loads correctly and the enhanced navball mod stops working randomly. Also mechjeb started to realy miscalculate some things but this can be just a random error and not connected to this trick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter around 2h of playing the game got attacked by the mighty kraken and I had to stop my testing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaultesian","CreatedById":145145,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T21:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the reply and the testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have no instances of conflict. \u00A0I often quit the one instance of the game I do not intend to play (once the ram usage is much lower on the instance of the game I do want to play), and yes ,I do get the gradual memory bleed (takes more hours than I can actually play the game), but no errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the testing gh7531.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
