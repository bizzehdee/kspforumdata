I guess they\u0027re one of those science fiction ideas that sound too easy to be true.\u003Cp\u003EAll evidence so far suggests that (self-) replication is only possible in a system much more complex than the replicated object. In other words, if you want to create a complex machine, you must start with an even more complex machine. Or wait until evolution manages to create an ecosystem complex enough to create the machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy life works, its not impossible to imagine an automated mining facility connected to an advanced factory able to create an copy of itself and all the other equipment and finally build an starship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is that with current technology it could not be scaled down enough so you would end up with something the size of an small town as seed, and AI is not good enough for doing this including repairs, you would not need sapient level AI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the starship and miniaturization is the hard part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T17:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy life works, its not impossible to imagine an automated mining facility connected to an advanced factory able to create an copy of itself and all the other equipment and finally build an starship.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiology is the main reason why I don\u0027t believe that self-replicating machines could work.
