In contrast, the number of free MMSs I have only 10 and it\u0027s only when I pay my bill on time.\n\nIn this regard, I would like to ask whether it is possible to Samusng Galaxy S3 does not change the format of my text message from SMS to MMS. The strange thing is that in my old mobile phones could send a very long text message, which was calculated as 10 sms, but I can not do that in the Samsung Galaxy S3"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T13:27:42Z","Content":"You would have been well-advised to ask this kind of thing in Samsung\u0027s own customer service networks."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T17:09:00Z","Content":"It\u0027s common thing on Android.
