If scaled directly proportionally, that\u0027s, for estimation, a 1/7 ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we can expect the Sulaco to be roughly 700 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, the Valley Forge, according to you, is 1,280 meters. We can again try to scale proportionally, but considering parts of it aren\u0027t the same material as the Gojira or Sulaco, it wouldn\u0027t work in the end... but it can give us a start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1280m divided by 9 is a hair over 142 meters apiece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive or take, the scale between Gojira and one section, therefore, is 55/142, because it doesn\u0027t really divide cleanly, I think.
