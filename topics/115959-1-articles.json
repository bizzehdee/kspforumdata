For example, if KAC says today is the day, MechJeb will say the next transfer is in 7 days. To be honest, I don\u0027t even know if KAC believes KAC. I just set an alarm 1 hour and 15 minutes before the next (according to KAC) optimum transfer window to Duna. When the alarm went off, I left the space center and got on my orbiting ship. I opened the KAC transfer window and it says the next window for Duna is 28 days away...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T05:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no one right answer.
