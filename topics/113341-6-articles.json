Any special reasons you don\u0027t want to?...\n\u003E \n\nI haven\u0027t done anything about it to not delay KSP 1.2.2 compatible release any further.\n\nSpeaking of stock settings integration, there are pros and cons. It would be nice to have G settings in the same convenient place but on the other hand ~~if~~ when Squad decides to move them or change the way they work that would break half of the mod and would require to get everything together again, do tests etc. So in terms of time that means to spend more time on integration in order to spend more time fixing it in the future. So settings are not of the highest priority, I\u0027m satisfied that at least everything works at the moment.\n\nAs for stock stats, initially I was against them because it\u0027s unrealistic to raise G tolerance based on experience. Real astronauts/pilots train for years to withstand G forces, actually being an astronaut means to have regular centrifuge training to keep an appropriate shape, not to get a star for just one flight and a great strength with it. What can really happen after a single mission is a significant shape loss due to continuous living in zero-G environment. That effect is simulated by the [KeepFit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/61510-120wip-plugin0119830102016-keepfit-kerbal-fitness-degradation/) mod and it was intended that G-effects should be used together with it to have varying G capability for kerbals in a realistic way.  \n\nAlso I have some doubts on KSP 1.2.2 new stats. \u0022G endurance 2.12x\u0022 - what does that mean? Can you tell up to hundredths how stronger you are than your mate or exactly how stronger you became after a single event? I think if such numbers exist they should be hidden deep inside logic and we should see only some statistics on the number of missions, days in service or something like that.  \n\nOn the other hand, in KSP world many things happen instantly: rocket building, technology research and many other things. So gaining experience and G stats could fit that compressed time paradigm. \u0022G endurance\u0022 numbers could be thought of as a result of a centrifuge test that a kerbal has already passed behind the scenes.  Don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll look further on how stock stats work and think about that more, so discussion isn\u0027t closed yet."},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-20T15:40:45Z","Content":"Hi Ser, thanks for keeping this mod alive.\n\nUnfortunately, seems I\u0027ve found an incompatibility.
