I think you may have a minor issue with your surface normals on the models for the inline containers and recyclers. Notice in the screenshot below how the shading is \u0022flat\u0022 across the surface of the Hex Cans, but each of the inline modules is lighter on top and then darker on the bottom? That\u0027s likely a result of the surface normals not being oriented correctly. The geometry is flat, but the normals are indicating a curved or beveled surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had this problem myself, and it took me a while to figure out what was going on. The problem is that ksp uses smooth shading to make curved surfaces look ...you know... smooth without using tons of vertices. This effect is also applied to the sharp edges which causes the light to dark gradient on the side. To fix it you can split the mesh along the sharp edges into 3 (top, side and bottom). I\u0027ve done this in blender using the .mu importer exporter addon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xfIoYmn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xfIoYmn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a fixed version of the part model:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1286469/TacContainer.mu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1286469/TacContainer.mu\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfjohnny5","CreatedById":64610,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T19:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ninenium\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ninenium\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve had this problem myself, and it took me a while to figure out what was going on.
