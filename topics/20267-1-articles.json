I then found out that there is math to find out what you need to get to your destination. But I have no damn clue what they are and how to do them. If you could kindly post those equations, also please post some ships that I could use to get to the different planets of 0.17! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T02:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it applies to you I have created this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/21600-Comprehensive-Video-Tutorials\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/21600-Comprehensive-Video-Tutorials\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically just advertising the series of tutorial videos I\u0027m creating.
