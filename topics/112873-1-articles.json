I was actually planning to do this after my nuclear engine mod. I had plans all the way to batroid. Nice that you have GERWALK going. (for those who don\u0027t know, GERWALK is an acronym for Ground Effective Reinforced Winged Armament with Locomotive Knee-joint.) \n\nFor batroid you\u0027ll need to animate the cockpit somehow and add another screen by sliding it from the rear once the cockpit tilts back and the canopy shield comes down. If you are using IR the sequencer mod is needed for mode switching. I had come up with two ways to do the mode switching. One was a complex animation rigging and BD animation for walking, the other was IR and sequencer. My thermal nuclear mod is a precursor to having the reaction engines for the Valkyrie. If you plan to add FAST packs (Fuel And Sensor Tactical) you need to adjust the COM on the parts so the center of thrust lines up with the center of mass. Like I said I planned it all out, from VF-1 Valkyrie to VF-30 Chronos.\n\nI\u0027m an expert on the Shoji Kawamori\u0027s designs, if you need help or get stuck feel free to ask.\n\nEdit: Looking at your pictures, I must add, using adjustable landing gear would be best for the craft, and the ruddevators need to be 45 degrees not 90. I own a load of the Kawamori approved valk toys. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEdit2: I also figured out that the VF-25 is easier with complex animation rigging then with IR. \n\nEdit3: You\u0027d have to somehow change the position of the craft orientation in batroid mode so that the top of the cockpit is facing forward, the seat tilts back in the cockpit, a screen comes out in front of the pilot so the pilot could see outside using RPM and the camera in the head.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-07T22:12:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eskandare**"},{"CreatedByName":"ironsatan","CreatedById":144698,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T02:56:40Z","Content":"hey its been awhile i was just wondering if you are still working on this mod"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T03:27:18Z","Content":"We must fight\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/foFScLHscJY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Auriga_Nexus","CreatedById":149320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T23:03:11Z","Content":"Now all we need is a custom music plugin for KSP so I can fly this around while blaring Linn Minmay, Fire Bomber, and Sheryl Nome tracks at maximum decibels."},{"CreatedByName":"tedmeister","CreatedById":119146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T17:44:14Z","Content":"Valkyries!
