I\u0027ve launched many similar ship in the past without any problem, the main difference with that one is that there is a control module on the of the mk1, as to do rescue mission (it is intended to be launched with the pod empty).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/uaTA7UTg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/uaTA7UTg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, problem is that the ship exhibit a strange heating pattern, where the mk1 is overheating like crazy, going as far as exploding, even at low speed and wayy before any heating effect in visible in game.
