When I launched my asteroid interceptor, I had almost 100 tonnes of payload attached to a single 2.5-meter decoupler, with no struts to hold the payload steady. As TWR increased during the ascent, the game made it clear that I had overloaded the decoupler. So far so good. What went wrong was that the joint started flexing instead of breaking, which didn\u0027t make much sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same launch, I had 115-tonne boosters attached with one radial decoupler at the bottom and one strut at the top. Those tiny parts held the huge boosters steady, which felt rather ridiculous.

If you used too small decoupler to hold a booster, the decoupler would eventually break, unless you had a lot of struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T02:19:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuite simply, if you don\u0027t like the new parts you can just not use them, edit the part configs, or delete them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T02:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tank Buddy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tank Buddy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuite simply, if you don\u0027t like the new parts you can just not use them, edit the part configs, or delete them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan people stop saying this please?

I think if you look at the new easy to assemble kit-rocket parts in combination with stuff like the excessive joint reinforcement, as well as Squad\u0027s own statements about wanting to make KSP easier for new players to wrap their head around, you\u0027ll understand why I\u0027m thinking that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, what I\u0027m worried about is not that this is simply a feature that needs more tweaking or what have you to get just right, but is basically an intentional effort to dumb the game down to make it easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that would be a shame, as IMO rocket design and the sense of accomplishment that comes along with pulling off stuff like getting crazy payloads into orbit is a fundamental aspect of what makes KSP fun. If anything, I think the game really needs more such considerations to heighten that sense of accomplishment (such as a more interesting aero model), not less, as many of the rocket design constraints previously in place were largely artificial (such as the need for crazy strutting and a computer capable of handling it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I feel we\u0027re kinda heading towards is the equivalent of Bridge Builder where there\u0027s no chance your bridges will ever collapse anyways, because that would be \u0022too hard\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course most players will love more powerful parts. Of course they will love easier to construct rockets...at least initially. However, they may also find themselves growing quickly bored of a game that provides no meaningful challenge in the long term if things go too far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, that\u0027s my 2 cents. Given that we\u0027re in alpha I think that a large part of the value Squad gets out of having so many people playing their game is that it opens up the potential that people will spot problems with it while they still have time to correct them. To me, this represents a big potential problem that I feel compelled to point out, and if it is an overall design trend as I fear it might be, I think it also stands a good chance of alienating the core audience that has made KSP such a success to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because they\u0027re \u0022 pre-built\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be creative with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out this thread to see some examples: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43086-Open-Source-Construction-Techniques-for-Craft-Aesthetics?p=1066932#post1066932\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43086-Open-Source-Construction-Techniques-for-Craft-Aesthetics?p=1066932#post1066932\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I love the LFB; it\u0027s the only engine from the ARM pack that I use.
