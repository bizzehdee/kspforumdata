Consider delaying serious staging events until you\u0027re out of the lower atmosphere and try to keep the rocket from overspeeding, since that will allow aerodynamic forces to overpower your control authority. Make sure to start your gravity turn much lower than you\u0027re used to and keep the rocket pointed fairly close to prograde so that you stay in control. Those suggestions tend to fix approximately 99% of all the problems people have with transitioning to FAR.

A while ago in a ferram thread, somebody mentioned to keep the center of lift behind the center of mass (going away from the command pod). For me this works nearly every time in keeping this from happening to me. But if you put the center of lift too far behind the center of mass, the plane will be difficult to pitch up (pull up) at all. Planes that have the center of lift nearly on the center of mass , just a barely visible bit behind it are very easy to pitch. Keeping in mind that the center of mass can move in flight as you burn up fuel, and that could cause instability later while you\u0027re going kerbal at mach 7. The total mass changes this too and also the shape of the plane and thrust to weight ratio, which you can get by using Flight Engineer or Mechjeb\u0027s in-editor window. If there is a way to fly a plane with the center of lift in front of the center of mass in FAR, I haven\u0027t really tried with that, planes tend to go crazy on takeoff in that case.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell my save file kinda got glitched out the other day because of a virus but i built a new plane and even with the center lift way in front of center mass the damn thing wouldnt lift off the ground at all..but then when it got to end of run way it shot straight up...ill try with the centers more lined up and see...it was a pretty nice design too...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Netris","CreatedById":28791,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T06:40:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(...)If you need more inspiration, take a look at real life rockets and design yours to look more like those than the abominations that most people build(...)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quote you on that and put it in my sig ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T09:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this is the right place to give suggestions, but have you considered using namespaces so that the modifications to the part config files get ignored by the stock KSP binary?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be possible.

Specifically, every engine or intake is counted once for every part module of any type that it has. This probably throws off the calculation in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laphtiya","CreatedById":61211,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T11:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving serious difficulty redesigning my rockets to work with this mod. I\u0027ve been able to make a 1 seat rocket that will orbit with ease but when it comes to launching a 3 seater command module with a munlander (in a similar set up to the Apollo program), I am running into problems. I can just about get the rocket in orbit but I seem to be lacking the power I need to get the performance I once had. Now I realise this mod adds realism and this is not a complaint I am just looking for some sound advice on how I could squeeze out the maximum amount of power I can get for the most simplistic design. My original Mun rocket had 4 stages, the original ground to space stage, a circular stage, transfer stage and finally command and munlander stage. At the moment I am having to burn all the fuel I have in what used to be the transfer stage to gain a sustainable orbit so its obvious that I am lacking in power in the previous stages. I use all stock parts in my ships if I upload the craft file and some screenshots can anyone lend a hand or give a few tips on what I could try to improve the rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
