One is better support for people with multiple monitors. Some games implement was is called \u0022Windowed Fullscreen\u0022. This allows one to utilize a second screen while the primary one has the game running fullscreen. This makes browsing the web and other tasks easier and makes the game much more enjoyable in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo is a fix to the framerate issue for the main menu.
