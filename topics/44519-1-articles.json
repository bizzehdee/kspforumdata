Lately I\u0027ve been using their surface setting to help me try and find surface anomalies. Right now I\u0027m in the process of trying to find the anomaly on Duna\u0027s southern polar ice cap (around 66Sx160 W; the SSTV one unless I\u0027m mistaken). Thursday night when I landed on Duna, the game was telling me I was at 44Sx169W (first time attempting a precision landing on Duna; obviously botched it pretty badly). Last night when I fired up the game, it was telling me I was at 44Sx190E. My question is \u0022is that actually referring to the same set of coordinates (i.e. what longitude is the \u0022date line\u0022, i.e. is the date line at 180 degrees always), and does it make a difference where the game says I am for purposes of finding that anomaly (i.e. if it\u0027s working the way I \u003Cem\u003Ehope\u003C/em\u003E it\u0027s working, will the game still generate the anomaly when/if I get close to 66Sx200E, or am I going to have to rove all the away across the whole damn planet)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
