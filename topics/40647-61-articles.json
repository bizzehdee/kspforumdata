You see, polygon vertices and faces overload the system little specially in the unity engine that \u0022exclude\u0022 not visible faces. Textures overload a LOT. The thinking is simple: You can have a large number of faces mapped to the same 256x256 seamless part of the texture map. Say, for example, good quality sand on duna. Other stuf, like rocks, and mountains, the same thing. So, with a low quality alpha map, you make the continents mountains and plains \u0022limits\u0022 and merges, and with another map you do the details, the last one, being a \u0022texture atlas\u0022. There is a lot of literature about this process. And one feature that ksp lacks actually, about optimization, is the correct use of texture atlas. Specially in the in the planets (and parts). The last build adds new details to the planets. Maybe they are merging textures into atlas, and correting UV maps and stuff. Maybe not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T14:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eRe4s3r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eRe4s3r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOf Unity?

It would be good to monitor CPU load, GPU load and GPU memory usage (VRAM). You already checked RAM usage, but it never hurts to do that again. That way it should not be too hard to identify the problem.\u003Cp\u003EI personally suspect VRAM, but that is just a hunch.
