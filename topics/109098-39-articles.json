It is much easier to have stable landing slope and control touchdown speed due to high responsive throttle/thrust from electrical engines.\n\nJet engines variants are possible, but much harder to accomplish, you would probably want to use some pilot assitance mod, to accomplish steady landing slope.\n\nA bit of advice, when you touch down water, don\u0027t try to brake imediately. It is best to have nose slightly pitched up, while having vertical velocity for about minus 1 - 2 m/s. Once your craft is steady on water, throttle down engines and engage spoilers/brakes.

I\u0027m still fairly new to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E mechanics, and i know having a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E far away from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E in default is not a major issue.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E thanks for the help\n\u003E \n\nIf the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is far behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E that usually means high pitch stability. Not nessecarily bad, but means you need a powerfull elevator to pull high AoAs.\n\nPut simply, you\u0027ll want \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E close to each other for agile planes (stuntplanes, fighters) and possibly planes with high wingloading (as they may need high AoAs to fly slow). \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E further behind if the plane is meant to be easy to fly (trainers and stuff). But even \u0022futher behind\u0022 shouldn\u0027t be overdone, or you risk not being able to pull the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E to sustain level flight - which is probably what is happening to your plane.\n\nYou can, ofcourse, build agile planes with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E far behind \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E - a very big/powerfull elevator can overcome stability, thrust vectoring can help (especially at low speed), and some planes may have lower stability at certain speeds (one kind of layout I used had significantly lower pitch stability at exactly 0.9M for example). But it\u0027s a bit like building supersonic planes without area ruling them - possible (as the Bell X-1 proved), but there are easier ways.\n\nA better indicator for how pitch-stable a plane is are the \u0022pretty graphs\u0022 in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E interface. There\u0027s a yellow (iIrc) line, and if it\u0027s going down as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E increases, the plane is pitch-stable. Good way to see if the plane is, i.e. getting more or less stable as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E increases. Also usefull to see if the plane will keep the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E required for level flight without trimming (if you want that, I\u0027d recommend adding an Angle of Incidence (AoI)), and to get the critical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nYou can also calculate the graphs with pitch input (only elevator, not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/thrust vectoring iIrc) to see the maximum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E you can pull. I\u0027d recommend you to do that, and compare that to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E required for level flight (as can be claculated using the \u0022scary numbers\u0022 section).\n\nThe \u0022scary numbers\u0022 can also help determine stability in general, but not all of them (not even all of the coloured ones) are vital, and I found it hard to figure out how stable the plane is - only if it is stable at all, or not."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-09T18:35:07Z","Content":"Yes, the yellow graph \u0026 Mw derivative will tell you how much nose-down the plane is generating - the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E ball isn\u0027t really a good indicator because it\u0027s dependent on a lot of things, and Ferram has said several times he\u0027d quite like to remove it. I use it to help gauge what my flaps are going to do, mostly. If the flaps are behind takeoff \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E you\u0027re going to get pitch-down from them, which isn\u0027t generally that useful. Once you get airborne the best indicator of balance is your pitch indicator, if it\u0027s neutral while you\u0027re cruising you\u0027ve got the most efficient balance.\n\n--\n\nFlying boats?\n\n[![29433729276_1065e2c127_b.jpg](https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8541/29433729276_1065e2c127_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/LQXyfY)  \n[![29533983196_9e6f2fbcdf_b.jpg](https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8199/29533983196_9e6f2fbcdf_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/LZPofQ)  \n[![28942341464_ae761d0c0a_b.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8467/28942341464_ae761d0c0a_b.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/L6x4Mj)\n\nAmphibian technically.
