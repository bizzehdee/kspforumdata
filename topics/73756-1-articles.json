How can I make my own parts? Im advanced modeler (blender) and i have plugin that can export models to .mu. How to propetly create model? When i make one my part was pink (without textures) and it was invisible to other parts that i want to connect. Can someone help me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T21:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to make sure the part has a KSP shader. As you probably know already, Blender\u0027s .mu export is imperfect, so in my experience it\u0027s easier to get reliable results if you save as a .blend, or export as a .fbx, and then use Unity and the 0.23 PartTools to assign a KSP shader with your desired texture and export the part as a ready-to-go KSP part. It will of course need a corresponding CFG.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T13:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnity can directly import a blender .blend save file. That may speed up your work flow a little bit. The biggest gotya you have to make sure about is that you only have one material per model object. If you need multiple textures you\u0027ll have to split a model object into separate parts. Unity would allow multiple materials but Kerbal Space Program only uses the first material.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
