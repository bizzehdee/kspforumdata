The mechanics are different. With interplanetary transfers (as we know them), you change orbits with short burns along the way to get an intercept and capture, timewarping through the bits where you\u0027re coasting. With interstellar travel you\u0027re essentially on a straight vector from star A to star B, accelerating on the way out and decelerating on the way in. A star is also ridiculously far away, the current system simply wouldn\u0027t allow you to plan a burn precisely enough -- you\u0027d miss by several solar systems\u0027 widths.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m more interested in how they\u0027ll deal with brachistochrone trajectories inside stellar systems. If you\u0027ve got interstellar-capable propulsion systems, you can use them to travel very quickly between planets, but these trajectories will look quite different too because again you\u0027re burning all the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
