Or, extending the landing legs, then retracting them, then immediately setting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to Radial Out works. If you don\u0027t have Radial Out as an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E mode, then sometimes you have to do it yourself with WASD.
