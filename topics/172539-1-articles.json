I\u0027m sorry, but the new shock heating effects are just awful, they totally obscure the vehicle and look weird and fake from different angles. Also, reducing quality to any of the lower presets seems to just turn it off completely?

The new system has rendering issues. Take a new MK2 out to the launch pad during daylight and switch to cutaway mode. You get this weird partial opacity thing with the window chines and front grill. Game is screwing up and not putting overlays on the correct layer ar blocking layers it should not be.
