We all agree on this. So I was thinking some ways it can be improved\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I will say once more that they need a hit box. With the new unity engine it will mean less lagg so now it can handle the hit box. Make the load distance for the hit box small; around 1.5 km should be sufficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnext I will say regenerating scatter as a simulation for asteroids on some bodies and tree growth for some bodies. Obviously it will be optional as my next suggestion kind of explains this. This can be prevented by \u0022anti ground scatter spray which you have to spray an area with to prevent ground scatter. This is used to make runways and bases\u00A0practical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnext is destructible ground scatter. As ground scatter is limited then it would not be a problem adding an animation for the tree or cactus or rock burn and crash. This would add a lot to landing as you can mow down some ground scatter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally I want more runways. This has been suggested but I just wanted to mention it here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matt77","CreatedById":69015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T19:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree ground scatters need collisions.\u00A0 I drive my rovers around rocks and trees because clipping through them is so ridiculous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree in principle with your scatter removal idea, but not for all types.\u00A0 Trees and cacti should be vulnerable to heat, which could be applied in various ways.\u00A0 Rocks would need a bulldozer, not a spray.\u00A0 I think this is probably mod territory, because it\u0027s definitely not happening in stock.\u00A0 The whole scatter feature is still WIP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-05T19:33:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2016 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Matt77\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
