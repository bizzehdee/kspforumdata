It has drills and converters to mine and refine fuel on the asteroid. The Tugs are a little expensive (480,000 in career mode). My original idea was to put tugs in space and then never have to re-enter the atmosphere.

After topping off the tanks on the rock I would have to expend so much DeltaV to match INC that I would not have enough fuel left to make the intercept. I could launch refuel ships but that would expend more money so in the long run it was almost as cheap to launch a new tug every

with each asteroid having a different inclination inside kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, then I found that with a ship in my current configuration

was plenty to catch the asteroids well outside of kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E giving me time to push the asteroids before they hit kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E, and then my mining ships could stay in an equitorial orbit, and the asteroid catcher could head out for the next after

that the midpoint of that manoeuvre is the perfect place to burn for capture.\u00A0 The issue with burning while attached in atmosphere is that the vessel doesn\u0027t have the control that it\u00A0needs:\u00A0 Nervs thrust at only 60 kN--less in atmosphere--and 1,300 tonnes provide a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of turning resistance, so if the asteroid swings to a bad direction, there isn\u0027t anything to do but\u00A0wait it out and lament the lost opportunity.\u00A0\u00A0That\u0027s assuming that the vessel was designed to enter the atmosphere at all, which it may not have been.\u00A0 Also, asteroids, as giant, dense rocks, have reduced drag because of their mass, so aerocapture, though possible, may not be plausible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat all being said, I think that it\u0027s worth a try, but perhaps is best considered a last-resort approach.\u00A0 I won\u0027t discount the idea entirely without trying it for myself, but allow me to point out that if detaching, chasing, and reattaching are plausible ideas, then so is launching a more powerful tug equipped with Vectors or Rhinos and using that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I know that asteroids in the past have tended to be made of concentrated explodiboom when it comes to aerocapture from anything other than low

Unfortunately, this asteroid\u0027s polar flyby will offer precious few opportunities to attempt a gravity assist and less effect from one should the encounter actually happen.\u00A0 It is possible,

with care and to learn that patience is the key to orbital mechanics.\u00A0 There are new asteroids every day; choose those that are cheap to manoeuvre.\u00A0 Tugs are generally not worth the cost anyway, because propellant is rather cheap on Kerbin\u0027s surface.\u00A0 You save more money by refuelling a vessel already in orbit (meaning that your entire fleet, not just the tugs, are reusable) because you also save all of cost of the launch and second stage hardware\u00A0that you no longer need to build.\u00A0 The main reason for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource

is, but there are good reasons for that.\u00A0 Changes to inclination are changes in the direction of the velocity, not changes to the magnitude, but since changing the direction of a velocity in a practical sense means cancelling the velocity in one direction while adding an equivalent in another direction, the most advantageous time to do it is when the magnitude is as small as possible.\u00A0 An extremely elliptical orbit has an extremely small velocity at apoapsis, so it is the most efficient to make the change there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022

and final vectors tail-to-tail, then the vector to change from one to the other is the one that runs from the head of the initial to the head of the final.\u00A0 Since we\u0027re trying to change the direction and not the speed, the initial and final vectors will have the same length, and since it is a 90\u00B0 change in direction, the resulting construction is similar to an isosceles right triangle.\u00A0 The length of the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is always the leg length multiplied by\u00A0\u221A2, and the direction is that of its rotation away from the positive x-axis.\u00A0 In this case, that is 135\u00B0--in other words, exactly half-way between retrograde and normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to why the magnitude is so small at extreme apoapsides, consider what it would mean to make the magnitude exactly zero at apoapsis:\u00A0 with no velocity at all, the vessel would stop there\u00A0and, having stopped, would not return.\u00A0 Of course, for that to work in a gravitational field, the apoapsis would have to be where the gravity is also zero, which is to say\u00A0at infinite distance from the gravitational source.\u00A0 This is not realistically achievable, but mathematically\u00A0it is equivalent to an escape on a parabolic orbit, which leads to an alternative definition of a parabola:\u00A0 a parabola is an ellipse with one focus at infinity, and a parabolic orbit is one with zero velocity at apoapsis.\u00A0 We are working with something less extreme, so the situation scales accordingly:\u00A0 apoapsis is at a long--but finite--distance, and the velocity there is nearly--but not quite--zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

velocity.\u00A0 The essence of it is that the hyperbolic excess velocity is the velocity that it has beyond escape velocity, and the periapsis distance affects the eccentricity of the orbit.\u00A0 Because the asteroid started in a solar orbit very nearly identical to that of Kerbin, the hyperbolic excess will be close to zero; however, whatever it is, you will need to shed a corresponding amount of velocity in order to effect a capture.\u00A0 The periapsis distance will determine how effective your burn is to make that capture; the closer you can get to Kerbin, the better, but given the size of the asteroid, you may well need to make use of what you have and hope that it is enough.\u00A0 However, you are probably in a very good position to change your periapsis; it isn\u0027t the best possible, but you might want to see what you can do with a small normal/radial burn just inside Kerbin\u0027s sphere.\u00A0 Normally, radial burns are wasteful, but this is one time that they can be useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022

3600 tonne asteroid was coming in well below kerbin with a periapsis below the south pole.\u00A0 An apoapsis burn would just rotate the polar orbit, and not get me that equitorial orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are correct in that a rotation about the line of apsides (which is the \u0027apoapsis burn\u0027 you referred to) will not necessarily change the inclination.\u00A0 Changes to inclination are absolutely dependent on the line of nodes (that is the line connecting the ascending and descending nodes, the axis of rotation about which inclination is measured, and thus the reason why inclination changes are best made there), and burns at any other point will only change the inclination to the extent that the line of nodes projects to the point of the burn.\u00A0 In a more intuitive sense, it means that if the apsides are located above the poles of the planet, then no burn at those apsides can change the inclination, because rotating a polar orbit about the poles will naturally result in an orbit that still goes through the poles--i.e., it will still be polar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fix that, you need to rotate the apsides of the orbit to the equatorial plane (the specific orbital parameter that you need to change is called the \u003Cem\u003Eargument of periapsis\u003C/em\u003E).\u00A0 There are a few ways to do this:\u00A0 one\u00A0is to burn at the periapsis to capture, burn again at the periapsis to circularise (this doesn\u0027t need to take two burns but it may be necessary to keep the burn from being too long), burn to raise the apoapsis from the equator, burn at the apoapsis to change the inclination, and finally, burn at the periapsis to circularise (or burn for the first part of a transfer to a different orbit).\u00A0 There are ways to increase the efficiency; for example, burning for as low a periapsis as possible as early as you can will save a lot of delta-V on later manoeuvres.\u00A0 You may also be able to influence the location of the periapsis with a few creative burns very close to the sphere edge, and that can save propellant later by reducing the adjustment.\u00A0 For another example, the really important thing is capture; once you have that, you can rendezvous with the asteroid at your leisure with whatever equipment you think you might need.\u00A0 For yet another, you may be able to get a lot of free delta-V from Mun gravity assists once you have an equatorial orbit, though that can be tricky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the initial orbit and the first stage intermediate orbit (the orbit immediately post-capture and the orbit with the apoapsis at the equator) have the same size and shape (semi-major axis and eccentricity) and share the same orbital plane (they have the same inclination and longitude of ascending node), they necessarily must intersect at two points.\u00A0 It is possible to get a single-burn solution to change the argument of periapsis at one of these points, but it is expensive.\u00A0 I do not know how expensive it is, but it involves radial velocity, so the answer is\u00A0\u0027too expensive for your rocket\u0027.\u00A0 From my limited research on the subject, it appears that the delta-V cost is the same at either intersection point, which is a bad sign; I expect that the single-burn manoeuvre has a cost well into the thousands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also a two-burn solution involving tangential ellipses; the idea is that for any two distinct coplanar elliptical orbits, there is at least one other orbit that is tangent to both of them, and the elegance of that is that moving from one orbit to a tangent orbit requires only prograde/retrograde burns.\u00A0 You may also recognise this as a generalisation of the Homann transfer orbit.\u00A0 For this reason, I suspect that it is potentially the cheapest of the alternatives, but I must confess to only passing familiarity with the theory; I\u00A0have never attempted it for myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reiterate, the first priority is to capture the asteroid\u00A0because you can then take the time to equip it properly before attempting further refinements to its motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
