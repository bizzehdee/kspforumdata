To this end, I set the score to 10,000 at the mission\u0027s start, and now I\u0027m trying to set it up such that it subtracts 1 point for every in-universe minute that passes. However, I\u0027m not sure how to get this to work properly.

As far as I can tell, you can only modify the score based on a constant value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draradech","CreatedById":139656,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-15T21:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are correct, you can only modify score with constant values. Also, you can\u0027t have a loop running independently from your mission without disturbing it, there is no parallelism. You need to integrate a score loop before every objective node like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uZIj3r3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022uZIj3r3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a display message there for debugging purposes, it can be an \u0022always true\u0022 node. This node is the reference for the \u0022time since\u0022 node. Those 3 need to be able to be activated multiple times, so remove the \u0022once only\u0022 option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
