The first step in the mission plan was orbital assembly (completed) and the second step was a training mission at Minmus prior to departure for the Jool system. Upon review, and checking the math with a fully working calculator (this time with the batteries connected properly) it was decided that the vehicle was lacking sufficient fuel for the second step. Jeb concurred with this new analysis and ordered up more boosters to be sent to orbit. Fortunately the KSC controllers were smarter than Jeb and decided to simply add more fuel to the existing vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter this additional launch and rendezvous the total mission cost has risen to 1,232,672 funds.

Since the probe is utilizing the latest in automation technology it can perform its mission without remote guidance from the crew at Laythe or by the mission controllers back at KSC. A few orbital maneuvers with rocket motors plus aerobraking brought the probe into the atmosphere at Jool in a position where it could be observed. This mission was a success, allowing science experiments from deep within Jool. The transmission of the results back to KSC as quite successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the success with the science probe it was time for the crew to deploy a second automated satellite to survey the surface of Laythe for Kethane. This step is crucial in the planning for the landing phase of the mission. Its important to pinpoint a safe landing zone that also has rich resources, as the lander will need to refuel from mined Kethane. Sherman performed a systems diagnostic on the probe and found everything in perfect working order. The docking clamps were released and the survey probe departed on its mission exactly as planned.
