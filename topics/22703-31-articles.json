I know, there are plenty of Rocket Scientists, that love building and launching that orcish rockets consisting of decades of stages and tens of jumbos, screaming WAAAGH! during flight and shaking their BIG CHOPPA over their head, but (no offence!) real technologies require elegant decisions.

Can\u0027t count all the purposes for it: orbital tug, Kerbin-Mun-Kerbin transport, recon vessel for mapping (ISA, Kethane), drilling, sampling etc. He can bring a habitat module for base or couple of rovers or rescue the kerbals... but he\u0027s not so big to be omni-purposal. he can\u0027t carry a single DEMV Mk.1/2 or somewhat like it.

Bear in mind, the rover was not really resigned for the WT-51, but its about the only ships I have created capable of taking something that big into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it looks like yes the game project im working on with some friends \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E going ahead, but at the moment my only job for it is to make a few basic models for the initial engine to be worked on, as I won\u0027t be doing much coding at the moment for it, I really need to scrub up on my python, the last time I seriously got into coding was Pascal and fortran, sure Ive made a tonne of crap in vb.net, but really who can\u0027t? drag and drop programming while easy doesnt teach you anything unfortunately and it\u0027s those years of relying on quick and easy ways that basically got me out of practice. I\u0027m not by nature a mathematic person. I\u0027m good with figures and percentages, profit margins etc.. but when it actually comes to complicates physics, it\u0027s just out of my ball park - luckily have people to help with that part. We\u0027ve made 2D multiplayer games before (and our own engine) so we have some clue as to what we are doing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, all the work I need to do for the first few months of that project is actually almost done, so ironically im almost back to having some free time. So I spent a few hours last night designing something new (yes I actually got some pen and paper out! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) I thought to myself, what do I actually want to build? Once you start looking at Sci fi ships, you go nuts.. I mean how many things are there out there that would be cool to put into KSP? But... really, the game is neither designed for that type of ship and also it just doesn\u0027t fit the over all feel of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started making mods originally after seeing Bobcat\u0027s and Tiberions stuff. Sure, there were other modders around at the time but they had probably the most neat stuff you could download (we\u0027re going back a bit here.. not that things have changed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly once you start making mods, can you have any appreciation really at all what goes into actually making a massive pack (like HOME or KW Rocketry) , I can\u0027t say I could accomplish anything as great as the B9 pack, but If I was unemployed, didnt have kids, and didnt have to worry about mortgages and life in general, I think I might actually have the chance (and time) to try and do something as professional looking as that - it takes alot of time :/ Hand painting textures etc etc.. So I often cheap out to save time. Last night I asked myself (I talk to myself alot lol...) Why do I cheap out? Why am I rushing? do I really feel obligated to churn something out because 40 people are hounding my inbox for it? Would it be worth actually making a serious effort and putting 100 percent into it? I don\u0027t know, mainly because I never have..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe WT-51 and the PegasusX1/X2 are the most popular downloads I have at the moment. There are about 10,000 of each floating around out there in someones space, hopefully being flown. That\u0027s one thing about the Spaceport, it does give you a pretty good general indicator of the types of mods people want. So my two most popular mods, are the ones I spent the least amount of time on! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E No plan, not idea just started making stuff. The pegasus was of course a modification of the original, but still we are talking a day or two. I did the WT-51 in the time the forum was down in april from start to finish, I think it was done even before the forums came back up.. Anyway the point I\u0027m trying to make while I sit here and type this wall of text, it\u0027s clear that If I just stopped, sat back and concentrated on one thing, like the new large pack Im working on, then it probably would be all for the best and the finished mod would be alot more polished. I love making 3D models of sci fi ships, but so do a million other people, and most of them do it better than me! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E At the end of the day, you are not re-creating the wheel, you are simply sprucing it up, cutting it apart and giving it a paintjob. Also, with the new PNG optimised KSP, I will probably be going .PNG for all my textures from now on too, so you wil be able to edit them as you see fit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next pack (and really the only pack I am working on) is going to be very large, all original and hopefully fits with the style of KSP alot more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Khaos yes the KAS hooks work well on it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T00:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m super curious.....!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like your gonna make what you want to in this pack, and Im all for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour dropship/rover mods is awesome, you did a wonderful job on that.
