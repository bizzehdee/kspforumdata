That explains it. I have been ignoring the space plane stuff and so have not unlocked these yet.\n\nCareful with those things. They are crazy dense. (like a few cm thick of aluminum from what I hear)\n\nSome payloads are better off (in terms of launch cost) skipping the faring and either overpowering drag with more thrust and winglets or flying a subsonic accent to 36 km.\n\nFor small payloads, the launch ease can be worth the hit, but that big fairing is rarely useful for launching the monsters you want inside of it."},{"CreatedByName":"THobson","CreatedById":97709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T06:49:23Z","Content":"Interesting. I haven\u0027t tried them yet, what I was hoping they would do is to reduce the drag at the top of the rocket so it doesn\u0027t somersault if I start the gravity turn below 20\u002Bkm."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T11:28:57Z","Content":"Reducing drag can be achieved with a nose cone covering the circumference of the payload at front. Just make sure to strut it up to the bottom. As devs explained, a front part creates a shock cone, and any parts behind it are occluded (shielded).\n\neh, I call these things \u0022pinecones\u0022. Usually thickly covered in massive amounts of Vernor engines to prevent the rocket from flipping over."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T11:39:32Z","Content":"Yeah, the stock fairings are decidedly underwhelming.

I can\u0027t understand why Squad didn\u0027t just incorporate that one (plus the wings) into stock as they\u0027ve done with plenty of others. I hope they at least approached the mod author and were turned down or something.."}]}
