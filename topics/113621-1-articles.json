Before burning, you have to orient your ship properly. Follow the blue arrow on the navball til you reach the maneuver marker, it\u0027s a **dark** blue circle. Use the pitch and yaw controls (W,S,A,D keys) so that the blue circle is placed at the center of your navball. Then do your burn. From what I see on your screencap, for example, you\u0027d have to yaw right (\u0027D\u0027) to find the marker.\n\n2) maybe you\u0027re starting your burn too late. On the first screen, the time to maneuver (shown at the bottom right corner of the navball) indicates \u0022Node in T**\u002B** 1mn 53\u0022, thus saying that you are already close to 2mn past your maneuver point.\n\nIn fact, it\u0027s even worse than that. Read what Gene Kerman says : \u0022start your burn when the indicator is half the time the maneuver takes before you get there\u0022.\n\nWhat does it mean in this case :\n\nThe required, estimated burn time displayed on screen is \u00222mn and 7sec\u0022 (also at the bottom right corner of the navball). So it will take you 2mn and 7sec at full throttle to change your orbit to the desired one (the one that will bring you close to the Mun)\n\nTake this time, 2mn 7sec, and divide it by 2. That\u0027s around **1mn and 4sec**.\n\nSo you have to start your burn, at full throttle, 1mn and 4sec **before** the maneuver point, that is, when the time to maneuver indicates \u0022Node in T**-** 1mn 04\u0022.\n\nThus, you\u0027ll burn from \u0022Node in T- 1mn 04\u0022 to \u0022Node in T\u002B1mn03\u0022. Total time 2mn 07sec.\n\nCheers\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T19:05:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Plume \u0026 Akakak**"},{"CreatedByName":"tutike2000","CreatedById":134359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T13:37:29Z","Content":"You also don\u0027t have SAS turned on (press \u0027T\u0027)"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T13:54:23Z","Content":"This thread makes me feel warm and fuzzy.

You have the right approach to things.\n\nYou identified a problem, attempted to solve it yourself, then found the correct subforum to pose the question on the first try, and supplied useful, relevant screenshots to explain your situation. That\u0027s exactly the sort of methodical approach you need in this game, and it\u0027s a rare trait in newcomers ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThis will probably be only the first of a hundred questions you\u0027ll be asking, but don\u0027t worry about that. Everyone here once asked a hundred questions (I know I did!), and some are still busy asking. That\u0027s just KSP for you... you never stop learning new things. The only dumb question is a question not asked."},{"CreatedByName":"Pinchy","CreatedById":143038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T15:20:37Z","Content":"I tried this mission several times and failed everytime - I learnt a lot more by jumping into Career mode and doing the small things first like launching a Pod into the air on a Hammer SRB. As you get more into the career mode you learn a lot more things as time develops.\n\nFrom your screenshots you are not facing the correct direction - you need to go to the dark blue target marker, and also when T hits 0 or as referenced above about T- (half the time of your burn) - I made exactly the same errors but stuck with it - and now totally addicted and planning my first foray to Duna. I have learned more than I ever learned on any of the tutorials - watching Scott Manley (career guide) on you tube. He is now up to episode 27 (Yes I am still watching an learning all the time) - but he goes through everything you need to know as a beginner - and the guy is a legend!!"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T15:24:42Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s amazing that after just six hours in the game you\u0027re attempting Mun landings! That\u0027s fantastic, but be ready to be frustrated for a little while while you begin to understand the *why* behind the *what* going on in the tutorials. Remember, landing a man on and returning from the Moon took NASA a decade to figure out how to do.\n\nBased on the feedback given by others, I would suggest you start up a **Science Mode** game, and start learning how to do things from closer to home. Good luck!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T15:27:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon**"}]}
