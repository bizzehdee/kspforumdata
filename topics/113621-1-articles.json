Before burning, you have to orient your ship properly. Follow the blue arrow on the navball til you reach the maneuver marker, it\u0027s a \u003Cstrong\u003Edark\u003C/strong\u003E blue circle. Use the pitch and yaw controls (W,S,A,D keys) so that the blue circle is placed at the center of your navball. Then do your burn. From what I see on your screencap, for example, you\u0027d have to yaw right (\u0027D\u0027) to find the marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) maybe you\u0027re starting your burn too late. On the first screen, the time to maneuver (shown at the bottom right corner of the navball) indicates \u0022Node in T\u003Cstrong\u003E\u002B\u003C/strong\u003E 1mn 53\u0022, thus saying that you are already close to 2mn past your maneuver point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, it\u0027s even worse than that. Read what Gene Kerman says : \u0022start your burn when the indicator is half the time the maneuver takes before you get there\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does it mean in this case :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe required, estimated burn time displayed on screen is \u00222mn and 7sec\u0022 (also at the bottom right corner of the navball). So it will take you 2mn and 7sec at full throttle to change your orbit to the desired one (the one that will bring you close to the Mun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake this time, 2mn 7sec, and divide it by 2. That\u0027s around \u003Cstrong\u003E1mn and 4sec\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you have to start your burn, at full throttle, 1mn and 4sec \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore\u003C/strong\u003E the maneuver point, that is, when the time to maneuver indicates \u0022Node in T\u003Cstrong\u003E-\u003C/strong\u003E 1mn 04\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, you\u0027ll burn from \u0022Node in T- 1mn 04\u0022 to \u0022Node in T\u002B1mn03\u0022.
