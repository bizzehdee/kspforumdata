My orbital momentum was trying to throw me away from the moon on an escape trajectory, but the moon was moving closer at the same rate, slowing me down. The positions/vectors are right for this theory. In other news, the Bigtrak I was attempting to land randomly blew up.

If you hit it just right, because your orbit direction reversed between each SOI shift, and with time warping you could complete hundreds of shifts in a loop, you\\\u0027d essentially stop moving while everything else carries on around you, causing the eventual falling back into the Mun dead centre. If this new issue can be duplicated, it would be interesting to see what the result of letting it run on high warp is."},{"CreatedByName":"GenJeFT","CreatedById":21208,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T13:31:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I would agree with you, but I spoke to Harv about LP\\\u0027s two days ago and the current system doesn\\\u0027t actually support Lagrange points. ???\n\u003E \n\u003E So it must just be some weirdness with the SOI\\\u0027s interacting to maybe somehow create an emergent LP...dunno, but still looks neat.\n\nI think there is a way the system could support Lagrange like points.\n\nIf the system only supports interaction with one gravitational body at a time its fairly simple to find a Lagrange like point. All you would have to do is find a point where the gravity of two bodies nearly cancels the other out and the spacecraft will keep rapidly switching between the two gravities creating a situation like a Lagrange point.\n\nJust an idea on how its possible."},{"CreatedByName":"WoodenBiplane","CreatedById":22309,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T21:14:43Z","Content":"Maraz.

If you already understand them then ignore me, but if not this may help you grasp the idea.\n\nYou cannot gain velocity relative to your target body. In this instance we\\\u0027ll say you want to slingshot around Mun *without* performing any burns. Let\\\u0027s assume you enter Mun\\\u0027s SoI at 100m/s relative to Mun. An observer on it\\\u0027s surface will see you leave it\\\u0027s SoI at the same 100m/s. \n\nYou *can* however gain velocity relative to Kerbin by a Munar gravity assist. Roughly explained, the best trajectory is as follows;\n\nEnter Munar SoI from a direction directly opposite from it\\\u0027s orbital velocity vector (an orbit identical to Mun\\\u0027s but orbiting the in the opposite direction will achieve this). Ensure that you have a low enough Pe to skim over Mun\\\u0027s surface and leave Munar SoI in the direction you came from. Once you\\\u0027ve left Munar SoI again any observer on Kerbin will see a large increase in your ship\\\u0027s velocity.\n\nNow if we call the Mun\\\u0027s orbital velocity \\\u0027U\\\u0027 and your crafts initial velocity \\\u0027v\\\u0027 it can be shown through vector addition that it\\\u0027s possible for your craft to leave Munar SoI with a total velocity of **2**U\u002Bv. Quite an increase.\n\nOrbits are also have reversible properties so you can reverse this technique to lose velocity as well.\n\nBearing all of the above in mind I don\\\u0027t see why it\\\u0027s not possible to achieve a gravity assist in KSP. I\\\u0027m sure I\\\u0027ve heard of other people doing it but I\\\u0027ve never actually done one myself and measured any change in velocity relative to Kerbin. Will have to try it!"},{"CreatedByName":"GWBBQ","CreatedById":114,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T23:50:39Z","Content":"If you have fuel to spare, burn through your slingshot for max efficiency.
