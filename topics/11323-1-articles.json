If you hit it just right, because your orbit direction reversed between each SOI shift, and with time warping you could complete hundreds of shifts in a loop, you\\\u0027d essentially stop moving while everything else carries on around you, causing the eventual falling back into the Mun dead centre. If this new issue can be duplicated, it would be interesting to see what the result of letting it run on high warp is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GenJeFT","CreatedById":21208,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T13:31:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would agree with you, but I spoke to Harv about LP\\\u0027s two days ago and the current system doesn\\\u0027t actually support Lagrange points. ???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it must just be some weirdness with the SOI\\\u0027s interacting to maybe somehow create an emergent LP...dunno, but still looks neat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there is a way the system could support Lagrange like points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the system only supports interaction with one gravitational body at a time its fairly simple to find a Lagrange like point.

If you already understand them then ignore me, but if not this may help you grasp the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot gain velocity relative to your target body. In this instance we\\\u0027ll say you want to slingshot around Mun \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E performing any burns. Let\\\u0027s assume you enter Mun\\\u0027s SoI at 100m/s relative to Mun. An observer on it\\\u0027s surface will see you leave it\\\u0027s SoI at the same 100m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E however gain velocity relative to Kerbin by a Munar gravity assist. Roughly explained, the best trajectory is as follows;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter Munar SoI from a direction directly opposite from it\\\u0027s orbital velocity vector (an orbit identical to Mun\\\u0027s but orbiting the in the opposite direction will achieve this). Ensure that you have a low enough Pe to skim over Mun\\\u0027s surface and leave Munar SoI in the direction you came from. Once you\\\u0027ve left Munar SoI again any observer on Kerbin will see a large increase in your ship\\\u0027s velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if we call the Mun\\\u0027s orbital velocity \\\u0027U\\\u0027 and your crafts initial velocity \\\u0027v\\\u0027 it can be shown through vector addition that it\\\u0027s possible for your craft to leave Munar SoI with a total velocity of \u003Cstrong\u003E2\u003C/strong\u003EU\u002Bv.
