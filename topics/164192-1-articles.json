Jeb was at the wheel, so what could go wrong?\u00A0The ascent, rendezvous, and docking went off without a hitch. The new scientist boarded the station, and Bob settled into the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ECharon\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto take some R\u0026amp;R before his deployment on the soon-to-be-launched manned Duna mission. The undocking went as planned as well; it wasn\u0027t until I tried to retract the docking arm and found that it was frozen in place that I realized something had gone amiss. The cargobay doors proved similarly unresponsive. Now this was my \u0022no quickload no respawn\u0022 career save, so I had to live with the mechanical failure. Worse, I had Deadly Re-entry and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E installed, so even though vanilla heat mechanics weren\u0027t a thing, death due to bad re-entry was a very real threat.\u00A0 Still, only the docking arm was new;\u00A0the\u00A0\u003Ci\u003ECharon\u0027s\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0airframe was a design I had flown and landed probably fifty times at that point. I was confident I could bring her down safely. I burned for reentry and dropped to into the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nThe\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ECharon\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0aerodynamic profile was seriously compromised thanks to the docking port; the first hints of drag immediately tried to pull her off vector. Still confident, I tried to compensate, only to\u00A0instantly\u00A0and completely lose control. Everything I did only seemed to make it worse. Strain on the\u00A0\u003Ci\u003ECharon\u0027s\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Eframe was increasing.\u00A0I tried to reign her in hard, and instead\u00A0flipped\u00A0her clean over in the opposite direction.\u00A0With the spaceplan wrongside up, a combination\u00A0Deadly Reentry and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E disassembly began their work. Parts started coming off like waterdroplets on a windshield. Every battery, antenna, mechjeb component, and parachute was scoured from the cargobay and upper hull. Finally the docking arm and the outer winglets were sheared/burned off, with part of the debris taking\u00A0one of the tailfins as it went. The end appeared nigh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nWithout the drag from the arm, the plane became a bit more conventionally aerodynamic and righted herself before Deadly Re-entry could live up to it\u0027s name. Less fortunately, the chaotic descent had dumped more speed than expected. Where the original flight plan had put the \u003Cem\u003ECharon \u003C/em\u003Eabove the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, she was now\u00A0falling into the mountains to the West. As a final nail in an already well secured coffin, the plane had traded the crazy rolling of re-entry for a rotating pancake drop. It was more genteel, but no less lethal. The worst part was that the control surfaces appeared to be functioning, but the plane itself wasn\u0027t responding as expected.\u00A0I was bewildered. Jeb and Bob were going to die a scant few kilometers from home, and there was nothing I could do about it.\u00A0Then I looked closely and the \u003Cem\u003ECharon\u0027s \u003C/em\u003Ewingtips\u00A0and the full extent of what the Infernal Robotics bug had done to me was made clear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nThe bug hadn\u0027t just frozen every actuator on the ship, it had inverted every control surface as well. (While leaving the reaction wheels alone.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nWith this newfound understanding (and after some desperate attempts to click spinning parts in order\u00A0to disable the reaction wheels) I slammed the\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ECharon\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Einto a nosedive.\u00A0The spinning began to slow, but I still lacked the airspeed to maintain flight. The plane dropped below the peaks of the mountains, still mostly in free-fall. Ground clutter had just become\u00A0visible when the \u003Cem\u003ECharon \u003C/em\u003Ewas finally able\u00A0to pull up her nose and gain horizontal momentum. I even managed to limp my way over to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and\u00A0landed on the runway, though the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ECharon\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewas burned, bruised, missing more than few parts, and decidedly worse for wear.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nI had to take a break after that one, my hands were shaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\nSo yeah, that\u0027s my closest call.
