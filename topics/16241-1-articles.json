When you are near Kerbin, then Kerbin is the body with the strongest gravitational influence on you. When you are close enough to the Mun then that has more effect on you than Kerbin, and when you get too far away from Kerbin you leave its SoI and are most influenced by Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kraken is a bug that shows up when you are moving at very high velocity (relative to whatever body you are in the SoI of). When you are moving fast enough PhysX loses a lot of precision and the force calculations between parts of your ship become very inaccurate, and you are liable to see your ship shake itself apart! Generally, you can only trigger this bug by leaving Kerbin\u0027s SoI, as you end up moving at the velocity Kerbin has as it orbits Kerbol (which is a heck of a lot) \u003Cem\u003Eplus\u003C/em\u003E the velocity you had just before you left Kerbin\u0027s SoI - which is even larger than a heck of a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kraken is supposed to be killed in the next release - planets won\u0027t be possible if it\u0027s still around!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pumper578","CreatedById":36491,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T02:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the Kraken has struck already, it shook my thruster and fuel tank off my pod, so now I am just the pod soaring out to the nothing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis forum has a lot in here, is there a place to see the \u0022high scores\u0022 of the members and see what everyone else is doing?
