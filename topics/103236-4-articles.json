If the station is not 100% self-sufficient, that means supply runs are needed (probably a lot of them). With strict death-upon-starvation mechanics, I cannot timewarp through the Eeloo mission without either letting my station kerbals die, or stopping multiple times during the Eeloo mission to spend 15-30 minutes of my playtime doing repetitive supply missions.\n\nAll this said, you might say, why bother with Life Support at all? Two reasons:\n\n1) I want the design challenge of bringing enough supplies or a robust life support system on my missions. A ship needs to be able to handle the long trip; opening up fun possibilities like ISRU or sending extra supplies ahead of time.\n\n2) I want to do resupply missions, really! Just not when my attention is on a different project, and certainly not 20 times in a row while I\u0027m waiting for a ship to transfer to Eeloo.\n\nFinally, kerbals not dying opens up more options to the player. If they\u0027ve gone all the way out to the outer reaches of the solar system and run out of supplies... It might be easier to write them off rather than launch a difficult rescue; but the rescue is an option you wouldn\u0027t otherwise have."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T20:07:03Z","Content":"This is why the game is not a management game at all, IMO.
