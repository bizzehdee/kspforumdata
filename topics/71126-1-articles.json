Over in the IR thread Albert VDS posted a config that will create this functionality, but I would like to create a new texture/model to go with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest thing in my mind would be to create a new texture for the part variant; however, I suspect this may go against one of Squads policies since it would be modifying assets from a stock part. Alternatively I could create my own model to fit in with the robotics style, but haven\u0027t found any guides so far how how to do this. I know B9 has it\u0027s own strut so it must be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould people advise me on which is the best direction to go in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Zodius\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"landeTLS","CreatedById":97925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T12:54:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eall i can contribute is a picture i made of the model setup in blender for reference. im not sure if shearing source squad assets is permitted so im not going to share the file. but you can do this as easily as installing the io_object addon by taniwha in blender and import the model.mu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4ICSpgz.png\u0022 alt=\u00224ICSpgz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-01T13:07:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2014 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T20:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
