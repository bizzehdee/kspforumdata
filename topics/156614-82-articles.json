Along with DME, I want to also have\u00A0a smidgen of ICE (Iowa, Chicago, and Eastern, DME\u0027s sister railroad), CNW (Chicago \u0026amp; Northwestern, the railroad DME and ICE branched off from), and a very small spattering of \u0022The Rock\u0022. Officially CRIP (Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific, rebadged ROCK in the 70s.), \u0022The Rock\u0022\u00A0was a railroad that had a lot of people batting for it\u0027s survival, but in the end, it ran out of money in the middle of a strike, and that was that. All their assets got liquidated to pay off debts, and while \u0022The Rock\u0022 was no more, it\u0027s railcars fanned out onto other railroads, including CNW, which in turn spawned the DME\u00A0and ICE roads.\u00A0Their railcars and locomotives were VERY noticeable... A turquoise/sky-blue sorta color (depending on how much the sun had faded it), with a giant angular hexagonal black\u00A0\u0022R\u0022 on the side, and \u0022THE ROCK\u0022 or \u0022ROUTE ROCK\u0022 printed in big, bold, enormous, white\u00A0lettering. They were \u003Cem\u003Eeye catching\u003C/em\u003E! Much like DME and ICE did, The Rock also named their locomotives after places, people, and groups.

You just don\u0027t see that anymore. So many of the old smaller lines have failed or have been bought out by the big lines, and they certainly don\u0027t tend to do creative things like what the small regional lines like DME and ICE did... \u0022The Rock\u0022, DME, and ICE had the named locomotives, Chessie System had a floofin\u0027 \u003Cem\u003ESLEEPING KITTEN\u003C/em\u003E as their logo.\u00A0What set Rock Island apart was that, while not the largest railroad, they were still pretty big... They covered a region that included Chicago, Minnesota, South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana,\u00A0\u00A0Arkansas, and\u00A0Tennessee.\u00A0\u0022The Rock\u0022 was\u00A0not small, yet they still took the time to create a series of locomotives like that, and they did so before DME or ICE were even around. I almost wonder if they inspired the people at DME and ICE to follow suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe failure of Rock Island was kinda shocking when it happened. People knew there were troubles, but no one expected a complete financial collapse. They expected a gradual recovery, and it was \u003Cem\u003Eworking\u003C/em\u003E! Projections had them being profitable by the end of 1980, a first for them since the mid 60s!\u00A0As I stated, a strike struck them in the worst possible way, at the worst possible time... And then the government stepped in. \u003Cem\u003EExpectedly\u003C/em\u003E, everything came crashing to the ground once that happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I was a kid, I always was fascinated by those lone bright blue boxcars and hoppers that would roll by at random...

I am VERY nostalgic about them, and I had always intended to grab a few of those to intersperse\u00A0with my other models, just like I always remembered them. I never knew back then, when I was just a kid, that the company those once belonged to was long gone. They ceased operations around the time I was only about half a year old.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow on to my point, and my first complaint\u00A0for the day...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EComplaint one:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E I am saddened that this personal touch is lost on most railroads. I genuinely miss the old DME locos and playing \u0022spot the city name\u0022 as they passed by. These days, it\u0027s all CP (Canadian Pacific) or UP (Union Pacific), and every locomotive is the same, save for an unremarkable number. Even Chessie the kitten is gone from Chessie System... It\u0027s been swallowed up by CSX (Just CSX... That\u0027s the name. Lawyers made it up... Not even joking about that one).\u00A0Needless to say,\u00A0that personal touch is long gone. I know there\u0027s still a few railroads out there that still do that stuff from time to time, but it\u0027s far more rare these days.\u00A0Interestingly, CSX is one of them. They have a handful of \u0022named\u0022 locomotives, and even a few with the classic logos... But it wasn\u0027t done for nostalgia... The layers made them do it to retain legal control of the vintage logos. That\u0027s just... sad.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, nostalgia bombs and what not made me look something up. When I was a kid I remember my family driving up to a town for their \u0022Railroad Days\u0022 festival. It was one of these annual small town things... Carnival rides in the park, food stands, bounce house, etc. What made it \u0022Railroad Days\u0022 was they would get this scaled steam locomotive out there, on narrow gauge track and give rides on the mini-train, and they had an old rail depot converted into a train museum. It was a pretty big event, and there was so much to see and do... Except for reasons I didn\u0027t learn till years later, the Model Railroad Club that normally held an open house... Was closed. I never got to see the model trains, and for years, I wanted to see that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why I looked it up, and decided after two and half decades, I was going back to see those model\u00A0trains that I\u0027d missed so many years before. I got there, and let me tell you, they have an awesome setup. When you enter, there\u0027s a display case with numerous models and railcars that don\u0027t fit on the layouts on display. to the left, is a massive O gauge layout. it follows the entire side and back wall, in an inverted \u0022L\u0022 shape. On the floor level, under the edge of that O gauge layout, is another simpler, and smaller Lionel set for kids to play with and control. if you walk around the display case, you see the back side is the same, but showing off locomotives. behind it is a massive \u0022S\u0022 shaped wall, and an HO scale layout snakes along that wall, up one side and back down the other side. In the back curve, it\u0027s completely dark, with only dim UV lighting, and the lighting of building, signs and street lamps. They play \u0022night\u0022 sounds, like crickets, and occasionally, storm noises, with \u0022lightning flash\u0022 strobes\u00A0and thunder sound effects to simulate night and the occasional storm. VERY cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter having my childhood wish restored...

I ended up leaving and heading back home, deciding to pass through my home town. I visited my mother for a while, helped her out in her garden, and when it was getting a bit late, I decided to head home. I was gonna stop by my father\u0027s place too, but it was getting late, and I figured, I\u0027d not bother him (I only live 15 minutes away, so I see them both frequently). I got home, and got more bored, and decided to browse ebay, and look at a few cheap Rock Island boxcars and hoppers. There were a few that were in good looking condition, and were cheap. I had set aside money for the fleamarket, but since I spent exactly none of it, I ended up buying groceries for my mother and myself. I\u00A0ended up getting more than I\u0027d planned, and then grabbed a few other odds and ends as well. I still had some cash, and my bills were paid, so I said sure! I\u0027ll start out my new collection with a few of those beautiful blue Rock Island railcars. I hit the buy it now, and ended up getting four of them, plus some graffiti decals (I like modeling things with a bit of grit to them, including the graffiti). In the end, I spent about $60.

I\u0027m less concerned with the auto show, and more concerned with the drive in movie they always project on the side of the grandstand at the fair grounds, once it gets dark. My Dad was watching one of my brother\u0027s kids, when my other brother called him, asking if he wanted to come see the movie. He said no. Decided he should probably just stay home. The kids wanted to go, but he decided to not bother. Now, by pure, random coincidence, just a measly week prior, I had been talking to him on the phone, and he mentioned a movie. He saw part of it on TV, never caught the title, and kinda wanted to see the whole thing. He still lives in the dark ages (aka, he has no internet), so he asked me to try to look it up. I found it in like, 10 seconds, of course. I told him that if he enjoyed that one, there\u0027s a much older one he\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EGOT\u003C/em\u003E to see...
