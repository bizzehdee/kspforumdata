It only works properly with a relatively small subset of cpu instructions, and can actually compromise the single-execution-unit performance of the system for the benefit of parallel execution with those instructions. The result is that i5 actually tend to bench and perform better than i7 for general use (and definitely have a larger OC headroom). Though, i7 really shine with highly parallel tasks which HT accomplishes well (video transcoding is a good example).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I saved myself $100 and got an i5, it just doesn\u0027t make a huge difference to have more cores/threads at the moment as the vast majority of the software/games out there do not make use of that yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-21T00:07:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2013 12:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by _Aramchek_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR4Y","CreatedById":66897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T00:05:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome pessimists will say that 0.20 will only add flags and nothing else, pretty much like Team Fortress 2 that gets bigger and bigger in size, but only seems to have more hats added.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sadron","CreatedById":61671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T00:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen IS 0.20 coming out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mishkin_007","CreatedById":59818,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T00:11:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sadron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sadron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen IS 0.20 coming out?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am starting to get slightly impatient though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zzz","CreatedById":63211,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T00:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis does not mean that the game\u0027s performance will speed up by 40%, this is likely to be a small boost overall, and more likely will just keep things a bit smoother/more stable in certain situations.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, 40% of 15 fps is 6 fps, so if you\u0027re running the game slowly, and in the unlikely event that you got a 40% boost in the games rendering speed, you would be at 21fps, which is still going to be choppy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly more stable, not significantly smoother (if you have enough memory) and no any fps boost.
