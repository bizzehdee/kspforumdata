A Jr on one end, and a regular one on the other, with the small grey adapter between. Same with a Sr to a regular docking port. That way, you can mix and match in any way you want with docking ports and you never end up with the problem where you want to dock 2 things together and don\u0027t have a port of the correct type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to ignore anything extraneous though. Once you\u0027ve emptied the asteroid of ore, I\u0027d send the drills, isru converter, and now empty ore tanks away, perhaps to a new asteroid or just deorbit them.
