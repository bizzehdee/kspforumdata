This can\u0027t be reversed except directly editing the craft file (which is not an option)! The reason why the motors must be disabled by default is that they suck power when the rover is mounted on a rocket for launch/transfer to mission site.\n\nReason: Bug in part description / generation\n\n**Reproduce:** create rover and disable motors in SPH, then launch, enable motors drive and try to brake -\u003E brakes aren\u0027t really working anymore\n\nI made 2 rovers to verify the bug, 1 designed normally without disabling motors in SPH and the other one with disabled motors. Both use custom key 05 to toggle motors. The first one brakes normal as expected, the 2nd one doesn\u0027t brake at all (or only very very minimal according to craft file).\n\nThen i compared the craft files in UltraCompare:\n\n![RoveMaxM1BugCompareSmall.jpg](http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/RoveMaxM1BugCompareSmall.jpg)\n\nThe brake torque in the bugged non braking model is set to 30 and in the model without disabled engines is set to 300, which by the way looks wrong too regarding the section brakeTorque\\_UIFlight which defines torque values between 0 and 30.\n\nSo there is something definitly wrong, either the torque must be 300 in both cases OR the applied force for 30 braking torque must be 10x higher than it is now. Also the part config file must match the desired/correct value, either 0-30 or 0-300 max torque value.\n\nHere are links to the craft files for easy compare:\n\n[http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/RN RoveMax M1 Test bugged.craft](http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/RN)\n\n[http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/RN RoveMax M1 Test Ok.craft](http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/mods/RN)\n\nImage of testrover:\n\n![RoveMaxModelM1TestRover.jpg](http://www.docmoriarty.com/ksp/gfx/RoveMaxModelM1TestRover.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T08:08:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 08:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DocMoriarty**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T08:42:45Z","Content":"Yeah it\u0027s a known issue, there\u0027s lots of threads on this one ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nClaw has made a fix which you can find in his sticky at the top of this section which deals with this issue for now, and 1.1 will see completely replaced wheel code, but there are no plans for any interim patches.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T10:02:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 10:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal\\_vager**"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T09:46:28Z","Content":"Ok thanks, wasn\u0027t sure it has been reported already.
