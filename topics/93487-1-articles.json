Of course the largest obstacle is budgetary limitations. As to Venus itself, wearing nothing but an oxygen mask might be a little uncomfortable, given that at the altitude in question, the sulfuric acid clouds are near or sometimes at that altitude. Even if the astronaut was wearing clothes, acid mist might ruin someone\u0027s day. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T08:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow to you get back to Earth?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T08:46:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDetails, details! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T14:06:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 2 Vega probes carried balloon probes, they saw 2 problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.acid rain that could melt it 2 days after entering atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.winds rating hundreds of miles per hour.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pipcard","CreatedById":2541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T17:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECall it \u0022VenuSoar\u0022 (kinda like \u0022Dyna-Soar\u0022 but for Venus)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmartS=true","CreatedById":128671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T03:34:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xenomorph555\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xenomorph555\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe 2 Vega probes carried balloon probes, they saw 2 problems:\u003Cp\u003E1.acid rain that could melt it 2 days after entering atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.winds rating hundreds of miles per hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EYou could coat the balloon/blimp with Teflon, and the wind doesn\u0027t really matter, as it is constant, and your balloon/blimp will be going at almost the same speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T03:55:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wind really does matter, if you need to be near the equator to rendezvous with the ship that is going to take you home, or to catch the new ships coming down with supplies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NERVAfan","CreatedById":72817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T03:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe winds are mostly east-west, though; staying on the equator shouldn\u0027t be difficult.
