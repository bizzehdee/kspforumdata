I tried for several hours last night to work out a Kerbin-Eve-Jool or Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin-Jool slingshot maneuver, but was unsuccessful. Has anybody out there posted a calculator for this or even some kind of primer on gravity assists in KSP? Even a list of how much deltaV you can milk out of various bodies would be very helpful. For example, what is the best boost that you can get off of a prograde Munar slingshot? Does it even help you? Does dividing your ejection boost between Kerbin periapsis and your Munar periapsis gain you anything? Etc. Etc.

I could get to Laythe easily with that doing a regular Hohman transfer to Jool, but if I want to get back off of Laythe I need to find a cheaper way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T18:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-The-Ultimate-Jool-5-Challenge-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-mission?p=1554632\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1554632\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E1051m/s Kerbin-Jool transfer path\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
