I tried for several hours last night to work out a Kerbin-Eve-Jool or Kerbin-Eve-Kerbin-Jool slingshot maneuver, but was unsuccessful. Has anybody out there posted a calculator for this or even some kind of primer on gravity assists in KSP? Even a list of how much deltaV you can milk out of various bodies would be very helpful. For example, what is the best boost that you can get off of a prograde Munar slingshot? Does it even help you? Does dividing your ejection boost between Kerbin periapsis and your Munar periapsis gain you anything? Etc. Etc. TIA for any help!"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:59:37Z","Content":"[Trajectory Optimization Tool](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476-WIN-MAC-KSP-Trajectory-Optimization-Tool-v1-3-2-Update-for-KSP-1-0!) sounds like what you are looking for."},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T17:11:04Z","Content":"Thanks!

How much DeltaV do you have left after achieving orbit?"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T17:58:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can you post pics of your SSTO?

I could get to Laythe easily with that doing a regular Hohman transfer to Jool, but if I want to get back off of Laythe I need to find a cheaper way to do it."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T18:53:34Z","Content":"Check out this [1051m/s Kerbin-Jool transfer path](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57197-The-Ultimate-Jool-5-Challenge-land-Kerbals-on-all-moons-and-return-in-one-big-mission?p=1554632\u0026viewfull=1#post1554632)."}]}
