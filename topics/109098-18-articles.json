Thick wings allow you to pull higher AoAs, but would prob skyrocket the wave drag area on your design. Otherwise, what Hodo said (it kinda is possible to do automatic \u0022slats\u0022 though, just need to set the leading edge to negative AoA deflection).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, do you actually pull 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA? Or do you pull till less, and then the nose suddenly lifts? If so, your tail stalls first, loses lift, and now that your tail wings aren\u0027t countering anymore, your wings will pull the nose up. Possible solutions would be thicker tail wings, or tail wing slats. Or not pulling that tight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith B9PW it shouldn\u0027t be a problem to add slats/make the slats bigger.

They should deflect up at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA, and then deflect towards the airflow (-AoA deflection, I think you already use that) so they don\u0027t cause a stall. That should increase your lift a bit. Don\u0027t expect too much though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: You could ofcourse also rotate the slats, instead of letting them deflect as flaps/spoilers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData volumes suck :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait raising the gear in the hangar actually effects the calculations? ...
