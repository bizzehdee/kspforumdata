Again the real Flanker uses both for take off and landing. \n\u003E \n\u003E Your take off speed should be around 140-180kts depending on load of craft.

But vids... not a chance.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, I know it\u0027s annoying with Adjustable Landing Gear, but calculating stuff with raised gear is usually a good idea (except for calculating performance for landing approach, etc. ofcourse).\n\u003E \n\u003E The stability issues do sound and look alot like an asymmetric stall -\u003E snap roll (wouldn\u0027t call it spin unless it keeps spiraling down, instead of instantly recovering). Thick wings allow you to pull higher AoAs, but would prob skyrocket the wave drag area on your design. Otherwise, what Hodo said (it kinda is possible to do automatic \u0022slats\u0022 though, just need to set the leading edge to negative AoA deflection).\n\u003E \n\u003E However, do you actually pull 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA? Or do you pull till less, and then the nose suddenly lifts? If so, your tail stalls first, loses lift, and now that your tail wings aren\u0027t countering anymore, your wings will pull the nose up. Possible solutions would be thicker tail wings, or tail wing slats. Or not pulling that tight.\n\u003E \n\u003E With B9PW it shouldn\u0027t be a problem to add slats/make the slats bigger. Same for flaps.\n\u003E \n\u003E Set the leading edge control surfaces (if I\u0027m not mistaken your leading edge is already a control surface) to either spoilers, or flaps, then modify the custom action groups so you can control them. They should deflect up at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA, and then deflect towards the airflow (-AoA deflection, I think you already use that) so they don\u0027t cause a stall. That should increase your lift a bit. Don\u0027t expect too much though.\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: You could ofcourse also rotate the slats, instead of letting them deflect as flaps/spoilers.\n\nData volumes suck :/\n\nWait raising the gear in the hangar actually effects the calculations? ... Ups ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI could try to increase the thickness a bit, there is still room for that. \n\nI use negative AOA deflection, I found out about that from one of BahamutoDs videos, that inspired me to revisit this design, since the SU27 is an inherently acrobatic plane. \n\nAnd yes I pull till it snaps basically. If I could get a good PID setting that would not start to oszillate when I reach the setpoint, but instead would just keep me under it so that I could pull the stick back as hard as I want without worrying to lose control. That\u0027d be great ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI will play around with that a bit, I could also use negative deflection for spoiler and flaps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T21:58:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by VentZer0**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:44:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Always.

Amount of control is a product of vertical fin area and distance from CoM. More fin, further back = more stable. If you\u0027re accustomed to building in stock, you\u0027re going to need a lot more tailfin than you\u0027re accustomed to, especially if you build rearward weight-biased ships (e.g. most deltas).\n\nTwin fins are for when the needed single fin would be excessively large, or when there is some design logistics issue discouraging a central tailfin placement.

I\u0027m not sure how much occlusion of the tail FAR does, but at the sorts of AoA we fly at we\u0027d be occluding most of it if it was real life...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T16:38:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T16:50:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I generally choose my tailfins based on aesthetics, then tweak as necessary if yaw stability is an issue (usually only a problem on tail-heavy deltas). Mk1 ships normally get a Tailfin or similar (AV-R8, Delta Deluxe, etc,) Mk2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a tapered swept wing piece, Mk3\u0027s one of the new large tailfins.
