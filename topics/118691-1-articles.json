Thus, if you can get an airplane to Duna, you can see a lot more of it in a lot less time than if you drive. More biomes, more science, visiting all the anomalies, etc. Plus, if you have multiple bases on the ground, airplanes are the best way to move stuff between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aero model in 1.0.4 makes flying on Duna very easy. In fact, everything involving Duna\u0027s atmosphere (aercapture, reentry, landing a rocket on a specific spot, using parachutes, taking off again, etc.) is way easier than it was pre-1.0. As such, there is no good reason NOT to fly on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut flying on Duna is rather different that flying on Kerbin, so I\u0027ve put this guide together to provide a starting point for folks who\u0027ve never designed a Duna plane before. Use at your own risk and be advised that 1.1 will almost certainly change things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EI. General Advice\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to Kerbin, Duna has considerably less gravity and thinner, oxygen-free air. Strangely, these factors come together in 1.0.4 to make a nearly ideal flight environment, provided you can find a propulsion system than doesn\u0027t need free-range oxygen. However, a plane that will fly superbly on Duna will likely be a complete dog on Kerbin. Therefore, I strongly recommend setting up a separate sandbox game with HyperEdit installed so you can do your testfights on Duna---you won\u0027t get much useful info flying the plane on Kerbin. So, you need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A propulsion system that doesn\u0027t need atmospheric oxygen (more about this later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* HyperEdit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A sandbox testing lab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EII. Basic Flight Parameters\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ELIFT:\u003C/span\u003E Because Duna\u0027s air is much thinner than Kerbin\u0027s, you need lots more lift on Duna to fly the same mass. Somewhere in the region of 1.4 lift per ton of ship works very well as it gives a stall speed below 50m/s even at relatively high terrain elevations. This is EXTREMELY important for getting the plane stopped on landing before some lump in the terrain kills it (more on this below). You can go with less wing and rely on rockets or chutes for landing, but then you also need lots of horsepower to take off again before encountering a fatal bump in the terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDRAG:\u003C/span\u003E Most of the drag of a plane comes from the lift of its wings, but this is very much a function of air density. The way things work at present, a plane with 1.4 lift/ton will have a very low top speed on Kerbin due to gobs of drag, but on Duna there\u0027s hardly any drag at all so the plane can reach hypersonicc speeds. Also, because there\u0027s hardly any drag on Duna, airbrakes aren\u0027t very effective at all. You need way more airbrakes than you do on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETHRUST:\u003C/span\u003E Because there\u0027s so little drag on Duna, and because the gravity is so much lower, you need way less thrust on Duna to achieve insane performance. A ratio of just 4Kn/ton is sufficient on Duna to climb steeply while still accelerating, reach any altitude desired, and exceed orbital velocity in atmospheric flight. But on Kerbin, the plane will hardly fly at all with this little thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ECONTROL AUTHORITY:\u003C/span\u003E This is largely a function of both control surface lift values and air density. Thus, for crisp, responsive controls, a Duna plane needs WAY more control surface area, with as much leverage as possible, than a Kerbin plane. But even so, the controls will lose a lot of their effect at speeds above about 200m/s, even at lower altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EWHEEL BRAKES\u003C/span\u003E: When you combine high amounts of lift, low stall speeds, and low gravity, you lose most of your braking power. Brakes only work when the wheel is on the ground and low gravity plus high lift make the plane float long distances with the wheels just above the ground. Thus, retro thrust is very desirable to keep stopping distances short. But OTOH, because brakes have little effect at all, they\u0027re not likely to flip you over, either, unless you get really sideways due to a bounce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EIII. Common Problem Areas\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPROPULSION:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith stock, about the only viable option is ion engines powered by 6-Pack fuel cells. Because Duna\u0027s air is so thin, ion engines have reasonably good performance in its atmosphere, enough to keep the plane flying anyway. However, they lack the oomph to take off in reasonable distances so pretty much require assistance by small rockets to get off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves mods. There are several options there. Both KAX and Firespitter have electric props which work quite well. The large amount of electricity they require, however, means you should probably go with fuel cells to power them, given the weak performance of solar panels on Duna. The plane below, powered by a single Firespitter electric prop, can achieve suborbital trajectories. It has an FL-T400 and 2 6-Pack fuel cells in the cargo bay, which is enough juice to circumnavigate Duna several times. Note the large wing area. When the pic was taken, the plane was doing about 900m/s at 22km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/wrzfrd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5706/19980102694_162e7bfb99_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002219980102694_162e7bfb99_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is nuclear thermal jet engines. Both Atomic Age and Mk2 Extensions have some of these. Their virtue is that they work in any atmosphere and don\u0027t need fuel tanks, although some of them need more nuclear fuel eventually. However, they\u0027re also rather heavy, which means lots more wing needed, or accepting dangerously high landing speeds. Personally, I haven\u0027t yet used these on Duna but they work quite well on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Kethane (if that\u0027s still a thing) and Karbonite have jet and propjet engines that burn the respective resource and work in any atmosphere. These are typically lighter than nuclear thermal engines but make up for this by consuming fuel in larger quantities than electric motors powered by fuel cells, so weight is still something of an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, you have tradeoffs no matter which way you go. Personally, I prefer the electric prop route as the lightest overall while still being plenty powerful, and also because (at least with Firespitter), you can reverse the thrust so don\u0027t need a separate retro thrust system (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETAKEOFFS and LANDINGS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole point of having a plane on Duna is to go everywhere. Problem is, except in the basins and canyons, Duna has nothing resembling the KSC runway. It\u0027s all dunes, hills, and mountains, meaning all potential LZs are pretty short and rather bumpy, just small flat areas scattered between obstacles. To be able to operate safely, therefore, short-field performance and rugged construction are essential. Landings are typically more difficult than takeoffs because of the difficulty of slowing down (see below), whereas you can usually use a hill as a jump ramp on takeoff. The main problem with takeoffs is picking a good path so you don\u0027t drop off a hill before you\u0027ve got flying speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several ways to provide short-field performance: VTOL, STOL, and STOVL. VTOL can be done with an electric helicopter instead of a plane, but othewise will need rockets or Kethane/Karbonite lift jets. STOVL usually means parachutes, which these days means the crew must include an Engineer to repack them. The least-complicated option is STOL, but it puts a high premium on your flying skills and giving the plane enough control authority to steer it to the desire LZ. I prefer STOL myself as I suck at VTOLs and still don\u0027t trust repacked chutes. And by STOL, I mean stall speeds below 50m/s. You\u0027ll still roll a long way after touching down unless you\u0027ve got some good way to slow down, however (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut except in a well-flown VTOL, both the landing and takeoff are probably going to be rough due to the bumpy terrain. Therefore, your plane must be strong enough to survive this. You also want high ground clearance, small safety wheels under the wintips to keep them from breaking off when striking the ground, and a general lack of flex in the structure. Kerbal Joint Reinforcement highly recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESLOWING DOWN and STOPPING:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the lack of drag, a Duna plane can build up lots of speed relatively quickly. However, this also means that airbrakes aren\u0027t very effective. A single pair of stock airbrakes will slow you down about 1m/s per 2-3 seconds of elapsed time at \u0022low\u0022 altitudes (4km and below), and do rather less well at higher altitudes. And you have to kill off most of your horizontal speed to land safely, no matter what method you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, unless you want to carry a huge number of airbrakes, some form of retro trust is virtually essential. Firespitter electric props are great because they allow thrust reversal, so you can use the same power plant for 2 purposes. If you go with ion engines, you\u0027ll need some small, forward-facing rocket engines. AFAIK, the other mod engines lack thrust reversal, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem of slowing down doesn\u0027t stop once you\u0027re on the ground, either. Unless you can stop quickly, a STOL plane will bounce and float along forever, and will frequently meet a fatal terrain obstacle or cartwheel the plane. Wheel brakes, as mentioned above, aren\u0027t very effective at all. Therefore, if you touch down with even 30m/s horizontal speed, you still need reverse thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ELAUNCHING FROM KERBIN\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, you\u0027ve designed and tested a plane that flies to your satisfaction on Duna. Now, how do you get it off the ground on Kerbin? This is one of the more interesting challenges in the whole program. The basic options are either either to fly it off the runway or launch it vertically, and both have their problems (or you can use Extraplanetary Launchpads or UKS to build the thing at Duna, but what\u0027s the fun of that?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunway takeoffs are desirable, especially if the plane is a Duna SSTO. It\u0027s actually extremely easy to make a Duna SSTO spaceplane. However, as mentioned above, Duna planes typically have so much drag from lift, and so little thrust, and so little fuel, that they\u0027re utterly incapable to SSTOing on Kerbin, assuming they can even fly there at all. So if you want to go that way, expect to need some huge takeoff stage (or reuseable spaceplane) that actually carries your Duna plane to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/xbUPi3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/663/20470529688_8897fd3273_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220470529688_8897fd3273_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above pic dates from 0.21 but you get the idea. The actual Duna plane is the small biplane in front, and the part with the big wings is the SSTO lifter stage for it. Then most of the lifter stage went away and I docked a transfer tug to it once in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s not your thing, then you\u0027re stuck with using a rocket. But the huge wing of anything capable of STOL/STOVL flight on Duna will do its best to flip the rocket out. If the plane has a small enough wingspan, you can maybe surround it with a fairing, but big fairings present their own problems on launch. Besides, if it\u0027s that small a plane, you might be able to \u0022Dreamchaser\u0022 it with sufficiently huge tail feathers on the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA less orthodox, but totally workable, alternative is to use the airplane\u0027s wings as the rocket\u0027s tailfins. IOW, attach the plane(s) at the bottom of the rocket. The most effective way to do this is to send out 2 identical planes, one on each side of the central rocket, so that the lift of their wings cancel out with no net force (except lots of drag) on the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: It\u0027s a good idea to disable the plane(s)\u0027 control surfaces during launch and any aerocapture passes at Duna. Also, the rocket will need gobs of control athority from torque, RCS, and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/t1w6iC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7781/17727503938_80774f4de3_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002217727503938_80774f4de3_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2 planes above were going to Laythe but the concept is the same for a pair of Duna planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, however, your plane is rather large, you can just lift 1 at a time and deal with the asymmetrical lift during launch. Such as this actual Duna plane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/wvK3Yq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm1.staticflickr.com/541/20027281240_e1507a75c5_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002220027281240_e1507a75c5_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, the top of the plane faced south on the launchpad so pulled the rocket a few degrees that way during ascent. I had intended to rotate the whole rocket to keep this from happening but forgot. So, about halfway up, I simply rolled the whole thing 180^ so the lift pulled the rocket back to the north. The end result was an inclination of only 2 degrees, close enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EIV.

As you can see, things were pretty much the same. In fact, so similar that when I decided to do a Duna airplane in 1.0.4, all I had to do was refine the plane\u0027s design slightly. It actually had too much control authority to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut seriously, why stick with 1.0.2? That version\u0027s heat model was totally bogus and unrealistic, not to mention very bug-ridden, and much more prone to spontaneous combustion than what we have in 1.0.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E@ Cirocco:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, if you want to use chutes, they should be balanced around the CoM so the plane will hit the ground more or less level and on its landing gear. If the chutes are more on 1 side of the CoM than the other, the plane will land at a steep angle and might break off part of the nose or tail. However, this also depends on the terrain where you land. It\u0027s quite possible the chutes will make you come down on the side of a steep slope, in which case a level plane might break a wingtip (or nose or tail) on the hillside before the wheels hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, chutes should be viewed as the final step in landing, a substitute for a conventional, controlled landing. Because Duna is so lumpy, you have to spot and maneuver over a good landing zone. You have no control once you pop the chutes and the higher and faster you are when you pop them, the less likely you are to hit the spot you\u0027re aiming for. Besides, IIRC it\u0027s \u0022risky\u0022 (per the right-click menu) to open chutes between about 350-500m/s and Duna planes can easily exceed such speeds. Therefore, even with chutes, you still need some other means of killing off most of your horizontal velocity, preferably to just above stall speed. So what you do is, while still at normal flying speed, pick out a good spot and line up on it, then glide down towards it while slowing down a lot. As you pass slowly just over the target, pop the chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note, it\u0027s a VERY good idea if your plane has some powered wheels for taxiing. There are powered landing gear available in several mods, or you can use ModuleManager to add power to stock wheels. It\u0027s quite likely that, due to terrain issues, you\u0027ll have to land a few clicks away from your real target. It\u0027s a LOT easier to drive the remaining distance in rover mode than trying to taxi there using airplane engines. Besides, powered wheels have a reverse gear which is quite useful for maneuvering in tight spaces.

It uses two Firespitter electric props and performs like a stuntplane on Kerbin, but is a bit floaty on Duna. However, this was anticipated - I tested by flying into the upper limits of Kerbin\u0027s navigable atmosphere on the assumption that Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere would not be terribly unlike those conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying is different, feels almost like a hybrid between atmospheric flight and orbit, because you can pretty well flip around and do straight retrothrust maneuvers and actually get results, especially at higher altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should also mention that I find the electric props get hot, especially as atmosphere thins, which is why I used Randazzo\u0027s fantastic active heat management system, giving me actively pumping radiators that won\u0027t break off in atmospheric flight or create needless drag. You can really get going fast though, Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere lets you go supersonic on props!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut landing is definitely the real challenge IMO. Dunatian terrain is very unkind to planes, the low gravity means less downforce for the wheels to engage the surface (probably a major reason why wheel brakes feel so worthless), and just like you say, low drag means lengthy stops. My design packs a parachute in the rear shroud (not shown deployed because this was sent unmanned just in case it was a total failure, it can now fly to wherever my kerbals land and pick up a pilot), but reverse thrust on the props seems to work well, although using that to stop with precision is not easy.
