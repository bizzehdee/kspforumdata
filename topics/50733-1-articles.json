Pilots flying unpressurized aircraft require oxygen when flying above 10000 feet for more than 1/2 hour, and at all times when the aircraft is above 12000 feet altitude. Climbers and high altitude inhabitants can survive above 12000 feet altitude without oxygen, but they must acclimatize to the lower pressures over the course of several days. Above about 18000 feet (roughly 50 kPa), acclimatization has only a limited benefit and the body will slowly deteriorate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the correction!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of Mars still lies below the Armstrong limit though, so without a suit on your blood will boil. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Idobox","CreatedById":80299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T00:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOther methods to produce oxygen on spacecraft use monopropellant.
