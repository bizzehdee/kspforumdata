(KerbalJointReinforcement)\n\u003E If you do it might be the problem with the save, KJR will not run on a 64bit KSP.\n\nYes actually, I am using KJR. I\u0027m wondering what other mods won\u0027t run on x64.\n\nActually, REMOVING that mod doesn\u0027t fix the problem. My existing satellite solars still explode.\n\nNot only that, but the Mk1 command pod also explodes for new rockets put on the launch pad. (will try and narrow down the culprit mod)\n\n[uPDATE] Okay, actually Kerbal Joint Reinforcement wasn\u0027t the problem at all. It was **Deadly Reentry!** Sadly, having that mod installed will NOT work with x64. I removed it and now my solar panels and command pods are fine. Will continue to test, maybe with a brand new career save, and see what problems I find. I\u0027m a bit disappointed to have to nix DR because honestly reentry is SO forgiving in vanilla it\u0027s kind of crazy.\n\n**Bugs I\u0027ve noticed:**\n\n1. My KSC buildings all look upgraded, and the game thinks they are upgraded but they really aren\u0027t. This means I can\u0027t actually upgrade them in career mode. Could be a problem.\n\nThough... I noticed they revert to their unupgraded state after exiting the VAB, so maybe this is okay.\n\n2. RealChutes doesn\u0027t work. Also, since its parachute part category is missing, the Mk16 parachute is also missing and you have to uninstall RealChutes to get it.\n\nIn addition, I\u0027m not sure why, but my Mk16 parachute didn\u0027t open in time to save Jeb from a fiery death just from the very first rocket launch \u0022capsule on top of the RT-5 Flea SRB\u0022. This propelled him up past Mach 1.5 in a few seconds and topped out above 15km in altitude. The descent was so fast the parachute had no time to act. I tried angling it out for a more shallow ascent but that didn\u0027t help either. The terminal velocity seems to be a whole lot higher for me now.\n\nThese are the mods I\u0027m using. If anything on this list is known to NOT work, please let me know.\n\nOf course, I plan on adding a bunch of mods since... that\u0027s the whole point of x64 right? ![^_^](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png)\n\nDoes anyone have a quick list of the best mods to add which are usually too high in memory use to be worth it in 32 bit?\n\n![KSPMods.jpg](http://members.iinet.net.au/~recon/Junk/KSPMods.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T15:10:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 03:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Recon777**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lumaan","CreatedById":120286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T14:15:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Bugs I\u0027ve noticed:**\n\u003E \n\u003E My KSC buildings all look upgraded, and the game thinks they are upgraded but they really aren\u0027t.
