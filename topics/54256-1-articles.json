It\u0027s resemblance is pretty close if you look at the orbiter. The external tank is pretty accurate, but the boosters are the most obvious deviation from the real shuttle. The boosters were somewhat inspired by the WIP shuttle Amloris is working on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36120-Space-Shuttle-Atlantis\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, they seemed like a good way to do it.

The launch procedure is fairly basic but will require some effort for fine maneuvering. I was able to dock to a little makeshift space station launched to test the space shuttle (the station was in a 85 km orbit). Enjoy, have fun, and criticism is welcome as I am not so good at replicating space craft (don\u0027t make fun of my skills \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) I\u0027m only really good at just launching basic craft.

First off, the wings are too long. Second, the docking port is hidden inside the payload bay. Third, the payload bay is quite a bit longer, and even with the 64% scaling, your payload bay is still a bit short. Fourth. You don\u0027t have any actual SRBs. You\u0027re using regular tanks with dual engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want some tips to improving it, I can probably help. I made a shuttle that got into orbit with the RSS mod, and it was a very good replica. I used StretchSRB for the SRBs, and I was able to control the size and burn time down to very finite details. I also used RealFuels, which allowed me to use Liquid Hydrogren/Liquid Oxygen like on the real shuttle, which meant that I needed less thrust to actually push it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T02:22:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I just noticed I got replies on this! Nice to see people commenting on it. Maybe calling it a replica was too much. Personally, I called it that because of the way the orbiter and external tank perform. I.e., no engines on the ET, 3 SSMEs, and 2 OMS pods. I could revisit this, and also take better advantage of the Space Shuttle Engines mod (it\u0027s been updated a few times since this release). Appreciate the feedback. About StretchySRBs, I might consider using them but I wanted to keep the amount of mods down low. But it is always an option. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also look into doing more research on the payload capacity. I was just using it for aesthetics and crew ferrying but the payload is obviously part of the whole basis of a space shuttle system. I\u0027ve become more familiar with Kerbal Engineer Redux, so that should help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
