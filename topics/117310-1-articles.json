As many celestial bodies as I can handle until I can\u0027t take any more. I will record not only my progress, but my slowly slipping sanity as I drive around the Kerbol system.\n\nWhy do something so obviously crazy? Because I\u0027m crazy of course, and also because planetary exploration really appeals to me, both as a pursuit itself and as an impetus for engineering and mission design. It turns out I just love rovers, making them, driving them, pulling crazy stunts in them, and whenever possible, proving that rovers are not just practical, they\u0027re a lot of fun.\n\nMost of my rovers are mod craft; some are mostly stock but carry some utility mods (some even unnecessarily, because I overbuild like you wouldn\u0027t believe!), while some barely have a stock part in them. Sometimes the route demands mods and sometimes I just want to try out the new toys. But hey, see for yourself what I\u0027ve put together:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I don\u0027t clip parts (at least not egregiously) and I\u0027ve done my best to make everything visible, including toolbox contents where applicable.\n\n**Current Status:** Eve circumnavigation in progress!\n\n**Travelogues** **:**\n\n**Minmus:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/XNyw5)\n\nFinal thoughts on Minmus:\n\nMinmus is, surprisingly enough, a very practical place for a rover, much moreso than the Mun. Minmus has a number of excellent landing sites where you can land on perfectly level terrain and be within easy driving distance of one of the named flats (Greater, Great, Lesser), nearby regular Flats, Slopes, Lowlands, and Midlands, giving you access to five biomes if you have a rover capable of hauling science equipment to them. Further, Minmus\u0027s gravity is low enough that a single lander with either reasonable fuel reserves or refueling access (whether ISRU or delivery/pickup of fuel) could easily hop between the named flats and then to the Pole/Highland areas, which are found close together and provide relatively easy terrain to drive on. This could allow a single lander access to all nine biomes within a couple hour mission, and a rover is easily the most practical way of approaching this, in my opinion. Would also be that much simpler to leave the rover behind when you go home, as you can save dV on the mass of the rover and all science instruments.\n\nA much smaller rover than mine using only stock parts could easily deliver science instruments, and could even carry a real pod to store science and get crew reports. My fuel was more than I needed for a full circumnavigation, local driving between nearby biomes could be facilitated by very small fuel tanks for downthrusters.\n\nThose are necessary, by the way. My rover has a mass of over 10t when full and it still wanted to fly at the drop of a hat, though it was perfectly fine when going straight most of the time. Smaller rovers would require downthrusters all the more, but I only used 30% max thrust on both my engines and rarely more than half throttle at that, and I found that very adequate.\n\nMinmus is also a fun place to drive. The highlands are really quite high, and most of the terrain is very easy. Flats and Midlands can typically be driven at x4 physics warp, and even when driving carefully, x2 actually proved fine, even while turning, surprisingly enough. And oh yeah, the poles are really weird. Fun to see, just make a safe quicksave beforehand.\n\n**Kerbin:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Minmus did not prepare me for that.\n\nWould I recommend it to a friend? Yeah, maybe. Unlike Minmus, there\u0027s almost no practical application to a rover on Kerbin. Kerbin data is much easier to gain with an airplane. But Kerbin is an underappreciated beauty of a planet, with some really impressively steep mountains, broad seas, and bizarre terrain aplenty. It\u0027s also got what must be some of the most challenging terrain anywhere; seriously, what\u0027s going to be harder than driving right up a vertical wall, out of the water no less?\n\nOr maybe Minmus is just a pushover and I\u0027ve underestimated the depth of an Elcano challenge. But if there\u0027s one thing I do, it\u0027s learn from my mistakes. And let\u0027s be clear - a blind drive carrying useless equipment around a planet the size of Kerbin is a mistake. I\u0027m glad I proved the strength of my engineering in this rover design, but I also think that experiment has served its purpose. I have decided to use different rovers for different planets in the future, not merely to optimize designs further and test new ideas, but also because I\u0027m frankly tired of driving this one. I\u0027ve put some 80 hours in on it, let\u0027s drive something new.\n\nI will also be employing some scouting in the future. A mission is already underway for Duna, and this time we\u0027re taking SCANSat and what I hope will be a Dunatian bushplane for low altitude scouting. We passed right by so many anomalies on Kerbin that I\u0027m embarassed, and I literally landed within throwing distance of the only anomaly on Minmus without realizing it, with my very first installment! How foolish! I won\u0027t make that mistake again, either.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this road trip with me, and thanks to everyone for their support! I\u0027m not done yet, not by a long shot. Duna will have a very nice base of operations, and with the changes I\u0027ve introduced, entries should have both more brevity and better scenery. Stay tuned!\n\n**Duna:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/B99yo)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/lzEpu)\n\nFinal thoughts on Duna:\n\nDuna looks nice. Not a lot of variety, but what it does have is sufficiently Martian, especially with enhanced visual effects.\n\nSo is a rover good here? Well, it certainly operates well here, the terrain presents zero challenge to a rover anywhere but the poles, really. There are also sites where you can collect five biomes in a few minutes, and a rover is, as always, a very easy way to do that without having to move your lander four times. Adventurers may find themselves longing for an Olympus Mons or really any kind of Martian analogue; there are some mountains with considerable local prominence, but they aren\u0027t the highest on the planet - the highest point is in a fairly ordinary looking highlands near a valley that looks impressive on the map but is really just a zone of lowlands in between zones of highlands. The lowlands aren\u0027t exactly Planitia, either - not that one flat plain is more boring than another, but my plane certainly wishes there were some flatter areas rather than just gentler dunes.\n\nBut I did take something away from this: I\u0027m taking a vacation from polar routes for a while. I like weird terrain, I like rough terrain, what I don\u0027t like is minefields of unnatural terrain that makes my skin crawl. Okay, I kinda like it. But I think I\u0027d like a nice, tropical cruise around a pleasant equatorial route, free of any spires of impending death looming over me. I\u0027m thinking somewhere warm, with exotic beaches? What\u0027s that? Eve, you say? Eve is huge, hard, and dangerous, like a bull on steroids but with a lot more gravity. I\u0027m also thinking I\u0027m going to take a pleasure craft on this next expedition. I\u0027ve got Eve science for the most part, I\u0027ve had a functioning (if stranded) base there for quite some time, and I think the poor \u0022colonists\u0022 could use something more fun than being driven into a polar abyss.\n\nSee you next time, and as always, thanks for reading!\n\n**Eve:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Congrats!\n\nAnyway, as to some of the questions and ponderings....\n\nFirespitter pontoons, from way back in their beginnings have had weak, wobbly joints. KRJ really helps there but I find they still need bracing anyway. After much experimentation, I\u0027ve found that the minimum arrangement is a horizontal X of struts from the front end of one to the back end of the other, plus some ties from the ends to the main body of the vehicle. This isn\u0027t really an option for you with retractable pontoons unless you use KAS struts you can install and remove as needed. You might be able to use KIS to remove and reattach the various pontoon pieces to cure their misalignments, however.\n\nAs to more efficient wall-climbing, having winches aimed up at an angle and firing grapplying hooks or harpoons seems to work pretty well."},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T05:12:17Z","Content":"Yeah I\u0027ve done quite a bit of experimenting with the seaplane skis. I actually think they\u0027re an amazing part in general, though I would certainly recommend KJR in general and for...adventurous builds especially. I\u0027m thinking the main source of stress on them in this design is the lateral pushing into the water, the central strut piece is always slightly misaligned when you push in that way, plus I\u0027m riding them at a pretty sharp camber. However they are surprisingly versatile, I\u0027ve got an extraplanetary seaplane design waiting to be tested off Kerbin and I\u0027ve got a great design working on a much, much faster amphibious rover that lacks the utility and mountaineering ability of this one but is maybe the most fun thing I\u0027ve ever driven in cockpit view (using the Mk2 xpac bubble cockpit, just an amazing IVA part, cannot recommend it enough).\n\nI have a concept in mind for a \u0022Spider\u0022 rover that is very lightweight and uses harpoons as you describe and deployable landing gear for use when pulling up rough terrain.\n\nI must also admit I am planning some changes in how I do Elcano challenges in the future, partly in how I plan and execute them and also, maybe, just maybe, toying with the idea of tossing the idea that it needs to be one rover that does them all, mostly because I am increasingly convinced that while there very well may be challenges even greater than the ice wall in the future (recent scans of Moho have even Jeb kinda worried about that one...of course I must do a polar route there, but have you SEEN that north pole terrain?), what exactly is harder to drive over than a straight wall?\n\nIt also seems like a waste of several hundred hours of quality torture testing for my products to keep putting the same vehicle through the same things. I wanted to become the master of rovers, I\u0027m not sure you get there by doing the same thing ad infinitum.\n\nPlus I think the albums are much more interesting when they\u0027re something like the ice wall than \u0022yay more grassland.\u0022 Which is also why I\u0027m considering some changes to planning phases - I think I can stop pretending kerbals can\u0027t fly and use some scouting. ScanSat views of Kerbin have already shown me I pointlessly drove right past two anomalies already that would have been a great thing to pick up on the way. I\u0027d like doing that, and I have to imagine anyone reading likes the highlights and fun moments more than the \u0022and then I drove there\u0022 bits. Actually mapping out a world using semi-realistic methods of satellite technology (the angle of view is really a wonderful mechanic to have included!) feels far more reasonable to me than just consulting a wiki, which I have avoided doing (which is why I\u0027ve missed some interesting sights, sorry guys!).\n\nNaturally long hours driving around give me plenty of time to consider how I\u0027d like to do the next one better, and this is what I\u0027ve been chewing on. Anyone think differently? For example, I am 95% certain that I will do Duna next, not to get too far ahead of myself. I still have not been there despite going much further afield due to long launch windows but one is coming up soon. I\u0027m thinking I will send the rover of course, maybe the same and maybe a different model, an atmospheric surveyor plane that I HOPE will work on Duna (PS Geschosskopf - I read your stuff and love it but often wait until after I try it myself and either succeed or fail, so I\u0027m holding off on reading that Duna flight tutorial until I find out if what I got works, just to see if I have what it takes to design a plane for an atmosphere sight unseen based only on what I predict from the basic information in the info tab, i.e. thin atmosphere, low g), and of course satellite mapping.

Again, nice job and keep up the good work!\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-16T07:42:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2015 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T12:58:49Z","Content":"Eve circumnavigation is underway, first album posted! This one\u0027s going to be special: besides being an equatorial route and a whole new rover design, I\u0027m going it all IVA, Manley Mode, from start to finish! No F2 unfortunately, I need the HUD to show the map and prove location, but future attempts with RPM cockpits may look at a no-HUD run.\n\nI\u0027ve also given the OP a much needed update, migrating much of the vehicle discussion and expanding upon it with the new vehicle catalog, detailing the rovers I drive.\n\nAlso if anyone has any great ideas for circumnavigational stunts, I\u0027m open to suggestions. I can\u0027t guarantee I\u0027ll do every insane idea but I\u0027ve got a lot of driving to do still so who knows how low I\u0027ll go to keep it entertaining?"}]}
