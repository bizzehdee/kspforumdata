Problem is, I\u0027m not exactly familiar with designing these, so I\u0027m not entirely certain how to make one that can lift the payloads I need, but minimize the fuel costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one thing, I\u0027m not sure what engines are ideal for the task, particularly since it\u0027s not as simple as slapping on Rapiers and calling it good. Is it more efficient to use a bunch of lifter engines (Mainsails, Mammoths, etc.), or should those be used along with more efficient engines (Poodles, Rhinos, etc.)? Having the more efficient engines would be great once you got out of the atmosphere since they have high ISP, but then your lifter engines become dead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to parachutes, how many do you tend to need? Same goes with drouge chutes and airbrakes, which I assume you\u0027ll need in order to slow the craft enough for the main chutes to safely deploy. Are radial chutes more ideal, or is it better to stick some on top of the side tanks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and fairings. Are they even worth using in most cases? Particularly if payloads are often fuel tanks with docking ports on the sides and maybe a Cupola module on the top. Then there\u0027s the issue with wobbly payloads inside the fairing, since the only connection between my payload and the rocket is often a docking port (A decoupler would just add velocity to the payload and screw up a rendezvous, I would assume).

Generally I stick them as \u0027nose cones\u0027 on side-tanks if the slots are available, otherwise as radial-mount inside a service bay where I also put the batteries, probe core, SAS unit and what-have-you. Airbrakes are great for keeping orientation during re-entry as well as just the braking effect but quite often you don\u0027t need them at all anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairings very much depend on the payload, although for fuel tanks and command pods they shouldn\u0027t be needed.
