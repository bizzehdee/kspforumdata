Keep following it until it moves towards the top of the nav ball, be as accurate as you can as it will move about a bit, but don\\\u0027t go mad following it when it\\\u0027s at the top. That will get rid of most sideways movement. Aim to land at as low a speed as possible, I think around 3 or 4 m/s max. I use the RCS as well for little blasts of the H key to smooth out throttle movements. Also, if you can see you\\\u0027re going to be landing on a slope, manually fly to a flatter area, then aim at the retrograde symbol again and stop the drift again.
