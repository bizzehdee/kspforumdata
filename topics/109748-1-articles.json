He put forward that a barstool with only 3 legs is more stable than one with 4. Of course I denied it could be possible, more legs is always more stable, right? So we first took to Google where we found a lot of sketchy information about how 3 points make a plane (the dimensional kind, not the kind with wings) and how the extra leg destabilizes the plane. But we couldn\u0027t find anything really concrete that said for certain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I had the great idea, let\u0027s try this in practice. Let\u0027s land on the Mun! We then spent several hours designing and testing at least 6 different mun landers and landing them on different terrain. We had tall skinny landers, wide landers, we landed on hills and flat terrain, each with a 3 leg and 4 leg variant. On a flat landing surface it seemed no different, but then we moved on to steep slopes. The wide landers performed well in either case, but to my surprise, I could not get the 4 legged tall lander down after about 10 tries, it always tipped over. Once I switched to the 3 leg variant, it landed on the first try. Not only that, but it just felt easier. The trick was to move 2 legs up hill with the 3rd downhill just before touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my brother was right (and I\u0027m not too happy about that) but at least now I know a better way to build a Mun lander.

For example, an object with more legs can have more directions it can fall more easily, one in each area between two legs. However, larger tipping points relative to circumference of the object can also lead to instability, as it is more likely for a slope to be toward a tipping point. For most slopes, fewer tipping points would be better because it minimizes the chance that the force down is close to the center of any said tipping point. The reason the third leg down-slope method worked is because it kept the pull down the slope on a corner, a direction which an object is difficult to tip.

However, four-legged tables do have their uses too. Stability occurs when the center of mass is over a place that is supported. What is useful is not the number of tipping zones, but the distance between the feet that are supporting the object, or the size of the tipping zone. If you put a tripod and a four-legged table of the same height indoors on a level floor, the tripod is easier to knock over because it is easier to move the center of mass of the object over a spot in the middle of one of the tipping zones, away from the supports. In this setting, the table is more stable, because its tipping zones are shorter, making it harder to move the center of mass to an unsupported location. However, on rugged terrain, the tripod will probably win out because the table will be very unlikely to touch down with more than three feet, and the distance between the feet that are in contact with the ground is now larger, because you have 3 legs of a table in contact with the ground (leaving one whole quadrant unsupported), rather than three evenly-spaced legs of a tripod.

The 4 legged design was chosen as a compromise between stability, redundancy and weight. I believe essentially, a lander with more legs has more angles of rotation which they are optimally stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, imagine a weight with a triangle base, and try to push it over such that one of the corners is directly opposes your push. Visualize how far you have to push it before it tips over. Now do that same except with a side of the triangle on the opposite side of your push. You will notice that you don\u0027t have to tip it as far before it tumbles over. This is because the side of the triangle is much closer to the center. Now do the same thing with a square base, then a pentagon, hexagon, and so on. You will notice that the stability when a corner of the polygon opposes your push is the same for all. The extra stability for polygon bases with more corners comes from in-optimal positions, in which a side is opposing your push, not a corner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put it into other terms: the more sides a regular polygon has, the greater its apothem (the distance from the center to the middle of an edge).

One that note, I would like to ask if you tried landing the 4 legged lander on the hill, in which 1 leg is facing downhill, 1 is uphill, and the other two are sideways. I believe the result should replicate what you saw with your three legged design. Also try it with a lander with many many legs, 8\u002B and see if it will stay upright on the hill regardless of whether a leg is facing directly downhill.

The more important things for making a lander reliable are to get a low center of mass and a wide stance. A tall single-core lander with legs right off the core will tip over much more easily than a short lander with radial tanks and legs connected to those. Unfortunately the wide lander is also significantly harder to launch now, thanks to aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T13:14:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hotblack Desiato\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hotblack Desiato\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI usually use that as lander.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H7MIHCB.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/H7MIHCB.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 legs, stable as hell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso, I think it doesn\u0027t depend so much on the number of the legs, but how far they are apart from each other. and a lander-can \u002B 4 FL-T400 tanks, with the legs on the outer edge of the tanks, that gives a very nice base, and it can\u0027t tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand that was my ten-wheel rover and my 6 leg kerbal home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kdNW6y7.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/kdNW6y7.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is of course more to stable legs. OPs solution was good for a lander which is inherently instable, namely a tower with high CoM and closely packed landing gear. Your lander on the other hand has a CoM that\u0027s practically on the same level as the landing gear and is very wide. In that case 3 legs might indeed become more of a hindrance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared, the real lunar lander did land on a pre-determined, optimal landing site, not the accidental side of a hill like you\u0027d do in KPS, so the counter-wobble of 3 legs wasn\u0027t needed and they went for the advantages of having 4 legs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThought about this some more\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen tipping over, a lander will tend to tip on two legs at once, pivoting on what is essentially an edge. A 3-legged lander can be thought of as having 3 edges like a triangle. A 4-legged lander would be a square.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distance from the center to an edge determines how far the lander can tilt before tipping over (when the CoM goes beyond the edge).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose that the feet are at a distance R from the center of the lander. In an equilateral triangle, the distance to an edge is half the distance to a corner, so R/2. In a square, that distance is R/sqrt(2) (or R/1.414). As you add more legs, the shape approaches that of a circle, so the distance to an edge keeps increasing, approaching R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on a flat surface, a lander with more legs can tilt farther before falling over because it effectively has a wider stance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a slope though, there\u0027s more going on. If you put an edge downhill, then obviously the 3-legged lander will do the worst and a many-legged lander would do best.

A 4-legged lander will tip 45 degrees away from straight downhill, and a 3-legged lander will tilt 60 degrees away.

The extra speed tends to cause frantic panic as I try to stop tipping over. Here\u0027s a thought - how about putting on 4 legs, but retracting the upslope leg during descent? Should give the best of all worlds (Except for the extra leg mass).
