We have two modes: Sandbox and Career. Science is just one tiny aspect of Career mode, Contracts are another one. The idea of having multiple versions of Career mode, where you can pick and choose which features you like, is just silly. Contracts and Funds are integral to the vision of Career mode that Squad has, they\u0027re not going to chop it up into tiny bits for every player who doesn\u0027t like this or that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game is very easily moddable. You can take out things you don\u0027t like, add things you want. You can just hack the save files if you want and give yourself infinite funds. I know this game has a very different development cycle to normal games, but can you imagine a regular action/adventure game giving you the option of playing through without a health bar or infinite ammo or something? No, if you want to do that, you use a cheat code, you don\u0027t expect the developers to just give you those options from the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, I don\u0027t even really get why you\u0027d want a career mode that\u0027s just Science. Science is a cool feature, but this whole time I\u0027ve looked at it as just a piece of something bigger to come. With just science, Career mode is just Sandbox except it takes you a while to unlock all the parts.

I get not wanting to abandon your save, and hopefully it won\u0027t break them. However, the game must move forward. Personally, I don\u0027t think making contracts optional is the way to go. Wait until the update and then learn if it breaks saves. If it does perhaps you could do some tinkering with save files or hyperedit and put all of your flags, bases, ships and kerbals into the new game. If not, well then you can keep your old save and just have to play it in 32 bit until starting a new one in .24. It\u0027s painful I\u0027m sure, but I can\u0027t think of a way to move the game forward while catering to such a high extent to old saves. I guess I just hope for you that the saves don\u0027t break or they release a patch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T09:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlay sandbox if you don\u0027t want contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that: You should be able to migrate your save from career to sandbox just fine with some clever text editing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T09:54:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Twreed87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Twreed87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaking Contracts optional is a ridiculous idea.

Right now, yes, science and the tech tree are the only things separating Career from Sandbox, but my point is that that\u0027s not how it\u0027s supposed to be. The completed vision for Career involves contracts and funds, science, reputation, probably things like astronaut training and who knows what else.
