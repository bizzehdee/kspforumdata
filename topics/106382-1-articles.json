It was a lot of fun and I was pretty happy with myself since it was the chance to set up another science lab chugging away.\n\nAnyway, before going to bed I decided I should transmit all my lab data from my various science labs. I switched vessels to one in orbit around kerbin, saw that it had 300 or so science built up and so I started uploading it.\n\nAnd then while I was waiting for this to happen the camera flipped, I was suddenly no longer in orbit but headed down. After a WFT moment (this station has NO ENGINES) I started trying to figure out what was happening. My Nav ball shows no increase in velocity but in the map view I see my orbit is becoming more elliptical second by second as though I had a small engine thrusting me away from Kerbin. Now my nice circular 125km orbit is stretched out to 240km and my station and all its kerbals are on a path down to disaster. \n\nAnd its getting worse, if I let the game run the AP just keeps going up by a few meters every second and I\u0027m locked to that spacecraft since I keep being told I cannot switch while under acceleration. Remember, this craft has no engines, and RCS and SAS are turned off, the only way out is to revert or quite the game. \n\nIs this a version of the Kraken? Help?"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:01:05Z","Content":"Alt F4 NOW!\n\nAutosave should have kicked in before the accel."},{"CreatedByName":"ScriptKitt3h","CreatedById":82780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:22:28Z","Content":"I\u0027d attempt to reload the save, but if that doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027d try and intercept the station using some sort of rescue vehicle."},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:40:21Z","Content":"I\u0027d try to replicate it.

Its like a black hole suddenly appeared in the system and is pulling my ship out of orbit. \n\nMaybe I can bail my kerbals out in EVA, they would still be in a doomed orbit but maybe I could at least match velocities that way.

Some part interaction causing a phantom force (if you have a hexagonal strut part I\u0027d point my suspicions at it).\n\nYou might be lucky and have an autosave that was made before this happened, in which case make a backup of your quicksave file, copy your persistent.sfs and rename the copy to quicksave.sfs and try and load that.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t work.\n\nYou could try using HyperEdit to replace your orbit. or you can manually edit your persistent.sfs file.\n\nActually, better to edit the quicksave.sfs so you can easily load it with f9. So do a quicksave, edit the file and search for the vessel\u0027s name, right under the name are a whole bunch of vars that define it\u0027s position. I just hyperedited a craft into a 125km orbit to get you the values, I\u0027m not 100% sure what each of them are but I think you want to take the lat, lon and alt values and all of the ORBIT sub section.
