One of the people launching rockets that day had built a small rocket with HUGE forward-slanted fins as his rocket for H and I motor qualification. On launch, the fins sheared off- leaving just stubs glued to the rocket- almost before the rocket even managed to leave the launch rail. As the fins came slowly fluttering back to the ground, the rocket, freed of the ridiculously oversized fins, zipped away almost horizontally into the far distance. (Luckily, all the fins sheared off, evening out the drag, before it could turn more than 90 degrees.) I couldn\u0027t stop laughing at it.
