God. I can\u0027t wait until Unity 5 gets here... unlimited mods! the hype! \n\nBut then something came across my mind I never thought of.... Aren\u0027t all the mods going to have to be completely re done as well from the ground up? Not the usual small little tweaks to fix incompatibilities with patches, but completely re vamped by the mod makers?"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:00:31Z","Content":"Most, if not all mods, will have to be changed/recompiled. I\u0027m not a proper Unity coder so I don\u0027t know the differences between 4 and 5, but I\u0027ll bet you the API has changed, and KSP will have to change with it in some ways."},{"CreatedByName":"Ninjahgoblin","CreatedById":144438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:15:51Z","Content":"I was thinking about this as well.

I Killed Jeb and I\u0027m not learning nothing new. When I change, you can) -\u003E well, yeah, make the most of what the OS lets you do. (-\u003E maybe macro changes)\n\nMiddle Earth (2000s - 2010): machine change -\u003E\n\n... ME APPLE, ME PRETTY, YOU PAY! No, I\u0027m Windows, stay with me or I\u0027ll kill Jeb! Oh heh, Linux and his family know how the machine works!\n\n...-\u003E engine (Unity amongst others) change as they have to/can for all of the above -\u003E One Application To Rule Them All (-\u003E maybe mod changes?)\n\nEngine-ering (sort of now): machine change -\u003E (some sort of OS then, I suppose) -\u003E YOUR ENGINE? I HAVE YOU NOW, LITTLE ONE! (-\u003E Toto, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re working for the machine any more) (-\u003E maybe mod changes)\n\nNB: No operating systems were hurt in making this post. The universe is a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple and payment will be extracted in blood on my death, or possibly as a cause of it. Disney has 10% of every poisoned apple, but will sue if you mention it. Or them. Or Mickey Mouse. Which would be the end of me, if it weren\u0027t for Apple still trying to find a buyer for bad blood. Microsoft would like to apologise for Windows but a) can\u0027t stop laughing long enough, ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) can\u0027t quite see what they have to apologise for, c) might have done already but everyone stopped listening because Apple bought the universe. Then locked it.\n\nLinux users may, of course, do exactly as they want. That\u0027s sort of the point."}]}
