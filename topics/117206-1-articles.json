Aren\u0027t all the mods going to have to be completely re done as well from the ground up?

The universe is a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple and payment will be extracted in blood on my death, or possibly as a cause of it. Disney has 10% of every poisoned apple, but will sue if you mention it. Or them. Or Mickey Mouse. Which would be the end of me, if it weren\u0027t for Apple still trying to find a buyer for bad blood. Microsoft would like to apologise for Windows but a) can\u0027t stop laughing long enough, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E can\u0027t quite see what they have to apologise for, c) might have done already but everyone stopped listening because Apple bought the universe.
