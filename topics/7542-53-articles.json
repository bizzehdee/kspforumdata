There\u0027s about two pages of discussion about it here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62270?p=980907#post980907\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62270?p=980907#post980907\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the IsControllable flag, you are correct to suggest that the flag isn\u0027t updated live, but rather gets updated whenever some ksp internal routine runs the check ... which we would naturally assume happens in OnUpdate() or OnFixedUpdate()... except maybe not quite every cycle. However, I\u0027m fairly sure it does not depend on the call to vessel.SpawnCrew().\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I did: I reset a counter to zero when a kerbal gets moved, and have OnUpdate() increment the counter each update tick.

If the former, then there is probably something that happens in ksp code in the first tick, which then triggers the check/update to happen on the second tick. A bit odd, but at least it would be consistent in terms of the OnUpdate() cycle, and can be sort of reliably used. If the latter, then there is some asynchronous process going on outside of the unity lifecycle that is dependent on processing speed and such. All bets would be off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, IsCommandable remains true throughout, so that flag likely refers to the presence of at least one part with ModuleCommand in the vessel (i.e. debris is not commandable), whereas IsControllable looks at whether crew requirements are met / EC available for probes (and I guess RT2 might be using this for lack of comms link).
