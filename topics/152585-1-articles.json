But, my attempts with Aerospike-only builds weren\u0027t successful - partly due to low launch thrust and partly as I couldn\u0027t get enough steering control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, a central Vector surrounded by Aerospikes was my eventual solution. The Vector has excellent gimbal control plus plenty of thrust - I use it a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are 6 Aerospikes on an outer ring, feeding fuel in to another 6 Aerospikes on an inner ring. The outer ring is the first stage to drop, taking the landing legs with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe remaining lower stage of 7 engines then drops off, leaving a higher ring of 6 Aerospikes surrounding a final central Aerospike. So, that\u0027s 18 Aerospikes and one Vector (plus some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually all that is left is the central Aerospike on top of FLT-800/400 tanks.. it flies straight and true like a Minuteman missile!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tested the Eve ascent using Hyperedit. I\u0027ve landed on and returned from\u00A0every other body in the system without using Hyperedit for testing, but I honestly think I would never have managed this challenge without being able to test the ascent (and the thermal entry) before the full-up mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final ship had 8500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E - and I found that\u0027s enough to get in to Eve orbit from an elevation of 5000m\u002B.

So, it became a game of trial and error - I saved my de-orbit manouver details and then tweaked by a few m/s until the landing was close enough to my target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EThermal protection - \u0027The Flower\u0027\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was really tricky! Coming in to Eve is like hitting a brick wall, especially around 46000m. Others had success with airbrakes, but in the end I went with a ring of 6 inflatable heatshields I call \u0027The Flower\u0027 to act as a an airbrake and to keep the ship retrograde-oriented. They are held back from the ship (to keep the centre of drag behind the centre of mass) using a system of girders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then had another pair of inflatable heatshields at the bottom to actually provide the thermal protection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022J5G2Dr4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J5G2Dr4.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt works pretty well - as long as you come in shallow from a low orbit.

Sometimes at 46000m things get a little wobbly, but it soon settles down and after that point (once speed drops below 1800m/s) the heat quickly dies off too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022stAyZ4Z.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/stAyZ4Z.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe harder part is getting rid of the damn shields. If they touch anything they produce a huge explosion, destroying your craft. Getting rid of \u0027The Flower\u0027 wasn\u0027t too bad - just decouple it from the base of the girders once you\u0027re through the heat and generally the whole thing just disappears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting rid of the lower two is harder, I think because they tend to bump in to each other (they overlap). I found the best results came from jettisoning \u0027The Flower\u0027 and then letting the drag from the two heatshields flip the whole vessel nose-down. Wait until a fairly low level (e.g. 10000) where the speed has dropped off significantly and then jettison them one at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that - pop the 6 drogues and the 6 radial chutes. They lower the speed\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enearly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0enough for landing - but a last second burst from the Vector allows a landing with almost full fuel tanks and with all the legs intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ze0CkWv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ze0CkWv.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EEVA\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ENo major dramas, although it took a while to arrange all the ladders and I didn\u0027t do a great job of it so getting back up was fiddly.
