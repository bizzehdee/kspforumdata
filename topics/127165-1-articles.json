The star is ejecting cuurently mass from its outer layers into the surrounding media, when the corona loses enough mass it will begin to collapse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientist of this article have found that the star is beginning to produce increasing larger dust grains. I speculate these are prolly being turned up from the radioactive\u00A0\u00A0core. \u00A0They also claim that the larger dust grains would likely survive the pending explosion being accelerated in the surrounding media. Such large grains are useful for accretion models of the type that formed our solar system, in the same way certain salts can be used to seed rain clouds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T16:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow long does a star like VY cm live anyway?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T20:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt isn\u0027t very dense.
