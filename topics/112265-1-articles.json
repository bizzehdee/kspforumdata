For a buy-in at 20-tons minimum, it would need to be significantly more productive. If I\u0027m reading my persistence files correctly, the Near Future 2.5m fission reactor outputs 2000 EC/s at maximum, at a mass of 5.4 tons, not counting any radiators you may have attached to it."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T16:01:04Z","Content":"Since the OP is talking about large reactors, radiators, and 2.5m ion engines, I\u0027d suggest directing your attention [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-1-02-Near-Future-Technologies-%28All-packs-updated-to-1-02-Finally%21%29).
