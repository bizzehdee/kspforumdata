As a matter of fact, its the one thing we get reports for that we don\u0027t act on the most. At the same time, a lot of people find threads through google, and then post in them after they haven\u0027t been relevant for quite some time. Then others come in not realizing how old it is. As [@Deddly](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/62955-deddly/) said earlier, we actually act more on necromoaning than we do necroposting. Some forums go as far as to have threads get autolocked (something some have suggested here, but we don\u0027t do for obvious reasons) after as little as two weeks without a post. As far as we\u0027re concerned, as long as the post is relevant (as well as the overall content of the thread in general), its perfectly fine."},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-30T22:03:29Z","Content":"Ok, what is a \u0022necro-moan\u0022?
