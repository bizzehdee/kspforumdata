I have found some new stuffs and so I\\\u0027m going to use Zlib compression for this project.

The basic idea is that you\\\u0027ll no longer need to copy-paste everything into and out of the mods folder, or make sure that you have a plugin installed as the manager will handle all of this before starting KSP (this should be launched first so that mods can be configured.) Currently the method of packing mods does \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E preserve the file system, so I\\\u0027ve decided to use a .ZIP format instead and encrypt it so that it can\\\u0027t be modified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother feature that could be possible is automatic updating. For users that use Dropbox to host their addons, I can get a download from it of the file requested. Possibly this would be a version file that would be used simply to check the version, then, if the addon is outdated, the user can update to the new one. The existing information would be deleted and the new version put in it\\\u0027s place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you guys think, otherwise I\\\u0027ll discontinue my current work.
