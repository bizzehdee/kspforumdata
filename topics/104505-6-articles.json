It\u0027s really slow to balance, though; the lander still landed and tilted over - it balances itself over the course of about a minute. This is really only useful if you\u0027re building a surface base and need to level the structure for a docking port.\n\nWhile I appreciate your work and effort, SpaceTiger, the legs balance too slowly to be of use when landing an ordinary lander on a slope and hoping to prevent it from toppling over.\n\nI was hoping the mod would do something like\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/3bujGZP7a_o?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n (which dynamically measures the distance to the ground from the bottom of each landing leg and extends/retracts each leg in real time so that the craft is perfectly level at the moment of touchdown). (The reason I don\u0027t use kOS is that this solution requires extra parts, and I\u0027m already hitting the memory limit, so I was hoping to have a solution that includes everything in the one automated part).\nIs there any chance you could do something like this, please?"},{"CreatedByName":"jlcarneiro","CreatedById":79196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T04:07:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Autobalancing landing legs... how to make it work?

As far as the game is concerned there is no difference in simulation between rendering to 720x1280 from rendering 1080x1920. However, from a side of GPU consumption there is a major difference. This provides a decent thumbnail for the window managing system (Aero on Windows, Aqua on OS X and the Compositor on Linux) while further reducing graphic consumption. One could also turn off Antialiasing and aniso filtering because nobody will notice that they are missing. \n\nIf one really wanted to tinker in settings, one could reduce the quality of the mip-mapping bias when in this mode as well. This would even further reduce GPU consumption. However, it would also add unnecessary bulk to the mod that might not be worth it.\n\nAnother mod I\u0027d like to see is overburn functionality to engines. This would allow LFO Rocket engines to run at 200% power, at the cost of overheating if kept on, and a possible loss of efficiency. This is an actual functionality put into real world engines. \n\nFinally, is there a way you could replace the GUI heat gauge on parts with a simple heat warning, that is a small icon that flashes over the part when the heat gauge would almost be full. If the heat gauge could be put in the right click menu instead, that would also be a nice mini tool.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T22:49:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ruedii**\n  \nAdded a second and third request"},{"CreatedByName":"Scientist","CreatedById":129760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T20:32:47Z","Content":"for afteburner, there is ToggleAfterBurner event, could you also add an EnableAfterBurner and DisableAfterBurner plz?![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nedit: enabling afterburner should also set throttle to max\n\nnormal engine operation is more efficiency, afterburners is literally dumping fuel into the exhaust for extra thrust\n\nso nobody in their right mind should use afterburner without max thrust\n\nthat said i\u0027m sure some nut would complain, so perhaps a KSPField SetThrootleMax = false\n\nthen if config sets true, it acts as i suggested, else works current way ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nedit: just realized throttle applies to all engines uh...\n\nsome way to max throttle / ignore throttle \u002B set full while afterburner on?\n\nedit: XD maybe some extra fiery exhaust effect while afterburner active\n\ndont hate me for bein a thinker! ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T21:35:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scientist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tahib","CreatedById":111243,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T01:39:58Z","Content":"It seems the Legs do work most of the time, but sometimes they get bugged.
