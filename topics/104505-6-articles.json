As far as the game is concerned there is no difference in simulation between rendering to 720x1280 from rendering 1080x1920. However, from a side of GPU consumption there is a major difference. This provides a decent thumbnail for the window managing system (Aero on Windows, Aqua on OS X and the Compositor on Linux) while further reducing graphic consumption. One could also turn off Antialiasing and aniso filtering because nobody will notice that they are missing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf one really wanted to tinker in settings, one could reduce the quality of the mip-mapping bias when in this mode as well.
