Be warned at least 4 engines is needed for this design to be stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is again 4 engines with then angled slightly off center. So the two at the front point forwards with the engin at about a 35-45 degree angle facing the nose and the dame for the rear engines towards the tail. Stick a 5 engin on the back in the normal place to move forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the design I have used in the mox industries thread in my Sig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3 is a small light craft with just 2/3 engines. 2 on the end of the wings pointing down ans one on the rear of the plane for forward momentum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T13:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA tail-sitter aircraft balanced on a single engine also works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sufficient tilted wings will give you an almost-VTOL effect where you can take off and land over short distances and go very slowly without falling out of the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foursh","CreatedById":34197,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T15:54:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find using the avionics package instead of the regular ASAS helps a lot with control.

For vertical take off I use no more than 2 jet engines because you can disable the one or both with a single click. Also the avionics sas is best imo because it alows for slight adjustments in pitch roll and yaw which help while hovering. While testing mine I disable the horizontal engine and slowly increase speed of the vertical engines until the craft starts to lift off the ground. I\u0027m looking for the slowest climb possible because sometimes even a balanced vtol will pitch slightly during takeoff. Then enable sas and check for balance. If it pitches foward go back to the SPH and move the engines foward. If the craft pitches back then move the engines back. Keep adjusting untill it\u0027s balanced.
