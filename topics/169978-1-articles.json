I bought this game way back and use to play it a lot and like it until that overhaul ruined the game for me. I no longer found it fun and stopped(I don\u0027t care if it was unrealistic its a game and is still unrealistic anyway). I checked back on release and didn\u0027t see any mods only some others requesting the same thing, but I\u0027m hoping by now or is it just not possible to mod that aspect of the game?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am tempted to give ksp another go, but I gave up on the new system back then as it was just to hard, and Im a casual player with only a few hours to play after work here and there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-22T23:42:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2018 11:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by MaGicBush\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-23T03:17:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know of any mods that make the aerodynamics less realistic.
