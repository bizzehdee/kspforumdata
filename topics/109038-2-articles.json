For most purposes they should be annoying as hell and heavy in Earth gravity. They\u0027d kick arse on small moons or planets with non-Oxy atmospheres though. Weight not such an issue, and the atmosphere is essentially heated and accelerated regardless of it\u0027s chemistry.\n\nA lot of hard data is missing from the tests and reasons for cancelling etc, but it\u0027s suspicious that it was cancelled shortly after they ran the airborne shielding tests. It might be that engine plus shielding was just too heavy. Again, requires kerbals to care. And the trade off would be for extremely long airborne times.
