Pick an area for a new subdivision, draw roads till it\u0027s saturated with buildable areas, designate the zoning, place a very simplistic water\u00A0pipe network, add access to\u00A0electricity, wait for the population to fill in. Repeat. I have not had to do much serious analysis to figure out problems my city was having, other than perhaps chronic railroad congestion (which can only be solved until rail traffic volume increases again, over which you have zero control).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end-game mechanics are not great. There are a handful of game-breakingly good buildings available (infinite electricity, infinite healthcare, infinite education, etc.), and to unlock them, you have to build all of a lower tier of unique buildings with a variety of unlock requirements. However, those lower tier unique buildings have no function except as recreation/tourism destinations and increasing land value, and those benefits don\u0027t cover their exorbitant upkeep costs. In my cities, I\u0027ve spammed all of them in a designated wonder-ghetto, then opened their properties and turned them off, just to unlock the top tier stuff. It feels insufficiently designed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe budget is kind of opaque and random-feeling. I\u0027ve watched weekly net income fluctuate between -10000 and \u002B20000 without me making any changes to the city. Luckily it\u0027s easy to accumulate a reserve for padding so the current specific budget numbers matter less than the long term trend.\u00A0You can see how much you\u0027re spending overall in categories like health and transport, and you can scale expenditures up and down proportionally, but it\u0027s hard to tell whether you\u0027re meeting needs or overspending until, say, dead bodies are piling up all over the city. Similarly, sea ports and train stations show you how much you\u0027re spending on upkeep but not how much you\u0027re making from the added commerce, so you have to guess whether they\u0027re worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also found the natural resources run out too quickly.\u00A0You build a whole section of your city to exploit oil or ore, and by the time the population in that area is settled and stable, the resource is gone and it\u0027s just another generic zone. I decided to install\u00A0an infinite resource mod so such areas could retain their distinctive character.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I can\u0027t say I had no fun with it. The visuals are particularly good. If you like city builders, your time and money will be relatively well spent. If you don\u0027t like city builders, I wouldn\u0027t expect this game to draw you into the genre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T15:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got it and tried to start it multiple times.
