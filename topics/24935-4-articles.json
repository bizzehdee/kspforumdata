In reality, the crew quarters of a spacecraft will be arranged more like a skyscraper than like an aircraft. You will feel like the direction of \u0022down\u0022 is in the same direction the exhaust is going.\u003Cp\u003EI disagree with your statement. Look at the spaceshuttle for example, certainly not laid out like a \u0022skyscraper\u0022, it may seem that way on launch but the interiors are all laid out like an airplane. This is needed since it comes back like one. Spacecraft can be laid out however they are needed, since when the engines are thrusting everyone should be strapped into seats anyway. In fact this \u0022airplane\u0022 layout would make the most sense for a spacecraft that will land on a planet, since its much easier to attach wings and or VTOL engines than if it was designed with the \u0022skyscraper\u0022 layout\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spanier","CreatedById":57247,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T22:40:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sole and only somehow \u0022realistic\u0022 Sci-Fi movie I know is \u00222001: A Space Odyssee\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a giant, ion-powered monstership with artificial gravity and hibernation chambers sounds realistic to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nexustrimean","CreatedById":33308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T22:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf i remember correctly the Starfury\u0027s from babylon 5 were fairly accurate physics wise.
