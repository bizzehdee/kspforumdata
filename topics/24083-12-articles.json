Yeah, I haven\u0027t gotten around to writing it, but you seem to have nailed it. Basically break Mach over 10kms by going shallow (your exact angle depends on TWR, and the later you do it, the easier it is), then go as shallow as you dare to gain mucho speed. When you start overheating pitch up a bit, and once you run out of air you want to have as much vertical velocity as you can, without creating too much drag by pitching up brusquely. In case of doubt, let it go and stop touching things. Those insane G\u0027s you pull when you turn at high speeds are all in the wrong direction to gain speed. I would correct you only in that when you have a time to apoapsis over 50s or so, you are better off telling the autopilot to hold prograde to minimize drag, and that you can perfectly fine circularize on RAPIERs: they actually have the same isp as Thuds (I love that name).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

Let\u0027s see, AoA vs heights... Keep \u0026gt;20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA until 10kms, then go to 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA to go past Mach.

Or, you don\u0027t: then you could probably had gotten faster on airbreathers going shallower (this one is mostly for the Longsword). I think the Spatha and the White Dart have the TWR to do the speed run at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA and still switch at over 1,200m/s, but you know, this way you will get even more out of them (I confess I\u0027ve never put an airbreather above 1,300m/s during a climb, so I myself can get better climbs... it\u0027s probably that last pull up, I chicken out too fast)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
