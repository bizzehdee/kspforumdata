If you are flying towards an event, it appears to have happened earlier. So both rockets need to be departing away from Earth. It still causes a \u0022paradox\u0022, but honestly, time travel isn\u0027t an issue with real physics. The fact that you prevent event\u0027s cause using a CTC resolves itself trivially in field theory. Like many things in QM, it\u0027s easiest to understand from MWI perspective. All you did was create another branch in the many worlds. One that is, admittedly, a bit odd for anyone involved. But there are no fundamental contradictions in logic anywhere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand (which may be off, but bear with me). Having consistent histories seems to be a fly in the MWI soup. As both parties could check history, and see it still matches up. Now if there tuely is many universes with many possible outcomes, there is no reason to prefer one history over another when checking. So they should theoretically have the same probability of finding a different history, as they do for branching into a new branch. (For example I can record an event, then check the same event again to see if I get a different result)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I check for historic results, I don\u0027t get a new branch of the MW, I get the same one every time. Whenever I check, I am always born on the same day, I never find it \u0022flipped\u0022 to a new one. However, in the example of travelling back in time, they branch into a new history, anything could change. This would seem to be a difference in the theory, which does not match observation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, we need to be very careful when drawing assumed realities from perfectly relevant and predictive calculations.

To go back in time (thus travel faster than light) seems trivial and possible when observing things on the quantum level. As far as we can tell, things DO on the quantum level.

There\u0027s no such thing as \u0022faster than light\u0022, because light always moves \u0022instantly\u0022 as far as geometry is concerned. We perceive this as it moving at a set speed because of geometry of the universe. c, if interpreted as a speed, can be exceeded in various ways by various things, but it\u0027s more than a speed. It\u0027s a fundamental geometric constant that defines how reference frames interact. The truth is, we\u0027ve got serious difficulties when it comes to relativity. You can \u003Cem\u003Ealways \u003C/em\u003Ego \u0022faster\u0022, if you add more momentum, you\u0027ll reach your destination in shorter time. Period. However, beyond a certain point, you\u0027ll seem to be moving at near c for a stationary observer, and your time will start slowing down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem indeed comes down to \u0022what fast is\u0022. If you tried measuring speed as distance/travel time, you would seem to have traveled faster than light if the flight was done at near c. But you\u0027d underestimate distance you traveled, due to Lorenz contraction. On the other hand, an outside observer doing that would measure your speed at being near c, but he\u0027d overestimate your travel time due to time dilation. So which approach is correct? Turns out, there\u0027s no such thing as \u0022correct time/distance\u0022. When everything is relative, everyday terms like \u0022fast\u0022 and \u0022far\u0022, \u0022slow\u0022, etc. become useless. Even \u0022moving\u0022, \u0022simultaneous\u0022 and other such terms need clarification to work with relativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mentioned universe expanding at FTL speeds, but that\u0027s merely because \u003Cem\u003Eit isn\u0027t matter that is moving. \u003C/em\u003EWhat is expanding is the very fabric of space. Limits that apply to matter don\u0027t necessarily apply to space, because they\u0027re different entities. Alcubierre drive uses the same effect.

IIRC, you never gave your criteria, so I assumed \u0022parts of the model that influence the outcome in a significant way\u0022. Which I personally consider incomplete and too strict, here is why. The way the universe is expanding according to our current best understanding implies that there is a cosmological horizon: A \u0022sphere\u0022 around us where everything inside the sphere can potentially still influence us and everything outside can not (assuming FTL is impossible) and also cannot influence anything inside the sphere. And locally, that horizon is sweeping inwards towards us with the speed of light. As I write this, maybe another star has moved from the inside to the outside. Ten minutes ago (in its proper time), it could still send light that could reach us, now it can\u0027t. There is no reason to assume anything bad has happened to it, yet if you only grant reality to things that can possibly be observed, it stopped existing. That does not sound right to me.
