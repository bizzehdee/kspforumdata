Four swept wings, submerged in water at some angle and four tail fins on the tip of each swept wing. When fuel get used up, ship emerges somewhat and one tail fin destroyed. This cause that side of ship to submerge somewhat and opposite side to emerge and symmetrical tail fin is destroyed too. It\u0027s some kind of self-balanced system.

The rest of the ship was strutted firmly. In result, all the frame, behaving as one piece, was shaking like mad around the core which stayed in place because of its high inertia.
