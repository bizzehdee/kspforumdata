The bottom line that the rules in this are nonsensically arbitrary, so it\u0027s disgustingly pathetic how this works out exactly and I have no short explanation out of the sleeve to hand over to you.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003EFirst of all it\u0027s best to use \u0022autostruts\u0027\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is a function when you right click on a part followed by a context menu where it says autostrut with 3 options (heaviest, root and grandparent)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis option is only visible when enabling \u0022advanced tweakables\u0022 in the main menu general settings (have to revert to main menu and have the \u0022strut\u0022 part unlocked in the tech tree when playing career)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAutostrut rules in a nutshell:\u003C/strong\u003E If you have a central stack (like a 2.5m rocket with several tanks, cockpit, and other modules within) then it is best to use only \u0022grandparent part\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nEspecially when the vessel is long it is often useful to autostrut the far end (the engines) to root (assuming root is the cockpit above) to stiffen the rigidity over the full length.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have parallel tanks to the sides then it is best to use \u0022Grandparent autostrut\u0022 only on the parallel part (fuel tank) that is directly attached to the central stack but the other fuel tanks attached to the parallel stacks are better attached to root or heaviest to weld the parallel rigidity to the core stack. Otherwise you grandparent the parallel tanks to the same fuel tanks on the parallel stack while it\u0027s better to strut it to the central stack which is stiffened through grandparent struts with which they\u0027re attached to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively you can use the part strut but they have added weight and minor aerodynamic drag so try to avoid them. I usually only use them in odd situations where heaviest or root part are in off locations, or I use the strut part for looks as it may sometimes serve the aesthetic purposes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, to address all the bits and pieces considering the above quote...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLanding gear and rover wheels need to be straight. You can use number keys (1,2,3 and 4) to switch between Place, move, rotate and select root. You can use \u00223\u0022 (rotate) to put landing gear on a angle for better rolling stability. But this also means they will break faster when hitting terrain.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe further any part (fuel tank or wing) is moved away from the parent part the less rigid it becomes. It may make it wiggle but it won\u0027t break off mostly. Under flight such parts are under aerodynamic stress and (rigid attachment will make connections brittle and break so don\u0027t use it)\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUnfortunately with wings you want to add other sections to that wing but when you add more attachment points on the Width of a craft (by adding wing segments to other wing segments) the furthest attachment point becomes more flexing and brittle. Eventually there\u0027s a point where you autostrut them, fly your vessel under the best piloting skill and by the time you reach 400m/s they start to fall of. \u003Cem\u003EDoes this mean you can\u0027t make massively large wings?\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cu\u003EFortunately you can.\u003C/u\u003E What you want to do is place each individual wing part to the fuselage itself. That means you want your wing tip to be attached to the central fuel tank just as the first wing segment is which is directly attached to it. The culprit is that you have to \u003Cu\u003Emove:tool\u003C/u\u003E each wing segment to the corresponding spot and that you have to individually move each part away from one another. With the editor extension mod posted above you should have the freedom to move parts anywhere even outside the space plane hangar lol\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThrough this method of attaching wings I created the biggest rapier cargo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E there is (not the biggest but the most cargo capacity AFAIK) excuse me for undeserved boasting rights.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you want to magnify yourself into that design and how I made that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E then you can download it at my KerbalX.

Best is to move them from one another until they barely touch one another.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAttaching parts to specific other parts may prove better then attaching them to specific other parts. You can use the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E again as I used the following trick for that design also.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you mouse point over the central main landing gear there are 2 \u0022Extra Large landing gear\u0022 on that space plane. One of them is attached to the central fuel tank and the Engine block is attached to that main landing gear.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou would have to use \u0022absolute mode\u0022 (Press F) and use rotate (3) with (5-90\u00B0 rotating increments, toggle using C) to rotate the engine block into linear relation to the fuselage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe apparent benefit of attaching super heavy stuff to landing gear is that landing gear parts are extremely rigid. (every landing gear with the heavy landing gear being the strongest)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe further a part is from it\u0027s connection point the more wiggly it becomes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLanding gear doesn\u0027t wiggle and is shut stuck into position even if you drag it to the outside of your vessel. This is probably to accommodate rolling balance so wheels don\u0027t drift or shift out of balance because of silly wheel physics. Many people are aware that you can use hyperedit and drop a super heavy vessel using the \u0022Heaviest landing gear\u0022 from 200meters high and hit the surface at 50m/s or more and survive. And well, that\u0027s the deal with these landing gear. They don\u0027t bend, wiggle, vibrate or even break.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSo if you need something very heavy on one end (or both ends) of your vessel it\u0027s best to use the largest landing gear, drag it to the sides and remove lower/retract from the landing gear action group (unless it serves as landing gear as in my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E) and then attach the heavy module to it\u0027s surface and use rotation to snap it horizontal/vertical. The added benefit is that it is nearly impossible for it to break off. I tested this and it is the best method to have very heavy stuff hanging off from one side, the other benefit is that landing gears are very aerodynamic so they have no penalty to be used as such a rigid attachment surface and you can attach Kilotons to a Extra Large landing gear and it will serve it\u0027s purpose under what I consider ludicrous designs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFurthermore it is best to use the widest fuel tanks as possible. If the main stack is 2.5m try to stay at 2.5m and not shrink to 1.25m. If you have a 1.25m central stack with very much stuff hanging onto it and it has to endure aerodynamic stress then it is best to use a wider setup.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf a part is rotated from another part (like in a ring station) the connection is just as rigid. But a rotation from one piece to another piece creates a spring effect while the snap off rigidity remains the same.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo theoretically a rotated part under stress while it might be due to momentum (thrust) or impact should snap off sooner compared to not being rotated. AFAIK I have never snapped off a rotated part due to aerodynamics or impact so beyond theory you shouldn\u0027t worry. Just try not to attach something extremely heavy to a rotated part just to be safe, otherwise test it yourself and let us know \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223571695\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183254\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221553905141\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196345\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Celthon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Celthon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt; If the parts have been moved (and to my thinking \u0022misaligned\u0022) with the move and/or rotate tools, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#f1c40f;\u0022\u003E1: are angles\u003C/span\u003E, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#8e44ad;\u0022\u003E2:thrust lines\u003C/span\u003E,\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#3498db;\u0022\u003E 3:lifting surfaces\u003C/span\u003E, etc., affected, causing a craft to behave in unexpected ways or to respond to control inputs differently than expected?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#f1c40f;\u0022\u003E1:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#f1c40f;\u0022\u003E Angles\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#f1c40f;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 For Vacuum spacecraft rotated misalignment usually doesn\u0027t matter. KSP calculates drag on the attachment setup. If 1.25m is attached to 1.25m it has no added drag. When you rotate them from one another they would increase drag because doing so creates a dent into a cylindrical shape and it increases the frontal cross section. On a jet engine \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E this will be a problem as it may add to much drag to break the sound barrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#8e44ad;\u0022\u003E2:\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#9b59b6;\u0022\u003EThrust lines:\u003C/span\u003E The same balance has to be met in terms of Thrust balance.

If this thrust arrow moves below the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust will make the plane pitch up.

Imagine a airplane flying level at 0\u00B0 pitch with 0\u00B0 horizontal wings relative to the fuselage. What would the airplane do? It would sink...\u003Cbr\u003E\nTake any airliner on a picture album and see that most airplanes have their wing on a incline (That means the wing is rotated several \u00B0 above horizontal) In that scenario a airplane would stay level at 0\u00B0 (at least at a certain speed: \u0022cruising speed?\u0022)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is so the wing has positive lift at operating speeds so that the fuselage is straight into the wind. If you don\u0027t put this incline (wing incidence) on the airplane the plane has to pitch to create the desired lift but the fuselage will also rise above the prograde reticle and suffer more drag whereby it enlarges the frontal cross section. AFAIK most \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E professional users make use of wing incidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem with wing incidence is that it creates a pitching moment based on the inclination of the wing. A inclined wing in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E will want to rise the nose. So what you do is rotate a incline on the front or rear stabilizers to re-balance this effect. Best is to design that the Center of Mass in Wet mode (fueled mass) is similar to the Dry mode (empty fueled) and you can use the RCSbuildAid mod to see dry/wet mass indicators using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E icon on the vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is best to balance this effect by rotating front/rear stabilizers to mitigate this effect. Otherwise the Elevon to correct that effect has to pitch and it will add drag. Keep playing with incline until the plane flies more or less level without control input or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and you will have little no no control surface drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother point about lifting surfaces is that for the best \u0022roll\u0022 effect elevons directly to the larboard/starboard sides in relation to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E across the vessel length will cause greater rolling torque. So if Elevons on the rear are set to roll (away from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E) the effect is lessened.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe closer the Center of Lift is to the Center of Thrust the less torque is required to roll, pitch or yaw the vessel. Sometimes however the front has more drag then the rear causing a plane to flip when achieving a certain airspeed if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is to close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, so it is often better to place it somewhat behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E unless you know what your doing and you want a very agile plane.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are also wing attachment methods called dihedral and anhedral.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EDihedral\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E is that the wings are rotated so that the tips point slightly upward. This creates a keeling/swing effect like on a marine ship and acts as a horizontal roll stabilizer whereby it\u0027s effect causes the plane to roll natively to 0\u00B0 bank for level flight. The swing effect is that the Center of Lift will be above the Center of Mass making the mass of the vessel swing below the Center of Lift which is why it wants to natively level out when using this trick. The keeling effect creates native vertical stabilizing effect also.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EAnhedral\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E is the opposite whereby wings are rotated with the tips to the ground. Here the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is below the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. The benefit is very fast and immediate roll input. So for agility a small level of Anhedral wing design can be beneficial. It also creates the Keeling effect as with Dihedral.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223571695\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183254\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221553905141\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196345\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Celthon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Celthon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt; If none of this matters, what is the point of the green/black connection points...I was operating from the assumption it is where the parts have to be attached, to be attached \u0027correctly\u0027...it\u0027s very possible I did not read something correctly or entirely in the beginning and have been operating with incomplete information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo see where you could attach to?
