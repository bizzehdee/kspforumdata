Now crashes begin happening, usually when you begin your rendezvous burn, sometimes right after you plan your rendezvous burn, sometimes when you warp to the maneuver.

Not related to proximity to target (eg. not tied to the pop-in from 2.2 km away)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorkarounds tried: -force-OpenGL (spelling?), -force-d3d11, lowering conics limit - the only thing that seems to work (however frustrating) is unselecting the rendezvous target until a stable orbit is achieved in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, ie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni. start your rendezvous maneuver,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nii. When your maneuver achieves your earliest stable orbit, you can re-set the target\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\niii. Burn retrograde to target for final stop\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other other workaround is, of course, to circularize at the destination \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E before attempted to set target or rendezvous but this adds extra burns, time, and delta-V costs.\u00A0 The problem seems to be that the back-end is getting some unhandled exception trying to calculate your intersect 1 \u0026amp; 2 with target as well as your new orbit data as you are both transitioning to the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E orbit and meeting your target. I\u0027m not a programmer per se but it seems like it gets very upset performing that math especially during the burn as the values change violently. Any better workarounds or fixes for this bug?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Been playing around with such a burn/crash, and it looks like I can consistently trigger the crash by looking at the Intercept Info Tab in the Maneuver Data Panel (bottom left of screen), the crash does not happen if looking at the Orbital or Advanced Orbital tabs. Something about having the intersect tab open while you\u0027re burning and not in a stable orbit yet/still on track to leave \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.
