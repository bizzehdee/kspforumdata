FUN STUFF. If anyone here has played it thumbs up to you. Well I\u0027m a bit late to the party (about a decade, give or take a couple of years). I have been interested in AI for a while but somehow I completely missed the fact that Steve Grand existed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out he\u0027s been working on a new Creatures game called Grandroids. It\u0027s a life sim based on mimicking biological systems in very fine detail (down to the DNA and biochemistry that come with these systems, and how all of this affects the way the brain works) with the goal of creating an artificial life form (yes really) that thinks to a certain degree, in the real sense of the word, beyond winning jeopardy or beating kasparov with brute force computational power. The goal is to create something akin to a mammal, a creature that plans ahead - as opposed to the Norns of Creatures 3 which were just reactionary systems in that they were able to react to novel situations and respond to certain base drives like wanting to not starve or kicking a ball around for fun. This paragraph cannot do the project justice though so I encourage everyone to visit his blog at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://stevegrand.wordpress.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://stevegrand.wordpress.com\u003C/a\u003E There\u0027s a whole section devoted to Grandroids, even though it\u0027s fairly old.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that made me post this here though is that he\u0027s doing this using the Unity engine. Procedural planets and biomes are cool and all KSP but they are lifeless... How amazing would it be if instead of going places to gather science points we actually went there to check out the life forms. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/discuss\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T16:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it is wishful thinking, but it would be cool if Kerbals walked around a bit if you\u0027re not directly controlling them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T17:21:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have used and written several AI/A-Life systems over the past few decades. They\u0027re interesting but the trouble with a chemical-scale one such as you describe is that the computer has to simulate so many billions of reactions for anything even as big as a virus - plus all its environment - that you need a supercomputer or three for any non-trivial. No-one had managed to get from chemical-stage to convincing bacteria last time I looked - but you might like to check the literature.
