As an object passes through the air at supersonic or hypersonic speeds, the air bunches up in front of it. Compression of any material raises the temperature. As said before, the resulting temperature increase in Kelvin is roughly equal to the object\u0027s velocity in meters per second. That\u0027s temperature. Think of temperature as the average amount of heat. Temperature is not quantity. Heat is quantity. Dense materials or media have more heat than less dense materials. So high up in the atmosphere at 7000 meters per second, the temperature is about equal to 7000 K. The denser the air, the more heat is transferred to the reentry vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlunt bodied objects like the backside of an Apollo capsule work to keep most of the shockwave from contacting the hull and also provide a lot of drag to slow the craft down. However, I\u0027ve also seen it said that pointier vehicles would be better because most of the shockwave would pass by harmlessly. Maybe that\u0027s true too, but they don\u0027t provide enough drag to slow down an incoming capsule full of astronauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m having trouble with deadly reentry on 10X Kerbin, none of the heat shields work, simple de-orbit from 250 km to 60 km is death.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a FAQ on the very first page that answers questions like this. It has a link to a file that provides shields designed for planets on that scale. (though I need to create a version of it that is not RO specific, it will work for you)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, you might want to try the beta. Default DRE shields might deplete faster but will still protect better in the beta. They may deplete faster but will resist heating better. That part is still WIP, but when I test the beta with 10x Kerbol, I I explicitly do so without the RSS / RO class shields because one of the goals of the beta is to not be reliant on special configs. The logic is that materials that evaporate or sublimate do not heat up past the temperature of evaporation / sublimation until there is no more ablator left. (The same principle makes it possible to boil water in a paper cup: Paper can not reach its ignition point because it will not heat up past the boiling point of water unless massive amounts of heat are concentrated on it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother word of advice, the more time you spend in the upper atmosphere, the more time you have to slow down. Some people might tell you to adopt a steeper reentry angle but that can result in high G forces killing your Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T01:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell may problem is a little more odd then that, I can get the Mk1 pod back from 250X60 km orbit, as long as I don\u0027t using physics warp, with 115 out of 250 ablative cork left.
