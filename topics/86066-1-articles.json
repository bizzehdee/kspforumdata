If you are looking down on the solar system and Jool is at the bottom and the Sun is near the middle then you need to burn left to get towards Kerbin. If Laythe is going left and you ship is also orbiting left then both of these things will add up and give you a boost meaning you don\u0027t need a lot of DeltaV to perform the manoeuvre. To be more accurate you perform the burn a bit before Laythe and your ship in orbit are both going fully left as Jools gravity will pull you round a bit. That\u0027s a simple description \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOP. In your case Kerbin is not in the correct place when you do your burn. This is not a problem because the trip takes so long you only need to add a bit of a radial adjustment to your manoeuvre node that Kerbin will be in a different place by the time you get there. Adding a slight radial adjustment to your burn will make the trip longer and if you give it enough time Kerbin will have come right around by the time you get to the intersection of Kerbins orbit. Does this make sense?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jodo42","CreatedById":68895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T21:50:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe radial solution worked.

Glad it worked. I don\u0027t have a complete explanation for how it works but if you are far away from a target or moving slowly with respect to it then the radial burn becomes a lot more useful than normal. When I\u0027m entering the SOI of a moon or planet it is easier to adjust the periapsis using radial burns I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
