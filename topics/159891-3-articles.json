Rails do play a vital role e.g. in Germany, France and Switzerland. French have the sexy TGV (renamed i read), speed up to 300km/h overland, Germany a dense ICE network, speeds up to 280km/h. That makes a flight between lets say M\u00FCnchen and Frankfurt more of an ego decision.

They remain open no matter what era they\u0027re in. Exception being the UK which rails were run by truly private companies, many serves short distribution services, which ends up having those\u00A0\u0022short\u0022 lines removed later when rails were brought under a national company (where only long-distance matters most of the time). The same can be seen in the US, but due to the vastly larger size, when later a lot of short freight movement moved to the road or other means, and only long-distance freight remains profitable, a lot of the lines close down (or rarely maintained), practically the\u00A0passenger transport becomes a terrible burden - hence Amtrak. It goes even worse when (jet)plane appears as long-distance passenger movement nearly\u00A0dissapears on rails.\u00A0Inner-city (or local) transit becomes scant as the long distance one barely exist. When people feel the need of having a local transit again,\u00A0the rail infra are no longer up to the task (most of the branches left deserted or the local stations closed and/or occupies by extra sidings). I can see that probably Elon was thinking on making some ways to ensure people keep the local transit alive by encouraging people to use some non-plane or car transport, but I don\u0027t see why the same can\u0027t be said to just providing a transit in the first place to airports etc.. If he was trying just to have that. If he wants to redo the intercity rails, I\u0027m sure a well-maintained line with traffic segregation between passenger and freight would work better\u00A0under the same cost (I mean, come on, 50 mph isn\u0027t enough, most train in europe would run 100 mph or more).

Light rail in the US is never cost effective, for example. Busses make far more sense than trains, they are scalable, and require no new infrastructure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022Railrunner\u0022 train in NM (seen on Mythbusters in an episode) cost half a billion to solve a problem that doesn\u0027t exist, then they charge so little that it doesn\u0027t pay for operations.

And while rail systems can also have their problems, rail tended to work very well for commuting. It is usually more consistent in terms of how long the commute takes. And instead of moving a person and a car back and forth to work, you only move the person. Unless the car is actually desired at the office, this just makes more sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, buses can provide some of the same benefit, but crucially they tend to be caught in the same traffic jams as the cars.
