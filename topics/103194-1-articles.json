It\u0027s getting really boring. I mean, really, really boring. We haven\u0027t done a real mission in years. Bill and Bob are off to an \u0022undisclosed location\u0022, but since we don\u0027t have the funds to space anything, it can\u0027t be cool. Those greeping stockholder people. They never give us any money. Gene\u0027s been going to meetings almost every day now, and he always comes out with the same frustrated look on his face. They must be giving him a hard time. He says he\u0027s been vouching our best ideas, our most efficient, even the safest - and they find some way to shut it down. Most of the volunteer staff left. For paying jobs, can\u0027t say I blame them. It\u0027s a good thing I only need food once a month and sleep on the ceiling, but the lack of doing ANYTHING is taking a big toll on the 20 or so engineers and pilots and scientists we have left. If Bob were here I know he would do something to keep us busy. Cookouts or camping on the Launch pad or Calvinball or something. No one else wants to play that, they\u0027re too depressed. If we don\u0027t get a project soon, this space center is gonna close. I can feel it. Jeb out.\n\nP.S. How the geep do we afford these buildings? Almost nobody on staff makes money of any kind, except Bob and Bill, they\u0027re on a secret military contract (sorry, gene, I read your log), and Wernher for talking at universities and consulting in his spare time. I don\u0027t know how almost everyone is below the poverty line but we have modern buildings.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nLog entry II, KSC command.\n\nGene was angry at me for reading his log. And taking down the firewall he set up to protect the log. Dunno why they call it a fire wall. It\u0027s not a wall and it\u0027s not on fire. And logs make no sense either. Why is it called a log? It\u0027s not wood. Whoever names things is probably drunk full-time. Anyway, Wernher seems to be brightening up, but he won\u0027t tell anyone why. Even Gene seemed remarkably forgiving about the log. Also, he\u0027s not going to those meetings anymore. Last night I heard some debating in the Administration building, and then there was shouting, and some loud smacking noises, and Gene came out ten minutes later full of bruises and a slight grin. I saw the medical bay this morning and Erbal was treating some badly punched-up businesskerbals. Apparently they all tripped and fell, or so goes the story. Wish administration would tell us why they seem so happy. We could use happies.\n\nP.S. launching rockets isn\u0027t actually the safest way to pass the time. I dug some \u0027KESTES\u0027 model rocket engines out of the junkyard, filled em, and launched them all in one big cluster. After that a group of pilots with their hair on fire came back with my rocket and patiently explained the concept of safety to me. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll launch the next engines tomorrow."},{"CreatedByName":"VelocityPolaris","CreatedById":101162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T06:16:43Z","Content":"Gene\u0027s base log - secure channel, log entry 87.\n\nIf anyone reads this, and that means hacking all the firewalls, please don\u0027t share this information with anyone. Now, you may be asking, why post it on the cloud then? The answer: I\u0027m lonely. Everyone knows Kerbals don\u0027t age in the traditional sense, like most plants and animals. I am... old. If you knew my real age, you wouldn\u0027t believe me. But the point is, I\u0027m dying. Well, that\u0027s not the actual main point, but in my department that\u0027s a big deal. The fact is, Bob and Bill have been on a secret mission with the Armed Forces. What about I cannot specifically say, even on a secure channel where the only audience is my paranoia of hackers (and hackers). What I will say, is that they have been helping to... gather intelligence. I would take Jeb, but he\u0027s just too loud. He would never work well on a secret project. He posts all of his log entries on his blog. This better not end up on his blog. Anyway, gathering intelligence with the Armed Forces. We have detected somewhat of a threat - not an exact threat, in fact we don\u0027t know - but it\u0027s worth every expense in investigating. We\u0027ve gotten contracts from the government - Darn those stockholders and business types. They don\u0027t know what they\u0027re missing. We don\u0027t need their funds anyway. I don\u0027t like the Armed forces. They seem too dangerous. But they\u0027ve given us complete autonomy for this operation, so I took it. Besides, we have a lot at stake. Specifics I can\u0027t give, but a master hacker can probably hazard a guess. So I\u0027m determined to see this through. Fact is, I\u0027m sick, and don\u0027t have much time left. Heh, what\u0027s time, just another joke? I like jokes. Jokes are good. But even if I don\u0027t live forever, at least i\u0027ll see this through - our entire way of life will change. Everyone will be informed publicly soon.\n\nP.S. Jeb here. Downloaded onto my blog. Sorry.\n\nP.P.S. So, you know then?\n\nP.P.P.S. No, you said not to read it. I just posted it online.\n\nP.P.P.P.S.

I know you\u0027ve got a questions, (unless you dont) but long story short, our space program is back up and running again. So I\u0027m up here in the lovely spaceplane Aurora, along with Bill, who is mostly back from the military, and we are floating weightless again! Hold on... Bill just corrected me about how we\u0027re actually not weightless, but experience it because we\u0027re free-falling. Awesome feeling, anyway. So, our actual mission is classified, but I can tell you- hold on, Bill wants to talk to me.\n\nBill: What are you doing, Jeb?\n\nJeb: updating my blog. Why?\n\nBill: BLOG!? Oh, for - This entire mission is classified! Officially, this spacecraft does not exist and is not out in orbit, and you\u0027re on your BLOG!\n\nJeb: Well, if the viewers are like me, they have an array of radio telescopes and transceivers in their backyard, so they\u0027re probably curious.\n\nBill:...Fine. It could make an ok cover story. As long as you don\u0027t reveal the real purpose we\u0027re here, you can update your blog.\n\nJeb: Ok. I don\u0027t know it anyway.\n\nBill: You weren\u0027t at the briefing?\n\nJeb: I was, but I brought my Iplatform and played EGGSCOM for most of it.\n\nBill: ...\n\nIt\u0027s a wonder he doesn\u0027t notice I\u0027m typing the entire conversation. So anyway, mission backstory. Gene said to come to his office, and he had a bunch of brass in there, and one started talking cheese -peace, national security, grave matter... kind of got bored, so I pulled out my Iplatform. Didn\u0027t have Eggscom before on it. Still a fun game. Got to the alien base attack when Gene took my Iplatform. He told me Bill and Bob were back, we were government funded now, and I was flying the Aurora to orbit. I asked him what the meeting was about and he looked kind of distant, then told me to figure it out. I don\u0027t remember what we\u0027re supposed to be doing, but I took a photo montage.\n\n![?view=att\u0026th=14c77784c772d9ed\u0026attid=0.3\u0026disp=attd\u0026realattid=f_i7zeoltw2\u0026safe=1\u0026zw](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/s/?view=att\u0026th=14c77784c772d9ed\u0026attid=0.3\u0026disp=attd\u0026realattid=f_i7zeoltw2\u0026safe=1\u0026zw)\n\nThis is us taking off, not sure how this was taken.\n\n![?view=att\u0026th=14c77784c772d9ed\u0026attid=0.4\u0026disp=attd\u0026realattid=f_i7zeolua3\u0026safe=1\u0026zw](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/s/?view=att\u0026th=14c77784c772d9ed\u0026attid=0.4\u0026disp=attd\u0026realattid=f_i7zeolua3\u0026safe=1\u0026zw)\n\nThe view from the cockpit.

Love to right what we were doing for the military, but that\u0027s too secure information to be typing. Engineering is really scratching their heads. They have a tight deadline to finish our contract, and they\u0027re the best to work on it. And a secret project. It really messes this place up. The space program runs on trust and teamwork, and having secure information that your friends can\u0027t know really messes it up. Some Kerbals have kept from talking to anyone. I hope the classified stuff ends soon. I\u0027m going to ask Gene if I can get a few volunteers from outside the compound, (yes KSC is a compound now with fences and everything.) to do stuff like dish out coffee and tea and foods. Also, my job is liaison officer to military. So I report the project\u0027s progress to the military correspondent, the Lieutenant. He\u0027s really creepy. He tells me what the military wants this project to have, and I go and tell the engineers a version of that. My other, non official job is idea man.
