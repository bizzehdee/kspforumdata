Confirm?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrewed ships would say something like:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EWARNING!\u00A0 Vessel \u0022Snarxplorer\u0022 has 3 kerbals aboard.\u00A0 Deleting will KILL these kerbals.\u00A0 Are you really sure?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...or words to that general effect.\u00A0 As long as the wording is different, and the visual appearance of the dialog is significantly different enough that when you\u0027re expecting the uncrewed version to pop up, and the crewed version pops up instead, it makes you notice and go \u0022whoa\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3.\u00A0 Have some way in the flight UI to delete the current vessel.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, the only way to delete a vessel is from the tracking station.\u00A0 This has a couple of issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst issue: when I have a whole lot of active ships, I may not be able to remember for sure which one is the right one to delete-- just seeing it in the map view in the tracking station may not be enough.\u00A0 I want to go to the ship and see for myself, first.\u00A0 So right now what I have to do is: 1. go to the tracking station, 2. rummage around through the ship list to find the one that I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethink\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is the right one, 3. switch to it to confirm visually, 4. make a careful note of the name (maybe even write it down, if there are a lot of similarly named ships), 5. switch back to the tracking station again, 6. find the ship in the list again, 7. press the delete button, 8. fight a horrible sinking sense of dread that maybe I\u0027ve got the wrong ship, 9. confirm.\u00A0 If I could just go to the ship, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esee\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it, and then decided on the spot \u0022delete this ship\u0022 (which would take me back to KSC), that would really be helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond issue:\u00A0 There are situations in KSC where the game won\u0027t let the player switch to another ship or return to KSC, i.e. when flying in atmosphere.\u00A0 This can lead to a situation where the player is \u0022trapped\u0022 on the current ship and can\u0027t do anything at all to escape for several minutes.\u00A0 For example, suppose I drop an expendable probe into Jool\u0027s atmosphere.\u00A0 It takes its science measurements, transmits them, then I\u0027m done with it.\u00A0 As far as I\u0027m concerned, I can destroy it and go on with life.\u00A0 Except that the game has no way to destroy it from the in-flight UI, and it won\u0027t let me return to KSC or switch to another ship because I\u0027m in atmosphere.\u00A0 All I can do is just stare helplessly at the ship for the next many minutes, waiting for it to fall all the way through Jool\u0027s atmosphere until it gets to the \u0022surface\u0022 and is destroyed.\u00A0 That takes a long time, and there\u0027s absolutely nothing I can do.\u00A0 It\u0027s just infuriating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, this ask is to have \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esome\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E way to avoid the above two issues.\u00A0 Obviously it\u0027s not something that should take up a lot of screen UI or be at all possible to activate by accident, or add to the clutter of the screen, so some careful thought would need to go into just how it\u0027s designed.\u00A0 But surely there must be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esome\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E way to work it in.\u00A0 A \u0022destroy\u0022 button next to the \u0022abort\u0022 button from the top center pull-down, perhaps?\u00A0 (With confirmation dialog, of course.)\u00A0 I don\u0027t really care what the UI looks like, as long as there is one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also be fine with not adding an in-flight delete button if some other workaround could be found for the above two issues.\u00A0 For example, if the \u0022return to KSC\u0022 button \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ealways works\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 If you try to do it while in atmosphere, it could pop up a big ugly warning \u0022going back to KSC right now will kill this ship\u0022 and then allow you to confirm.\u00A0 Or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
