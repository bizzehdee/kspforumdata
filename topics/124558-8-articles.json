The lower albedo (reflectivity, basically) of a solar panel means more solar radiation is absorbed rather than reflected. When absorbed, it\u0026#39;s converted to heat. When a solid object absorbs heat (and gets hot) another factor gets introduced into the equation. Convection. And it\u0026#39;s already common knowledge that that\u0026#39;s a lot of heat. Next time there\u0026#39;s a sunny day in whatever locale you happen to live in? Go outside around noontime and put your hand on the WHITE sidewalk. Not the asphalt, you already know how hot that gets on a sunny day.

It\u0026#39;s common knowledge that the Earth\u0026#39;s atmosphere reflects about 30% of the Sun\u0026#39;s radiation energy back into space before it ever hits the ground. How? Greenhouse gases.
