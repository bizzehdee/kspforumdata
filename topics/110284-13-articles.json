For uneven terrain, try looking at the ground where ground textures meet and avoid those junctions. My test base is on a hill and I have no problems.

That last suggestion about the lights and dropping them first has paid off well since then so we\u0027ll see. If you can figure out a way to avoid the bolting I think it would be a fantastic development. I was thinking about this today and had the idea that you might look at EPL and how Taniwha is doing his launch pad for some possible ways to accomplish it. I can land that pretty much anywhere without landing legs and have never had a problem with it.

The Gold Digger generates experiment results while taking core samples. Those results are now worth more than just their Science value; you can use them to improve the efficiency of your habitation, science, and industry processors. In other words, creating RocketParts, MaterialKits, ResearchKits, Water, and others will be improved if you have good results when performing your soil analysis, metallurgic analysis, or chemical analysis in the Geology Lab. And with the Geology Lab\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s new Biome Analysis, you can either use the research to improve your production abilities within the biome, or transfer the data to the new Doc Commercial Science Lab.

This is a new multipurpose laboratory. With the Doc Commercial Science Lab, developed in partnership with the Rasta Engineering Group (thanks rasta013 for the lab configs!), you get a Mobile Processing Lab equivalent that can do more than just process experiments for Science over time; you can publish the research for Reputation, or sell the research for Funds. You can also reconfigure the lab into the Sunburn pellet lab, and produce FusionPellets and Coolant for your fusion needs. And finally, you can retool it into the Watney Chemistry Lab, named after a fictional character that finds creative survival solutions through chemistry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added the Hacienda Inflatable Multipurpose Factory. The Hacienda meets your industrial needs by providing the Ironworks, where you can smelt Metals from MetallicOre and create RocketParts from Metals. If you have Extraplanetary Launchpads installed, then you\u0027ll also get the Fireworks Survey Station, where you can build vessels. Also you smelt Metal from MetalOre, and fabricate RocketParts from Metal instead of using MetallicOre and Metals. Be sure to bring some survey stakes and a mallet. And if you have OSE Workshop installed, then you\u0027ll get the Clockworks, which lets you 3D print parts in larger volumes than the Blacksmith, and you can retool the printers to use RocketParts instead of MaterialKits (or vice versa). Additionally, with OSE Workshop installed, the Ironworks lets you produce MaterialKits, and convert between MaterialKits and RocketParts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESaddle\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Updated config file to reflect the latest KIS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStorage Templates\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added templates for Metals and MetallicOre.

The Hacienda is self-contained in terms of producing RocketParts. Without anything installed but Pathfinder and CRP, you produce RocketParts via MetallicOre-\u0026gt;Metals-\u0026gt;RocketParts, which is the closest I can get to EL\u0027s current production chain using just CRP. EL currently defaults to MetalOre-\u0026gt;Metal-\u0026gt;RocketParts. That production chain is what EL users are accustomed to, and I go by what EL uses if EL is installed. To accommodate other production chains, the best thing to do is create a ModuleManager patch that works with the Ironworks template. In fact, that\u0027s what I do when EL is installed; the patch modifies the Ironworks template to use EL\u0027s resource chain instead of the CRP default. Next release I\u0027ll make it easier by having a separate MM patch that tweaks the MetallicOre and Metals templates as well as the Ironworks template, all in one place, so you could change Pathfinder\u0027s production chain for EL depending upon what mod you have installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI, The point might become moot in the future if EL changes its production chain to be more in line with MKS. If EL\u0027s chain does change, Pathfinder will follow suit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that answers your questions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T17:28:49Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T17:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rub with an updated EL chain is that Taniwha has stated he\u0027ll have different modes (easy/hard/etc.) with potentially different resource chains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working with ObiVanDamme on getting OSE and MKS in lockstep, then it\u0027s just a matter of adding a config that changes up the EL chain, especially since Taniwha is adding recipes (which makes all of this a lot easier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy intent then would be to drop in the alternate EL chain as a stand-alone, either as a shim in CRP or just a loose config other folks can borrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T18:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes - very good detailed answer and for now I\u0027ll whip up an MM patch to convert at least for stock and see what I can do about something for MKS as well.

Currently only planetary resources are supported but there are hooks in place to support other resource types in the future. efficiencyType specifies the type of efficiency to monitor. Currently, Pathfinder has three types: habitation, science, and industry. Any template can use any efficency type, but the baseline is to use habitation for Ponderosa, science for Doc, and industry for Hacienda. That way, you know the basic type of functionality just by looking at the model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the efficiency type is mapped to the type of research performed in the geology lab. The Soil Analysis improves/worsens habitation, Chemical Analysis improves/worsens science, and Metallurgic Analysis improves/worsens industry. The modifiers you gain/lose are dependent upon the biome you\u0027re currently residing in, so if you pick up and move you will have whole new habitation, science, and industry modifiers in the new biome. If you move back to the old biome, you\u0027ll still have the habitation, science and industry modifiers that you researched in the old biome. It\u0027s not quite possible to add new efficiency modifiers and research them using config files, but that\u0027s in my backlog, and the infrastructure already supports it. I just need to make efficiency research more generic.

Also note that you have a form of multiple-inheritance with templates. You can create several template nodes like PATHFINDER, SCIENCELAB, and FACTORY, and in the templateNodes field for your WBIResourceSwitcher, WBIMultipurposeHab, lab, and storage, you can add multiple template types by separating them with a semicolon.

One example would be to have two parts that share a common set of SCIENCELAB templates, but one variant of the Doc is designed for the ground while another is designed for orbit. To do that, both parts use the same SCIENCELAB templateNodes but one uses a templateTypes set to ground;common while the other uses orbit;common. You would then add a templateType field to the desired template to identify it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T18:20:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ObiVanDamme","CreatedById":136329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T19:37:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sampa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sampa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAngel, how do you and other modders get ideas?

I looked fora mod that did that, but could not find one.
