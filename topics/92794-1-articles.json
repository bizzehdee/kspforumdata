But if we\u0027re going that big, the devs also need to reform the fuel system to be more realistic- the current stock combination of fuel density and ISP is impossible. The ISP for many engines is at about the level that would require Methane/LOX, but the fuel-density is similar to hypergolics (and like with hypergolics, there is no boil-off). Bigger rockets become capable of being safely built to increasingly tall heights (especially if the devs added a size 4 node to go with a larger size line) and have better ballistic coefficients (important when the devs reform the aerodynamics system), and can be cost-effectively staged to a larger degree: thus they can achieve greater payload fractions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I\u0027m saying is, \u003Cstrong\u003Efor balance reasons the devs need to make the game harder in other ways if they add a 5\u002B meter line\u003C/strong\u003E (just making 5 meter parts expensive wouldn\u0027t cut it- and with the fuel tanks would be especially unrealistic, as larger fuel tanks become CHEAPER per litre of fuel in real-life due to the Square-Cube Law... Larger fuel tanks have relatively less surface area, and *proportionally* thicker walls as they are pressure vessels, for the same overall mass ratios- but it\u0027s much cheaper to build a 1 cm thick wall to within 0.1% accuracy than a 200 mm wall...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBringing fuel-density and ISP in line with real life (probably adding all the fuel mixtures below for advanced players to play around with- newbies could just stick with the defaults for an engine, and fuel tanks would be tweakable to different mixes and try to auto-default the correct mix for the engines attached...) and possibly adding boil-off (*GASP*) would make for a much more difficult/balanced experience if larger parts were added, and a much more realistic system when ISRU is implemented.

If you add fairings, then you can enclose exponentially more volume relative to fairing mass the larger the rocket the fairing sits atop (a 5 meter diameter fairing in a conical shape 5 meters high encloses 8 times the volume of a 2.5 meter fairing 2.5 meters high, for around 3 times the fairing mass...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, when it comes to rockets, bigger is better.

Comparing KSP to Orbiter, with *or without* increased realism, is complete nonsense, and I do think you know better than that. Orbiter is a game that has silly-stupid limits on what players can build and design, and THAT is what makes it a terrible game- not the high levels of realism. KSP is a sandbox game with very free-form play, and THAT is what makes KSP a great game- not the low levels of realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t take this personally, but I think most likely the (real) reason you\u0027re resisting increased realism is because you\u0027ve become accustomed to the unrealistic features of the status-quo, and you don\u0027t want them to change because that would make you feel like a newbie again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly consider, did you ever expect the current aerodynamics system to work as poorly and unrealistically as it does when you first started playing the game? Didn\u0027t you have any previous knowledge of how flight actually works, that was completely contradicted by the broken placeholder system in KSP? And a placeholder it is- the devs have been *very* clear about this from the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the same principles can easily be applied to something like fuel mixtures. If you just picked up KSP today, as a new player, you wouldn\u0027t expect every type of rocket to magically work off one miracle-fuel with all the density and boil-off advantages of hypergolics and all the ISP of Methane or Kersosene, rolled into one. The first time you try to build a Space Shuttle, you *quickly* realize that the fuels in KSP are *far* too dense, but have much too low of an ISP compared to the LH2/LOX in the Shuttle\u0027s External Tank. The first time you try to build a suborbital rocket, and it has enough fuel to take you all the way to orbit, you realize there\u0027s something off with the fuel balance (or with the size of the planet and thus the Delta-V it takes to get to orbit in the first place- although it took me quite a few months to realize just how far off KSP\u0027s scale was from the real world when I first started playing, I must admit...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP isn\u0027t more fun or intuitive for its unrealistic, over-simplified, often placeholder systems.\u003C/strong\u003E It\u0027s a game about rocket science- so we EXPECT it to be extremely challenging. I was actually rather disappointed when I first started playing KSP, and found it didn\u0027t quite push me nearly as hard as I had come to expect from sayings like \u0022it\u0027s not like it\u0027s rocket science\u0022 and such... Don\u0027t get me wrong, KSP is an awesome game with lots of cool moments- but the unrealistic features detract from that immersion, if anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the point- if the devs added 3 meter command pods, I would want 5 meter or larger fuel tanks and engines to stick under them (or a stock Procedural Fuel Tanks system *gasp*). And if I had 5 meter fuel tanks, I would want to be able to fill them with low-density, high-ISP fuels like Liquid Hydrogen \u002B Liquid Oxygen (especially with the upcoming weight-limits on your rockets until you upgrade the launchpad: I might want to use these fuels to bring down rocket mass for earlier in the game. This would add more flexibility and strategy to early rocket design...) \u003Cstrong\u003EIf you give a mouse a cookie...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T11:39:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T11:46:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s more of the \u0022if you give a mouse a cookie\u0022 sort of thing- but if 3.75 meter command pods were added, having more than 3 Kerbal professions would be nice. Why will there just be a single \u0022scientist\u0022 Kerbal in 0.90, for instance?

Biologists and geologists could get large bonuses for surface samples, for instance, whereas chemists and physicists would have large bonuses for Materials Studies. Chemists and biologists might share an interest in Mystery Goo, whereas a geologist would have no use for it. No two professions would have the same experiments they were best at, and the bonuses could stack and even vary by planet and situation- for instance a biologist would expect little of interest in surface samples from Moho or Gilly, but might look for evidence of current or past life in surface samples on Duna, Laythe, or Vall...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would encourage players to visit the same location again with different crew, or to send missions with a larger crew complement (which is a balance factor the devs really need to work on).

Once 0.90 is released, there will never be a reason to send more than 3 Kerbals- unless you\u0027re sending extra crew members solely to level them up... (and there are probably easier/cheaper ways to do this than sending them on interplanetary missions...)
