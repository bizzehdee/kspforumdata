Bigger is better, in the case of payload size. However this means that to launch a smaller high dV ion probe, I\u0027d need to send what would become a humongo beast into orbit. But this is your line of thinking, and on second thought I like it. It also means that as you improve with a smaller/sleeker ship, you should be getting better at designing your payloads and become capable of doing more with a smaller craft. I edited it and changed it to mk2 -\u003E mk3 myself last night, but I might just switch it back to see how that affects the play through. I guess a shuttlesque -\u003E Skylon progression makes sense. Although, they are both massive, Skylon only puts around 5mt into orbit, so again, this follows your reasoning. I\u0027ll try it out. I also can\u0027t play without adjustable landing gear, which I made the small/med/large go into landinggear1/2/3 respectively, and instells scramjets into the experimental tech with the rapier. \n\nAs far as balance goes, the aerospike doesn\u0027t belong in the jet engines tree.

It\u0027s main pro is that it has a relatively small change in ISP over a great range of pressure. I still see it being used in SSTO\u0027s and Eve landers, due to the fact that it might be one of the ONLY engines that actually works near sea level(i think\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2). It still has more isp than a rapier, and may be good for orbital maneuvers for SSTO\u0027s. I actually just got an idea for a design...need to go unlock the parts though first. On any rocket where the stage will be used from sea level to vacuum, the aerospike is the best choice. I\u0027m not sure where exactly on the tree that would fit, but that\u0027s its niche use."},{"CreatedByName":"schoff123","CreatedById":71389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T21:45:17Z","Content":"- Tantares \u002B LV\n\n- RealChute\n\n- KAS/KIS\n\n- DMagic Science\n\n- TAC Life\n\n- RT\n\n- Maybe KW?
