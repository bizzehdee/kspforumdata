With the integrated graphics you might have to turn a few settings down, but the newer intel integrated graphics are actually quite capable so it should still look alright. KSP is primarily CPU limited anyways so an Intel CPU is the right choice. The 8GB of RAM means that KSP won\u0027t have to compete with windows and other programs to be able to get its 4GB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only suggestion I would have is to see if there\u0027s a newer model with a 4 series instead of a 3 series CPU (you can tell by the CPU model number, in this case it\u0027s a 3217U, a 4 series model would start with a 4) and unless battery life is a high priority, you\u0027ll get better performance out of a non-U CPU (the U on the end of the model number indicates a low voltage part). An i5 would also help with performance, but it might be hard to find a laptop in your price range with one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, hope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T21:29:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 09:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T21:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.8ghz is going to be a bit on the slow side, so expect some serious chug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run it on a 2009 2.2ghz Core2Duo laptop and the chug really kicks in around 150 parts (graphics on full or on minimum makes little difference).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 2007 desktop is a fair bit faster at 3.5ghz on a Core2Duo with a slight overclock (300 parts is pretty sluggish).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what kind of performance you\u0027ll get on a more modern processor, but my understanding is that the core speed has the most significant impact on KSP performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m tempted to load it on my old 3.2ghz pentium4 just so see what\u0027ll happen \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T21:50:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 09:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by T.A.P.O.R.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T21:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECore speed isn\u0027t everything.
