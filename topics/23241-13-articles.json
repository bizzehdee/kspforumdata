I think the attachment node for both sides of the part are too far back or something. Though it seems to connect to other parts just fine which is weird. My workaround is to use 2 of the S2-2m adapters but that disrupts the flow of the parts. Just a heads up for that considering it\u0027s meant to be used in conjunction with the rest of the S2 pieces.

I just make mine a short as possible in out of view places to try and hide them as best as possible, however the only parts I\u0027ve really felt the need to strut are the HL cargo bays and tail section (and possibly the side extensions if they get very long).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

The cargo bays and HL tail sections seem particularly weak, even with strutting, and tend to fall apart when pitching up or down too hard (such as taking off or landing...).
