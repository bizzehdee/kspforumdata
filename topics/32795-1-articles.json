I suggest using a di-pole antenna, as it has a range of 5Mm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Add a directional antenna, like a satellite dish. To enable a sat-dish you have to both open it (most of them start out folded for transport) and target another vessel (or planet), then switch to the other vessel and target back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki tutorial has some really good tips too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:RemoteTech\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:RemoteTech\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pluto100","CreatedById":26442,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T18:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see.
