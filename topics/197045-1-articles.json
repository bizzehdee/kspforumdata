One of the interesting bits of writing advice I\u0027ve came across described the trap for female authors in writing a strong female character. The trap went like this: (a) strong = masculine and (b) masculine = violent, anti-social, \u003Cem\u003Eet cetera\u003C/em\u003E. Obviously, the product of such gross misunderstandings of humans cannot be a pleasant character, not to mention thay (a) is essentially a form of perverted self-hatred (corollary: feminine = weak).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yet misguided charecter-building, of the (a) variety particularly, has become a scourge in pop culture because of the mandate to churn out \u0027stronk wahmen\u0027.

One of the worst implications of misguided writing comes from the \u003Cem\u003EMass Effect\u003C/em\u003E series. The Bathanian Hegemony and the various independent planets use chattel slavery... and this is treated as superior to automation.

As such, every bits of media is political, whether it\u0027s intentional or not. It\u0027s especially true in fiction (not only science), because the author wants you to see a world that is more or less different than ours and making you dream about those differences and makes you build the gap between those worlds and yours (because we all perceive the world in different ways, we don\u0027t understand it the same way, and so we live in different worlds).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeck, even advertisement is political.
