But sometimes you decide to change the antennas or something like that and forget to update the RTG\u0027s. It\u0027s very annoying to keep track of this manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis there a way - maybe a mod - to easily find out the total electric charge needed by the vessel? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebest regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T13:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to try the Fusebox plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxdreamland","CreatedById":100941,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T18:10:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI looked at the plugin and it seems to be just what i was looking for. thank you for pointing it out to me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebest regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
