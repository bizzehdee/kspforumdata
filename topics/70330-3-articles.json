Instead, your failures and successes are determined by your ability to prepare and account for the natural problems presented to you by the laws of the universe. Having the numbers at your disposal gives you the necessary tools to accomplish this. They\u0027re not going to save you from forgetting to put a docking port on your ship or realizing you don\u0027t have parachutes by the time you\u0027re 10,000m from Kerbin\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-24T23:05:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2014 11:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FenrirWolf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T23:05:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the very least, some sort of analogue to Kerbal Engineer Redux\u0027s system should be in place to let you approximately gauge TWR and delta-V.

I personally wouldn\u0027t have bought this game if I was required to manually calculate everything myself. Sure, I know about the rocket equation and its importance and I could solve it for any rocket you throw at me, but the fact remains that I bought this game to be just that - a game. Not homework or actual work or similar. A way to relax and wile away the hours building things that explore the pretty places. I don\u0027t want to have to waste time figuring out if my thing can do what I want it to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a yes from me, but I can see people like to fly by guesswork and like having to do equations and everything, so as a compromise, I\u0027d be happy with an option to turn the info on and off. Not that I\u0027d ever turn it off though. I guess I can see why the devs want us to do the whole trial and error thing, but seriously, just give me a TWR for Duna for my craft or at least an option to test it before I get there for the first time and find out I\u0027m too heavy to lift off at all. Yes, I could work it out manually, but as I said, I bought this game to relax, not to feel like I\u0027m back in school.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T00:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy problem with trial and error is once you get past going into orbit it gets VERY repetitive or you just massively over compensate. Imagine going to the Mun, you can estimate the fuel required, fly into orbit, get it wrong, change the craft, fly into orbit, get it wrong, change the craft, fly into orbit. Or you can take so much fuel that you\u0027ll easily have enough to run any mission, it\u0027ll get the mission done but building the craft becomes a bit academic. You can\u0027t even record how much DeltaV you needed for the mission because there\u0027s no counter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith information readouts you still have trial and error because you don\u0027t know how much you need to complete the mission, but you\u0027ll be able to make intelligent choices rather than guessing every time.
