The only workaround I have found is to restart the game, load into my save, and load back into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, click launch and then it will let me pan/move the camera however, after some time and reverting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to make changes to my craft, it happens again randomly?
