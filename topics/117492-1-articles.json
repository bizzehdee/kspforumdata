I was focused on the craft when it was at Munar periapsis and when it left the SOI, but not at all times between those two points, and not when the craft entered SOI.

You should get credit for a fly-by if you orbit, perhaps into low orbit.\n\n2. You should get credit for a fly-by if you fly by when the mission isn\u0027t focused."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T03:18:14Z","Content":"Really you should get the credit for a \u0022flyby\u0022 the moment you meet these two requirements:\n\n1) The ship is in the SOI\n\n2) The ship is in your physics bubble.\n\nNo (sane) tourist is going to say \u0022I wanted a flyby of Mun, but I\u0027m sorry, all you did was land me there.
