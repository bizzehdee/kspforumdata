I prefer that you ask the users to install the mod themselves instead of including it in your download. To change the config value **DO NOT edit the content of the default file** but use a [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219) patch in your mod folder.\n\n[Default config](https://github.com/sarbian/CustomBarnKit/blob/master/CustomBarnKit/default.cfg) file mirror stock config.

It should be noted I run a VERY heavily modded game under Windows (85 mods atm) so I\u0027m not sure what it could be conflicting with if anything, but with the Custom Barn loaded, I cannot revert flights in Career Mode. I get a message regarding a Null Reference Exception from Unknown thrown from Exception Detector and when I dig into the KSP.log I see the following message repeated continuously at the end of the log file: \n\nNullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\n\n PauseMenu.drawRevertOptions ()\n\n MultiOptionDialog.drawContent (Int32 id)\n\n UnityEngine.GUILayout\u002BLayoutedWindow.DoWindow (Int32 windowID)\n\n UnityEngine.GUI.CallWindowDelegate (UnityEngine.WindowFunction func, Int32 id, UnityEngine.GUISkin \\_skin, Int32 forceRect, Single width, Single height, UnityEngine.GUIStyle style\n\nKSP will allow me to unpause and continue the game but there is an incomplete Revert Flight window drawn in the middle of the screen and the Null Reference errors continue non-stop in Exception Editor. I tried removing several mods that I thought might be suspect as I had updated about 5 of them today but had no joy. It was only after removing Custom Barn Kit that it stopped and I recovered my ability to revert flights.\n\nOne thing to note, this error happened to me in Career Mode but I could not duplicate it Sandbox. I did not try in Science Mode but would happily help you do any further testing or provide more information including replicating the problem to get a full Exception Editor message if you need it.
