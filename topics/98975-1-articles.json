It was way too late to revert, so I went back to the VAB, made the corrections, and played with it a bit on the launch pad before deciding it was right. I relaunched it (just deleting the original from the tracking station), got it to Minmus, and discovered I\u0027d gone too far in the other direction. Again it\u0027s too late to revert. I\u0027ve made a third version and I\u0027m convinced that finally this is the one. I\u0027ve extensively tested it and it works. Now for the real question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to mod the new version in to the persistence file so that I don\u0027t waste yet more time (and money -- I\u0027m in career mode) on a third launch for what should have been right the first time? What I mean is, can I launch the finished module onto the launch pad, then edit the persistence file to replace the one currently on Minmus with the correct one that\u0027s on Kerbin\u0027s launch pad?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally I wouldn\u0027t do something so drastic (and, let\u0027s face it, cheaty), but dang it I\u0027m not flying that particular sack of potatoes again if I can help it.
