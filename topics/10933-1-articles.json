The Munar SOI is huge and close. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus is slighltly harder because of the orbital tilt, and it\\\u0027s hard for me to see it from the play screen, so I sight from the map screen.. I typically do a plane correction at about the Mun\\\u0027s orbit. to bring my apoapsis into contact, then at about 3/4 of the way out, I start \u0027feeling around\u0027 on the orbit for the SOI\\\u0027s patched conic to appear by burning to slide apoapsis forward and backwards along the orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the latter \u0027feeling around\u0027 is a bit wasteful (not to mention a bit tricky without Mechjeb), but my standard Stock Munlander is suddenly getting into orbit with a lot more fuel than I\\\u0027m used to, and I might as well burn some of it off before ditching the LFR three boosters that are typically still attatched at the time, and will likely be thrown at Minmus with plenty of fuel still on board.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T18:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E100KM orbit circularized.
