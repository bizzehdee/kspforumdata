It\u0027s not a joke ship either, but a serious test:\n\n![wAV0Uhe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wAV0Uhe.jpg)\n\nFuel distribution, only unused exidizer in the cargo dummy. Mind the fuel locks, no cheating here.\n\n![tKCxvsC.png](http://i.imgur.com/tKCxvsC.png)\n\nAnd it stalls around 2060 temperature, I expect it to burn the full 3600 delta-v on the sunside of a planet without explosions. I did most of the burn, but lost flight computer. The cargo are two locked fuel tanks, around 27 tons, full T/W is 0.32. Very inefficient ship, but already more efficient than you would ever be with normal engines. Mind the fuel tanks above the engines are working at half weight, giving every 3 ton engine around 7,2 tons of fuel in a oversized 2 ton container. Not to mention the empty middle tank.\n\nOne thing was very important: Let the head spread through the ship (bringt it to space and use that heat coloration)! In my first version those outer tanks were connected by the midsize girder, which effectively isolated the middle compartment and causing a heat congestion in the 4 engine/tank sections and killed the engines after ~1200 dv (which is enough for most burns). Connecting the tanks directly to the empty middle tank did cause the heat to spread nicely up through the mid-stack.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind are the more sensitive equipment and probes. In my example the heat spread to well, killing my core and one or two electricity parts. Interestingly enough, the other 6 batteries and panels survived. Isolating them via girders is probably the best choice. It\u0027s also a question if you want to try to spread some heat to your cargo. In my case the cargo was isolated.\n\nSo yeah, heating is an issue than can be solved and nukes are still more efficient than everything else. Have to see how it plays out, but I like it until now. Looks like you really want to properly design/reuse your nuclear driven motherships in future. As a fun fact, crafts like the apollo space ship are similarly build to spread and radiate heat as much as possible to avoide overheating. That\u0027s why apollo 13 got so cold after shutting of the heating.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T23:26:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:56:05Z","Content":"In the meantime I\u0027m just going to use the next best engine: The Poodle."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:04:44Z","Content":"I\u0027ve started testing with my old nuclear Tugs (since I have a lot of them out in space on missions).\n\nThe engines are thermally isolated from the rest of the Tug because they are mounted on radial decouplers along with an extra shadow shield part and a parachute so that the nukes can be dropped and recovered in case of launch failure...which seemed like a prudent design at the time). \n\nAt 100% power, the nukes explode after 75 seconds.
