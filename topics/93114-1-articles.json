If you launched perfectly upwards, that lateral velocity would still be there, and your trajectory would look similar to your first picture. Sitting on the surface, you could say you are on a perfectly circular orbit, with the trajectory making a ring across the surface. Now imagine you are in an \u0027actual\u0027 orbit at 100km, perfectly circular and equatorial, and you burn directly west or north. Your trajectory doesn\u0027t immediately about-face (or left/right-face for North/South), but it slowly tilts in the direction as you overcome your orbital velocity.

Again, because you start with a high Eastward velocity, once your navball ticks into Orbital velocity, your vector marker will jump towards the East. I suppose starting with your navball in orbital might actually help, but you\u0027ll be losing a lot of energy to fighting your surface velocity until you leave the denser atmosphere, and if you\u0027re using FAR, you\u0027ll probably lose control because you\u0027ll be aiming pretty far off your velocity and you\u0027ll get flipped by the airflow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T15:53:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cleric2145\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thyriel","CreatedById":113679,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T15:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cleric2145\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cleric2145\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince you are moving East at 174m/s at the same speed as the ground, your surface velocity (the difference between your speed and the speed of the planet) is zero.

You are indeed correct to generally say \u0022making corrections sooner is better than later.\u0022 If you switch to a westerly direction during the initial stages of launch, you spend much less dV than trying to change your orbit direction later. In that case, you\u0027re spending 174 m/s * 2. Whereas if you did it in orbit, you need a lot more (as illustrated in my earlier post).
