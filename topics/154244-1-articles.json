I\u0027m not very good at it but no matter, I\u0027m enjoying myself!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe MPL can give a terrific amount of science points but I\u0027ve noticed that it\u0027s possible for a second 1 to\u00A0process the same experiments again. It feels kind of \u0022cheatty\u0022 to me. Now, I haven\u0027t send the science points from both MPL\u0027s back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E yet so correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but isn\u0027t this a very easy way to fill out the techtree. Am I overlooking something here? If this is possible is there a way to turn off the ability to do this?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance and happy flying everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benji13","CreatedById":162932,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T22:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is extremely easy and is very over powered. To limit this for myself I have decided to only process physical samples (surface samples, atmospheric samples). You could do the same or you could go into the mpl\u0027s cfg and change some of the processing values.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bounty123","CreatedById":142602,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-02T17:20:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like a way to nerf the MPL to only generate science for the time spent\u00A0in realtime, and ignore warp.
