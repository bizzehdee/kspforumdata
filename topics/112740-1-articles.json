When it gets an exception because the joystick is missing, not only does that make it abort the rest of the joystick setting code, it also ends up aborting the entire process of reading the rest of the settings file and forgets everything else in the settings file after the control mapping section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe workaround fix: Use your controller again, or if you really didn\u0027t want to use it anymore, plug your controller back in, temporarily. Then run KSP again. Go to the settings screen and turn off all the controller axis mapping options. Then save the settings and quit KSP. Unplug your controller and try running KSP again. From now on it should read the settings all the way to the end again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
