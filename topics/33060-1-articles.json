For more critical interplanetary transfers (like out to Eeloo) it\u0027s a little more complicated. I take my maneuver dV, divide it by my maximum acceleration (I have a Mechjeb window that displays the relevant stats) and then multiply by a factor that depends on what proportion of my fuel I\u0027ll be burning and how massive my ship is. For a large burn that will take up a large portion of fuel and thus a large portion of my total mass, I\u0027ll multiply by a small fraction like 3/7. For a smaller burn, I\u0027ll multiply by something closer to 1/2, like 4/9. Then I just add about a second and a half of throttle-up time and I\u0027m good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
