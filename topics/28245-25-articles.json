This is why the model and texture names are TAL_\u003Cstrong\u003ELarge\u003C/strong\u003E_Toroidal_Tank instead of just TAL_Toroidal_Tank. It was originally going to be the first of several models. Personally, I like this because while the overall size of the major parts (such as the tank and hubs) change, the detail parts (such as the colored strip that I use for content identification) can remain the same diameter throughout the entire pack. I was going to have the spokes remain the same diameter between tank sizes as well, only changing the lengths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the process, I came to the conclusion that while I personally like the aesthetic of maintaining the details at a consistent size, it was at the price of an increased memory footprint for the pack as well as greatly increasing the work involved for relatively little gain. I could be wrong, but the impression I got from the responses to the spherical tanks was that the majority of people would have been happier with 1 tank model rescaled for each size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I decided to go the route of rescaling a single model instead of making each distinct. Unfortunately, after I was completely done modelling and unwrapping and texturing, I found that by making the XXL tank, the hub spokes actually ended being thicker than the hub pieces. Fixing this would require either a redesign of the model to make the spokes thinner or going back and making the hub pieces thicker, neither of which I really wanted to do. So I just topped it off with the 10.5m one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at it now though, I suppose it wouldn\u0027t really matter if the spokes are thicker than the hub most of the time. Unless the hub piece is on the very end of the rocket, it wouldn\u0027t really be too noticeable. I intend on making downloads for the other fuel types that I included in the spherical pack and for empties as well, so I can make one for the XXL tank I originally planned too (14m diameter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you have it... a look into the ugly, chaotic workings of my design process. More of a meandering path through a dark forest than a clearly marked road from point A to point B.

Believe it or not, I\u0027ve actually passed on some suggestions that would have made it twice the size that it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking at some plugin options that will allow the pack to be shrunk down to a single tank of each size and add the ability to change fuel levels and types in the VAB. I\u0027m not a programmer, however, so I have to depend on other people\u0027s work to accomplish this. My main concern with this option is that game updates and/or plugin conflicts could make the pack unusable (at least until the plugin is updated), but I think that is the only way to clear out the pages and pages of spheretanks and still offer the variety that is currently available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xzabath","CreatedById":66393,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T07:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool, I call all my probes sumos, because they have a big fat belly, sphere tank as a core solar panels for arms , some of my long distance probes have a couple nukes for legs.
