There are no Nvidia GPUs for the same price as the R9 280, only ones which cost the same and perform worse, or ones that cost more but perform better. The 280 is in the middle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, I see a $30 rebate on that card, and its original price is $200 USD. This is about the same price as the GTX 760. Since the performance on the 760 is better, and it only cost a few bucks more at that point, you might as well go with the 760 if you won\u0027t take advantage of the rebate (ie. it will expire before you have to chance to use it). And, like I said above, for a few bucks more and a longer wait, you will get the 960 for the same price and even better performance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

As soon as your physical RAM runs out, the machine starts swapping to your hard drive. Because this substitutes pretty much the fastest form of memory with the slowest problems are expected.

In my book that is the only way of figuring out what components are bottlenecking your system, along with Task Manager. GPU-Z (along with CPU-Z) is the defacto standard in checking out your hardware, while Afterburner also allows you to overclock your card. Please note that you need to read up and follow instructions when you do that to avoid permanent damage to your card. It is not hard, but you \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E need some pointers on how to do it correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother decent tip is that, to load the GPU in games, you generally turn up the graphics way high. Big resolutions, lots of detail, that kind of stuff. To load the processor you do the reverse. Turn the graphics all the way down and you generally artificially limit the system by CPU. Mind you, this might not work when the system is a bit lopsided, with a weak CPU combined with a powerful card or a beast of a CPU linked to internal graphics. The only way of being sure is measuring, measuring and mearuring again. You can only spend money effectively if you know where to spend it in the first place. Measure thrice, spend it once.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-02T04:03:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2014 04:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
