For example, people might not want all the packs, keeping track of what needs updating could be problematic and time consuming. There\u0027s also the legalities of following licences, all these packs are bound by the original KerbPaint Licence aswell as the mod for which they apply, as far as I am aware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best solution I think is for links to each pack be put in the opening post of this thread, failing that a new thread that contains links in the opening post and is maintained as new packs come about (hopefully). I\u0027ve been meaning to do this, I\u0027m just unsure about where to post it really. These are not really new mods and the concept for the thread would be partly about developing new packs for the multitude of mods out there. I posted about this a while back in this thread.
