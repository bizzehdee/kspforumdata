The trick is finding that right balance to get it right. In someways it is easier to do in the stock KSP then in some of the modded versions. In other ways it is harder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd trust me we all started somewhere, here is my first successful SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SP-301 \u0022Orca\u0022, and I still use it today, granted it has had some improvements but it is the base for most of my SSTO designs now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img836/4610/y5wl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y5wl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T07:38:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI replaced one of the rocket fuel tanks with 2 structural fuselage pieces, so the shape and balance of the plane aren\u0027t affected but the weight is reduced, and replaced the gimbaled 200-thrust engine with the un-gimbaled 215-thrust, which is also lighter. Combining that with flying it right to the flameout point in level flight on the jets (c.1650m/s at 25,000), I was able to squeak it into orbit twice in a row. So there\u0027s still room for improvement in both the design and my flight profile, but it\u0027s improving. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I haven\u0027t rejected the other suggestions helpfully offered here, but of the ones I\u0027ve tried, the method above got the best results so far.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
