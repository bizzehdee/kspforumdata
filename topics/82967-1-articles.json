However, TWR is going to grow the higher you go, it\u0027s not going to go down. So you should start with a properly sized engine that gives you 1.2~1.3 at 100% throttle and allow it to increase naturally as you ascend. This is cheaper and more fuel efficient. So you still want 100% throttle, making this 50% thing stupid.
