There are a lot of mods out there, all good and all balanced towards different sorts of end goals. The trick is to survey them all and pick the ones that best fit whatever it is you\u0027re trying to do. An objective definition of \u0022good\u0022 is a hard thing to nail down, because basically every mod out there can be considered inappropriate for a specific situation. Well, okay, perhaps not Real Plume. But you get the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry I can\u0027t be more concrete, but without an idea of what sort of multiplayer thing you\u0027re trying to do I can\u0027t be anything but vague without imposing my own preferences on you (which would be counterproductive).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
