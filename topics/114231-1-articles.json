Which are one time contracts you can miss forever if you visited X place before they pop up. There are also smaller contracts that never expire that are attached to the EExplore Contracts. But, the thing that is diffrent about them is the expire at some point if you don\u0027t accept them. And they usually appear before the explore contract. Well the Fly By X place pops up. Then you get the Orbit followed by Return from orbit. Then land contract. Which can be done with one craft except for the Land part.

Once I figured out how it all worked, I decided to just rip it out entirely for my mod due to its ambiguous and largely irrelevant nature. The only real impact I\u0027ve really seen it have on the game is to cause blockages in the contract queue that wind up feeling like bugs (like the thing above mentioned about missing explore body contracts) because nobody really understands how the thing works unless they dig into the underlying systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T04:04:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
