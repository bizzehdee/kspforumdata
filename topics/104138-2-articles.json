Are there any plans to implement some kind of hybrid rocket motor in stock?\n\nExtra audio is good, sound effects in this game are lacking in stock. Will this also extend to things like rovers which have been silent up to this point?\n\nNot sure I like the idea of repurposing the toroidal tank as a Xenon tank as it\u0027s actually a useful part for smaller designs. Drastically changing or removing a part should only be done if the part had some serious balance issues (i.e. OP or useless), or if it\u0027s being superseded by a part that fills the same role (which does not appear to be the case here). A better approach would be to create a new tank (or just simply copy and retexture), as we do need a larger Xenon tank in stock.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also been several other minor fixes and tweaks, from proper detection and placement of splashdown effects at very high speeds (now that that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s possible) to making pressure and temperature experiment modules able to function in space\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 It was an intense week, most assuredly.\n\nDoes that mean the water physics have been fixed so we can actually land safely on water now? Also, glad to hear you\u0027re extending the locations for science experiments (I got so frustrated with the arbitrary pressure requirements I made a mod to allow the barometer to work in space).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The jet engines have had another pass with respect to their characteristics. For those that don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know, the airflow through jet engines (and thus fuel flow, and thus thrust) is now a function of mach and of air density giving them more interesting limitations and effects.\n\nGlad to hear the jet engines are getting overhauled, they definitely need it.

I can only hope that they\u0027re planned for an update soon after 1.0.\n\nI haven\u0027t heard much about career mode, is anything being done on that front to make it more coherent and rewarding?

To turn off the UI completely you can hit F2 ... that already works in the beta.\n\nThe problem with the torodial tank was that it hat no usable fuel-to-mass-ratio. However I often used it for aesthetic reasons. It gave great character to my landers. I love using it to attach size 0 engines to size 1 parts.

The game is full of parts that are \u0022redundant...except in terms of design\u0022, but they stay in. The doughnut for me isn\u0027t redundant, I see it as the smallest 1.25m tank and it\u0027s valuable for \u0022fine tuning\u0022 fuel amounts on craft with slim margins. So a new xenon tank would be better I feel, base it on an existing one like the doughnut or maybe the .625m xenon tank and I can\u0027t see it being an awful lot of work."},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T23:04:14Z","Content":"Will we see a more standard looking (say FL-T5) fuel tank for the 0.625 size to give us a bit of design flexibility since the round-8 change is going to leave our options there a little sparse?\n\nWhat change is making splashdowns at very high speeds possible?

Difficulty sliders make sense for the \u0022game\u0022 elements, such as Money and Science and Rep. But should we really be able to change the laws of physics? That would be like having a slider to make engines more efficient or even change the gravity of Kerbin, not good.\n\nDRE wound up making reentry heat adjustable as well, because the realistic level of heat didn\u0027t provide enough challenge for some players, so they added a setting that would cause more reentry heat than physics would support. Because of the reduced reentry velocity caused by smaller planets, it\u0027s possible to reenter without a heatshield even with DRE installed if you\u0027re using the \u0022realistic\u0022 setting, and that\u0027s without using rockets to kill off most of your velocity."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T23:09:33Z","Content":"A smaller SRB will also come in handy as a bigger sepratron for use on really big rockets."}]}
