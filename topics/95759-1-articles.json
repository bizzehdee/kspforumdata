There is a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E good chance something is going to break. If you have the Steam version, it should automatically update -- just make sure you run the x32 executable to start the game. Otherwise, you\u0027ll need to run the Launcher.exe so it can begin to patch the game to the latest version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to some files being reshuffled, in order to avoid glitches you\u0027re going to need to delete the Squad folder located in GameData; Steam, or the patcher, will automatically retrieve the correct files for the latest version. Once all the files are downloaded, you can try loading up your save game. If it is a Career save, you may have some issues, as 0.90 introduced the upgradeable buildings, as well as a great many other things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you experience issues trying to play your savegame, the best thing to do is create a brand-new savegame so that you have a \u0027correct\u0027 0.90 save file to look at. Open your old save and the new save side by side in a text editor, and compare them. You should find multiple blocks of information in the new save that you did not have in the old save; copy these across to the old save, but be careful not to leave blank lines in your save and make sure to preserve the structure of the file (essentially, make sure there are the same number of } as there are of {).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"her0brine52201","CreatedById":138935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T02:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, when i try to update my ksp launcher, i click update and it asked for an email and password on Squad patcher and above the login space it says store login, how do i register for an account ive already tried using my kerbal space program thing and it didnt let me , do i have to buy Ksp, because i got the full version for free so , my main question is how do i update it with an account. thanks:D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T03:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022her0brine52201\u0022 data-cite=\u0022her0brine52201\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey, when i try to update my ksp launcher, i click update and it asked for an email and password on Squad patcher and above the login space it says store login, how do i register for an account ive already tried using my kerbal space program thing and it didnt let me , do i have to buy Ksp, because i got the full version for free so , my main question is how do i update it with an account. thanks:D\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not quite sure how you\u0027ll have gotten the full version for free. If you had the game gifted via Steam, it will update via Steam. If you got a store key, you\u0027ll already have an account with the KSP Store that you used to redeem the key, so you can either download via there or put your store details into the KSP patcher. I\u0027d recommend just downloading the latest version over using the patcher at present. If someone has just made a copy of the game for you, that\u0027s an unauthorised copy and there\u0027s not much we can do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
