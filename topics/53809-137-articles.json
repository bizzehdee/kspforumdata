(Probably most common) Most of the textures are already offloaded into VRAM (graphics card memory), so when using ATM, what happens is saving VRAM, but not much RAM/VMEM since most textures don\u0027t reside in RAM/VMEM to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. (Rare and you probably would already know) You manually went and downscaled textures of stock and mods, so there\u0027s not much left to do for ATM. In theory, texture memory could be further reduced, by downsizing the textures in the asset files (those are not in the squad folder). Those contain stuff like textures for buildings, planets, sky, kerbals, menus and so on. ATM currently does not downscale those, even though some of them are excessive (i.e. those for kerbals - and there are dozens of them). This might actually be a good thing, as ATM after all the time it has been in development, does not have a simple filter like for example .*/icons/.* out of the box - if it can\u0027t even by default handle what obviously are icons, then what do you think might it do to the UI of the game, if it were to downscale assets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KolourBlynD","CreatedById":63415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T19:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey-low Dev!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after a small hiatus from KSP, I came back to play around a bit in game and, without any new additions to mods, found that ATM is causing some very weird behavior on my PC; For some reason ATM is causing a ridiculous amount of load on my CPU, causing loading of a single texture, regardless of size, to take up to a few minutes to load, as well as crippling any other processes. If I take ATM out, KSP loads as normal, within a few minutes altogether.

For heavily modded installs, this may take an hour or so. Then, next time, KSP loads the cache ATM created instead of each texture individually again and you get loads times of under like 5 minutes. If you quit during loading, ATM has to start creating the cache again.

I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re running the x86 version of KSP as it makes no sense to be running the x64 version as, while it does allow more RAM usage, your OS doesn\u0027t. If you are using the x64 version of KSP though, you\u0027ll need the x64 version of ATM. Match the ATM version with the game version, in short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2, In the ActiveTextureManagerConfig.cfg, add a line - WAIT = TRUE - like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ACTIVE_TEXTURE_MANAGER \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E WAIT = TRUE \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E DBG = TRUE \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ###Section for global settings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3, Open a command prompt as administrator* and enter \u0060bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVa 3072\u0060.
