For now I use action groups for such things, but it would be nice of TCA did that for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I look into it, I will try to keep the elegance of the mod intact. Meaning, it will know if engines are facing the wrong way, for it uses that information to determine which engine to use for steering. So it would know if they are no help at forward thrust and disable them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes for side engines that you could use for giant RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Colmo, I\u0027m guessing you need to bind TCA to a part to incorporate it to the tech tree. In my mind, TCA _should_ be part of stock SAS. Which, at this point, you get for free as well. I\u0027ll make it qfeys\u0027 call \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@evilC. I haven\u0027t noticed sluggishness when in SAS, for when you turn, SAS is temporarily disabled. When SAS is on, TCA will use the output of SAS to control the thrusters (much the same like it does with user input).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout changing orientation of the craft mid-flight. It \u0027should\u0027 do fine. I\u0027ll take a look at that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@phoenix_ca: I haven\u0027t tried it with MJ, and it depends how MJ controls its crafts. If it generates SAS-output or user-input then it might work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I started using this mod for a big long range spacecruizer as well, including a snub-spaceplane. Although it is quite unbalanced and impossible to keep pointing in the right direction manually; it flies beautifully with TCA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout thrusters above CoM, it works for me. TCA does not do anything with the thrust vectoring.
