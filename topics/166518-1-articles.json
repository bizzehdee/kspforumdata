For my first couple of rockets in my New Horizons series, I decided that stock launch clamps were too big, so I built this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NQTo87x.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NQTo87x.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xOgB4Pa.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/xOgB4Pa.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022inhK88d.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/inhK88d.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not mechanical and doesn\u0027t actually do anything other than stop the rocket from falling over, but it does that while looking fairly good I think. The rings are hollow cargo docking ports from Near Future Construction; they\u0027re better than decouplers for this sort of purpose because parts can pass through them and so can engine exhaust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
