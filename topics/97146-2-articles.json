Scale it up to 200% and it fits perfectly for the FH sections. Speaking of tweak-scale is it also coming to this? It could be a bit useful. Also not sure if this is a glitch but if you take a FH21 and FHWwh21 turn the extra nodes on they will snap vertically but not connect, staying transparent as if there is a clipping issue.
