Get your little green backside to the office, pronto!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just got done tracking down where Squad moved a lot of parts and edited the ReStock Reloaded cfg files, and added Science! to one of them. Three parts ended up on the cut list due to the loss of MK2 Spaceplane parts and the wingConnector. They\u0027ve been moved to the old24 folder.
