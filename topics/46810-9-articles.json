Now that I have unlocked over half the science I went back and deleted most my designs and returned to basic models. Basic models means something that has been tested to work good, without anything extra added to them, also called barebones (no science instruments, no extra add-ons, no unnecessary parts except for the strictly needed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on the simplicity or complexity of the designs, I number them with versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs such:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasic Space Plane V1.0 (does not actually reach space) is reserved for a small plane that can do low range flight around the base. I may wish to test some things or just practice my landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nV1.1 is planned for bigger craft that can reach at least half way the planet but not space (work in progress) but the initial design has been scrapped for the time being until better wings are researched to help with the overall flight quality and distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nV1.2 is planned for the craft that can reach the entire span of the planet and is to carry a crew of at least 3 (lacking the proper technology right now)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nV2.0 is reserved for space planes that can reach very high altitudes. (Vx.1/x.2 rules follow the same roles as before)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nV3.0 is reserved for space planes that can go to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasic Space Ships\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasic Orbiter Rescue V1.0 unmanned vessel with room for 3 crew used to launch rescue missions to near planet orbits, armed with a claw to recover parts and enough fuel to set debris on planet descent trajectories for those ship that do not need recovery but would like to bring down from space to clear the area. Can perform up to 3 recoveries of crews and one if captured with the claw and kept within the part. Armed with two parachutes that provide enough efficiency to land below the 6.6m/s and not destroy anything. I will most likely need to add more batteries or solar panels since the thing is damn fragile when it comes to power, and cannot survive more than 60 minutes away from sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo note, it is all on the 1.25m rockets and components, so the top part may be replaced depending on what needs to be lifted to orbit. I like to keep things that work in order to maintain order and to learn the rockets. It should be able to launch small satellites very far in the planet orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far I have planned the Basic Moon Lander V1.0 which should be a universal thing to allow me to go to the Mun or Minmus. I know that this is counterproductive, but I plan to use the same design to travel to the moon and then with the help of a second ship with a lander to do all the on and off missions and return with the main ship back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I have no basic rovers I do plan on implementing the same designs as above, only that this time the science instruments will be implemented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no plans for making basic satellites since these contracts are all random and require different specs and that would be useless since I would have to edit stuff all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for being potentially boring with my descriptions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-01T12:47:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2016 12:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by mystik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T17:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread\u0027s been going forever.
