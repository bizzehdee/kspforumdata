I like to bird watch and she thought I might try taking pictures. I haven\u0027t attempted it yet but the few outdoor photos I tried turned out OK and the pictures I took of people at my birthday party turned out nice enough for first pics. I also have a blog where I review tea. For the last couple years I have used a simple Samsung point and click for reasonably good close up pics especially considering I limit the size to 800x600 pixels. I thought if\u00A0a toy camera took good enough pics, a beginner DSLR should blow it out of the water. Maybe if I knew how to use it that would be true. My indoor macro shots all come out way on the yellow side. The software that came with the camera is more cryptic than the camera interface. I tried turning on more lights. No difference. Tried using something besides auto mode and upped the light adjustment. Setting it on the lightbulb setting made the picture way too bright. I\u0027m not an experienced photographer (obviously), can any one offer advice specific to this camera? Is there an easy to use freeware photo editing program I should try?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T21:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe yellowness comes from the wrong white balance setting. The light bulb is the setting to use if you use incandescent lights to light your scene. Other settings include a sun, clouds,\u00A0little fluorescent tube, flash, shade and the \u0022K\u0022 (it may also look like two triangles pointing at each other and a blob between and slightly above\u00A0them). Use the K, which is a manual setting for the color temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifically, if the lights you are using, and you should use one type of lights, is more yellowish as with tungsten bulbs, then a low number (roughly 3000 K) is what you need. If you use a more bluish lights such as halogens, you need a higher number (4000 - 5500 K).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe K stands for Kelvin and represents the temperature an ideal black body would need to have to glow with that color. It\u0027s not something you need to worry about, though, it\u0027s just good to know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, practical advice:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSet the white balance to K and a number that gives you OK-ish color with the light you use, don\u0027t worry if it\u0027s not perfect, we\u0027ll fix that. Next place a white paper in the frame and take a shot, proceed\u00A0to take a shot of your subjects. Now all your photos will have a slightly wrong white balance, but that\u0027s what the photo of a piece of paper is for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince we know that paper is white we can use that to tell the software what should be white. In, for example Lightroom, you can take the eye dropper tool to set the white balance on the paper photo and transfer that same correction data to the entire series of photos you\u0027ve taken in the same setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have Lightroom, Photoshop or a similar software that is made specifically for photo manipulation, go get yourself GIMP or Paint.net. Both are free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn GIMP you can try the Auto white balance tool. It may work properly, depending on the picture. Go to Colors -\u0026gt; Levels and find the Auto button. If it doesn\u0027t work properly, pick the rightmost eye dropper tool and find something white in the scene, but not to brightly lit or in shadow. Try the missle eye dropper tool as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also Color -\u0026gt; Auto -\u0026gt; White balance tool, try that too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, I use Lightroom for all my image editing, it\u0027s much more powerful and better at these things, but GIMP can do a decent job as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that being said, try to nail the white balance setting in camera as precise as you can, using the manual setting K and picking the correct value. It will make your life a lot easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAuto white balance may also work for you. It\u0027s the AWB setting in the camera\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I almost forgot... Happy birthday!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I don\u0027t know what kind of lenses your wife got you, but photographing wildlife is not easy and professionals use some quite expensive gear to do it, so don\u0027t expect miracles from your setup. Well, unless she dished out some serious cash for the lenses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy advice to you is, unless you have one get yourself a tripod (don\u0027t spend less than $150-200 on it, otherwise you\u0027ll be wasting your money on anything cheaper and make sure you get one with the ball head), next on a shopping list is\u00A0a\u00A050 mm f1,8 lens. It\u0027s the cheapest Canon lens, but it\u0027s excellent. A cheap chinese cable release for under $3 with free shipping should also be on your list (don\u0027t worry about knockoffs, there is literally nothing in it except an electrical contact, you\u0027re buying the cable with a connector, so genuine Canon is not really needed). If you need macro and can\u0027t quite get the magnification you want, you may also like to get yourself extension tubes. Ebay is full of them, just make sure you get the ones with electrical contacts. They are denoted as Autofocus ones. Don\u0027t bother with the ones that don\u0027t have the contacts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-28T21:57:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2016 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shpaget\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T23:06:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the detailed reply! I am using some indirect outdoor lighting but it is via a covered porch. I supplement this with candelabra bulbs in the ceiling fan and a desk lamp. Yeah its all quite low tech. If it hadn\u0027t worked so well with the point and shoot I would not have expected it to work here. It also explains why I tried the light bulb setting.

More often than not, when on tripod it\u00A0introduces blur. New and more expensive lenses have tripod detection system to turn it off automatically, but not the ones you have, so if you get less than sharp images, that might be your problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n75-300 should serve you well for birds. It\u0027s a decently long lens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n50mm 1,8 is not only brighter than either of your current ones, but it is optically very good (much better than 18-55), it is also very small and light, so caring it around is less of a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does have its own issues like the housing and mount being made out of plastic, so it\u0027s less durable should it sturdy on the ground, but I\u0027ve had mine for a while and it\u0027s seen its share of abuse. It\u0027s\u00A0still going strong. Read a few reviews and decide for yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCable release from T80 will not work (at least not without an adapter) on modern EOS cameras. But a cable release\u00A0really is not expensive, anyway. It\u0027s not a mandatory piece of equipments, you can use timer, it\u0027s just that I find it sometimes easier to use cable release when shooting macro.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou say washed out pictures and earlier you said you got the pictures way too bright. Try using exposure compensation. Put the camera in aperture priority mode, set the aperture to something like 5,6 or 6,3 (it doesn\u0027t really matter), crank the ISO to 800 or 1600 and while looking through the viewfinder press the shutter button\u00A0halfway. The camera should focus, but also on the bottom of the viewfinder a scale will appear (-3..2..1..0..1..2..\u002B3 with a small indicator marker somewhere on the scale). Every camera has somewhat different controls, for your specific take a look at this video\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBOo1aOb3IE?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor uniformly lit scenes, the marker should be at 0 for optimal brightness. Modern cameras have quite decent light meters, but they only consider the entire scene and take average value. If you have a brightly lit portion and a darker portion of scene, you may need to help the camera out in deciding what to meter for. If your images are coming out too bright or too dark, play around with that setting. Start with zero, if the images are too bright move a bit towards the -, if they are too dark, move towards the \u002B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T17:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222606188\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140694\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464502255\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245577\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Shpaget said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n50mm 1,8 is not only brighter than either of your current ones, but it is optically very good (much better than 18-55), it is also very small and light, so caring it around is less of a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, I have the II model of that - it\u0027s very inexpensive, works very well with the APS-C bodies (digital Rebels and 30/40D etc), and takes great shots - crisp and clear.\u00A0 The only caveat is that it\u0027s really bad when mounted on a full frame body (like a 1D or a 135 film body -- I have an old Rebel film camera that it\u0027s miserable on), but that\u0027s fairly high end use, and probably deserves more than a $99 lens heh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EliasDanger","CreatedById":151803,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T17:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always shoot in RAW format, then edit the files in Lightroom to get the best look.

Don\u0027t think that your new DSLR will blow the image quality of point and shoots out of the water.

Honestly the interface is not very intuitive. The manual is zzzzz and \u003Csub\u003Etiny\u003C/sub\u003E print. For an entry level DSLR you would think Canon would put some effort into making it a little more beginner friendly. It\u0027s kind of like the learning curve for a certain game we all love - pretty steep. Anyway, I can take pretty much exactly the picture I want outdoors. Can\u0027t always remember how to get to some settings, especially the f stop when in Av mode. I seem to be able to set everything but shutter speed. Haven\u0027t tried manual mode yet, baby steps. Even on fully automatic mode I took some pretty good amateur pics of family in an indoor gym setting.\u00A0I took some macro pics on my shady porch of a Mtn Dew bottle (the bottle cap pic is quite high art) while messing with the camera.
