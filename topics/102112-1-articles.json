In fact, at an ISP of 100 (well below most engines) the slope is merely -.03... which will almost always favor saving weight over ISP. For reference, if the dV required is upped to 2000, the point where slope is -1 moves up to an ISP of around 66.5 and at an ISP of 100, the slope is -.16 (considerably larger than before, but still pretty marginal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the function on the right side, you can see that decreasing the mass of the vessel will have a similar effect on dV. I\u0027ve actually created a 3-d plot with ISP on one axis, the weight ratio on another axis, and dV on a third axis. It\u0027s a pretty complex function, but generally speaking... saving weight is almost always more important than anything else. If you select by weight mainly, you may short yourself a couple m/s of dV here and there... but you\u0027ll generally come out far to the better than if you select by ISP alone.

This lander can get you there (it\u0027s a belly lander using four side mounted RM 24-77 to make the final drop after the atomic motor brings the ship to a hover at about 500-1000m. I return entire lander, LV-N and all, to Kerbin and soft land near KSP to recover most of the $23k cost.

If you\u0027ve got a really heavy vehicle (such that changing from lv-909 to nuke doesn\u0027t change percentage of mass by very much) then favoring ISP will be more important... but this isn\u0027t always the case. Neither can it be said that swapping to a lighter engine over one with better ISP is not often beneficial, because in many cases it is. The problem with the nuke is that on really heavy vessels (where it\u0027s ISP is much more important and its weight less important) it doesn\u0027t have sufficient thrust to perform in a manner that most people will find satisfactory (I am *not* doing a 20 minute burn in three kicks); however, once you get to lighter vehicles where its thrust is more acceptable, it\u0027s weight becomes a big problem (and you\u0027ll probably get better dV out of a lighter engine). There are roles for which the nuclear engine are ideal, but it isn\u0027t always the most effective/efficient for a given build.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rematog","CreatedById":134130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T14:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHell yes I\u0027d like a Rock-o-max sized atomic motor, with say a thrust of 400 kNt and ISP of say 775 sec (they wouldn\u0027t be likely to give bigger thrust without taking away a little ISP...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I\u0027m making my first run (Training mission to Mun \u0026amp; Minmus with 3 rookies to get them to Skill 3 in one go) in the \u0022Kondor\u0022 lander, which has 2 LV-N\u0027s and a dV of 5,561 m/s.
