This means that, when exposed to fluctuations, the object may move slightly to the right or left, but its total volume is always conserved. Because this displacement resembles a tug-of-war game with a rigid object, the researchers call the method \u0022tug-of-war (TOW) dynamics.\u0022\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically they argue that propensity of nature events to change the environment can attract or repel solid objects that resist deformation.
