Doing a quick read the region where Hydrogen would likely become metallic within Jupiter is where pressures are around 200 GPa and further down pressures easily exceed 3000 GPa. Thus the challenges to overcome would be not only finding a means to compress Hydrogen into a metallic state and keeping it in that state but also finding a pressure vessel that can endure extremes of temperature and pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-15T22:59:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2016 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Exploro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T23:11:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe have made metallic hydrogen, but it didn\u0027t stick around for long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen#Z_machine.2C_2015\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen#Z_machine.2C_2015\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T23:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMetallic hydrogen is useless to us.
