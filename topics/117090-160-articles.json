I wonder what a \u0022realistic\u0022 guideline would be for a part that is to be used as habitation as a function of total volume? \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps the default state of the part assumes use as a hab with the stated crew, then has EC, mono, LS, etc. judged to be reasonable for that number of crew.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is the large torus 5860 m^3^(a 5m cross sectional diameter)?  That would not count wall thickness, obviously. I could imagine coaxial tori, where the space between the interior torus (the living space) and the outer skin is filled with propellant/LS/etc (water, basically, it\u0027s good radiation shielding). \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Even with no IVA I like to try and visualize the interior ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) .\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Spitballing:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A 0.5m wall thickness (including tankage) means that ~64% of the large torus would be tankage (slop it down for the actual shell).

I might even be inclined to treat the tori all as labs, or certainly the large ones. there is enough volume for 30 crew to all have large volumes for habitation, AND have multiple labs of the stock volume.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, those kind of back of the envelope calls can inform decision making in terms of how players use them. I think the tori should be  expensive in career mode, and perhaps off the end of the existing tree.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If I throw cryogenic engines back in my mod mix, I bet I could make some cool long-duration ships with those spherical tanks and the large torus ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) . (that has a retro look that appeals to my design sense).\n\u003E \n\nI think I had ~2300m^3 as the raw volume for that torus... but that could be incorrect (was merely what the Blender volume-calc tool told me... which has been very accurate so far).  The torus\u0027 are using 10% of that volume for \u0027storage\u0027 volume, the rest being hab and structure; but that is just a wild-guess percent that I threw in there when I saw how much volume those parts have.  In contrast the cylinder-inflatables and COS modules have 75% hab/structure, 25% storage, and the DOS modules use a closer to 50%-50% ratio (as they store a ton of propellant in addition to other supplies).\n\nI\u0027ve added some of your posted info to the feedback ticket so that it doesn\u0027t get lost in the forum shuffle;  should have time to start looking over the balance a bit closer when I return on Sun/Mon."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-03T15:27:33Z","Content":"Awesome.

And possibly make it a wee bit more powerful. Even around the Mun it\u0027s difficult to use.\n\nTo go along with the swapping of service modules, it would also be cool to have the have the option to swap the current black/dark gray color of the entire spacecraft with the green of older variants. I\u0027d make the texture myself but...i don\u0027t know how. The files can\u0027t be modified in GIMP without a plugin (of which doesn\u0027t work anyways), and i don\u0027t have photoshop\n\nExample, ASTP mission: \n\nSpoiler\n\n![H1UUC7I.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/H1UUC7I.jpg)\n\nProposal #1.5: Swap between Apollo service module blocks 1 and 3. ~~I have no idea what block 2 looks like, because google won\u0027t give me anything, but it must be very similar to block 1, so it can be ignored.~~ Block 2 was used for the actual Moon missions, Block 1 was Apollo 1 and previous, so Block -1- can be ignored.\n\nExample:\n\nSpoiler\n\n![ODZ9aQp.png](http://i.imgur.com/ODZ9aQp.png)\n\nNote that BIII, III\u002B, IV and V are shown, but the only one i request would be the standard BIII. Seeing as how BIII\u002B and V can most likely be made with the station parts, and BIV could be made with stock panels, they are extra unneeded work. For the engine, i assume just using the engine-swapping modue you have already created would work there, but i don\u0027t know what variant BIII and beyond uses. Probably just another variant that could faked with engines already made. the shuttle maneuvering engines, perhaps are a good option due to their size similarity with BIII\n\nProposal #2: Modular/procedural fairings, beyond the fiddly ones that stock implements (i\u0027m having serious trouble closing them at the point sometimes ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)).\n\nI\u0027m thinking about a fairing base, with adjustable bottom/top diameters, height (via model swapping or just stretching), the middle piece with adjustable length, and the top/cone bit that could be swapped out for others. So as not to inflate the part count of the vessel, maybe just have the fairing as one big part that splits into 2 when staged (rather than having 2 separate halves built with individual pieces) to begin with? That\u0027s how stock fairings seems to do it, and that works ok most of the time.\n\nExamples of fairings that could be made, Soyuz(can you tell i really like Souyz \u2764\uFE0F): ![ST-fairing.jpg](http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets_1/East_Europe_1/Soyuz-ST/Fairings/ST-fairing.jpg)\n\nTitan fairings. The only difference between these would be the base shape (configurable, ofc), while the panels would just be a different diameter due to the base top being scaled differently. I hope you catch my drift, i\u0027m really sleepy: \n\n![OTXxl0o.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OTXxl0o.jpg)\n\nProposal #3: A way to align ports to make multi-port docking easier. Maybe just a single long, skinny docking port that reaches from one end of the tank to the other (down the side) of some sort so i can dock tanks side-by-side. This would prevent the process of: align, dock, realize i screwed up, undock, repeat until i get it right. It would make docking things like Project Argosy type ships together a lot less tedious.\n\nExample: \n\nSpoiler\n\n![qLtz269.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qLtz269.jpg)\n\nIdeas i had that won\u0027t work, or that i suspect you wouldn\u0027t bother with ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\n- Being able to swap the current lander can out with the LK lander.\n\nWhy it won\u0027t work: It would mean swapping IVA\u0027s which isn\u0027t possible, if i\u0027m reading previous posts correctly.\n\n- MAKS Spaceplane:\n\nWhy it won\u0027t happen: Waaay too many non-modular parts. IVA, carrier craft to launch from, fuel tank, wheels. \n\n- Modular command capsule.\n\nWhy it won\u0027t work: IVA swapping. Nope, NEEEXT!\n\n- Lots of other non-modular stuff...ehh, you get the point.
