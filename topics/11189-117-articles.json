I then took apart my Poseidon \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and put a Gilly lander in a cargo bay, but the plane spun out of control.\n\n![GFLI4xc.png](https://i.imgur.com/GFLI4xc.png)\n\n- The Gilly lander after deployed from the first prototype.\n    - Delta-V: 3,475 m/s\n    - Thrust: 60 kN\n    - Mass: 24.933 tons\n\nHowever, after re-entry, I started to spin uncontrollably through the atmosphere.

In case you don\u0027t know what it is, it\u0027s a spaceplane that carries another spaceplane into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and drops it off before returning to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Below is a picture of the latest semi-successful prototype in action.\n\n![FK44sst.png](https://i.imgur.com/FK44sst.png)\n\n- Taken at 160 km orbital altitude\n- Main spaceplane has ~4966 m/s of delta-V when detached.\n- Now you know why it\u0027s called a spaceplane carrier.\n    - I won\u0027t waste the spaceplane\u0027s fuel getting ready for its ejection burns.\n\nOnce I get it working, I can send the main spaceplane to whatever planet I need to without having to stop at Minmus and/or Ike first. If I\u0027m lucky, I can land and get back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E without having to refuel - but I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E just in case. As for the \u0022carrier,\u0022 I will send it back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E immediately after detachment.\n\nIf successful, does this qualify as a K Prize entry? Yes, both planes will be millions of kilometers away and land years apart, but both should end up back home intact when they\u0027re done."},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-05T09:12:18Z","Content":"[@Mars-Bound Hokie](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/192121-mars-bound-hokie/) , interesting design and idea, reminiscent of Virgin Galactic\u0027s White Knight launcher.\n\nI think what you are proposing would have to break the payload ascent rule, in proviso A for rule 1, because of using the lift surfaces if not engines of the payload vehicle on ascent.  \n\nPlease bear in mind these rules are intended to allow comparisons between different spaceplane designs and distinguish spaceplanes from staged rockets, it can get a bit tricky around edge cases, gamers being gamers!\n\nIf you wanted Utilitarial certification for moving a daughter vehicle to orbit as payload then the payload craft may not use engines on ascent or lift surfaces, because this is indistinguishable from staging, so if the lifter lands alone but uses the daughter vehicle propulsion or wings on ascent then its a gatecrasher. \n\nThere have been precedents set regarding ships with detachable explorers and what seemed to make sense at the time was that the mission kudos only applies while the multipart craft is intact and as long as the other rules are also observed, especially no use of refuelling for kudos related propulsion. The kudos only applies up to the point they separate and after they recombine e.g. low orbit.\n\nSo the daughter vehicle can do what you want including visit Minmus to refuel and use mined fuel for missions, but nothing it does while separated counts for K-Prize kudos. Kudos begins to apply once they reunite to land as long as any mined fuel does not assist the combined vehicle. If the daughter used mined fuel to get to a rendezvous distant from the separation point then that would also break the K-Prize conditions, as that is using mined fuel to move part of the entire craft. Hope that makes sense. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-05T15:46:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2020 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ksp Slingshooter","CreatedById":158986,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-14T17:45:49Z","Content":"Here\u0027s my entry for the K-Prize, an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E that only weighs 9,208 tons.  \n\nIt\u0027s called Phoenix mk-3.  \n\nIt took me a few attempts to perfect the ascent profile (that\u0027s why you\u0027ll see different pilots in the pilot seat).\n\nIt only ends up having ~200 m/s of delta-V in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E  \n  \n![w8CGwdV.png](http://i.imgur.com/w8CGwdV.png)\n\nHere\u0027s the full album: [https://imgur.com/gallery/pW5W7q0](https://imgur.com/gallery/pW5W7q0)"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-14T23:20:22Z","Content":"Congratulations [@Ksp Slingshooter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158986-ksp-slingshooter/) on completing the K-Prize challenge mission successfully with the Pheonix mk-3.
