I had bad experiences with towing larger pieces of debris with KAS cables. Some behaved like giant jo-jo threatening to swing all the way around and slam into my tug. Other started losing parts while towed, creating more debris. And sometimes physic just glitched breaking one or both ships or even crashing the game. Granted, it was with one of earlier versions of KAS - i didn\u0027t try it since.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T07:11:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe whole point of magnets is that they don\u0027t have to be placed Via EVA unless you\u0027re trying to place them very precisely.

I have run into 3 problems; there may be more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1st, most important to your attempts at a towing, is that it\u0027s very hard to get both the winch and the connection on the other end liked up properly on the centerlines of both ships. If it\u0027s not that way, you tend to get lots of gyrations and tumbling. And even if you get this down, you can\u0027t maneuver, only go straight ahead. As soon as the towtruck rotates to burn in another direction, it has a the mass of the other way off-center. Or at least it was that way in my attempts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2nd problem is the unpredictable one you sometimes run into on the ground: the phantom forces. That is, the winch cable suddenly exerts a strong pull on the ships on the ends, but doesn\u0027t actually move them closer together, just cocks them towards each other. On the ground this is bad enough but in space, it can result in VERY rapid gyrations of the 2 ships until something breaks. To avoid this, do the same preventive measures you do on the ground. That is, extend a lot of slack in the cable, move it to the other ship via release mode, connect it undocked, let out some more slack, then connected docked. Of course, this is only an issue if you need to use the cable in docked mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3rd problem is that if your Kerbal has a winch part or connector on his back when he reboards a capsule, that part is lost and that Kerbal loses the ability to make connections with other parts. I discovered this by getting all ready to EVA to a stranded ship with one of those dismountable ports, but then deciding to wait until the sun came up and went back inside. To avoid this problem, don\u0027t go back inside while holding winch parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flyin_ruski","CreatedById":60421,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T17:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know what you mean about maneuvers.
