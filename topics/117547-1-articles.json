So, what makes a rocket flip?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably aerodynamic effects. You can verify with this test: next time a rocket flips, shut off the engines, turn off SAS, and just let the thing sail. It will likely do a 180 and then stabilize--flying backwards. Then, after it passes apoapsis, it will likely do another 180 and fly backwards as it\u0027s going DOWN. If it does that, it\u0027s definitely aerodynamic; your rocket is draggy in the front and wants the part with the most drag (usually the payload) to be in the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a few ways to fix this. Cover the payload in a fairing. Enough counterforce (thrusters or SAS) to beat the drag. Or put enough drag in the back of the vehicle to make IT the draggy part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd my personal favorite--flip the payload and launch it upside down. Then it can\u0027t flip because it\u0027s already flipped! No, really. Not joking. Every time I try this, it works.
