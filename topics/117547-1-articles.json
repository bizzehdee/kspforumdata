When you push through past 400 m/s, it lets you go again and your drag is suddenly lower than ever. If your solid boosters cut out at 300 m/s, though, that means you just transitioned from a high TWR to a low TWR situation, and *then* you get wave drag on top of that. You\u0027ll spend a long time fighting against it because you just can\u0027t accelerate.

So, what makes a rocket flip?\n\nProbably aerodynamic effects. You can verify with this test: next time a rocket flips, shut off the engines, turn off SAS, and just let the thing sail. It will likely do a 180 and then stabilize--flying backwards. Then, after it passes apoapsis, it will likely do another 180 and fly backwards as it\u0027s going DOWN. If it does that, it\u0027s definitely aerodynamic; your rocket is draggy in the front and wants the part with the most drag (usually the payload) to be in the back.\n\nThere\u0027s a few ways to fix this. Cover the payload in a fairing. Enough counterforce (thrusters or SAS) to beat the drag. Or put enough drag in the back of the vehicle to make IT the draggy part.\n\nAnd my personal favorite--flip the payload and launch it upside down. Then it can\u0027t flip because it\u0027s already flipped! No, really. Not joking. Every time I try this, it works. Though the resulting rockets look like something out of a 70\u0027s Theodore Sturgeon sci-fi novel.....\n\nOr.....if you hate aerodynamic shenanigans and just want to play the game: hit ALT-F12, go to the Physics/Drag tab, and uncheck \u0022Apply Drag\u0022.\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T16:42:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WedgeAntilles**"}]}
