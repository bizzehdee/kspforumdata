In current patch RT-10 got shafted by 48-7S which is tremendously overpowered. The difference is quite small but 9x 48-7S with a FL-T400 and LF-T100 is lighter, and give more thrust for longer burn time than one RT-10. \u003Cp\u003EThe RT-10 do have more dV if placed on a probe, but that is not an accurate measurement of engine performance, because it\u0027s heavily affected by empty mass.

However (!!) the aero generally uses less fuel, falling the tinniest bit behind in full vacuum at higher dVs, but overall, not having attempted the calculation, I suspect the aero uses less total fuel to reach orbit, using whatever stages are optimal to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is important because in reality (in game reality, or real life I guess), you attach a parachute to the engine and then you don\u0027t have to buy it again. So considering refueling, even if you want to strictly go by payload fraction, then the mass over repeated missions is minimized by aeros because the equation changes from payload/(total mass) = payload/(fuel\u002Bengines\u002Betc) to payload/(fuel*#(missions)\u002Bengines\u002Betc). I would argue that using less fuel *is* using less mass. Implicitly, it costs less over time which to me is the real goal, i.e. if person X builds rockets according to this challenge and person Y builds rockets with aeros, person Y will accomplish more with equal resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: (nvm)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-22T15:28:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2013 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Seanner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T16:40:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Seanner I\u0027ve made a replay to your post earlier, but deleted it because it wasn\u0027t any good, but now seeing your \u0022nvm\u0022 I\u0027m super curious what was that about \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and one small thing i wanted to point out, is that fuel itself (unless its antimater) is generally much cheaper than engines.
