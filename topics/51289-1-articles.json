A smart dad with a lot of books, and a fear of the dark. Now the deal was, bedtime was 8pm, lights out was 8:30. The only exception to this, is if I was reading. My dad would let me stay up late on the condition that I was in bed, and reading a book. Not drawing or listening to the radio, or sleeping with the light on. I had to read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy parents never bought me kids books. I never read \u0022go dog go\u0022, or \u0022the very hungry caterpillar\u0022, or comic books, so I had to choose from the bible, dads carpentry and woodworking books, a very long series of science encyclopedia magazines (kind of like popular science meets nat geo, I don\u0027t remember what they were called, world factopedia atlas, and the ultimate visual dictionary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started with the bible, and that was a bad choice for 8 year old me, because I opened it up to a random page in the beginning (my parents are both atheist and never read the bible to me) and the first entry I read was the eye for an eye bit, where some guy (Jesus?) says, if a hand should sin, then cut off that hand, if an eye should sin, gouge it out, for it is better to be blinded than to live with sin. I\u0027m paraphrasing there. It frightened the crap out me, and I didn\u0027t open a bible again until I was 27.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the carpentry books, atlas, dictionary, and science magazines were the library I had to choose from, and I read them all, cover to cover, several times over during my childhood. I had mad skills with geography and flags and stuff, even politics of far away countries (outdated as it was) and I could spell pretty much any word I recognized. I wasn\u0027t given plastic toys or video games, because we were a bit poor, but my dad made me jigsaw puzzles and building blocks (because he\u0027s a carpenter) and when I was about 11, they bought a computer that ran MS-DOS. They explained that, beyond word processing, they didn\u0027t know how to use it, so I took up the 500 page DOS manual and learned it, then I taught them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much ever since, I\u0027ve read just about everything I could get my hands on, and my sci-fi books outnumber regular fiction 3-1. When I discovered wikipedia, I probably almost died of starvation, just linking page after page after page of chemical formulas and quarks and scram cannons and Z-machines and alan turing and teller-ulam warheads and difference engines, and so on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here I am.

Thank your father for that, not many parents are like that. I too had problems understanding the bible at a young age because neither of my parents explained the metaphors and similes to me either so I was frightened as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experience with science came from the fact that my father is a bit of an everything type of guy so he, through osmosis, instilled that in me.

My dad was a chemist and he\u0027d occasionally talk to us about some aspect of chemistry or explain a reaction if we asked about rust or whatever but I think I first started being really interested when I found about atoms, evolution, electron energy levels and the animal cell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose things really started me thinking about how much I had absolutely no clue about. After I finished my formal education, I graduated in a biological science, I started to get more interested in the big questions like what is time? Where did this universe come from? And why are we all here anyway? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had decided from a very young age that the concept of the Christian God was laughable, (no problems if you don\u0027t agree, it\u0027s just like, my opinion man), so I wanted to find out more to explain things to me. I started with some Richard Dawkins as I felt understanding evolution would be the first step in understanding a whole lot more. \u0027The Selfish Gene\u0027 and \u0027The Blind Watchmaker\u0027 opened my eyes and really fired home the concepts of evolution for me. Then I read Brian Greene\u0027s book called \u0027The Elegant Universe\u0027 which is basically a history of the development of Superstring theory. Mind was blown. He manages to explain relativity pretty well in it as well as the concepts behind string theory and why it\u0027s just so damn elegant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there I\u0027ve done my best to absorb science documentaries, magazines, articles and whatever else I could find because to me, science is my religion. I have faith that science will eventually answer practically all of our questions and provide near immortality in the form of regeneration tech or simple mind-downloading-into-computer tech.

But more so, he believes that even theories, be them mathematical, particle physics or otherwise, could be deduced from simple abstract logic. I agree. And I\u0027ve seen it happen -- not only in the greek days mind you, but even now. Anyway, my talks with him got me really interested in how our universe works. Micro to macro.

It is a fully comprehensive spaceflight textbook with schematics, calculations, equations and engineering solutions to various problems of space travel, all written in a very simple and understandable language, with most unknown terms explained beforehand in a comprehensive manner.
