There is program that you hook to the Skyrim .exe It detects your saves and creates profiles for each character and it\u0027s saves. When you boot up the program, you choose a character, and forces the game to load only saves that has to do with that specific character. \n\nLike-wise as we all know. Elder Scrolls games also lets you activate and de-active mods with a push of a button. \n\nSo why have this? \n\nYou could have multiple career games with different setup of mods. One game could be focused more on cosmetics, and EVE, making the world beautiful with minimal other mods. Another could be focused ehavily on parts, or difficulty by using TAC and Remote Tech, etc. (Stuff like this would seem to be helpful to youtubers as well). \n\nBasically the idea is to combine the two into 1. \n\nA program that hooks into the KSP .exe that you start up first. (Similar to the already created CKan for mod management). In it you can select and deselect mods, and only the mods you selected are loaded by KSP. The others ignored. \n\nAlso having the option to \u0022save\u0022 a profile of mod loadouts for quick switching. \n\nPossible?"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T14:05:49Z","Content":"Check out [CKAN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067).\n\nHowever if you have multiple sets of mods, simply keeping two copies of KSP works a lot better - just copy your whole Kerbal Space Program directory."},{"CreatedByName":"LadyAthena","CreatedById":88614,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T15:45:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Check out [CKAN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067).\n\u003E However if you have multiple sets of mods, simply keeping two copies of KSP works a lot better - just copy your whole Kerbal Space Program directory.\n\nI already mentioned CKan in my original post.

I hope they can do it, it\u0027ll really open up the game for people, especially modders. More so because of the memory limitations of the game. If/when Squad finally gets 64 bit fully going, this\u0027ll be a big help for those mods that conflict with others, allowing you to have multiple instances of saves and profiles for mods."}]}
