There is program that you hook to the Skyrim .exe It detects your saves and creates profiles for each character and it\u0027s saves. When you boot up the program, you choose a character, and forces the game to load only saves that has to do with that specific character. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike-wise as we all know. Elder Scrolls games also lets you activate and de-active mods with a push of a button. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why have this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have multiple career games with different setup of mods. One game could be focused more on cosmetics, and EVE, making the world beautiful with minimal other mods. Another could be focused ehavily on parts, or difficulty by using TAC and Remote Tech, etc. (Stuff like this would seem to be helpful to youtubers as well). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the idea is to combine the two into 1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA program that hooks into the KSP .exe that you start up first. (Similar to the already created CKan for mod management). In it you can select and deselect mods, and only the mods you selected are loaded by KSP. The others ignored. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso having the option to \u0022save\u0022 a profile of mod loadouts for quick switching. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T14:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever if you have multiple sets of mods, simply keeping two copies of KSP works a lot better - just copy your whole Kerbal Space Program directory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LadyAthena","CreatedById":88614,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T15:45:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hab136\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hab136\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cp\u003EHowever if you have multiple sets of mods, simply keeping two copies of KSP works a lot better - just copy your whole Kerbal Space Program directory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already mentioned CKan in my original post.
