To my understanding the information in the mod states that with 2 propane tanks and nozzles to go with it its able to leave Mun and make a return trip back to our home on Kerbin is this true? also is it possible to land on the moon with the cart ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I\u0027m unsure about is how many stages would i need i know i need a stage to initially leave Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere but after that I\u0027m unsure. With my orbiter rocket it has 3 stages and a final remove capsule from spacecraft to return home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other information and advice would be appreciated \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYours Faithfully \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAescwulf\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T17:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually design my craft to have 2 stages to get it into orbit or nearly there (depends on the size of the rocket). The next stage is a transfer stage. From there, it\u0027s the landing and return stages (1 stage if just going to the Mun or Minmus).

Generally more stages are easier though - you\u0027re dumping dead weight so you get more total thrust out of the rocket giving you more room to maneuver - with the big increase coming from the first few stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree or four is probably the easiest to start with but don\u0027t worry if you need more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally the thing to avoid is making your munar lander too big, I don\u0027t know how much the cart weighs but I\u0027d generally try and keep the whole of the mun stages under 50 tons or your launching rocket will be huge. Ideally half that or less for a sensible sized rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John F.
