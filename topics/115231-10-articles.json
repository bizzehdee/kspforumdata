Because of the amount of energy put into this single point, projecting it at the Great Attractor, suffering from density vs durability instability, would have the pulse interatomically break down the high-density bonds between the material, effectively creating new, less dense materials for itself. To retain the same mass of course, physics dictates that it\u0027s volume scale proportionally, hence it\u0027s sphere of influence. Because of this, objects within a larger radius will be pulled in, adding to the Great Attractor\u0027s mass and volume even more, constantly being managed by the Verterons. It\u0027s sphere of influence, and gravitational power will grow exponentially. I thought to do this because you all were in the threshold for a little something I call **the impasse**. Go in, there\u0027s no coming out]\n\nEDIT: Or in English, I stabilized it with Verterons and it\u0027s going to kill you all.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T06:15:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 06:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"UnionPacific1983WP","CreatedById":140982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T06:12:56Z","Content":"*Warning: Great Attractor has gone supercritical.
