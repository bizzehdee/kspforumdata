I\u0027ve been trying to design efficient long range recon aircraft so that I can find anomalies on Kerbin. This was a new (and untested!) design, and I owe a nod of thanks to ZeroIgnite for the idea of putting air intakes on pylons on the wingtips. She used fuel tanks; I used vanilla fuselage because of weight considerations, given the wingspan of my design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final third of the trip was nerve wracking, since fuel balancing became an issue. If you look closely at the \u0022ground distance\u0022 on the report, it\u0027s probably a bit longer than the norm for circumnavigation. The reason is that the vessel became extremely difficult to control once the forward fuel tanks were empty, both in heading and altitude. At one point, I was both way off course and well above an altitude where I would have expected flameout. Thanks to the added air intakes, though, I never flamed out, to my vast surprise. I drifted above the ceiling for the challenge at that point, so that may disqualify me. I hope not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a \u0022purist\u0022, so the only mod I have is Kerbal Alarm clock. I tried F.A.R. for awhile, but I\u0027m no aerospace engineer, and I quit having fun while I was trying to make sense of how to manipulate the numbers so that my aircraft would quit flipping like autumn leaves at takeoff. I gave up on that after I realized that I was learning nothing except how limited my vocabulary of four letter words were for expressing my frustration. There just weren\u0027t enough to do the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the fuel balancing issue remains a problem, since I can\u0027t figure out how to keep my tanks from running out without manually transferring fuel in-flight. Any tips on this would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a link to ZeroIgnite\u0027s elegant design which inspired my attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25884-Kerbin-Circumnavigation-Challenge-Reloaded-New-Rules-Once-More?p=576576\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post576576\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25884-Kerbin-Circumnavigation-Challenge-Reloaded-New-Rules-Once-More?p=576576\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post576576\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Almost forgot to point out the \u0022primary feature\u0022 of the design. As I said, this is intended to be a recon craft, and it\u0027s based on another smaller design that has served me well. In both designs, I use three engines: a basic jet engine, and two Turbojet Engines. I group the Turbos together in an action group that I can toggle on and off, and also have the Basic engine similarly configured in a separate action group. Most of the time that I\u0027m exploring, I have the Turbos off to conserve fuel. Whenever I\u0027m ready to move long distance, I\u0027m able to flip on the Turbos and cover distance quickly, with the Basic engine off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-18T02:53:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2013 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Porspeler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WafflesToo","CreatedById":71736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T03:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOL!
