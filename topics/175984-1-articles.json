Plus it runs pretty smooth and stable for me. And on top of all that it feels like the last true Squad version we had, before T2 came along. Somehow the whole feel of the game, and the community here too, changed for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first I was excited for all the parts the DLC would bring, and when they finally came around we had some pretty serious bugs in the base game. Now, 3 hotfix patches later, some of those severe issues are still unresolved and somehow I just cant be bothered anymore. I would like to try out the new parts and additions, and some days I mess around a bit, but most of the time I am happy to play around with different 1.3.1 installs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the drag occlusion of Kerbals in Command Seats gets fixed, and some mods get updated, I might take the plunge though. Lets see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about you guys? Are you happy with 1.4.3? Do you play any other version? Do you think I miss out?

There was also still the lingering hope that we were getting close to \u0027just one more patch or two\u0027 away from a reasonably definitive version... but then the 1.3.x patches stopped, way too soon.
