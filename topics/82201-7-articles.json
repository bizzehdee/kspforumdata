Basically through instancing like you would see in an MMO. Each player has their own time instance (think KMP calls it \u0022Subspace\u0022) but can choose to sync their instance with the one furthest forward which would simulate on rails all the ships in that instance till it reaches the synced one. Sadly the execution doesn\u0027t work very well, and through no fault of the developer. I just believe adding multiplayer is too complex a task to be added as mod, it just needs more in-depth work with the core code than can be done, so it\u0027s never going to work very reliably.
