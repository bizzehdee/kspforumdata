People like me can often miss it with its collaborative work. I decided to make this but this time anyone can add anything to the station instead of chosen ones. Although to prevent hazard, rules are applied to the station and is follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Stock parts only. I may allow a few mods in the future\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Each module needs atleast one extra docking station to make sure expansion is not stalled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. The system uses save files, not craft files. I will explain this later\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Feel free to use hyperedit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSave file system means you download the save, add the module, then post the save download.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to start the hub, I need to go to sleep for school.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-03T14:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow was sleep school? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I wish you luck with this mate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nathaniel411","CreatedById":146942,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-04T08:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you and the hub is now on space *cough cough* Hyperedit *cough cough*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3RWx8cXEj-nR29RR1pkUEJuYVE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMay or may not have escape pods and mass relay.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
