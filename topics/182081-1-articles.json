I\u0027m looking for a mod I was using a few years ago but I don\u0027t remember the name of it or what it was attached to, if anything. It was a small, toggleable window with the name \u0022Engines GUI\u0022 that displayed a lot of basic information about current atmospheric conditions and engines like temperature, static pressue, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, Thrust to drag ratio, etc. It had a blizzy toolbar icon that looked like a centrifugal pump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be awesome to have this back if someone can point me to it. Thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-10T13:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s part of SolverEngines, which is bundled with Real Fuels.
