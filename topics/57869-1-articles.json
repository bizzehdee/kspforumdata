There are two reasons for this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjects further than 2.5 km are \u0022un-loaded\u0022 from the physics engine and put on rails, to lighten the load on the CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjects on rails that are on an impact course with a celestial body are deleted as having \u0022crashed\u0022. This includes spent stages that are discarded during a launch, or any other parts your craft sheds while in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, the game is programmed to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T07:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are \u0022mod\u0022 to prevent the disappear of the object.

Not an easy feat when you also have to fly the plane low in order to stay in the 2.5k range. Try dropping them from orbit and landing each one separately. They will then remain until recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
