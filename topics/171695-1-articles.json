Not much seems to have been fixed and more things have broken. This is a list of some of the issues I\u0027m still having.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCant recover craft - I can no longer recover my ANY of my rockets or anything. Before the patch I could recover everything. I could fly to mun, land, take science and then recover. Not anymore. I\u0027m stuck. Is this a fix? Was this how the game was supposed to be? I\u0027ve never played any KSP other than enhanced so I don\u0027t know.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLaaaaaaag - After reverting to build after a failed launch it does a loading spinner in the middle of the screen and I can no longer control my craft but it continues on flying for another 10-30 seconds before finally taking me back to the build.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nButtons disappearing - This actually was a problem before the patch as well. I will fly somewhere and somewhere along the way I will no longer be able to recover, go to space center, go to tracking station or quit. All the buttons are grey or missing. I have to restart the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all I can think of right now but there may be more I\u0027m forgetting I will add later but those are the main ones. Should I just restart my career mode? Start fresh with the new patch? I have a lot of hours into the one I\u0027m on.
