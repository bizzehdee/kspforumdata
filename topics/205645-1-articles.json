I\u0027m not sure about what they\u0027re going to with the newest Macs tho, since those are (once again) going away from the X86 architecture (for who knows what reason, maybe to make it harder for people to \u0022build their own Mac\u0022 probably, because apparently it\u0027s not in Apple\u0027s best interests to allow their customers the ability to choose to use anything non-Apple, and therefore intentionally make their stuff incompatible, despite their stuff likely not doing anything any better than a similar PC).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from my personal extreme dislike of Apple\u0027s business practices, I don\u0027t see any reason why crossplay wouldn\u0027t be possible, but like I said since they\u0027re moving away from the X86 architecture there would have to be a port of the whole Unity game engine over to handle that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess I\u0027m saying \u0022PC/Linux crossplay highly likely, Mac maybe but that\u0027s not on the KSP developers to make it happen, and after that they might maybe who knows make Xbox also crossplay a little bit (or maybe even do like Fallout 4 did and make a miracle happen by allowing some kinds of mods on consoles too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-12T12:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224063947\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205645\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221639163009\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SciMan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/10/2021 at 11:03 AM, SciMan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least with PC and Linux the hardware\u0027s mostly the same.

The CPU difference hardly matters when you\u0027re running CIL code on a CLR. There could be some minor incompatibilities due to new CLR being written to support the new Macs, but that\u0027s more in the realm of bugs, really. Either way, it should have no impact on how the multiplayer functions. There is certain degree of challenge to actually get the game to run well on the Mac, but once you have that, making PC/Linux/Mac cross-play is going to be just as easy with M1 Macs as it would be with x86/64.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, we haven\u0027t really had confirmation that KSP2 will be natively supported on Linux and Mac. Valve\u0027s Proton might actually end up being the best way to play KSP2 on Linux if nothing changes, since they are getting pretty good at supporting Unity games, and if Steam Deck does well, I suspect that will only improve. I don\u0027t think it will ever quite match native, but it could get close enough to where you don\u0027t mind. And, of course, if your best option to play KSP2 on Linux will be via Proton, you\u0027ll get cross-play automatically, as you\u0027d be running the same exact version on both platforms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, I don\u0027t think there are particularly great options for Mac right now. With Vulkan dropped and OpenGL getting deprecated, options for running Windows games on Mac are getting thinner. It is possible to take a Windows Unity game, partially decompile it, and then build a native Mac project from it, which people have done successfully with some other games, but also, if something doesn\u0027t work, there aren\u0027t a lot of good options to fix it.

There can be some little things, like tying your match-making too much to the game services, which could make matching players on different platforms difficult, but there are always ways to work around that. So the reason is almost universally in contracts that developers have with console companies. Usually, at least one of the two will have a clause that makes it impossible or very costly to develop cross-play games. It does sound like these restrictions might be loosened at the moment, as there are a lot more games showing up with cross-play, but it\u0027s very hard to say if it\u0027s anything Intercept can count on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-13T17:58:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224064366\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205645\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221639311284\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/12/2021 at 1:14 PM, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat doesn\u0027t really matter to a game like KSP2 or just about any Unity game.

If you only play with random people, it\u0027s not too much of a problem. You just need a simple name server for that.\u00A0But if you want ability to play with friends, you need a system in place. So if I\u0027m making a game available on Steam and consoles, my options are to roll my own user registration, user search, friend list, request/approval for said friend list, all of the UI that goes with it, some place in database to store all of the information and then a facility to report potential abuses and give users ability to manage and delete their accounts (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGDPR\u003C/a\u003E!)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr I can just hook into Steam/Sony/Microsoft API and have you play with anyone you have as a friend on that platform, including built-in ability to send chat messages to invite said friend to a game. Yes, each platform has a slightly different API with slightly different limitations, which means some of this you\u0027ll have to implement in triplicate (or more), but this is usually implemented through a thin wrapper, meaning UI and game logic is only implemented once, so you still end up with an order of magnitude less work than building your own system from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd because a lot of games are taking that latter approach, they are inherently locked out from cross-play, not because there is a platform incompatibility, but because you just don\u0027t have facilities to invite players from other platforms into a game. Of course, this is something that can be expanded after the release. And at least with Steam/Windows you have an option of adding Windows Live API to have access to your friends on XBox. So there are definitely ways to work around it. But it might not be something you have out of the box on any given project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
