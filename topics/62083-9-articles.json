Not even on reliability! The only way you can get to know how it will perform on orbit is to take it there and try it out. for example, the other day I wasted two hours of my life building a ship around an engine that had upwards of 80% reliability on the ground, only to find I got less than 5% on orbit. You could say it gets frustrating, so perhaps you want to use one of the ones here that actually work. I hear great things about the JD-D on orbital setting... mine don\u0027t go over 40% yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, the orbital setting is a function of speed, in that frame of reference (or in other words, orbital velocity on that SOI), not of altitude or anything like it. Over 700m/s, and the drive will give out a fixed set of G\u0027s. Under 700m/s, and the drive will instantly decelerate (or accelerate) to around 5m/s. You can imagine suddenly trying to decelerate to 5m/s when you are going 696m/s usually ends in explosions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E (That\u0027s the issue on Munar orbit, BTW, you usually get there going slow).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
