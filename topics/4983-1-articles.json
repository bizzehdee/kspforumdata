While below the boiling point a liquid evaporates from its surface, at the boiling point vapor bubbles come from the bulk of the liquid. For this to be possible, the vapor pressure must be sufficiently high to win the atmospheric pressure, so that the bubbles can be \u0027inflated\u0027. Thus, the difference between evaporation and boiling is \u0027mechanical\u0027, rather than thermodynamical. The boiling point is lowered when the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere is reduced, for example by the use of a vacuum pump or at high altitudes. Boiling occurs in three characteristic stages, which are nucleate, transition and film boiling. These stages generally take place from low to high heating surface temperatures, respectively.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its boiling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-01T00:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ping111\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ping111\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmm, you do realize your blood isn\\\u0027t boiling, right?
