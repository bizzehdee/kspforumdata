We had 90% of the sun obscured. Our lecturer decided to let us out of our chemistry session about 15 minutes early to go and look at it, and we were all just looking out the windows before then watching things get dimmer. The university square was pretty busy, needless to say, and there were a couple of folks on top of what I believe is the Maths building who probably had the best view, but the view that my friends and I had was just fine.\n\n[![rN9sKnfl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/rN9sKnfl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/rN9sKnf)\n\nI\u0027m surprised my phone camera got as good a picture as it did. Roughly 9:30am and the clouds were just right (*somehow* the UK got clouds *right* for once) to allow us to look directly at it for a few seconds at a time and take pictures. Risky business, looking directly at it, but as I said, I avoided angering the Sun God by only looking for a second or two when the clouds enabled it.\n\n9/10 Would nearly scorch my retinas and listen to one of my friend\u0027s minds being blown again ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"The Czosnex","CreatedById":38038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T13:04:29Z","Content":"An image from pinhole projector made from two pieces of paper by my brother.\n\nNot that spectacular, but still it\u0027s something ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n![iTbA9an.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iTbA9an.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T13:13:31Z","Content":"For once I had something worth getting up early for!

Also our eyes are excellent at adapting to different light levels. Indoor lighting might be around 50-100 lux, whereas full sunlight could be 50-100 *thousand* lux. So even with sunlight reduced to 10% of normal it\u0027s still not a big difference in the grand scheme of things."},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T13:19:40Z","Content":"That\u0027s the most it got here in germany, perfectly clear sky today:\n\n![KtF8U6A.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KtF8U6A.jpg)\n\ngot a nice view through welding goggles ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nthe twilight was quite fascinating, felt like wearing sunglasses..."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T13:35:15Z","Content":"Nice pics, guys.
