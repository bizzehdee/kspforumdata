One problem: I\u0027m not sure if my relay system will work, after reviewing some parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the probe \u0022mothership\u0022 of sorts, I have a communitron 88-88, which can get signal back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E without a hitch. BUT on my 4 smaller probes, I have smaller antennas that I was going to use to relay to the mothership probe, and then back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. However, I have noticed that the communitron 88-88 is a \u0022Direct\u0022 antenna rather than a \u0022Relay\u0022 antenna as some of the other dishes are. Does this mean that I won\u0027t be able to relay using the antenna? Or can I still establish a connection?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-04T06:01:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re correct. \u00A0The 88-88 can only talk back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E; it cannot talk to other spacecraft. \u00A0Also note that even if you had a small relay antenna onboard to talk to the probes, the 88-88 would still be no help in getting their signal back to Kerbin. \u00A0To do anything involving relayed signals, you\u0027ll need a relay antenna like the RA-100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-07T16:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222944281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221486188093\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165625\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aegolius13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4.02.2017 at 7:01 AM, Aegolius13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0To do anything involving relayed signals, you\u0027ll need a relay antenna like the RA-100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut having a pilot and one of the advanced probe cores (RGU) or two pilots and a Mk1-2 cockpit on your \u0022mothership\u0022 would allow you to control these satellites from it - using the small relay antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
