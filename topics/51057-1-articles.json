The trick with Minmus is that it\u0027s not in the same orbital plane as Kerbin and M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, so you will need to do some normal/anti-normal maneuvering to get there. You can treat it like you would an interplanetary flight - first burn to get out to its orbit, followed by a correction burn and the ascending/descending node to adjust your plane and make any final other burns you need. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat specifically are you having issues with?
