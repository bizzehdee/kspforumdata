My last large design was a Duna colony ship. Once in Duna orbit it drops 4 different unmanned landers and 2 identical manned ones. Each of those landers used 4-6 action groups. The 2 manned ones each used 6. The mothership initially used 8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverlapping all the landers worked, but the mothership AGs had to be unique since the landers would be docked to it.
