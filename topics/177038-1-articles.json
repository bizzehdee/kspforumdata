I\u0027d seriously consider burning to intercept the higher\u00A0node and then then trying to work for an encounter there on the next orbit.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the look of your intercept, I think you\u0027re burning a bit much; you\u0027re on a fast intercept\u00A0rather than a minimum-fuel transfer.\u00A0\u00A0I can tell because your departure from Eve and arrival at Moho are fewer than 180 degrees apart.\u00A0 Consider leaving earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso consider gravity assists:\u00A0 Moho doesn\u0027t have much gravity, but it doesn\u0027t have an atmosphere either, so you can squeeze the most out of Moho\u0027s gravity well both from a close assist and from the Oberth effect if you treat it something like a combination of periapsis kick burns and phased orbits.\u00A0 What I mean by that is that once you have an encounter, correct it to get a braking assist and then, once you\u0027re there, burn at your Moho periapsis not to capture on the first pass, but simply to reduce\u00A0your solar orbit some low-value rational multiple of Moho\u0027s orbital period, such as 3/2.\u00A0 Correct the encounter to get a close pass again, and keep repeating until you capture.\u00A0 In infinite time, you can do this entirely with correction burns until you need to actually capture, but I\u0027ll assume that you don\u0027t have infinite time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re on year 1, day 312 or thereabouts, correct?\u00A0 That is a window, but it\u0027s not the best one you have available.\u00A0 If you\u0027re willing to wait most of a year, there\u0027s a window that opens on year 2, day 250 that can get you to Moho for only 3,099 m/s.\u00A0 You need something on the order of 870 m/s to land on Moho, so if you have 3,438 on your vessel and\u00A0can strain\u00A0200 more from careful fuel management, then that leaves you only approximately 330\u00A0m/s short of a landing.\u00A0 You\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be able to take that off of the 3,099 m/s transfer burn if you\u0027re willing to use multiple passes and assists to get the most out of Moho\u0027s meagre gravity well, but taking ten percent off of a minimum-fuel transfer is asking rather a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d suggest landing on a high plateau, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.:\u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/67400-lowest-delta-v-to-moho/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EHave a look at this.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 The challenge is so old that you absolutely should not trust any of the numbers depicted, but the flights demonstrate a lot of the principles that I described.\u00A0 Maybe something there will give you an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-25T21:55:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2018 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomek1ni","CreatedById":190743,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-27T17:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for that extensive answer.
