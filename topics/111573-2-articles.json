Every few seconds the game would slow then go back to normal. Happened in space, landed, mun, etc. Copied it over to my test install and loaded it up to place a ship in orbit and cancel contracts so I could remove mods to find the bug. First contracts in the list when I hit f12 was the field science ones. Hit cancel and the stutter went away.\n\u003E Tested it by adding contracts and only field science has this problem. I have 5 other contract packs which don\u0027t have this.\n\nSomewhat of a known issue when generating field research contracts, but raised [[#225](https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/issues/225)] to see about addressing it. Part of the problem is the way KSP can generate contracts at any time (and cannot be done in the background), the other part being that some of the queries for getting science stuff are really really nasty. I\u0027ve got a few ideas on things I can do to improve it, so I should be able to get the stuttering down at least a little bit in 1.3.0."}]}
