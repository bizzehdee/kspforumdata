Where it says \u0022name = B9_Engine_L2_Atlas\u0022, change the part name to anything OTHER than \u0027B9_Engine_L2_Atlas\u0027. For myself (yes, I decided to do this for myself too, it\u0027s a good idea, I\u0027ve been needing a decent low-profile small engine. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ), I decided to call it \u0027B9_Engine_L1_MiniAtlas\u0027. As long as it\u0027s different from the original in some way, and of course as long as it isn\u0027t the same as any other part you have in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Now, under \u0027// --- editor parameters ---\u0027, change the title of the part to how you want it to appear in the game. Again, for myself, I used \u0027L1 Mini-Atlas Low-Profile Engine\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it. Well, the above are the 3 things you HAVE TO CHANGE, in order for the game to recognize this as a new part, and for it to show up in the game and actually be a new part. I also recommend changing the mass, thrust and other parameters to match what you think is appropriate for the smaller engine. Also, just for the sake of immersion, you should probably change the text of the description too, but that\u0027s just for looks, if that matters to you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this will help you to get the part you want, and also give you some information to make changes to other parts that you feel the need to have. As always, whatever you mess with in the config files is up to you, so be careful what you actually change, and I highly recommend keeping a backup of the original file somewhere safe in case something gets borked when you make the changes, that way you always have the original to fall back on. As soon as you know your changes/additions are good to go, you can get rid of the backup, but it\u0027s a nice safety net to have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I could have just posted a file of config text for you to copy, but I believe in the old proverb: \u0022Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
