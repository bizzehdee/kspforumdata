New to the forums, been playing KSP off and on for a couple months now. About me: I am an engineer and a nerd to the core. I live by the principle of double-overage, and it shows in most everything I do. As such, I am already hitting major lag problems with my stations and I haven\u0027t even left Kerbin SOI yet. KSP must not be multi-threaded yet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, I have come seeking parts and information. For parts, I remember seeing a short clip in some video of fold-out tent looking things for a Munbase. I have spent some time on Google, Spaceport, and the forums looking for a part pack, but no luck yet. Maybe they are now obsolete parts from a prior release? Or have I just been using the wrong search terms?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe information I seek relates to the topography of Mun. I have sent a few RCS hoppers to do some surveying, but have been having trouble finding a sufficiently large and flat area for a good Munbase. Is there by chance a compiled list of large (1\u002Bsq. km) flat areas near the equator? Or perhaps a topographical map representing relative grade rather than absolute hight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeace,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAndy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T05:56:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EKSP must not be multi-threaded yet? \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003ENope, it is not. \u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t really find a landing area using maps, because variations small enough to ruin the site are too small to show up on them.
