So, at launch, an engine is being used at 100%, lets say. Once I engage the stage, I would love for the limit to engage as well rather than having to right click and change myself constantly, especially since there are multiple engines involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I don\u0027t want a shuttle mod. If I wanted that, I would just ask someone to come play the game for me. The fun is in it doing it yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
