It\u0027s a very different challenge to design a lander that contains all of the stock equipment than it is to design one that contains all of the stock equipment plus all that DMagic provides (I\u0027m not referencing other mods here because I\u0027m not sure if there are any other allowed ones that add in science equipment). DMagic also has some very large pieces of equipment for orbital science that (and I can speak from experience here) are very much a pain to attach to a vehicle other than a dedicated science satellite. The option for modded science gathering attempts might also make rovers more worthwhile, since there\u0027s so much added benefit to a half-hour drive to the next biome."},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T22:14:44Z","Content":"[@sdj64](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100819-sdj64/)  Could you double check my [modlist](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/148872-onward-to-jool-a-jool-5-challenge-log/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2798199)?
