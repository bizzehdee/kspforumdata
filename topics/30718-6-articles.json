Although if this is the less punchy one, it\u0027s probably just as well that we\u0027re not on the RT5 tonight.\u0022\u00A0He chuckled. \u201CYou know a town has got a good case of space fever, when the local bars start naming drinks after rocket engines.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher raised his eyebrows. \u201CIf they\u0027re naming the \u003Cem\u003Ebeers\u003C/em\u003E after rocket engines, remind me not to try any of the spirits for a while!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob was carefully piling squares of jerky on top of a particularly large djan chip. He popped the assembled snack into his mouth and a look of bliss spread over his face. \u201CI don\u0027t know what old Jorfurt \u003Cem\u003Eputs\u003C/em\u003E in that spice dusting he uses but he still does the best \u003Cem\u003Edjans \u003C/em\u003Earound.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside him Lucan was happily crunching away on a handful of peppers. \u201CYup - and you should give these a try too, Bob. Sweet as any I\u0027ve tasted for a long time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill sighed as he stretched luxuriantly and took another sip of citrus wine. The liquid fizzed slightly as it washed against the chilled rim of the glass. Intrigued he canted the glass towards the fire and swirled it round, watching as the bubbles sparkled and scattered soft orange firelight through his drink.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce everyone had had a chance to fortify themselves, Jeb tapped his mug on the table for attention. \u201CRight, guys, I think we all know what this meeting is about, so lets make a start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney swallowed a mouthful of chips. \u201CThe Probodyne Prizes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly. Whoever they are and whatever they are, the Probodyne Foundation appear to be spaceflight enthusiasts. So much so in fact that they are putting up some substantial prize money for two rather challenging flights. No apparent restrictions on who can compete but it\u0027s winner takes all. The first person or organisation to carry out the flight gets the money.\u0022 Jeb took another sip of beer. \u201CFlight 1 is a long duration orbital mission. Four kerbals in orbit for four weeks in one contiguous vessel.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe cocked an eyebrow at the others. \u201CThe rules don\u0027t say anything about bringing those lucky kerbals home again but speaking personally, I think we should see that as part of the challenge. Flight 2 is \u0027simply\u0027 to send pictures of the far side of the M\u00FCn back to Kerbin. Probodyne didn\u0027t say anything about how this was meant to be done but KBS have announced that competitors can use their facilities to receive the images from the spacecraft and re-broadcast them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher crunched thoughfully on a pepper. \u201CThat\u0027s an easy decision really, Jeb. M\u00FCn first and then we maybe have a go at the orbital mission later, if nobody else has claimed that prize by then. At a pinch we could do two kerbals in orbit for four weeks by extending the Moho 5 / Moho 6 flight from rendezvous and station keeping to rendezvous and docking. I wouldn\u0027t much fancy sitting in a Moho capsule for four weeks - or being on the ground crew that \u003Cem\u003Eopened\u003C/em\u003E that capsule after four weeks - but it could be done. Four kerbals though is not something we can realistically pull off with Moho hardware.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u201CCamrie and I have some very preliminary plans for a three kerbal orbital capsule that \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E do the job but it\u0027s not something that we\u0027re going to have the resources to build for quite a while. Plus, the capsule alone is a lot heavier than a Moho, let alone the service and propulsion module that we were thinking of. It\u0027s going to take something a lot bigger than a Moho booster to get the whole ship into orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked intrigued. \u201CI\u0027d like to see those plans when you have a spare moment, Genie. In the meantime - I\u0027m thinking that the M\u00FCn is looking like our best bet too. Anyone else have anything to add?\u0022 He glanced around the table but nobody else spoke up. \u201CRight then - the M\u00FCn it is. So the next questions are how do we get there and what hardware do we need to do it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan reached for another piece of jerky. \u201COnce we get to Kerbin orbit we basically need two burns to get to the M\u00FCn. One long one to put the probe - at least I assume we\u0027re going for a probe - into a transfer orbit with a high enough apoapsis for a Munar encounter and then one shorter one to decelerate into Munar orbit. We should leave enough fuel for correction burns along the way but I don\u0027t think we should worry about our orbital inclination at the M\u00FCn. Unless we somehow manage to wind up in a polar orbit, we should get some good pictures of the far side whatever we do. If we\u0027re broadcasting the data rather than using film return like we did with the Kerbin 2, we don\u0027t have to worry about getting the probe back again either. Lucan looked at Wernher. \u201CLeaving the probe in Munar orbit saves a lot of fuel and gives us much more margin for error with the trajectory calculations.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAgreed,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher. \u201CAs far as hardware goes, I think we have most of what we need already. We can use the same probe chassis that we used for the Kerbin 2, although we\u0027ll need to figure out a proper guidance system for it this time. We don\u0027t need the heatshield so that will save us some weight but we\u0027re going to need a proper electricity supply.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney sat up. \u201CI think we\u0027ve got an old solar charger somewhere on the shelves, Wernher,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cwe could probably strip the panels out of that and fit them to the probe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPerfect.\u0022\u00A0Wernher said. \u201CWe should include one battery to smooth out the current supply a bit but solar panels should be a lot lighter than an entire flights worth of batteries. Then, if the propulsion module we built for the Kerbin 2 will do for braking into Munar orbit, the only other thing we need is a third stage for the Moho booster, to launch the probe out of Kerbin orbit. If two stages plus lateral boosters are enough to put a capsule into orbit, they should be enough to put a small probe plus boost stage there too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ll have to check the delta-v budget,\u0022\u00A0Lucan said,\u00A0\u201Cbut off the top of my head, I think we might need to build a stretched version of the Moho booster to give us more fuel in the second stage. I\u0027m fairly sure the Kerbin 2 propulsion module has enough delta-v for Munar capture, although I can\u0027t guarantee there\u0027ll be much left for fiddling around with whatever orbit the probe ends up in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that moment, there was a knock on the door and Jorfurt came in with a tray to gather up all the empty glasses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCan I get you boys anything else?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo more cider thanks, Jorfurt,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher,\u00A0\u201Cbut a sapwood would go down nicely. Water not milk please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stifled a belch. \u201CSapwood for me too please, Jorfurt. Big day of testing tomorrow, so I\u0027d better have a reasonably clear head in the morning. Which is a pity because otherwise I\u0027d be asking to try the RT5 about now! That reminds me though - when would be a good time to bring those souvenirs over for the main bar?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh any time you like Jeb,\u0022\u00A0said Jorfurt comfortably. \u201CCouple of hours before opening time would be good, so I can get them installed before the evening starts but other than that, whenever works for you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ll see what I can do. Milk in my sapwood please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob, Lucan and Geneney all ordered sapwood juice too. Bill gave one forlorn look at his empty citrus wine glass, sighed and ordered a glass of water. Jorfurt chuckled. \u201CI\u0027ll take that as a good opinion of my citrus wine then, Mr Bill?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill smiled. \u201CVery much so, Jorfurt. I know what I\u0027ll be ordering next time but I\u0027ll need a clear head tomorrow as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJorfurt bustled out and returned a few minutes later with fresh glasses, a half bottle of sapwood syrup and pitchers of milk and water. He discreetly handed Jeb a small slip of paper before nodding to everyone and backing out of the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney looked at Jeb curiously. \u201CSouvenirs?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned. \u201CYou remember those Trashcan casings we fished out of the sea?\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CI\u0027ve cleaned them up a bit, stenciled our logo on the side and welded some legs onto them so they\u0027re not just balancing on the the exhaust nozzle. Left enough rust on them to make them look genuine though - I thought they\u0027d make a nice set of bar tables for Jorfurt.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney looked slightly relieved. \u201COh those. Good idea, Jeb - they weren\u0027t any good for re-purposing anyway.\u0022\u00A0He poured a splash of syrup into his glass and topped it up with milk. \u0022Back to the M\u00FCn probe then. If we have a plan for the hardware, I guess the last question is when? When do we try the first launch?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked thoughtful. \u201CMohos 2 and 3 are about finished,\u0022\u00A0he said,\u00A0\u201Cand the Booth Crew reckon that Camrie is almost ready to fly. Wilford is about checked out on the capsule systems and starting to pick up on simulator time when Camrie isn\u0027t in there. There\u0027s certainly no point in keeping her waiting and I\u0027d prefer not to disrupt Wilford\u0027s flight either if we can help it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u201CWe should also get some good data on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system and 905 engine performance from their flights, which may help Lucan when he\u0027s planning for the M\u00FCn flight. If nothing else we could use some good delta-v checks to see if the probe propulsion module will actually work for Munar capture.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Moho 4 is only half finished,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher. \u201CWe could easily reschedule construction to build a stretched upper stage if Lucan thinks we\u0027ll need it and repurpose the current upper stage as the Munar boost stage. Plus Bill, Neling and Edsen will need some time to build and test the probe, not to mention its guidance system. That\u0027s going to be the tricky part and we can\u0027t launch without it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAdelan is going to be disappointed,\u0022 said Bob quietly, \u201CShe\u0027ll understand why we\u0027re postponing her flight but she won\u0027t like it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know,\u0022\u00A0said Jeb unhappily, \u201Cbut we can\u0027t really afford to wait until the Moho flights are finished. I think we\u0027ve got a lead at the moment but Rockomax will be working hard on the Probodyne Prizes too and they could be working on their own Munar probe as we speak.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan took a sip of watered sapwood. \u201CActually, it might take them longer than you think to put that together,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CI think I\u0027ve finally worked out what their launch pad systems are all about.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone put down their glasses and gave Lucan their full attention as he continued. \u201CIt took some time - and a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of replaying that video of their last launch but if you look very carefully, those gantry arms are holding the booster down at a slight angle. You can see it dip slightly at lift off too before it builds up enough speed. Last but not least, that thing went straight off the pad. Nice ballistic trajectory - \u003Cem\u003Ewith no obvious deviations after launch!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher got there first. \u0022So the booster is just aimed off the pad, with no active guidance system in flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly!\u0022\u00A0said Lucan. \u201CIt has fins on the bottom of course for stabilisation but as far as I could see those were fixed. I didn\u0027t see any steering capability to speak of. They managed to put that satellite of theirs into a pretty circular orbit, so they\u0027re either doing something very clever with the thrust from their solid motors, or they\u0027ve got some small liquid fueled engines as well to neaten up their orbital insertion. But I\u0027d be surprised if their guidance and control systems are good enough to get to the M\u00FCn yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded firmly. \u201CI think that decides it then, guys. It\u0027s still a bit of a gamble but we launch Mohos 2 and 3 and then put Moho 4 on hold and use the next couple of boosters to try for the M\u00FCn! I\u0027ll speak to Adelan myself - and I\u0027ll have a think about pepping up her flight a bit. What was the original plan for Moho 4?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney frowned. \u201CBasically just a progression flight from Moho 3. Moho 2 is going to be a simple up, round and down flight to test the updated systems. Moho 3 was going to be a test run of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E for orbital maneuvers and Moho 4 was going to be a longer duration Moho 3, with some Kerbin observation experiments thrown in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb tapped his fingers on the table. \u201CHmmm OK. I\u0027ll have a think about that and see what I can come up with.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=605319\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 13\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=627145\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 15\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-12T20:18:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2019 08:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JakeGrey","CreatedById":61242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T10:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, hell yes!

Actually, from reading those websites, I think Lucan was getting a little carried away - Rockomax would need \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E kind of steering to get into orbit but then again, he was extrapolating from a relatively short video clip \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JakeGrey","CreatedById":61242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T21:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI took it to mean they\u0027d come up with reaction wheels while the KIS had skipped directly to thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T18:16:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t want to dig too deeply into this right now because of possible spoilers but it was good to sort some things out in my head.
