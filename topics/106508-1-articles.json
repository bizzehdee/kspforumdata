Real space programs do this for weight reasons, KSP does it for performance reasons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour contract sounds reasonable, but you\u0027ve put about 150 extra parts in there that weren\u0027t asked for ^^; Unfortunately KSP is often a balance of part count vs the look you actually want. Some players accept 2 fps and magnificent creations, some (like myself) keep everything below 80 parts and have a green clock all the way.
