But... is it the only way for life? Most of us most likely heard about a theory, that somewhere in the univerese there could be life, but not like our carbon based life, life that is a bit different... Where the element of life is \u003Cstrong\u003Esilicon\u003C/strong\u003E. What do you think about it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally think, that it could be trueI. f we look at the table of elements we can see, that silicon is right below carbon, it has four valence electrons, which means, that it can create four bonds. The simplest of organic compounds are hydrocarbons and the simplest of them is methane, but silicon can form very, very simlar compounds, ok almost identical and they are called hydrosilicons...

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.[6] Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \u0022monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\u0022.[6] This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger mass and atomic radius, and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double bonded carbon is part of the carbonyl group, a fundamental motif of bio-organic chemistry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Finally, of the varieties of molecules identified in the interstellar medium as of 1998, 84 are based on carbon while only 8 are based on silicon.[8] Moreover, of those 8 compounds, four also include carbon within them. The cosmic abundance of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation upon which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, even though Earth and other terrestrial planets are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in the Earth\u0027s crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon, may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bartekkru99","CreatedById":76625,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T19:21:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I\u0027ve just started with biochemistry at school, so some things will not be so obvious for me for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T19:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamnit...

Perhaps mechanical life-forms could exist that use silicon \u0022brains\u0022, but I doubt that too, mostly because I think we\u0027ll eventually find that silicon microfabrication is not the best material and method for building logic circuits. You also need a massive set of infrastructure to produce one silicon IC. Our brains are several thousands of times faster than a desktop computer (in terms of equivalent processing power) and something like a million times more efficient.

Carbon readily makes double and triple bonds, allowing for a very rich chemistry. Silicon... not so much. Sure, you can find molecules such as Si2H4 and Si2H2. But the bonding scheme is very different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we take C2H4 and tear the double bond apart. We end up with two fragments CH2, sp2 hybridized, with one electron in the free sp2 and one electron in the pz. This is the electronic ground state of the fragment. Let\u0027s go to silicon and do the same. For simplicity, we\u0027ll assume the fragment is also in a sp2 hybridization. What you will obtain is 2 electrons paired in the free sp orbital. So what do we need to make a carbon style double bond? First we need to unpair the two electrons and place them in both orbitals and bring two fragments together. Problem is, the cost of unpairing the electrons in two fragments is higher than the energy released by forming the bond. What really happens is that the two filled orbitals will overlap with the two empty orbitals and form what is known as dipolar or dative covalent bonds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, silicon is just below carbon in the periodic table, but a chemistry based on silicon would definitely lack some of the versatility that carbon based chemistry can bring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
