I\u0027ve found that, while the LV-T engines work fine, they\u0027re a little underpowered at sea-level and not good for lifting a lot, so there is room for lifter engines there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a while since I took any classes on the subject, but if I remember correctly, ISP scaling (as altitude changes) is heavily dependent on engine bell shape, making the ISP highest at the \u0022design\u0022 altitude for the engine. So, would it make sense to have the multi-bell engines have peak ISP at sealevel, and have it drop from there?
