The isShielded function takes the direction of travel as its sole parameter. It checks first to see if the part is a stock parachute and is in any state of deployment. If both of those are true it is automatically unshielded and subject to thermal effects. It is then checked to see if it is a RealChute parachute and in any state of deployment. As above, if deployed it is unshielded. (IMO, a better solution might be to simulate chute failure by putting it in CUT state, assuming that\u0027s possible, which it might not be)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s not any kind of deployed chute then a ray is cast from the part\u0027s transform (the part of it that designates its origin) in the direction of travel. If the ray hits something in its path then the part the part is treated as shielded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we\u0027re talking about undeployed chutes (they are undeployed right?) then that means the chutes are failing the raycast test. The ray is striking nothing in its path so the chutes are unshielded. Being higher up the cone shaped capsule would definitely decrease the likelihood of hitting any part of the cone. And it also depends on exactly where the transform of the part is. If it\u0027s closer to the attachment side of the part then that increases the chance that the ray hits the capsule. If it\u0027s further away, closer to the end that\u0027s sticking out, then that increases the chance of a miss. I specify the capsule here because there\u0027s really nothing else it might hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might increase the odds of survival if you don\u0027t orient the capsule at an angle. The chute part\u0027s direction of travel would then be much more likely to strike either the capsule, or maybe the battery below, depending on where its transform is. (hypothetically, it could be so close to the capsule that when attached, the chute\u0027s origin is inside the capsule, in which case it might hit nothing at all. Hypothetically)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW if you are using the latest version of RealChutes then you want the very latest version of DeadlyReentry.
