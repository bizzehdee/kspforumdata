It makes no sense when people are using equations to determine the rocket equation for example to not have the unit that fuel comes in be obvious to the user. In a similar way, EC usage needs either a mod or a spreadsheet just to know if your craft will have enough or not.

convert ECs into something that behaves more like electricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real problem is really that ECs are treated in a manner similar to physical finite units such as the

valid point that there is \u0027fade\u0027 as power sources run down.\u00A0 If you treat a battery like a water tower, then as the water in the tower runs out, pressure is reduced, reducing current.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBringing EC up to a minimum standard to gauge electric power would likely require a little thought to keeping it simple enough for kids to work with, but realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hard part really comes from the crossplay of (V/IR)\u00A0and (P/IV).\u00A0 The problem is that in most domestic environments, the \u0027starting point\u0027 is defined by existing standards.\u00A0 We pay attention to voltage.\u00A0 That is to say, we pay attention to things like \u0027volts\u0027 on a 9-volt battery.\u00A0 Not how many joules it has stored, or amps the wiring it\u0027s hooked up to can handle, or how much resistance the\u00A0whole circuit has, or how much it will bleed off energy as it operates. \u00A0Thus, the problem is that for most casual people and those not educated in EE, there is a distinct lack of realization at how electricity isn\u0027t just a supply and an amount, but reliant on the \u0027shape of the pipe\u0027 to tell you how much is going to flow, how much energy will be delivered, and how long it will last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to bring that up to at least a certain level of slightly more electrical realism, a system will have to be created \u0027under the hood\u0027 that makes a mess of logical\u00A0assumptions to dumb it down enough for it not to drown kids.\u00A0 And that\u0027s... surprisingly easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest\u00A0assumption is\u00A0to assume that the electrical engineering side of things never sees the light of day.\u00A0 If you can do that, you can simplify the power system down to critical aspects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: Total energy in a source (battery/generator/solar panel*)\u00A0 to have a unit assigned after hashing it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2:\u00A0Maximum energy that can be delivered by a source per second (or game tick when you\u0027re mathing it under the hood).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: Driving voltage sources provide per source\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4: energy a device consumes per second while functional\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5: driving voltage a device needs to be considered functional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDriving voltage is the easiest to work with.\u00A0 If the total driving voltage of all sources onboard is greater than the driving voltage required to operate devices, they run.\u00A0 If it is below the requirement, they stop running.\u00A0 The end.\u00A0 ALL digital electronics work this way as that is how diodes and transistors operate.\u00A0 This is then\u00A0slightly complicated by the fact that all voltage sources are evaluated as a whole, while all voltage consumers are evaluated individually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, a rocket with two 12 volt batteries holds 24 volts (assuming batteries wired\u00A0in series, but the\u00A0EE itself is hidden), while it contains four consumer devices; two requiring 5\u00A0volts to operate, one that requires 9 volts, and one that requires 12 volts.\u00A0 As the batteries run down their power curves, the 12 volt consumer stops working first. Then things continue on normally until the voltage drops below 9, then the 9 volt consumer dies.\u00A0 And so on until the 5 volts run out, then those consumers die.\u00A0 Note, that once the 5 volt consumers are down, there is still power in the batteries, but not enough voltage.\u00A0 You could get away with setting up specialty items like \u0027tracking beacons\u0027 or other \u0027emergency low power devices\u0027 to take advantage of things like this.\u00A0 But I digress.**\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interplay of the maximum energy that can be delivered by a source per second and voltage are next, and can also work on certain assumptions.\u00A0 When looking at (V/IR), you can make V and I equal by equation I=V/R and setting R to 1.\u00A0 If resistance is 1, then current IS voltage.\u00A0 Once you\u0027ve done this, the equation becomes simply \u0022I-squared-R\u0022 to get power in Watts [SEE: (P/IV) converted to P=IV]\u00A0.\u00A0 If we\u0027re assuming R is \u00271\u0027 forever, then the equation for power is \u0027I-squared\u0027.\u00A0 Or \u0022V-Squared\u0022...\u00A0 Because with R set to 1, again, V \u003Cem\u003EIS \u003C/em\u003EI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of this, you run into an interesting situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour deliverable power is a square of the total onboard\u00A0battery voltage values.\u00A0 1, twelve volt battery is 144 watts.\u00A0 2, is 576 watts. 3 is\u00A01,296 watts... etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this manner,\u00A0the player is actually required to consider \u00A0not so much for long power supplies, but for \u0027burst\u0027 power from high-end consumers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, the only point left to consider is what the value of stored energy in a battery is and its relationship to consumers.\u00A0 It\u0027s easy enough to assign a battery a maximum and minimum \u0027rate\u0027 based on its total stored energy, and that can be anything the programmer wants it to be with the only consequence really being how close to real-life storage and consumption values it is, and how many fires get started from the virtual amps that get pumped through invisible wires.\u00A0 The behavior is pretty close to the same.\u00A0 From here, it becomes a task to find the balance for how many discrete units of power each battery holds and how many discrete units of power a particular devices consumes per second or per tick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Solar Panels have no finite energy like a battery, but will have a driving voltage/deliverable energy per unit time value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n**Another point with the voltage involves analogue equipment like motors, which will operate into the dirt without a discrete switching voltage, but at ever reducing rates as power runs down to zero.\u00A0 Might we worth considering for reaction wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-22T01:13:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou

If we solve for energy: 1 EC = 1 kWs (kilowatt-second), or 1 kJ. Pretty simple. But what about real world electric charge in Coulombs or milli-ampere-hours? Luckily, a quick search turned up a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://justjoules.org/conversions.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esimple table\u003C/a\u003E to convert energy in J to various values based on current, voltage and power. 1000 J is about 0.27 AVh (ampere-volt-hour) or exactly 1000 AVs (ampere-volt-second) but we can\u0027t solve for current or charge without knowing what voltage standard KSP devices use. Maybe we can guess though; a Z-100 battery pack\u0027s description is \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Z-100_Rechargeable_Battery_Pack\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etwo AAAA batteries\u003C/a\u003E,\u0022 which would be three volts DC in series in real life. A Z-100 pack would then contain 100 kAVs / 3 V = 33.3 kilo-ampere-seconds or about 9.25 ampere-hours, or about 9259 milli-ampere-hours (mAh). By comparison, a real Li-ion AAA (not AAAA) battery holds about 400 mAh, or a pair of them 800 mAh. That makes the KSP batteries hold over ten times the charge while being smaller!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can assume all KSP electronics use the same voltage value or they wouldn\u0027t work together, and I think we can assume direct current; even engines with alternators are generating DC charge as this is what \u0027alternators\u0027 do as opposed to \u0027generators.\u0027 Since KSP batteries are rechargeable, we can assume an improved chemistry is in use, in that charging and discharging are essentially perfect. Like a perfected lithium-ion chemistry. And since the smallest battery pack is \u0022two AAAA batteries,\u0022 we could assume all KSP devices use 3 V as their standard, like Year 2000-era desktop PCs and many modern low power devices. They\u0027d also be tolerant of really high currents and probably have superconductor-like properties to avoid I\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003ER losses to heat.

We need enough energy to send 800 science datas at a time so we need to hold 1600 electric charges.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you feel all smart as you approve the extra batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is so me lol.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-22T19:35:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223225162\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167762\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511318924\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157121\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gordon Fecyk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Gordon Fecyk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the more reason to treat EC as a measure of energy and not of electricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t that pretty much what I was saying?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-22T20:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t just \u0022make electricity make sense\u0022, quit\u00A0trying to control her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe\u0027s a woman;\u00A0a strong, independent woman with wants and needs....and you aren\u0027t man enough to satisfy her!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
