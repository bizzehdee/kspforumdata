I would say make it a requirement for entry level work for people going into engineering. I mean an engineer(the namesake of the profession) actually being a requirement for the job... Although it would probably just lead a bunch of people to flood engineering to get the jobs. I\u0027m surprised it pays so much also. 60k a year with only a high school diploma and good stamina... I could make a joke about running a train, but it might derail the thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s treated like a truck driver by the looks of it and not an engineering profession. Do they not do repairs or anything. Could they not improve the operation or design of the train if run by professionals... Engineers have higher ethics and would be more suited for this outside of the boredom. Which they are also accustom to. How did we get it so we don\u0027t have actual engineers being engineers... 60k a year would be great for people who want to get an entry level job after college. Get to see the world too. Only downside I could see is if it makes people leave the job more for higher paying work(it might not matter as less experience/training would be needed by engineering graduates making this less of a problem.). Although I have a feeling this work already similarly works this way for other reasons. At least you would have the potential for retention. With that much education running around you could probably expand businesses also. Or are the people running these companies so corrupt and greedy somehow they have to worry about people who understand everything around them being employed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need to stock society with higher education anyway. Why not start with something like this. More engineers running things would not hurt the world. Outside of people who hate educated people and ethics. Which seem to already be in every facet of life already. That would be the only problem if those people resist out of fear of competition or other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think the increase in education amongst drivers at least would help versatility for the companies normal operations. They could teach them to do more repairs and have more safety in case of emergencies potentially. And staffing could be more versatile. Training would take less time and people could swap positions more readily or gain position more quickly if that is already normal. And they could probably apply better training for more advanced tasks. This would only be stopped by the owners getting in the way if they are also not actual engineers. Then you get the same potential problems of software companies being owned by people not as educated as they should be as that is always a hindrance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-13T12:37:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2020 12:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-13T16:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223802223\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221592047868\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arugela\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Arugela said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs NPR a joke sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope, it is\u00A0a news site, although I agree this article is a little awkward.

But what if he had? Well he\u0027d have absolutely demolished everything in his path. US trains, unlike other trains, are built to ridiculous crash standards due to road crossing safety regulations. One of our trains took out a concrete station platform before. That\u0027s how strong these things are. They\u0027re a lot heavier than their European or Asian counterparts, and one of the reasons you don\u0027t see a lot of the super modern foreign rolling stock making its way to the US.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the training: We only required a high school diploma. I came from the airlines with an aeronautical degree but that wasn\u0027t required. There were cognitive tests but it wasn\u0027t like you saw a psychiatrist. You have to remember that our job is a lonely one; I can go hours sitting there by myself looking at rail. After 30 years of being confined to an engine with your thoughts, you can see where some level of insanity might creep up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for technical knowledge: We\u0027re pretty proficient at fixing the train on the go. Our trains can carry several thousand passengers into heavily secluded territories with no access to roads or emergency services, and we have a 3 man crew. We can usually troubleshoot most problems, save for a derail or a dead engine. No one wants to be rescued; It could take hours for them to get maintenance or another train out to you.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for cutting out safety systems; We routinely do this when making up trains / yard work / trouble shooting / etc. Usually the switches that disable safety features are sealed but you can break those seals with the flick of your wrist. I am not 100% positive but I think the onboard computer will apply a penalty brake if you accelerate beyond 65 mph with the speed controls disabled. I say I\u0027m not sure because I know they test sections of the rail at 100 mph, and with the speed control activated it limits you to 81 mph. I haven\u0027t asked how they do that yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo Mike Garrisons point on the US being behind in safety - this is \u003Cstrong\u003Eabsolutely\u003C/strong\u003E true. At my railroad we have \u0022Dark territory\u0022 where you are \u003Cstrong\u003Erequired\u003C/strong\u003E to turn off the speed control before entering, and all curves / switches / speed limits are muscle memory by the Locomotive Engineer. God forbid you fall asleep and enter a 25 mph curve at 65 mph. The trains won\u0027t stop you from doing that. We don\u0027t have any locations in our 750 miles of track where the computer will stop you from passing a stop-signal or hitting the rear of another train or going off the end of the track and into the sea.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask or PM me.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: Oh, I forgot. I was taught by my mentors that the name \u0022Engineer\u0022 (Most laymen just call us Conductors. Big pet peeve of mine) came from the fact that Locomotives use air. The idea was that you were \u0022engineering air\u0022, hence Engineer. Not sure how accurate that is but that\u0027s the legend...
