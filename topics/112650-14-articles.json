I actually am not a big fan of \u0022warp\u0022 mods... Say you sent a probe at a reasonably high velocity out at stockfish speeds... Just how many years would it take to reach the inner and outer systems? Can the game even \u003Cem\u003Ehandle\u003C/em\u003E times that large? I know the standard play method with this type of mod is to just install a warp mod... But what if I WANT a Voyager style probe to fly for decades and decades... Are the distances scaled to be possible in several decades...
