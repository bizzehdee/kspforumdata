Granted some of the things on the thread are kind of outdated, but it will definitely give you a good idea of how to go about modding. I recommend watching a couple of the tutorial videos on how to get a model from Blender to Unity to the game. If you are curious about a specific thing, such as \u0022how to engine\u0022 or \u0022how to solar panel\u0022, check\u00A0the respective sections on those for images, cfg examples and so on. If there are ever something you can\u0027t find the answer to you can always DM a veteran modder or post a question in the addon-dev section of the forum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orion Kerman","CreatedById":171362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-13T17:04:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222828838\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477744253\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166756\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GrzesiekB\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 29/10/2016 at 1:30 PM, GrzesiekB said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello dear KSP Community!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m talking to everyone here on this forum, You are amazing.
