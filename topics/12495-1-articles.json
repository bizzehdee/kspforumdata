A third would be impossible. Anyways, the two dorms can be clearly seen with horizontal solar panels. The Admin was the four engines vertical sitting structure, but instead can consider the comms building; The one using lander parts. Three classrooms would be the two lab buildings with tri vertical solar panels, and what I originally landed as admin, or the comms structure. Lastly, the statue is the cool virus looking building that originally dropped my rover to scout the area. Not wild, but no way to remove anything or land anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"decemberstorm","CreatedById":26995,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T00:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is my partly completed mun base, its only half completed. also is it ok if i use large rovers instead of buildings?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"that1guy","CreatedById":14276,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T03:29:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022decemberstorm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022decemberstorm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my partly completed mun base, its only half completed. also is it ok if i use large rovers instead of buildings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERovers are okay, keep up the good work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T06:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDecember, what is that structural beams pack you are using there?
