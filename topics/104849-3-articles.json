Totally forgot about it until just seeing the trailer for the first time. And I\u0027m like.. wow.. is this going to be the hardest, most realistic space sci/fi ever DONE?!? I know the book is super-hard sci/fi and it almost..almost looks like they are staying true to what I have read about it. Are we seriously slowly entering an age of increasingly realistic space sci/fi?? What is happening???? \n\u003E AHAHHAAHAHAHHHH I don\u0027t believe any of this! I think I\u0027m in a parallel universe. \n\u003E \n\u003E I love the spacecraft, omg. It actually shares a basic design aesthetic with an old Duna cruiser I built forever ago only it looks a thousand times better. \n\u003E \n\u003E Weird seeing actors reappearing from Interstellar. \n\u003E \n\u003E **To those that read the book:** I found a full copy online while searching for info. I feel guilty reading it and haven\u0027t yet for I know the guy self-published and I have way too much respect for that. Was it released free or something? Or did I stumble onto some pirate site? It looks very official, no sketchness.\n\nIts really cheap on Amazon. I would buy if not only for the fact that from now on every copy is going to have Matt Damon\u0027s face on it. So I would pick it up just so you can have a copy from before the movie release. Plus its a book you should have!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAlso how many times have all you guys watched the trailer? The more I watch it I can clearly hear that they edited the sound and video to make it seem like the hermes crew received Watneys message. Its too good of a plot point to not include in the film. What I would like to discuss is, what do we think they will cut from the film? What from the book do we think is going to be cut because of time constraints. From the trailer we see an Atlas Rocket on the launch pad, and a person looking quite upset after that shot and a launchpad in the forgroround, so the first supply mission will be in the film. There is a clip of to chinese people looking completive, so the hermes supply rendezvous is in it. His trip to the pathfinder seems to be in it obviously because that is his first means of communication. Honestly most of it seems to be there. Even the hab exploding looks like it is going to be in there. So honestly I think they might his trip to retrieve the RTG? Yes it is an important plot point and science wise he definitely needs it. What do you guys think? What will they cut? \n\nOne last thing my only complaint is that the hermes is way too luxurious. I was picturing more of a constellation program design but hey how could I really complain about it looking too nice. The gravity ring with the bay windows are not very realistic but I suppose makes for a beautiful shot and scenes so.....whatever!! ITS BEAUTIFUL OK!!! I love it!!\n\nAlso what are the chances they find a way to kill Sean Bean?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T02:40:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sp1989**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tourist","CreatedById":143403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:18:00Z","Content":"\u003E Also what are the chances they find a way to kill Sean Bean?\n\n\u003C\u003C\u003C\u003C\u003C\u003C\u003C\u003C spoiler \u003E\u003E\u003E\u003E\u003E\u003E\u003E\u003E\u003E\n\nI see Watney, safe and sound.

It also looks like it was constructed modularly, so that is good.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Drive section with reactor at the aft - storage for fuel, air, water, stuff in those \u0022balloon tanks\u0022 - more storage for supplies - ring-habitat section - another (probably secondary) support module - technical/sciency/communication stuff - command module/cockpit - weird thingy in front, hm ... emergency: inflatable shelter, aerobraking shield, sun screen for solar storm or maybe transfer vehicle to the Mars Decend Vehicle, seeing no thrusters though ...\n\nThis seems about right.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I was picturing a more classic white space suit, I just doesn\u0027t look bulky enough.\n\n*Interstellar* had the perfect space suit for this kind of movie. Of course, they can\u0027t use the same design twice.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think the timeline differs from ours quite a bit more than them landing on Mars regularly in a few years - either it is set far more in the future than 10-15 years (shame on me, cannot remember a date from the book ... ) or they never stopped at Apollo like we basically did.\n\nI think it is supposed to be set in the late 2030s or early 2040s.
