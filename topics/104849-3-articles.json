Totally forgot about it until just seeing the trailer for the first time. And I\u0027m like.. wow.. is this going to be the hardest, most realistic space sci/fi ever DONE?!? I know the book is super-hard sci/fi and it almost..almost looks like they are staying true to what I have read about it. Are we seriously slowly entering an age of increasingly realistic space sci/fi?? What is happening???? \u003Cp\u003EAHAHHAAHAHAHHHH I don\u0027t believe any of this!

The more I watch it I can clearly hear that they edited the sound and video to make it seem like the hermes crew received Watneys message. Its too good of a plot point to not include in the film. What I would like to discuss is, what do we think they will cut from the film? What from the book do we think is going to be cut because of time constraints. From the trailer we see an Atlas Rocket on the launch pad, and a person looking quite upset after that shot and a launchpad in the forgroround, so the first supply mission will be in the film. There is a clip of to chinese people looking completive, so the hermes supply rendezvous is in it. His trip to the pathfinder seems to be in it obviously because that is his first means of communication. Honestly most of it seems to be there. Even the hab exploding looks like it is going to be in there. So honestly I think they might his trip to retrieve the RTG? Yes it is an important plot point and science wise he definitely needs it. What do you guys think? What will they cut? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing my only complaint is that the hermes is way too luxurious. I was picturing more of a constellation program design but hey how could I really complain about it looking too nice. The gravity ring with the bay windows are not very realistic but I suppose makes for a beautiful shot and scenes so.....whatever!! ITS BEAUTIFUL OK!!!
