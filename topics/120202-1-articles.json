My idea is that there would be small rocks present an the surface of all celestial bodies. These rocks would have spots on them with a cetrain colour, indicating that there is a certain mineral present in said rock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can you do with those rocks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1)You can get contracts asking you to bring back these rocks (for funds, of course), (specific colours, or rocks from a specific biome or just from the body itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)You could also science these rocks by performing experiments on site or by bringing them back to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience would work per type of rock per biome per planetary body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis prevents the player from entering a biome, doing science and getting out again. Noo, you need to drive around and search for these rocks, you gotta do something for your science and your funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the game these rocks could be seen as normal parts, just like the asteroids (correct me if I\u0027m wrong on that), this would also allow asteroids to have these rocks on them as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally think that this would make it a lot more interesting to launch an unmanned rover mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T21:47:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is an excellent idea and it\u0027s come up at least once before \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80322\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80322\u003C/a\u003E.

Instead, (like what I read on the forum of the dead mod mentioned above) its maybe a good idea to let a kerbal (in his/her right-click menu) shearch his/her suuroundings for rocks, and let that trigger the spawns of rocks.
