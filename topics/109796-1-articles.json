Since they will be returning to Kerbin (hopefully), I figured I could recover the data opposed to transmitting it (crew reports and eva report I\u0027ll transmit for 100% the data).\n\nI was hoping to keep to the main 3 person capsule, (MK II I think), but don\u0027t know how much data it can hold and/or how to store more? \n\nThanks in advance,\n\nNick."},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T11:49:45Z","Content":"Infinite, provided they are of different type/situation"},{"CreatedByName":"mrnicholas","CreatedById":29777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T11:52:33Z","Content":"Excellent, and thanks for the quick response.\n\nSo to makesure I understand you correctly, a materials bay over moho and a materials bay over eve can both be stored?"},{"CreatedByName":"Dilli","CreatedById":142986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T12:02:22Z","Content":"Yes, although a scientist will need to take the data from all experiments and restore the materials bay and goo pods before new reports can be generated. \n\nAlso a Kerbal will need to take the crew report from the pod and then store it in the pod before a new crew report can be made from that pod.\n\nFor example I just did a trip past Eve and landed on Gilly; while areobraking all science experiments were performed in EVE atmosphere, once in space after that all the data was taken from the science parts / crew pod and materials bay and goo pod restored. When on Gilly the science experiments were performed again, taken and stored in the pod. Can be repeated for each biome / situation (flying, landing, low space, high space...)"}]}
