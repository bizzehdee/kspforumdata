Make a vtol or anyhing that can not be entirely stationary, like repulsor craft etc., with Abrams and targeting pod, put it 3km from KSC, zoom in and lock on to watertower, for example, and try hitting it. The turret lags behind the pod a little bit, with jittery movements, making it difficult to hit it.

Since it\u0027s a long lasting effect (not like an instantaneous explosion), it has to be stationary in a certain frame of reference, but there aren\u0027t any frames of reference that make sense. If you\u0027re in orbit and its stationary to the planet, it will fly by you at orbital velocity. If you use the velocity of the target as the frame of reference, then if the target is flying towards you, the explosion will fly towards you. If you use the bomb as the frame of reference, then if you drop the bomb on a planet, the explosion will continue to move below the surface. Etc.
