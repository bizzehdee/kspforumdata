Recently I extended the OX-4L panels while orbiting Kerbin, to do a bit of battery charging,\u00A0before continuing with my next burn. I then discovered I could not retract them? There was no option to retract. Anywho...I loaded what was supposed to be the last \u0022quicksave\u0022 and it was from very far back in my career even though I had the \u0022quicksaving\u0022 message pop up on the game screen at least once during the current flight. I have searched the wiki and these forums for \u0022saving\u0022, \u0022saving game\u0022, etc. but there are over 500 \u0022hits\u0022 on those searches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould some kind soul point me to the information that deals with everything about saving KSP and returning to this save (creating saves, returning to a save, etc.). I am somehow not finding this info. I\u0027m not asking for you to go over the entire thing here as I\u0027m sure the info is somewhere and has probably been posted a gazillion times already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVic the Newbal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T21:44:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 file is updated automatically at various times. It is updated in particular whenever you quickload or load a named save, whenever you switch to a craft that is not within your physics bubble, whenever you go back to the KSC, and at certain milestones during flight (like, for instance, as you\u0027ll have noticed when you are almost in orbit).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce it\u0027s written you cannot go back unless the \u0022revert\u0022 feature is still available (in which case I think the game reverts to a cached version of persistent.sfs, but this is the only situation where this can happen).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, there is no way for you to get back to a later state if you loaded an old save and didn\u0027t have any later save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do is duplicate persistent.sfs quite regularly, in addition to making numbered saves every time something significant is about to happen. Duplicating persistent.sfs is just a matter of command-tabbing and then alt-grabbing the file (on Mac - can\u0027t remember for windows) and avoids the (very slight) hassle of remembering where you are in your savegame numbering system (note to devs: a better UI for saving/loading would not hurt...). It also avoids making mistakes (like, pressing F5 instead of alt-F5, overwriting a quicksave I wanted to keep, etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, alt-F5 for making a savegame (or escape from KSC to have exactly the same option), alt-F9 to load it up. And if ever you have a doubt, just pause the game, go into your save folder and duplicate persistent.sfs for added security. Under MacOS, you\u0027ll need to rename it if you ever want to load it up since duplicates get a number added \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eafter\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the file extension (Apple caved to the file extension convention in computing, but still refuses to treat file extensions quite normally...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah, and the ultra-light solar panels don\u0027t retract. The slightly heavier ones have a housing to retract into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbtw, I really don\u0027t know if this question has a \u0022definitive\u0022 answer anywhere.
