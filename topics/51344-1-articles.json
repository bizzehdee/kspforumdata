So the idea is, they can work their way along, learning both game mechanics and the capabilities of parts, and getting more confident as they progress with baby steps. You only have 2 posts but you obviously know what you\u0027re doing so don\u0027t need what is effectively a tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is that career mode isn\u0027t intended to be much of a challenge, nor is it intended to be a long-term occupation, at least at present. And seriously, there\u0027s really no way to make it either without also just turning it into a repetitive grind. The only way to string things out is to either reduce the amount of science you get for doing various things in different places, or increase the cost of buying nodes, or make the tree a longer and/or wider by putting fewer parts per node. Once you can make it into orbit, there\u0027s no real trick to going anywhere else. Thus, you\u0027d just have to do more missions and seriously, once you\u0027ve sent a science ship to one planet, it gets old fast just doing the same for all the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me personally, just doing the \u0022Apollo thing\u0022, as in grab a handful of rockets, plant a flag, and go home, is pretty boring after the 1st time. If you can get to LKO, you can get to Mun. If you can get to Mun, you can get anywhere else, it just takes a bit more delta-V and having to wait on a launch window. If the player can do all that, why penalize him by making him prove this over and over going everywhere in the system just to get parts he obviously doesn\u0027t really need anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pigbear","CreatedById":68791,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T02:40:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eget a custom tech tree mod.

However I haven\u0027t been spamming science (apart from the Eve mission everything has been recover rather then repeated transmission and I\u0027ve actually missed out on a lot of crew reports because I forget that the feature exists). My Duna mission is almost assembled in orbit awaiting it\u0027s launch window in a few days (that\u0027s why the last part of the Eve mission is on hold, I need to time the Duna launch correctly and Eve can wait in stable orbit) and will probably finish things off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I would enjoy seeing some adjustments to how transmissions work. As most are aware you can keep re-running and then re-transmitting over and over again to get all the science. I don\u0027t want to break the idea that transmitting and then recovering on a later mission provides the same total science as recovering, but I would maybe just drop the diminishing returns and only allow transmission if you haven\u0027t already gotten science from it and recovering removes any future science from the exact same area - as biomes are added to the planets and moons this will become more essential. I would also raise the science costs of the later techs, so that there is some reason to go to other planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now \u003Cstrong\u003Ethere is a ton of science available right in Kerbin\u0027s backyard\u003C/strong\u003E, both Kerbin and the Mun have their biomes already filled out, which creates many unique locations to study compared to the single biome of most the other planets. I actually sent out a short range probe to try out the new gravmeter science thing along with a proving trial for nuclear engines (my program has some roleplay). I fitted 16 of the grav instruments on my ship (no antenna, I was bringing them all back for recovery) and bounced around Kerbin\u0027s orbit to find all the unique places to take a reading. As it turned out I could have easily mounted 24 and still run out thanks to all the unique locations I kept finding to take a reading and I wasn\u0027t even landing. Total haul was over 800 science just for flying a single type of instrument in an orbital ship with no duplicate readings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SyzUGRe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SyzUGRe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-02T22:43:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2013 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dave Kerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T22:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dave Kerbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPersonally I would enjoy seeing some adjustments to how transmissions work.
