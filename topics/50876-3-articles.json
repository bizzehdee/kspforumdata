I\u0027ve given up on trying to compute the optimal flight path from first principles, so I\u0027m just using basically your recommended trajectory: 8km start, 40km end, 65% shape. For the speed, instead of arbitrarily clipping to 23 m/s^2, I decided to try to follow that trajectory. When the actual flight path is below the target path (climbing too slowly), point at the target and full throttle. When the actual flight path is above (we\u0027re climbing too fast), burn prograde but throttle back to let the flight path fall back down. The policy I tried that works best is to throttle just enough to maintain vertical speed, letting horizontal speed build up. I also tried maintaining speed and letting both vertical speed fall and horizontal speed go up, but that didn\u0027t work as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy testbed was an SSTO like the ascent challenge from some time back. 1 capsule, 1 X200-16 tank, 1 T30, and a mechjeb unit.

In a way, I think of maximum vertical speed as a bank for accelerating sideways. Many different rockets and flight profiles that i tried (not including long burning, low TWR LV-N stage like the one posted here) i find that around 350-400m/s maximum vertical speed was giving me best results (500m/s for the LV-N).

Then burn along the maneuver indicator to achieve maximum rise of periapsis while not moving apoapsis (my apoapsis after early stages is usually at 50-60 km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- after reaching apoapsis (or sometimes before it by varying amounts), burn above prograde to push the apoapsis just a bit ahead of the ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if the angle is too steep, burn at horizon, and watch what the apoapsis behind you is doing. If it starts going too high, push it down by burning above horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- if things go wrong, retry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got the ship to the orbit on third attempt but I think there was some luck involved, too. When I finally got my apoapsis above 70 km it was on the other side of the planet and I was at 55 km or so, so I had to keep that apoapsis above atmosphere by occasional burns while the fuel level was already dangerously low.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-13T22:40:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2013 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T22:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy \u0022strategy\u0022, if you will, is to make sure I\u0027m going ~1250 m/s orbit speed and 40km when the nuke stage starts, and otherwise revert to the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise I let mechjeb burn at about 25 degrees, down to 15 degrees as the spacecraft gets higher (the settings are in the screenshots).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T02:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EData point: a high TWR rocket (using a T30) launched from 76m altitude burns 12 m/s more than the same rocket moved up on clamps to 128m.
