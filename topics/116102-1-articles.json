Imagine that we have two Europas, or perhaps something even more extremely water/-ice rich, colliding as part of the formation process of some theoretical solar system.\n\nWhat would, visually, such a collision look like? Would there be a gigantic flash - and if so, from what - or would we just see massive slabs of ice be ripped apart or vaporized and ejected at insane speeds in various directions? In most animations of the early Earth being impacted by a Mars-sized body (the collision that led to the formation of the Moon), large swaths of the planet are portrayed as turning into lava and molten material. I would presume that an icy world could not have such an appearance. Would it turn into a steamy fuzzball instead?"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T21:20:11Z","Content":"Maybe a lot of steam?

Any matter glows if heated above a certain point, and there\u0027s enough energy in collisions of planetary objects to cause blinding light. A piece of ice at a reentry will flash. Now imagine objects with orders of magnitude more surface colliding directly, lithosphere to lithosphere. Regardless of the composition, it would be an abominable blinding light.\n\nImages like these are hilariously incorrect.\n\n![tumblr_nn8ji6S26u1u6s0jdo1_1280.jpg](https://41.media.tumblr.com/e11d1ea8782ec9cb098f3d0b78500b8c/tumblr_nn8ji6S26u1u6s0jdo1_1280.jpg)\n\nAbsolutely downgraded in every way, with fancy stuff flying around. In reality, if two Europas would collide at several tens of kilometres per second at the distance of our Moon, it could very well look like this.\n\n![jpATOM-1-articleLarge.jpg](http://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/14/science/14ATOM-span/jpATOM-1-articleLarge.jpg)\n\nIt would be some time before the material cools down by radiation, which you\u0027d feel on your skin.\n\nAlso, remember that planetary objects would behave like liquids, rocky or icy, doesn\u0027t matter. They would both turn into blinding ejecta, swirling very slowly in the sky.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T21:54:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lajoswinkler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T21:52:48Z","Content":"i think you would see a flash but this would quickly be obscured by massive clouds of steam."},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T21:59:56Z","Content":"The heat generated would probably be enough to not only boil the water, but crack it into hydrogen and oxygen, which would then recombine explosively.

Basically, big flash, and when the overexposure fades, you are left with a cloud of really hot gas and ejecta around some chunks of solid/fluid material glowing softly in the infrared as they collapse gravitationally into a single body, hating further in the process (because if two planet bring a lot of energy into the collision, they are also huge heatsinks to absorb the heat generated, not everything would turn to steam, and forget about fusion). The relative speed of the impact is also important. Two icy bodies can merge slowly at a few hundred m/s in the Oort cloud, or they can slam at cometary speeds (50\u002Bkm/s), and the energy release is orders of magnitude different.\n\nRune.
