Would there be a gigantic flash - and if so, from what - or would we just see massive slabs of ice be ripped apart or vaporized and ejected at insane speeds in various directions? In most animations of the early Earth being impacted by a Mars-sized body (the collision that led to the formation of the Moon), large swaths of the planet are portrayed as turning into lava and molten material. I would presume that an icy world could not have such an appearance.

Basically, big flash, and when the overexposure fades, you are left with a cloud of really hot gas and ejecta around some chunks of solid/fluid material glowing softly in the infrared as they collapse gravitationally into a single body, hating further in the process (because if two planet bring a lot of energy into the collision, they are also huge heatsinks to absorb the heat generated, not everything would turn to steam, and forget about fusion). The relative speed of the impact is also important. Two icy bodies can merge slowly at a few hundred m/s in the Oort cloud, or they can slam at cometary speeds (50\u002Bkm/s), and the energy release is orders of magnitude different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
