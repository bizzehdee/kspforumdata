How about having wonder-construction as an achievable end game mechanic in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Have a certain resource generated (e.g. wonder construction points) based on the accumulated production of all MKS parts on a certain celestial body (for Civilian Population it could be based on the growth rate variable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. This resource will then be be accumulated, and when reaching a certain point you complete the wonder and \u0022win the game\u0022. Alternatively, you have to do this for a specific number of celestial bodies to win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. In addition, the resource points will also be used to animate a part, I.e. the visual representation of the wonder under construction (e.g. a pyramid, or a bio dome). To make it more difficult, the destruction of the part could lead to a reset of the \u0022construction points\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarise. You build a wonder(s) by expanding your colonies on a certain number of celestial bodies, while being careful not to destroy it. When it is built you win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose who played any Age of Empires or Civilization game should immediately have a feel for what I\u0027m trying to convey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinks to related mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMKS/OKS by RoverDude\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECivilian Population by michaelhester07 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112142-1-0-x-Civilian-Population-1-4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112142-1-0-x-Civilian-Population-1-4\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thought I\u0027d share this idea since I don\u0027t really have any time to dabble with mod-making at the moment.

I think there are two overall ways to make this work. (A:) Through actual resources which are store-able in parts, or (B:) through an independent counting system accessible through a custom window. Both have merits and demerits. An independent system, for example, would be less easier to \u0022cheat\u0022, I.e. sending \u0022construction points\u0022 from Kerbin, but would require more programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, by utilizing store-able resources, it is easy to just fly everything from Kerbin. However this could be counteracted by making the resource very heavy. Also, store-able resources would also favor a more \u0022manual\u0022 approach to construction the wonder. I.e. you may have to pick up the resources generated in the base and drive/fly it over to the wonder to \u0022store\u0022 it, as opposed to having it automatically construct itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother implementation choice would be whether or not it should be contract dependent or not. By using contracts it would be easier to use for example the Contract Manager mod to determine the win variables (I think). On the other hand, by being contract independent you could also win in a sandbox game as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next design choice would be how the wonder construction points are accumulated. Which variables determines the rate of points you gather. For example, you could either have a dedicated function for accumulating the resources. I.e. you specifically order your colony to start accumulating wonder construction points. On the other hand it could be automatically generated based on an algorithm that analyzes the overall \u0022production\u0022 of the colony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a couple of thoughts.
