Tweakscale comes with a config file for TACLS that is credited to O-Doc in the file, but I remember seeing posts by TaranisElsu of him mentioning he was working on a Tweakscale integration himself; so is the one from Tweakscale the \u0022official\u0022 config? Also, if it is the official method, what about the parts that need to be deleted? I cannot find any documentation regarding this; having to deduce from the Tweakscale config which parts to delete myself seems a little excessive.
