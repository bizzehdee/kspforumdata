Ive really held back on mods due to the above problem and have been waiting for something like curse to come along for a while now. I just want to know when the client will support ksp...im dying, playing this vanilla crap...and im too lazy to get all my mods working the old fashion way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T11:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, your guess is as good as ours when it comes to this.
