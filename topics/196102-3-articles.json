I think this latter one would be easier to implement.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGive the existing landing legs variants that allow the player to choose between horizontal and vertical clearance - that is, allow the legs to reach out further away from the lander, increasing the size of the ground contact area for better stability on a slope but at the cost of the landing leg not being as tall, meaning you have to choose between increased stability or decreased chance of tailstriking on touchdown. If that\u0027s not an option, then just give several variants with different leg lengths.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpeaking of which. A structural rail part of variable length and possibly width, designed to be mounted radially so that if whatever engine you\u0027re using on your lander is too big for your landing legs (ex. LT-05 versus Terrier, LT-1 versus Poodle), you can offset the landing leg downwards to reach the ground\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0half of the landing leg\u0027s mounting visibly hanging in the air.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVisual overhaul for the Reliant and the Swivel. Pretty much all the other engines got a pretty-up so far, so why not these two?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVisual overhaul for plane parts. The Mk1 cockpits and crew cabin, the intake\u00A0and the Mk0 tank are the ones most in need of retexturing. To a lesser extent the Mk1 tank needs something done with the texture as well, since it almost always ends up rotated in weird ways when radially attaching it. Wings would also be good with a smooth all-white texture as an alternative to the current black-trimmed-hodgepodge one.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrop tank parts for planes that have built-in radial decouplers and\u00A0do not cause horribad drag like a standard decoupler would, optionally with an advanced tweakable that automatically stages off the tank once it\u0027s empty at the cost of the player not being able to drop it manually anymore.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd if we\u0027re already at it, how about some \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_fuel_tank\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Econformal fuel tanks\u003C/a\u003E?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA quality-of-life mechanism for making it easier to snap elevons onto wings with minimal clipping regardless of wing orientation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFixing the MEM\u0027s off-center \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I\u0027m thinking something like an upside-down FL-A5/FL-A10/R-type adapter\u00A0with half a dozen or so exhaust nozzles at the circumference (visually firing diagonally outwards rather than downwards but the thrust vector points downwards)\u00A0rather than one or two bells in the middle, leaving enough room in the center for an inline attachment node.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMerge the 1x6 and 3x2 solar panels into a single part as variants, along with a few more possible combinations.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInline solar panel part. Basically a quarter-length Structural Fuselage with four OX-STAT panels equidistantly integrated into its circumference, sunken into the surface deep enough to seamlessly maintain the 1.25m diameter with no extra drag. Optionally, it can also close shutters over the panels to disable power generation but withstand reentry heat better. Of course, the integrated nature of the panels means no sun tracking.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nZero-gee passenger cabins in more sizes.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n1.25m has the Mk1 crew cabin, but its interior is very much not that\u00A0of a zero-gee cabin. I\u0027m thinking a fairly minimalist cabin with a one-guy-behind-the-other sitting arrangement, similar to the Mk2 inline cockpit or the KV-2 pod. Optionally, the cabin\u0027s diameter is slightly larger than 1.25m, about the same as if the Mk1 lander can was circular rather than octagonal.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor 1.875m, I\u0027m thinking a three-seater cabin where the passengers are sitting either facing outwards, back-to-back with each other, or rest their backs against the rear of the cabin with their heads pointing inwards in a trefoil formation. Refer to the Ares capsule in\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EThe Martian\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to see what I\u0027m thinking of.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor 3.75m, I\u0027m thinking something similar to the Hitchhiker Storage Module but with a double-deck internal design similar to the science lab, with three seats per deck and a ladder in the middle of the IVA space.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd if we\u0027re already at crew arrangements, how about a late-game high-visibility 1.25m command pod, something like an External Command Seat sitting in a spherical glass dome the size of a KV pod for 360\u00B0 panoramic visibility?\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhich way the seat is oriented relative to the pod\u0027s attachment point (ie. whether the attachment point is behind, below or even above\u00A0the seat) is an advanced tweakable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo top attachment node and nothing can be radially attached to the pod.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo monopropellant storage and no built-in reaction wheel because there\u0027s visibly no space for it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSlightly lower than average impact tolerance due to the outer hull literally being made of glass.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHeat tolerance about on par with the Mk1 lander can due to all the glass, plus the canopy is slightly wider than 1.25m so shielding it during reentry is difficult. Optionally, the part would also have a shutter-like heatshield that covers the canopy from the bottom up when deployed, making the pod as heat-resistant as the Mk1 command pod\u00A0at the cost of losing the visibility.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNot sure if the canopy would also function as an EVA hatch. If it does and the above heatshield is implemented, buttoning up disables the hatch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-26T19:57:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2020 07:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Fraktal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SOXBLOX","CreatedById":204106,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-26T21:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 I think that we\u0027re likely to see an update centered around Perseverance and Ingenuity, New Horizons, and more comet stuff. Maybe something to make a mission equivalent to Stardust, like a science experiment that collects dust particles? So, rovers, another probe core, reskins of the relay antennas? I want to see reskins of or alternate variants of the LV series to make them more clusterable and prettier overall. And of course, MORE SOLAR PANELS!!! Bigger landing legs, too, I guess? Also would really love to see plain textures for the fuel tanks, like perfectly pure white, with no seams, rivets, etc., and maybe a matte black.

Landing legs, a couple engines? We could use a larger, more capable crew capsule, but I don\u0027t want a Dragon clone. A reusability feature is probably out of the question (too complex); though this will likely appear in KSP 2, KSP 1 doesn\u0027t seem to be up to the task. And there\u0027s a mod for it anyways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Of course, a collab like this runs the risk of subtracting a lot. Elon and his company are controversial within the community here; is immortalizing them in the game the best idea? While I do not disagree with his stance on some issues, I do disagree with him on other things. Why should I have to be reminded of his opinions and company when playing a video game about rockets and realistic physics?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 While I don\u0027t hate SpaceX, I don\u0027t love them either. I was warming up to them (and am still almost excited about Starship), but then I saw a train of Starlink sats while observing. My scope is rather modest; I have no motor drive, no observatory, and only three eyepieces. But even though Starlink won\u0027t mess up any of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emy\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Epictures or ruin any of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emy\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ework now, it will ruin the work of others, and maybe interfere with mine, if I move to astrophotography. Of course, the trains disperse, but when the constellation is complete, I will be guaranteed to see many, many Starlinks drifting through my FOV. Amateur astronomers will no longer be able to observe the skies without capturing images of satellites, and families will no longer be able to go outside on a cold, clear winter night and see Andromeda and Orion twinkling away, unmarred, as they have for millennia.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 You can argue that new technology and new space telescopes will solve the imaging issue, but this misses the point. If an industrialist was to cover Mt. McKinley or the Grand Canyon in shopping malls, factories, and even research labs, would you tolerate it? If someone argued, \u0022Well, cameras will take pictures for you to look at, and then we\u0027ll build the stores, factories, and labs\u0022, would you agree with their argument? Of course not, because the point is for everyone to see these wonders in person, for themselves. Views through telescopes have inspired many young children to grow into engineers and scientists.
