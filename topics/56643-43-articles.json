When in the VAB, you can open and assign to the inventory for the various seats. So if you move a kerbal to another seat, I think the inventory stays behind. Think of that drill as being in a cabinet next to the seat in the capsule. If you move Bob to the science lab, the drill stays in the capsule.

The fact that you state \u0022...I reproduced it with stock override both on and off...\u0022 seems to indicate is it NOT SM.

I\u0027m now actively coding its replacement, Roster Manager, which will provide a much more robust experience. Once I\u0027ve released the early alpha of Roster Manager, I will begin stripping out most of the non vessel related functionality in the Roster Window, leaving ONLY those things directly related to the vessel in Preflight or flight. SO, this means you will have a limited ability to assign crew to a vessel or remove crew from a vessel. as a result, only the active vessel\u0027s crew and any available crew will be listed in the pared down window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be announcing more on this as I get closer to an initial release of Roster Manager, and ensure that no functionality is lost in the process of transition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a teaser screenshot of some of the early work. I intend to provide a tabbed edit section, that will provide much more functionality than currently exists.
