Reports of an \u0027aerial chase\u0027 and gunfire are largely being attributed to mass hysteria, likely the result of bystanders inhaling the leaking propellium gas just prior to the explosions. No casualties were reported and damage is being termed as minor.

And now over to ace reporter Kent Kerman with our top story this afternoon. Kent?\u0022\n\n\u0022Thanks, Kim. Chaos broke out earlier today at City Hall when a group of concerned citizens gathered to protest the apparent detonation of an *atomic bomb* on the East River only a few kilometers from the city. Mayor Mike McKerman, however, quickly defused the situation once he explained that the explosion was a simply a test of an experimental project by the Public Works Department to create a new harbor on the river. The mayor stressed that this project had actually been in the works for *some* time, and that the paperwork to all the relevant regulatory agencies had simply been mis-filed. He went on to say that there is absolutely no cause for concern, as the blast was in an unpopulated area, and, after all, Kerbals are remarkably resilient to radiation. The last few dissenters were quickly swayed when the Mayor began handing out some of his famous homemade snack cakes. \n\n\u0022Kent Kerman, KRBL News. Back to you, Kim.\u0022\n\n\u0022Thanks Kent. And now, over to Gregner with the weather, Gregner?\u0022\n\n\u0022Cloudy with a Chance of fallout!\u0022\n\n\u0022Thanks Gregner. In other news,  the *Mon\u00E9yPoke OW* phenomenon continues to captivate the country.

She let out a defeated sigh. Such a stupid, petty thing to even *think* about at a time like this, but still...\n\nAs usual, it all happened so *fast*.\n\nIn the handful of hours it had taken Valentina and Anastasia to trudge to the highway, covered in at least their own body weights in smelly mud, and hitch a ride to this travel plaza, the entirety of today\u0027s events had been swept away like so much radioactive dust. A building destroyed, half the city torn to shreds, even a *nuclear explosion*, all of it reduced to nothing but--\n\n*...fairy tales...*\n\nShe blinked at the odd thought. All these people, all these good, *honest* people, simply believing what they\u0027re told to believe, and doing so without question. It wasn\u0027t just here, it wasn\u0027t just the Union, but the whole world... That was a frightful power to even contemplate. \n\nAnd yet... something was off. Such a blatant, overt act... it didn\u0027t seem right. This adversary had always been subtle, hiding in shadows, like sending assassins to stalk their charge in dark, deserted places. The sniper could possibly have been hidden well enough, the evidence destroyed by a \u0022gas line explosion.\u0022 But... why not a dark alley, or poison, or--\n\n*...an airliner falling out of the sky...*\n\nShe jumped at the thought.\n\n*...Gene...*\n\nAnd that gunship. That could only have come from the mind of a madman. Something tickled a memory deep her own mind. Something about Cerimans disliking snipers, something about honor and proud warrior race and such. Or was that just another of Dibella\u0027s silly foreign movies?\n\nDibella. Valentina hoped she was alright. But there was nothing she could do, right now. Dibella was smart, resourceful, connected... and stubborn as an ox. She would be ok...\n\nRight?\n\nValentina shoved all the thoughts away. Something was wrong, something was *wrong* about the whole thing. But... not \u0022here, there be monsters\u0022 wrong--though that, too--more like... the monsters weren\u0027t...\n\nBah! She was still so exhausted she couldn\u0027t think straight.

The adrenaline of arriving once again in a public place had quickly brought her back. At the time, it had seemed unnecessarily risky, but they *needed* to clean up and recuperate. And this place had, of all great mercies, *showers!*\n\nAfter the last couple of days, it had simply been *ecstatic*. It was warm and wonderful and *clean*--at least it *had* been, she\u0027d left the attendant an extra bill for that--layers of filth and sweat and blood simply melting away. Valentina had used enough soap to bathe a yak, which somehow seemed appropriate. Then she had given herself a nasty abrasion trying to scrub away a smear of dirt that was actually a bruise. \n\nThose, she was covered with. And her back looked like she\u0027d been flogged. The pain was less, now, and that was good. It didn\u0027t seem to have bled much, either, but the wounds looked deep nonetheless. She would have to keep a close watch for infection, especially after marinating in mud and yak juice. Infection killed slowly, from the inside out, and was nothing to be taken lightly. \n\nShe caught a glimpse of herself in a nearby mirror. But... there were other things more... (de)pressing. Valentina Kermanova had never been the fashionable sort. She had no use for such petty frivolity, and it certainly wasn\u0027t a very Ussari thing to be concerned with. She had always worn a ponytail. It was simple, practical, and absolutely within Personal Grooming Regulations. She raised a hand to the fuzzy hair at the nape of her neck, and felt her lower lip tighten just slightly. \n\nNow, her hair fell in sheets on either side of her head, drooping down to two points at her chin and tapering up towards the back, where it was left very short indeed. She\u0027d managed to wash out most of the singed bits and burnt ends, but otherwise couldn\u0027t do a *thing* with it! There was simply no keeping it out of her face at all, and that one obnoxious stray lock that had always plagued her had somehow managed to survive. It hung there now, dangling in front of her face. Mocking her. She frowned at her own reflection, her lower lip quivering just a... hair.\n\nAnd of course, adding insult to injury, she was wearing... *sigh*... a *dress*. She wasn\u0027t Tercella, after all, she *could* wear a dress when a situation clearly warranted it. But she simply didn\u0027t *fit* into anything in the store\u0027s meager Kerbelle\u0027s selection. So this had come from the Junior Miss rack. A thought about \u0022getting any worse\u0022 tried to materialize in her head but she quickly snuffed it before it could. She knew better than to give form to that temptation. Instead, a scowl twisted her face. *ST\u0414LI\u0419S S\u0428\u0417\u0414T\u0423 S\u0424C\u041AS*, the first person who says *any*thing about her clothes, or *especially* her *hair*--not that *she* would ever be self-conscious about such a silly thing, not *she*--is getting a swift kick in the shin! One thing was for sure: *no one* would recognize her like this. \n\nA girlish giggle drew Valentina\u0027s eye. She sighed again. And then, of course, there was Anastasia. She was dressed in denim slacks and a very plain shirt--from the, ugh, *Kerbelle\u0027s* section--with her golden hair tucked up under a KSA ballcap. She still managed to look radiant. Maybe even more so. So much so, in fact, that she had attracted not one but *two* admirers from whom she *clearly* needed to be rescued, what with the way she was twittering and doing that thing with her hair, the bit that had somehow escaped the hat. \n\nPutting on a proper disapproving glower, Valentina stepped up to the trio and loudly cleared her throat. \n\n\u0022Whoah, is this your sister?\u0022 said one of them, \u0022you didn\u0027t say she had short hair!\u0022 He grinned at Valentina and raised an eye... bulge, \u0022heeeeeey,\u0022 then wiggled it, \u0022how you do--*ouch, my shin!*\u0022 and proceeded to limp away. Anna\u0027s jaw fell open. The other fellow just blinked at Valentina. \n\nChanneling her best Igor and drawing herself up to her *full* height, she looked him square in the chin.\n\n\u0022Boo.\u0022\n\nHe took a step back, \u0022oh, wow, wouldyoulookatthetimeIgottagonowsorrybye!\u0022 and was out through the door with a little tinkle from the bell hanging there. Anna\u0027s jaw flopped wider. \n\n\u0022You are supposed to be keeping low profile,\u0022 Valentina said, tugging down the brim of Anna\u0027s cap, \u0022besides, is too old for you.\u0022\n\nOnce more displaying its snake-like range, her jaw flopped even *wider*, then opened and closed like some bizarre snake-fish hybrid. \n\nFinally she threw her arms up, \u0022ugh, I can\u0027t *even!\u0022*\n\n\u0022Even what?\u0022 Valentina blinked. \n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022Can\u0027t even *what?*\u0022\n\n*\u0022What?\u0022*\n\nValentina\u0027s eyes rolled, \u0022nevermind. Come, the bus is leaving.\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u0022What will you do now?\u0022 Anna asked as they reached one of the idling coaches outside in the lot. \n\n\u0022I will go and see Edmund Kerman. Somehow,\u0022 Valentina shook her head, \u0022he is the key to all this. He is my friend, or used to be. Perhaps I can get through to him.\u0022\n\nAn uncomfortable silence stretched out before Valentina spoke again, \u0022you are sure you will not come with me?\u0022\n\nAnna\u0027s huge, beautiful eyes fell, \u0022I\u0027d never see my brother again, would I?\u0022\n\n\u0022I do not know,\u0022 Valentina said softly, \u0022I will find some way to talk to Edmund, but...\u0022 against her skin, the M\u00FCnstone had begun to cool, \u0022somehow, I do not think it will end well. Beyond that, I just do not know.\u0022\n\n\u0022I can\u0027t do that,\u0022 tightness crept into Anna\u0027s voice, \u0022Billy only ever had *one* friend in the whole world, and he abandoned him, right when he needed him the most. I can\u0027t *do* that.\u0022\n\n\u0022The Kerbs, they will come for you again. You *know* this. If they...\u0022 Valentina swallowed, \u0022will it not be the same?\u0022\n\n\u0022I won\u0027t run. I won\u0027t abandon him. I *won\u0027t* be like Edgas,\u0022 then she looked up with a fire that nearly made Valentina flinch, and spoke despite the creaking of her voice, \u0022if... if they get me, then it\u0027s because they beat me, not \u0027cause I ran away. I will stand for my brother, because no one else will. And if I fail then... well at least I\u0027ve tried. And maybe I\u0027ll just surprise them, too!\u0022\n\nValentina forced a smile, and clapped her hands on the girl\u0027s shoulders, \u0022you are brave girl, Anastasia Kerman.\u0022 Her own eyes widened, \u0022ah! I nearly forgot...\u0022 She reached into her--sigh--*purse*, and handed Anna a small, grey, sparkly object.\n\n\u0022My m\u00FCnrock!\u0022 squealed Anna, \u0022you *did* find it. Oh!\u0022 she peered more closely at it, \u0022it\u0027s cracked in two...\u0022\n\nShe thought for only a moment before handing the piece still on chain back to Valentina, \u0022here, you keep this half. It will bring you good luck.\u0022\n\nValentina raised an eye... bulge at the comment, but fastened the chain around her neck. Another awkward silence  was cut short by a boarding announcement. \n\n\u0022Take care of yourself,\u0022 Anna said soberly, \u0022and be careful. Something about Edmund... doesn\u0027t feel right.\u0022\n\n\u0022Edmund is my friend, he would never harm me,\u0022 Valentina said, then added, \u0022But I will be careful. And *you* do the same.\u0022\n\nAnna smiled, \u0022I guess this is good--\u0022\n\nA hand came up, \u0022I have never liked the word. Is too final. *Do svidaniya*, Anna Kerman. I am sorry I could not be more help to you.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Do svidaniya*, Valentina Kermanova,\u0022 then she winked, \u0022and it\u0027s not over yet.\u0022\n\nThey hugged for a moment, before parting ways, each boarding a different bus. They kept smiling and waving at each other, until one bus turned this way, and the second another. Then, Valentina\u0027s smile faded and grew cold like the fleeting taiga summer. A tear threatened, but she tensed her face into a sneer and forced it back, where it burned like fire. And by that fire, it was forged into something new... and very, very old. \n\nShe couldn\u0027t save the girl. All she had done was to postpone the inevitable. This burden now settled into place on her shoulders amidst all the others. She couldn\u0027t save them, she couldn\u0027t save *any* of them. She was never meant to be a savior. But the girl... the knife that twisted in her heart was especially jagged. \n\nThis transgression, this *sin*, would not stand unanswered. There would be... vengeance? Retribution? Wrath? No, those were lofty terms for lofty beings, and she was a simple thing. She would pursue the darkness, hunt it down, tear shrieking from its holes, and stare into its empty gaze. \n\nAnd then, there would be a *scourging*.\n\nShe understood. She had not believed, but now she *understood*. About the girl. And the truth about herself. Valentina *knew* she couldn\u0027t save her. She should deny the very idea, rage against it with every fiber of her being... but instead, she accepted it. She *accepted* it. And this knife dug deeper than any other. She understood. \n\n*I am a monster.*\n\nAbove the distant mountains, a bloated gibbous M\u00FCn was rising, pale against the deep blue sky. Valentina fixed it with an icy gaze. \n\n*I **am** a monster. And I am coming for you.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-28T08:50:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2017 08:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"}]}
