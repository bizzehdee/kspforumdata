It is obviously not a massive corporate project with an intent to replace KSP.\u00A0 At the time I made the (ugly old) video which includes a moonlanding, Flyout was just a showcase I made to make sure I get applied to the games developement branch in my university. It was heavily inspired by KSP, but I wasn\u0027t planning to release it ever. However I got very addicted to working on the project and figured I\u0027d like to make a game that feels like you\u0027re flying a sim like DCS,\u00A0Orbiter, X-plane etc, but has the fun aspect of creating the vessels\u00A0yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETo answer to the previous thread: No I do not use any KSP code or assests in the game. It\u0027s built from\u00A0scratch.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone mentioned the transform gizmos. It\u0027s the most common and only way to do the gizmos that I have ever seen in any game or app. It\u0027s the exact same way you move and rotate objects even in the Unity editor!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen it comes to the general building mechanics: I played KSP for years. I can\u0027t think of any better way of doing it. Maybe use Minecraft blocks? Nope.\u00A0What makes it somewhat different are the procedural parts, which I plan to add even more, as it could greatly\u00A0reduce the needed part count in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen to the Youtube video advertisements. The label you see below the videos is assigned by Youtube\u0027s automatic content recognition system. Because Youtube doesn\u0027t\u00A0know Flyout exists, my videos get easily labelled as being something else. I can\u0027t do anything about it. Even if I type \u0022Flyout\u0022 in the game label. They do it so the game developers get credit from Let\u0027s play videos etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what is Flyout now and where is it heading?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently it\u0027s mostly a modular flight simulator. I have spent a lot of time on the detailed aerodynamics solver. It takes into account, for example. current wing sweep, wing thickness, leading and trailing edge devices, aspect ratio. The wings are divided into segments and the forces are calculated for each one of them, like in X-plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also has (very WIP, reintroduced to the alpha 2 days ago, features include only seeing and hearing others) multiplayer with 5\u00A0people max. per room at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the engine creation mode, that many people seem to be interested in. Unfortunately it\u0027s not\u00A0integrated to the actual gameplay yet, althrough the same solver is used in the premade engines. Seems like I have to get it done asap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen to the space aspect. Like I said my resources are very limited and I can\u0027t work on multiple large features simultaneously, and I haven\u0027t had\u00A0time to\u00A0work\u00A0on space simulation for months. So what can you do\u00A0in space at this time? Orbit around the first planet, that\u0027s it. More space features will come later when everything works well on the first planet. Someone mentioned about the possibility of rocket customisation. Rocket performance in Flyout\u00A0 is calculated according to nozzle throat area, chamber temperature and fuel density and ambient pressure\u00A0(using some equations I found on a NASA website) so they could be tweaked a little bit. I haven\u0027t found a way to calculate performance effects from the nozzle shape yet, but yeah, I have been looking into that as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully this makes some more sense now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have any questions, please ask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-28T02:41:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2018 02:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by FlyoutGame\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatGuyWithALongUsername","CreatedById":140817,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-27T21:15:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very promising- I really like the modular engine part!
