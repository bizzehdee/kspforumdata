Also, I have heard reports that some craft files with KAS grabbable parts (no KAS parts themselves or any other mod!) I have messed with in 0.24 throw bugs for other people with bugs like turning on/off RCS, the engine, switching control point... and all gets solved if you re-save the ship in a KAS-free install.

It is a change Squad made to the way PartModules are added to Parts. What happens is old craft (both those launched AND those saved as .craft files) get their PartModules overwritten by repeated references to (in my case, anyways) ModuleAeroReentry and FarBasicDragModel. It could be anything, mine did those specifically because of the specific mods I have. Once the PartModules are all screwed up by the KSP bug, you get NullRefs all over the place. This causes CTD, and also gets saved in your persistence file. So it does crash, and it does \u0022corrupt\u0022 your save file (or .craft file, if in the VAB or SPH). Once this has happened, the only way to fix it is to rebuild the craft in question and save a new .craft, or launch it, save the persistence file, and edit the ship throwing NullRefs PartModules to match the one you lauched (which will have the correct PartModules). This is the gamebreaking bug they fixed in .24.1 supposedly (haven\u0027t tested it myself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it is a PITA.
