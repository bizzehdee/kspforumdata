I love those. My phone is an Android and has the default Google camera app, so it has a \u0027photo sphere\u0027 function that lets you take a mosaic of your surroundings which it then stitches together (often hilariously badly) into a spherical panorama, which you can then make into a little planet if you like. Hours of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose look like they\u0027re taken more or less all at the same time, though, rather than as mosaics- how is that done? What kind of camera do you need?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Okay, I\u0027m relatively sure that the Curiosity rover takes its pictures as mosaics- those are just stitched a lot better than my phone can manage. I\u0027m still perplexed about the rocket launches, though- is it just a really wide angle lens for the rocket and then everything else is taken after the actual launch?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-29T17:48:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2014 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GreeningGalaxy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
