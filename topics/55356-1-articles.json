It\u0027s a very simple rocket without docking clamps or something. Is it possible to refuel this rocket since I don\u0027t want to destroy it. The Kerbal in it served bravely and deserves to be rescued.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-06T09:14:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2013 09:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Belafon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T08:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout docking ports or a mod like Kerbal Attachment System you cannot refuel it. You can, however, do one of 2 things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) If your periapsis is fairly low, you can get your Kerbal out of the pod at apoapsis, and use his suit jets to push against the ship to slow it down. This can be time consuming and frustrating, so I only suggest it if you\u0027ve only got a few thousand meters to go (say, if your periapsis is under 80-100km). Just make sure you keep an eye on your suit\u0027s fuel. If you run out your Kerbal will be lost in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Send up a new ship with an empty seat, rendezvous with your old ship, and EVA your Kerbal over to the new ship. You\u0027ll lose the science on the old ship but you\u0027ll save your Kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddenis","CreatedById":89784,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T08:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout docking port and without addons you cannot refuel it...

Then board and get out of the rocket and push it again.... repeat as many times as needed.

Just make your Pe about 30-60 km above Kerbin and aerobraking will land you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Also you can build another rocker, get rendezvous, and move your kerbonaut to another rocket which have rocket and can land, but you can loose science in the craft without fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-06T08:48:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2013 08:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ddenis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xephirious","CreatedById":77577,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T08:46:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStep one.
