We\u0027ve used this arrangement with BobCat on the N1 and it helped avoid a lot of silly situations. For example, LES blowing up after jettison due to FAR/DRE G forces/heating damage, LES recontact with the rocket (the escape motor will generally burn straight up. It\u0027s an especially silly way to go, seeing as you just got rid of your means of escape...) and accidental orbiting of the tower assembly. It\u0027s also useful for when you jettison the LES after abort, the decoupler doesn\u0027t always do well in that case (it does for Mercury LES, but that one is extremely light and has no aerocap that could snag). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the rest, the pitch-over motor is a nice thing to have for pad aborts, especially for RO.

Pitch-over motor can be integrated, like in stock, I suppose. I\u0027d still love a separate jettison motor, though, there was only one system that was jettisoned by firing the escape motor, and that was on Mercury. While the pitch motor helps with nominal jettison (though high-G damage from DRE will likely remain a concern), there\u0027s still a matter of BPC snagging on the CM on abort. Dunno how heavy the new tower is, but on the old one, the decoupler didn\u0027t always do the job (IIRC). Especially if you decoupled at the wrong time, and the CM pressed into the tower due to latter\u0027s higher drag (I nearly always clip some sort of jettison motor into escape towers because of that).
