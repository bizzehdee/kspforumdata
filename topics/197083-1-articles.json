Now, I want to move the same docking port, using the same engineer, in the same mission, to another location on the vehicle. But when I try to grab the docking port, I get a \u0027too heavy\u0027 message, as it seems to think that I\u0027m trying to grab the entire vehicle. Restarting the game didn\u0027t change anything, and I\u0027m trying to figure out what is different, and (most importantly) if there\u0027s a way to \u0027fix\u0027 it so I can detach the docking port and move it.
