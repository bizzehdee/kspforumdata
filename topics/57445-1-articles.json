Currently, the only way to see the current game date (year, day) is to exit to the tracking station and look at the date in the top left. This is problematic because if you\u0027re sitting on the launch pad and want to time warp to a certain day, you need to warp a bit, stop, exit to the tracking station, look at the date, go back to the game, warp a bit more, and repeat. There are some work-arounds but they\u0027re fairly clumsy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, I\u0027m proposing that either in the main game UI, you can see the actual game date and time under the mission time and/or be able to see it somewhere when you\u0027re in map mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
