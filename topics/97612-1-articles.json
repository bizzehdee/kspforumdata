Makes life a lot easier for VTOLs that can thrust balance their downwards pointing engines on one throttle and then throttle up their horizontal flight engines once they reach altitude on a separate throttle without comprimising the thrust balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T05:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think MechJeb may have that capability?
