Until career was added, the point of the game was getting to far away places by any means that took your fancy. Which was massively entertaining. I think the problem with the science and career modes is that they\u0027re focused on restricting the player in the name of creating gameplay. It isn\u0027t fun (for me!) to play missions until I can get those part count and tonnage limits lifted. That feels like grinding to get to the point where I can have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to reminisce a little here, but there\u0027s a point, so bear with me: I remember building awful (and entertaining) rockets in the old demo. And then, after a little while, I got the game. Boom. 0.17. New planets, new parts, new things to do. And then 0.18 hit. That was brilliant. Same thing all over again. And then the next update, and the next... That was fun. That was a tech tree all on it\u0027s own. Remember when the mainsail was added? How easy (and rapid) orbit was with it compared to the tri-coupler behemoths we (I?) used to have to build? Remember when docking arrived on the scene? How suddenly, space ships went from things with very definite lifespans to something we could fly endlessly? Even rescue? Remember when NASA teamed up with Squad to give us the monstrously powerful SLS parts and freaking asteroids to play with? How about electricity? How about lights? Suddenly, we could lithobrake in the dark. \u003Cem\u003EThat \u003C/em\u003Ewas cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see? This is what a tech tree should provide. Instead, we\u0027ve got something that makes us stop looking towards space, and makes us start looking for mission waypoints and objectives in order to get to the fun stuff. In my opinion, it\u0027s missed the point completely. The demo was fun. 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, etc... they were all fun. Progressing from one update to the next and playing with the new parts was fun. And then career gets added, and suddenly we have to deal with arbitrary restrictions for the first time, and equally arbitrary contracts to over come the restrictions. That isn\u0027t fun. That\u0027s fencing off portions of the game to create a... whats the phrase? Treadmill? Grind? Power progression?

For example, the 2.5m engines, 2.5m tanks, and 2.5m decoupler / adapter are in three different nodes. Probe engines, probe cores, and power, again, three different nodes. Even RCS and docking ports, again, different nodes.

The problem I \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E run into is getting landers to the Mun and back for science purposes, because I don\u0027t have any good lifting rockets. I have to strap stupid numbers of boosters on (and it\u0027s even harder with the new aerodynamics basically killing asparagus staging) to get my wiggly hot dogs into orbit. This would be greatly alleviated if they moved the 1.25m bicoupler down to around Tier 3, leave the tricoupler at Tier 4, and move the quadcoupler to Tier 5. Right now, the tricoupler you unlock first (because \u003Cstrong\u003Ethat\u003C/strong\u003E makes sense) at Tier 4, which is the same tier you get 2.5m tanks and engines at... if I have 2.5m parts, why the hell would I still want these couplers?
