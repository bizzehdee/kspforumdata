Kerbal Alarm Clock is obviously required for this sort of thing, but I like running a lot of stuff at once. I\u0027m a bit of a completionist, and I like having crews maxed at experience, so there\u0027s always plenty to do!

It feels more like I\u0027m running a space program, and not piloting a space ship.\n\nFor YouTube, I think I\u0027m going to always just run one thing at a time (though that one mission may have several sub-objectives) because it can get pretty confusing, a month or more later, when I\u0027m returning to a ship that nobody - not even I - remember the purpose for."},{"CreatedByName":"SDEngineer","CreatedById":101148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:15:06Z","Content":"In the early game, when I\u0027m just within the Kerbin SOI, just one at a time. Once I go interplanetary though, I definitely do other things as well, but I do tend to just accomplish a few things then go back and time warp whatever interplanetary mission is closest to it\u0027s next \u0022checkpoint\u0022. For example, current game I have a lander halfway to Eve (just finished fine tuning the intercept). I have a reasonable dV launch window to Duna coming up in about 2 Kerbal weeks, so I\u0027ve launched that mission into orbit awaiting the transfer burn, and am meanwhile running a few incidental contracts (rescuing a few Kerbals, launching a throwaway solar station, etc) to pay for a new Minmus fuel mining station I want to launch to Minmus. I should have those done by the time the Duna launch window comes up, then I can start the Duna burn, and swap back to the Eve mission to time warp to an Eve rendevous - land the Eve lander and do some SCIENCE!, then swap back to the Duna probe which should be ready for it\u0027s fine tuning burn by about that point. Then head back to Kerbin and do a few more local contracts/infrastructure building, and look for another good launch window for another interplanetary mission, and repeat the cycle."},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:17:38Z","Content":"I ran several missions at the same time in 0.9. Topped out around 8-12, but got to the point that timings in KAC were starting to run up against one another. Some pretty tense moments waiting for a burn/landing to complete so I could jump to another ship. I was running multiple XP missions to Mun/Minmus/Sol, along with building my Minmus OKS/MKS base, and the occasional satellite contract. Right before 1.0 came out my saves were around 15 MB.\n\nIn 1.0, I am going to try and limit myself to 4 highly-active missions at a time, with some additional interplanetary cruise missions. So far I\u0027ve got 2 probes to Duna, 1 science lab to Minmus, and another Kerbin tour bus getting ready to launch. Kerbal Construction Time helps to spread out the missions, although I just noticed I have 6 rockets waiting in my build queue now. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonboy","CreatedById":134111,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:19:27Z","Content":"I usually do one at a time, because in-game time is a basically limitless resource. However, sometimes I have saves where I simulate a realistic colonization effort of Duna or Laythe. If I\u0027m doing that, I\u0027ll do launches at every transfer window to be more realistic and I\u0027ll end up with multiple sorties of ships in various stages of transfer at the same time (and a big queue of Kerbal Alarm Clock reminders so I can switch back and forth to make maneuvers as I time warp)."},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:20:43Z","Content":"I do lots of missions at the same time - KAC helps notify me when things need to have attention paid to them. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I could do hundreds of missions that require me to go to the Mun or Minmus in the time that it takes me to get to Jool, after all."},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:30:43Z","Content":"In the Kerbin system, I tend to have a couple of things going on.

I usually have a space station and landers at one or both of Kerbin\u0027s moons so there\u0027s always some exploring or mission support to be done.
