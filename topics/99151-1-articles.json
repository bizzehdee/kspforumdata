It had been 14 days since they landed. Well, 14 24-hour cycles. Time was strange here. The crew still kept to a 24 hour day, but the day/night cycle on the M\u00FCn was well over four Kerbin days. Two days of light, two days of darkness. Edgas figured he\u0027d eventually get used to it. Or he\u0027d have a psychotic episode. He was already growing to hate the nights here. Even the darkness itself wasn\u0027t....right. It was darkness like he\u0027d never known. It seemed to draw in, to consume the light as it crept across the landscape like a blight. Now it hung thickly around the base once again. Edgas could see the stars, but he tried not to. The way they sank down, then just disappeared into the inky, unbroken blackness of the distant horizon unsettled him. The base had floodlights, of course. They cast a pallid glow around the floorplate. But even that seemed to shrink back from the darkness. They were supposed to have installed long range spotlights by now, but hadn\u0027t gotten to it. Edgas wished they would.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHe had one friend in the darkness. From the window of his tiny cubicle on the hab deck, he could just see the old descent stage from\u003Cem\u003E Isfjell 1\u003C/em\u003E. It stood as a brave, lonely beacon out there in the night, its own floodlights fighting back against the consuming darkness like the desperate defenders of a besieged fortress. It was just a derelict now, there was no probe core to control it, but the departing crew had left the lights on. The base crew were supposed to have shut it down and stripped it for parts already, but hadn\u0027t gotten to it. Edgas hoped they wouldn\u0027t. The lights ran off the batteries. Only for a few hours each M\u00FCnar night, not nearly long enough. It was a silly thing, yet it gave Edgas some small comfort. Then, just as he was thinking this, the voltage dropped below some threshold, the castle wall was breached, and the lights winked out. Darkness rushed in like a conquering army.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EEdgas sighed, closed the window shade, and leaned back on his small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003Ecot\u003C/abbr\u003E. He rubbed his stubby fingers where they had been pressed against the cold hull. It was always cold in here, but he didn\u0027t mind. The cold never bothered him anyway. Edgas liked the cold. He stared up at collection of wires and tubing covering the ceiling. Nothing to do now but wait for the next duty cycle to start so he\u0027d have something to occupy his mind and take it off what was outside. Now, the night truly began.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E* * *\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EEdmund Kerman was at his station in the lab, near the top of the towering M\u00FCn base. He usually was, even if not on duty. There was just too much work to be done. He didn\u0027t like the nights here. They were too long, caused delays. He\u0027d forbidden night EVAs shortly after arriving. Too dangerous, he wouldn\u0027t risk his crew like that. They needed to get those spots up. Even then, too much out there that could catch a Kerbal off guard in the dark. Work outside would just have to wait. So he busied himself here, in the lab, surrounded by small grey rocks and containers of soil. He reached over to the little infrared space heater next to his station and turned it up another notch. Always so damn cold in here. Edmund liked it warm. He dreamt of retiring someplace tropical, with white sand and warmth. Maybe up the coast, just north of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Where he could sit in a beach chair and watch the rockets go up. Then come back down. Then go up again. And occasionally stay there. A drink in his hand and-- bah.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ENo time for such idle thoughts now, he had work to do. Besides, if wishes were RatSquirrelFishes then beggars would gag. That\u0027s what his ol\u0027 Gran-pabbie always used to say when Edmund was a boy. Hadn\u0027t made any sense to him then, either, but if Gran-pabbie said it, it must be true. He \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E gotten a little fuzzy there in his later years. Always strong like steel though. Why, at his age he could still--\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EBah! he pushed the thought away. Edmund closed his round, bulging eyes and rubbed the smooth skin between them. His head was thrumming today. That was better than thumping like yesterday. His headache had come and gone ever\u00A0since taking that tumble off the ladder on Day 1. Damn fool thing to do, a trained, experienced Kerbonaut like him. Rookie mistake. But that\u0027s what did it, alright. Blow to the head can cause lasting headaches like this. No doubt. Certainly wasn\u0027t that \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E thing. Damn fool doctors, what did they know, anyway? Probably read the test results wrong. Edmund was the pinnacle of physical condition. Why, he could out run, out distance, out lift Kerbals half his age. Everything on his last physical exam was perfect, except--\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EBAH! He slammed his fist down on the table. Something flew off and bounced around the room in slow motion. His head was making it impossible to concentrate. \u003Cem\u003ECalm yourself\u003C/em\u003E, he thought. Edmund picked up a small gray rock and turned it over in his fingers, tiny crystals sparking in the light. Mission Commander. He was lucky to have pulled this tag. But this, this was a high point to end on. No one would remember the fifth commander of the space station. First permanent presence on the M\u00FCn, now that was something special. Something memorable. Chadvey should have had it by rights, but he turned it down. Hmph. Chadvey. Big damn hero. First in space, first on the M\u00FCn. Edmund had logged more time passing gas here than Chadvey spent doing anything useful.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThen there was the anomaly. Edmund grinned under his mustache, trimmed exactly according to Personal Grooming Regulation OU812. Now that...\u00A0that could outshine even Chadvey. Satellite couldn\u0027t image it, even with a pass so low it smacked into a mountain. He didn\u0027t believe in that \u0022tall pink men\u0022 nonsense, but whatever was there, it was something extraordinary. Something that would be remembered. The Company\u00A0was getting impatient, they\u0027d funded a good chunk of this base. But procedure would be followed. The rover was nearly fully checked out, just needed the final instruments installed. Should be ready on the next day cycle. Edmund would not risk his crew with an improperly tested vehicle. Then it was an easy 8.2 click jaunt up the crater wall, and--\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHe sat back and sighed. This was pointless. A good commander knew when to call it quits. He couldn\u0027t get any work done like this anyway. He set the rock down next to a jar of gray soil tinged with orange. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E was a real bonus, he thought. Hoped for, but not expected. Billy had literally stumbled across it on a short rover excursion. Edmund looked over the collection of other samples on his table. So, so much data here. Right outside that hatch, just laying all over the ground like, well, powdery gray dirt. He got up and moved carefully to the ladder in the center of the cylindrical room. This place really is a geologist\u0027s soggy dream, he thought. He shut the lights off, went down the ladder to his cubicle, and went to sleep.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E* * *\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ETall pink men. Billy-Bobrim Kerman liked tall pink men. They weren\u0027t real, course. He knew that. But he still like the stories. This one was called, \u0022Duna Attacks!\u0022 He flipped through the colorful booklet. He weren\u0027t s\u0027posed to have this. Wasn\u0027t. Wasn\u0027t supposed to have this.

He hoped the Eds (he called them the Eds) didn\u0027t find it. They were too serious for picture books. He knew he wasn\u0027t dumb, but he wasn\u0027t smart like the Eds. He didn\u0027t understand alloys and compositions and things with molecular structures. But he was a good driver, and he could fix anything, and when he fixed something, why, it stayed fixed, by gum!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EBilly looked out his window into the darkness. He didn\u0027t mind the dark. He didn\u0027t know why it scared some folks so. Why be scared of what you can\u0027t see? Nothing but rocks out there, he knew that. Rocks never hurt no one. Well, \u0027cept maybe for those mi-cro-me-te-o-roids. He\u0027d seen some since they been here. Be looking out at the surface when suddenly \u003Cem\u003EPOOF!\u003C/em\u003E Didn\u0027t really go \u003Cem\u003EPOOF\u003C/em\u003E, course. The M\u00FCn was still space, and there weren\u0027t no sound in space. Wasn\u0027t. Wasn\u0027t no sound in space. He knew that. But it looked like the kinda thing that would go \u003Cem\u003EPOOF\u003C/em\u003E if you could hear it. That could probably hurt a fella. No sense being scared of that either. Can\u0027t see \u0027em coming, either it gets you or it don\u0027t.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EIt was dangerous up here. He knew that. But he was happy to be here. Being somewhere was always better than being nowhere, yes sir-ee. Billy was a Kerbonaut, and he knew there was always a risk of suddenly being nowhere. Or everywhere. Just one of those things. Being scared won\u0027t help. Besides, it was pretty up here, in its way. And interesting. He got to see interesting stuff that no one had ever got to see before. He didn\u0027t always understand it, but he got to see it and other folks didn\u0027t, and that was something.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThe Eds didn\u0027t have no family.

He talked to her every chance he got on the uplink. Those controllers were always pretty good about that. She was so proud of her big brother the brave Kerbonaut. Maybe they\u0027d let him bring her back a rock. So many rocks up here. He liked the ones that sparkled. Those scientists didn\u0027t really need all of them, did they?

Edgas hadn\u0027t bothered trying sleep. Too many bad dreams lately. Not horrible, but just enough that he didn\u0027t want to sleep until the day returned. He watched it now, from the small window of his cubicle. Just as the darkness had conquered the land, now it retreated, but ever so slowly, straining to keep every last centimeter.

The smaller one, the lab, was on top, with three floors of workspace. The main hull was huge, based loosely on the core module from the highly successful space station, but whereas the space station was all smooth plastic and padded surfaces, the M\u00FCnbase was entirely utilitarian. Metal grating divided the floors, the only exception being the nominal privacy of the crew quarters. The crew called them cubicles, though they were really more like triangular sectors spaced around the top most deck of the main hull, with open sectors filled with supplies separating the three.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EA tall metal ladder ran down the center of the cylinders, from the docking hatch at the apex of the lab, to the node at the bottom of the core module. Below the crew deck was the operations deck, filled with flat displays, walls of gauges, and a large map of the immediate area displayed on a round table off to one side. Below that was the airlock, taking up most of the deck, the rest being suit and equipment maintenance shops. At the bottom of the hull, was the galley. This meant a continual rain of M\u00FCndust from the open grating of the airlock above, despite the abatement blowers and containment procedures inside the airlock.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe crew had long since gotten used to the gunpowder-like smell of fresh M\u00FCndust that now permeated the place.

Edgas liked Billy. He thought it would be impossible to not like Billy. He had that enthusiastic exuberance people so often mistook for stupidity. Billy was uneducated, that was true enough, the Corps took practically anyone with a pulse. But Billy was sharp as a tack. Edgas knew about the comic books, of course. Billy kept them stashed underneath the massive copy of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EField Geologist\u0027s Guide to the Biomes of Kerbin\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that Edgas had given him when they graduated training. The comics were always pristine, but that old tome had been read so much it was starting to fall apart. Engineers. Pfft.

For a moment, he didn\u0027t know where he was. In rising panic, he peeked out the window. Still daylight. The shadows appeared not to have moved at all. \u003Cem\u003EDid I have a nightmare?\u003C/em\u003E He thought. He couldn\u0027t remember. But something....well, it was gone now. He put on a fresh flightsuit, and was about to head down to the galley, when he heard Edmund and Billy on the ops deck above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi Ed!\u0022 said Billy as he came up the ladder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, morning sunshine!\u0022 said Edmund, leaning against a console with a mug of coffee, \u0022So nice of you to join us. I was about to come looking for you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, what? Why?\u0022 Asked Edgas. Edmund nodded towards the mission clock. His jaw fell open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Told you that sleep debt would catch up with you,\u0022 Edmund said with a smirk. \u0022We\u0027re almost finished here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fine, fine, I\u0027ll eat later,\u0022 Edgas said, putting a palm to his face and picking a procedure manual from the map table, \u0022what\u0027re the call signs for today?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022See for yourself,\u0022 Edmund pointed toward the manual with his mug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas opened it and flipped to the \u0022Designated Callsigns by Mission Day\u0022 section, running his thick finger down the list. His jaw fell open again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ve got to be kidding.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund threw his non-coffeed hand up, \u0022hey, you can\u0027t make this stuff up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first of many times that day, Edgas wished it was over. He looked at the line in the book again. Hounddog. Jailhouse. Engineers. Pfft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the only window on the ops deck, Edgas watched the rover trundle off past the perimeter of the base, its wheels throwing up little puffs of M\u00FCndust as it went.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UZZqWvU.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UZZqWvU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jailhouse, Hounddog, how do you read?\u0022 Radioed Edmund from the rover\u0027s observation seat. Edgas could see his small white form wobble back and forth as the rover went over lumps in the terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe cringed. \u0022Hounddog, Jailhouse, you\u0027re in the pipe, five by five. Telemetry looks good.\u0022 Mission control was monitoring the excursion on a satellite uplink, so Edgas refrained from lamenting the pointlessness of silly callsigns when no one else was on the same frequency. Or body. \u0022You\u0027re cleared to continue.\u0022 He was acting commander while Edmund was on the surface. He could call the rover back at any time if he thought it warranted. That fact brought him little comfort as the rover passed out of view from the window. He had a very bad feeling about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas smirked as a thought occurred to him. He grabbed his tablet from the counter, flipped the telemetry readouts over to it, then bounded to the ladder and up towards the lab.\u003Cem\u003E Standing order is only two EVA\u0027s on the \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esurface\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E, he thought. Doesn\u0027t say anything about... Something caught his eye as he ascended through the lab. A small container of Mystery Goo on a shelf was glowing.\u003Cem\u003E That\u0027s....odd\u003C/em\u003E, he thought. Not particularly \u003Cem\u003Eunusual\u003C/em\u003E, Mystery Goo did odd things all the time. No one really understood it. Just...odd. It seemed to be silently judging him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas put the thought out of his head as he climbed to the small, unused contingency airlock at the very top of the lab. There, he donned one of the quick-use emergency EVA suits, depressurized the lock, and stood up through the top hatch. Banging his helmet against the uplink comm dish in the process. He watched as the rover shambled off across the grayness, monitoring telemetry from his tablet. Then, suddenly, it disappeared. That always disturbed him, how objects simply disappeared when they got more than a couple of kilometers away. It was still there, of course, still feeding telemetry. He just couldn\u0027t see it anymore. Some strange quirk of physics. Perfectly normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221vozCQh.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1vozCQh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rover bounced and tossed its way up the crater wall. Edmund was beginning to regret his decision to make the entire trip in the outside observer\u0027s seat. The rover\u0027s suspension wasn\u0027t as effective so far from its center, and each jolt felt like it was going right up his spine. When he wasn\u0027t simply getting tossed around like a rag doll.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HnrZN1r.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HnrZN1r.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bring it (\u003Cem\u003Eoof\u003C/em\u003E) down another (\u003Cem\u003Egrunt\u003C/em\u003E) meter Billy, getting real (\u003Cem\u003Eack!\u003C/em\u003E) rough out here,\u0022 he said through the intercom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok Ed!\u0022 replied Billy from inside the relative comfort of the cupola at the front of the rover. The rover slowed just slightly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThis\u0027ll be a long day\u003C/em\u003E, Edmund thought to himself. He was already getting sore. His suit was connected to the rover by an umbilical life support line, sharing its resources and saving the EVA pack on his back. He could theoretically stay like this for days. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u0027s not happening\u003C/em\u003E, he thought. Still, it was an ideal place to observe the terrain. Billy could only see a fairly narrow area directly in front of him from the cupola. From up here, Edmund had a nearly unrestricted view of the landscape all around. He\u0027d already been able to guide Billy around some of the larger bumps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned and looked back towards the base. It had disappeared some time ago. Edmund felt a small tinge of isolation that was highly unusual for him. He pushed it away. Probably just nerves. His head was really killing him today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rover was just about to crest the lip of the crater when Edgas crackled over the comm link, \u0022Hounddog, Jailhouse, hold position please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002211ebdRe.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/11ebdRe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund nodded to Billy in the cupola, and the rover slowed to a halt. \u0022Jailhouse, Hounddog, holding. What\u0027s the issue?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mission control just lost the telemetry feed, standby...\u00A0standby... I\u0027ll try recycling the signal\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy Jailhouse.

Only a couple more clicks now, just over this ridge.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a pause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All right, they concur.

They finally crested the crater wall, and were starting down the other side. Edmund thought he saw something just beyond the next rise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hounddog...hold...loosing ... signal,\u0022 flashed with static.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Billy, back it up few meters, slowly.\u0022 Edmund said, \u0022there, that any better?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Affirmative, got a clear signal now. Was loosing audio too,\u0022 Edgas crackled, \u0022I think we\u0027re gonna have to call this one off for now.

We\u0027re almost there, nothing to worry about.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can\u0027t continue without comms. That\u0027s a standing mission rule.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund was getting irritated. His head was pounding. \u0022Now don\u0027t go making me pull rank here. It\u0027s a minor thing, everything\u0027s green here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With all due respect, I have rank right now.

That\u0027s easy walking distance even if something goes wrong.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022I46dsaE.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I46dsaE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Edmund, this is against...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just one hour, please!\u0022 Why was he pushing so? This wasn\u0027t like himself. His head felt ready to explode, getting hard to think. \u0022One hour, then we get to forget all this hoopla and move on.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother pause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All right Ed. One hour. And if I don\u0027t hear from you then I\u0027m getting in the mini rover and coming after you. Agreed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Agreed! Hounddog out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund again nodded to Billy, and the rover moved off down the slight hill. A moment later, a brief burst of static indicated the loss of signal. And with that, Edmund\u0027s headache disappeared. He jerked, startled. He had been through a lot in his life. Aircraft crashes,\u00A0training accidents, and the very public in-flight breakup of his first mission that still haunted him. But he had lived though things he shouldn\u0027t have, and seen things beyond his understanding, yet this was something new. Something he\u0027d never felt before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund was terrified.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nQJWchp.png?1\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nQJWchp.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What do you think it is, Ed?\u0022 Asked Billy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know, son.

They were standing at the base of a massive cubic structure that loomed over them. Whatever was on top, he couldn\u0027t make out. What was it made of? Stone? Metal? He couldn\u0027t tell. The Object seemed to resist being looked at, as Edmund tried to his eyes would slide off, focus on something else. If he forced himself to look, the form went all fuzzy and he started getting nauseous. Hesitantly, he reached a gloved hand out towards it, then made a fist as he yanked\u00A0it back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo.\u00A0No, I do not want to touch \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethat.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a growing feeling in the back of his mind, something he couldn\u0027t quite place.

It took him a moment to realize Billy wasn\u0027t with him. He looked back, and saw Billy still standing before the Object, staring up at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey Billy!\u0022 Edmund said as he started towards him.

Edmund tried to compose himself. This awful feeling... what is..? He detached the imager unit, turned it over in his hands, trying to concentrate. His hand passed over the angular logo stamped on the housing. Wutani-something-or-other. What kind of name is that anyway? Why would they need...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe device dropped from his hands, and fell slowly to the dust. Billy was back in front of the Object.

The Eds had been happy, they found lots of good rocks too. But this one was his. No one else needed to know about it, right? It\u0027s just one little rock. He rolled it about on the nightstand in his cramped cubicle. It sparkled. Alot. Billy knew what it was, of course. Olivine basalt with anorthite inclusions in an igneous matrix. That\u0027s what made it sparkle. Billy could never say that, of course. If he tried to, his mouth got all confused and his throat closed up. So he used small words. The Eds knew that. They never made him feel bad about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027d been doing lots of stuff lately, going all over with the rover. All three of them.
