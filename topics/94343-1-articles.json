If you thrust more than about 10%, the RCS can\u0027t keep the vehicle oriented properly, and it spins out of control. This seems like it would cause huge headaches for people using these scenarios to learn how to play the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-24T04:49:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2014 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by xaf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T08:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know about the tutorials but the stock craft in-game contain deliberate mistakes because Squad don\u0027t think it would be fun to be handed functional designs from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ptonca","CreatedById":133226,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T09:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd another resign to love squad!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xaf","CreatedById":89322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T17:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDon\u0027t know about the tutorials but the stock craft in-game contain deliberate mistakes because Squad don\u0027t think it would be fun to be handed functional designs from the start.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went back and verified it was in a training section - Asteroid Redirect Mission, Part 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be horrible if this was intentional.
