I acquired the SP3 about one week ago. The first signs of the problem I\u0027ve encountered appeared yesterday as I was completing a \u0027collect surface sample/EVA report\u0027 contract. To complete the mission, I flew two kerbals across the ocean east of the space center and landed on the west coast of the next continent over. The overseas trip took about ten minutes of real time and no apparent issues arose. After landing, I took Valentina on EVA to collect the samples. During these missions, I\u0027ve started quicksaving before EVA because whenever my kerbals fall from a cockpit onto the ground, they clip through the ground as they stand up and die in a puff of smoke. On this particular mission, Val accidentally fell, clipped, and died, so I reloaded the quicksave.\n\nHere is where things started going wrong. After holding down the quickload key, the screen cut to the dark grey background of the game (as it always does for an instant when loading a save), and stayed on it. I initially thought the save hadn\u0027t loaded (not holding the key down long enough, perhaps) but holding it again only produced the \u0027hold down to quickload save\u0027 line for an instant before it disappeared, not changing anything. Moving the cursor to the top right corner of the screen produced the highlighted electric charge/fuel/oxidizer info for an even shorter instant, leading me to suspect the game had loaded and the screen was just stuck. I paused the game, but was unable to return to the station. At the top-center of the screen, the \u0027retrieve vessel\u0027 and \u0027return to station\u0027 dropdown buttons were not present, nor was the abort button. The main module (I\u0027ll call it that) to which these three buttons were connected appeared and disappeared like the fuel and mission info icons in the top-right corner.\n\nSeeing no alternative, I forced the game to close, then reloaded it. Since I had quicksaved at the site of the \u0027freeze\u0027, I simply selected that vessel from the tracking station and found myself where I would have been had the quickload worked properly. With one problem: **the kerbals were now moving in slow motion.** There was no lag during the walking/running/jumping/etc. animations, but the animations themselves were significantly slower. I managed to return Val to the ship and recovered it, but the animation bug has persisted ever since.\n\nNow for the throttle issue. Earlier today, I attempted to use a Logitech Wingman Attack 2 Joystick (around a decade old) to control aero/space planes. At this point I had not EVA\u0027d since the mission described above, and didn\u0027t know the animation bug was still present. Anyhow, I set up the joystick by inputting controls for pitch, roll, and yaw. However, I also input secondary key bindings (on the joystick) for raising/lowering the throttle. I immediately went to test the new controls in-game.\n\nThe controls didn\u0027t work well anymore. Specifically, the two buttons on the stick that now raised/lowered the throttle only a tiny degree, as if they were only being tapped lightly. I tried the pitch/roll/yaw, but found they were similarly slow. Take note, the response time was correct; *there was no lag on any controls.* For example, pitching a plane as high as I could on the stick only produced a slight increase in pitch in-game, with no discernible lag or delay. Frustrated, I reverted back to the default keyboard controls, only to find the slowness was still present. The throttle was also slow, even when shift/control were used. I closed the game, unplugged the joystick, and have not used it again since.\n\nI have been trying to correct the problems of slowed controls, throttle, and kerbals. They are present in old and new save files. Manually resetting all inputs in the settings had no effect. Deleting the game files and forcing it to be reinstalled on Steam with all default settings (including inputs) also had no effect. Reducing graphics, rendering, and resolution had no effect. It affects all kerbals and vehicles. I do not know to what extent, if any, the two incidents described above are related, so I have included both of them.\n\nI sincerely apologize for the wall of text, but I honestly don\u0027t understand these problems or how to fix them, so I\u0027ve mentioned everything that might be relevant. Thank you for any help you may be able to afford me!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T13:32:23Z","Content":"Hi A\\_Fossil, I have never heard of these issues before, and for any issue to persist despite re-installing the game and being present on other saves is, well it shouldn\u0027t be possible.\n\nPlease see the [**stickied support issue thread**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide) and upload your KSP.log, output\\_log.txt, settings.cfg, dxdiag log and savegames to dropbox or a similar file sharing site, thank you."}]}
