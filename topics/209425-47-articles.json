I went ahead and \u0022assumed\u0022 (you know what that\u0027s good for) it was the VRAM because the error was graphics related. Although I swear I saw it say out of VRAM on one of the errors but I\u0027m not seeing it now. Here\u0027s what I got after playing around with a few things including SCANSat. Loading up the big map increased both VRAM usage and RAM usage, most significantly the RAM. Both are at the highest that I observed during this particular run which lasted about 15 minutes or so in this screenshot. Although the max on my graph says 1253, I\u0027m not sure whether that\u0027s since the last reboot or ever, but I would have been using active texture management since the last reboot. I\u0027m thinking there\u0027s a memory leak somewhere. Both numbers kept slowly rising, and it never usually crashed until I was a couple hours into the game. However when I changed ships or went back to the KSC screen the VRAM seemed to be properly releasing what it didn\u0027t need while the RAM usage seemed to slowly grow, then release a tiny bit, then grow more than it released. I have 8gb RAM by the way, my usage goes up to around 75% or so when running KSP, a web browser with endless tabs, and a media player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/ram.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022ram.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/vram.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022vram.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigh, technology is a fickle mistress.

Windows, however well maintained, tends to build up clutter behind the screens. If you migrate your installation rather than do a fresh installation, you take that clutter with you.

I pretty much have a tolerance system in my head for whether I do a fresh install or not when swapping out hardware (or any time really). It\u0027s a carefully balanced ratio of how much more difficult and time consuming it would be to set everything back up the way it needs to be versus the overall current performance of the system compared to what it should be. I say that tongue in cheek but it\u0027s pretty accurate... In this one\u0027s case the biggest bottleneck I\u0027ve had since I upgraded graphics card was the hard drive itself (literally, see below) so I just opted to do a pretty direct swap.
