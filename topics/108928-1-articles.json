I want to fly to Antarctica and the dessert/badlands for fun and SCIENCE! but even at maximum time warp this would likely take hours with the plane tech I have now. Do I need a mod to warp faster in atmosphere (I do not have a satellite, and the plane is not that stable that I could leave it completely unattended for days of in-game time)? Speaking of that, is there some way of fixing the warping physics, It seems like instead of just speeding up the computations warping actually makes the game behave differently. Like a parachute landing will work without touching any buttons, or explode on landing if I was warping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus question: I have a fly around getting eva/crew reports and it wants me above 17K, but I seem to top out at around 12K and that is pushing it. Do I just need to add 1-2 more air intakes? and would I keep them closed to reduce drag at lower altitudes (what stat do I need to look at to see that the engines are getting as much air as they need)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) For planes (and rockets on the launch pad) is there such a thing as maneuver nodes. I would love to have an estimated arrival time for plane flying/estimated touchdown location if I cut all engines now. And the planets rotate, so it matters when you launch, it would be great if I could see that if I waited a day I would be better aligned/plan out exactly how much dV I need to add (often I overshoot and end up with 200K suborbital trajectories)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus: Career mode missions, Tourist Itinerary? Is there anyway to know the itinerary before hand (the mission briefing seems to just say they have some unspecified Itinerary). I accepted a mission for 3 who all mentioned an suborbital on Kerbin only to then see that they had Itineraries that then went into detail about how I need like encounters with both Mun and Minmus (and I imagine I need to bring them back, but I think they can be sent in separate missions).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T18:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly i would stay away from planes untill you get turbojet which is not really that hard actually.

Anywhere i wanna go on kerbin takes me about 10 minutes max. You really do need to make your plane solid to be able to warp with 3x tho. If it has anything not solid and actually bending in normal speed like wings that part will bend even more and you plane will bent itself to death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want precision planning for your landing you can always use mechjeb. Game just simply doesn\u0027t provide you with enough info which would be provided in real life.

The basic jet is a perfectly viable engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOP: There are a couple of ways to deal with this. You can\u0027t time warp any faster in the atmosphere because physics can not be calculated that quickly (unless you are on the ground, and stationary). You could wait for turbojets as the previous poster suggested, but that is not the only way. You could also build a suborbital rocket plane which will go much faster than the basic jet alone can, and when you arrive you will still have the jet engine and wings to fine tune your position. You aren\u0027t going to get to orbit, but you can certainly get a high speed jump out of the atmosphere and back down again which is much faster than the long flight over the surface. Generally speaking, the higher you go, the faster you can travel over the surface when suborbital, that rule does not apply to orbit and is in fact opposite. However this is also dependent on your angle of attack. Obviously flying straight up isn\u0027t going to get you speed over the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T19:14:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
