As a result, I can\u0027t have an upper stage, and am forced to launch it balistically like an actual R-7 would (hence my complaint about being unable to recreate its looks - if I am de facto forced to recreate it anyway, I\u0027d like it to look right), which is proving rather difficult. I freely admit that I\u0027m a noob at RSS, so it is certainly possible given enough trial-and-error, but the rise in difficulty between Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2 is massive as the result, which is hardly a good design choice as far as player progression is concerned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn fact, you do have the closest equivalents to the R-7 engines at TL1: the Decurion and the Miles (LV-T45 and 30).

The gimbaling on large engines is so strong that with a 1.5-stage rocket (as described above, I\u0027m unable to have an upper stage for Sputnik 2) keeping it on course towards the end of the burn, when mass gets low, feels like a rodeo.

If there\u0027s a bug/issues tracker I\u0027m happy to post these there (I worry about things getting lost in 170\u002B pages of thread). A lot of these are personal preferences, although some I think are actual bugs or balance issues. I\u0027m still doing things around Earth, but here\u0027s what I\u0027ve got on the tech tree thus far:\u003Cp\u003E- The LR18-4 engine that seems to arrive a tech node too early, as it requires a 6m tank, which is not available until the next node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I was surprised to find rover bodies down the manned spaceflight side of the tech tree. I would have expected them in with the landing legs (that\u0027s where the wheels are).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Sputnik I experiment can be repeated for extra science, unlike most other custom experiments which return 100% science on completion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The geiger counter requires recovery for full science value. I\u0027d suggest tweaking it to return 100% science on transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The LM-00 and LM-00a landing struts have a crash tolerance of 160m/s! This is an order of magnitude higher than other landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Advanced Science Tech has refineries, these might make more sense in the off-world mining tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The cyrostat and IR telescope feels like it would be more at home in the science tree, rather the electronics tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The first radiator node contains a 70\u0022 RCS tank, which seems misplaced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The first radiator node contains two battery packs. I\u0027d suggest putting them in the electronics branch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Gemini unlocks the Manned Orbital Laboratory cargo bay. I\u0027m not sure where the modules are for this, I suspect in the science tree. I\u0027d have them both unlock at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The various storage tanks and bins in the \u0022unsorted\u0022 nodes feel most at home in the off-world mining tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- FASA pod flags have a very low crash tolerance. They sometimes explode when accelerating at high-g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nosecones seem to be spread throughout the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The only conic procedural fairings are German. Egg-shaped fairings come in various flavours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Goodness me there\u0027s a lot of parts! May I suggest moving fairings, aerodynamic surfaces, and tanks into zero-cost nodes that hang off their original parent nodes?
