I have already assembled a tug \u002B crew capsule \u002B core with 12 smaller probes ship, now I was going to dock another tug to an orbital processing facility to be taken to Eve\u0027s orbit and filled by sending something else on mining trips to Gilly. The station was already in LKO, an interplanetary transfer stage was sent to meet it. After getting to around 80m from the target and making the ships relatively stationary, I\u0027ve decoupled the liter stage, rotated the crafts to face each other and discovered something awful... None of them had any RCS! What to do about that... I could\u0027ve sent something to dock in between them and to connect them to each other, but that would take some time and make the construction weaker(both stages were almost exactly 60t, so the smaller stage between them could even get crushed during the burn). I have decided to try docking them anyways, using short pulses from the tug\u0027s engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E The resulting vessel was 129t heavy and ready to go to Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/mtFeQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
