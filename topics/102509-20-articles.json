At any point, from the moment you left the sph or vab and began the attempt in which you landed, planted a flag and drove back to that flag, did you use hyperedit?\n\u003E If so, it\u0027s invalid. \n\u003E \n\u003E Hyperedit is fine for testing. But once you begin, if you fail and wish to pick up where you left off, you must do it the old fashioned way.\n\u003E \n\u003E Is that what I\u0027m reading in your log?\n\nSorry I wasn\u0027t so clear about this. I\u0027ll tell you, but I didn\u0027t mention it before because some details are... embarrassing to say the least. Well, for me.\n\nI made several attempts at this. The one I have screenshots of is the mk3. I abused the launch window and launched 3 ships at once. Number 1 and 2 were kinda weak, when it came to the rover. However, they still had good transfer vehicles. The mk3 was a good rover, with a good transfer vehicle. Unfortunately, and I find this quite embarrassing, I forgot to crew my mk2 and 3 vehicles because the crew module was not a root part, so it wasn\u0027t done automatically. Upon arrival in the Eve SOI, I used Hyperedit to test out if the mk1 and 2 were capable (I feared they weren\u0027t, and I was right). I found this quite embarrassing, hence why I didn\u0027t mention it before. The mk3 had no reason why it wouldn\u0027t make it; it was perfect in my eyes. So, after transferring the Kerbal to the mk3 vehicle from the mk1 (which by the way, I reversed quicksave and put it back into Eve orbit, then did the crew transfer legit), I set of for Gilly, leaving the Mk1 and Mk2 unscrewed and devoid of fuel (almost) in Eve orbit, doing the rest of the launch legit. I realise this all needs proof, so I\u0027ll be uploading screenshots to the original thread of the launch vehicle, as well as the mk1 and 2 in Eve orbit.\n\nJust so it\u0027s 100% clear, I used Hyperedit on versions that ultimately failed. The final version was done legit from VAB to Gilly surface, and the crew transfer, due to quicksave reversing, was legit. All Hyperedit use was reverted before any changes were made to the attempt you see on screen.\n\nUpdate: Transfer proof added to my thread here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130363-Gilly-Circumnavigation-Flying-without-wings%21?p=2114377#post2114377](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130363-Gilly-Circumnavigation-Flying-without-wings%21?p=2114377#post2114377)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T10:20:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 10:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ryan234abc**"},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T16:43:29Z","Content":"After a long delay involving system crashes, real life and 1000s of reworks, trials.. re-designs and suchlike.. **I\u0027m restarting my Elcano Challenge** after the loss of 4409 the way she went was rather depressing if not impressive.. it took a while to recover from that too ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n(twin generator failure on a steep mountain = runaway)\n\nthis time the 44 class is replaced by a 40 class locomotive similar to D4001 used previously as a helper loco.. much more refined though as a mainline leading unit\n\nshe breaks no rules just like her sister trains before her (and there has been many)\n\nDetails on my thread in my signature\n\n![hWWG1kW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hWWG1kW.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T16:52:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Overland**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T18:39:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I decided to tackle one of Kerbin\u0027s newer moons - VUY-519 - or \u0022Tato\u0022 as it is known to Frodin Kermin. \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/Z8r1l](http://imgur.com/a/Z8r1l)\n\u003E \n\u003E Circumnavigation took a respectable 16 minutes.
