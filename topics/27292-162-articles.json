That seems to be what the latest issue is. Once YT detects any sort of music, it\u0027ll likely flag it. A lot of previously uploaded videos are getting hit too. Give it a try, it might work.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGame music isn\u0027t the problem. Music I\u0027ve written myself with commercial (royalty-free) samples is. The licenses for the samples indicate no commercial use allowed (for entertainment purposes only), yet there are a few \u0022artists\u0022 out there who are throwing together crappy tracks using nothing but samples from the same library, plopping them into an album and offering them up for sale on Amazon, CD Baby and the iTunes Store. They then spam the living daylights out of their wares by creating entries on other music sites that point back to the sales pages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently, YouTube doesn\u0027t look at the whole track, it just looks for anything in a song that sounds similar to anything else that\u0027s already posted up on the web for sale. If even a single little teensy sound is similar, regardless of how vaguely it might match something else, the video poster gets a Content ID match warning, which takes months to dispute. Meanwhile the whole video gets blocked in some countries because of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems like unless you\u0027re Jerry Goldsmith and composing your entire background music tracks entirely from scratch for all your videos, you\u0027re an evil dirty copyright pirate who should be banned from the web. Meanwhile, other users are posting entire albums from mainstream artists and making money from the ads. Rotten system for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on-topic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to send the third Sherpa at Duna (piloted by Jeb) out in an attempt to rescue Charlie. Because he was on EVA, the game didn\u0027t want to let me set him as a target, let alone even be able to see him in the map view for some reason. I had to install \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46956-0-21-Targetron-Target-or-command-vessel-from-a-list-of-active-flights!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe Targetron \u003C/a\u003Eplugin in order to get a successful intercept with the poor guy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up with a successful rendezvous, but I had a problem to address. Charlie had no fuel left in his pack, so he couldn\u0027t maneuver to grab onto the Sherpa. Moreover, the Sherpa\u0027s cockpit only seats one, and has no automated control capability. Charlie needed to get in that cockpit to refill his EVA pack, so Jeb had to line up with Charlie, then nudge the ship forward slightly and immediately eject. Once the cockpit got close enough, Charlie could grab on and board to recharge. It sounds much simpler than it actually was to execute. Jeb bumped Charlie spinning away many, \u003Cem\u003Emany \u003C/em\u003Etimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow all that remained was to decelerate from escape velocity. The problem is that Jeb\u0027s Sherpa had been on placed on operational standby due to damage during a previous flight: it was missing the command chair that was normally present on the design. However, since Jeb\u0027s Sherpa was the only one to survive the Breaker\u0027s assault on IPEV Venture, his ship was Charlie\u0027s one last shot at salvation. So, once Charlie\u0027s pack was refueled, Jeb re-boarded while Charlie snagged the ladder rungs on top of the ship. And then proceeded to slowly \u0022slip\u0022 down the rungs. :|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I tried to engage the engines, even a tiny bit, Charlie would soon slip right off the ladder. I tried to just deal with the stupidity of it and just kept bringing him back, thrusting a tiny bit each time before having to bring him back to the ladder again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI repeated this cycle 20 times, and had only managed to shave 100m/s off their escape velocity, of which over 9,000m/s still remained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*cue rage-f9*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"turbo917k","CreatedById":95273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T17:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI installed MechJeb and started cheating\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh the shame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T17:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got lucky with a probe I sent to Jool and got a Layethe intercept on the way in.

Could also do with more lift. Thus, I came up with my greatest creation yet. It is so heavy that it requires vertical solid boosters to lift it once it reaches take off speed, (if it hasn\u0027t exploded by then), but I would call it a total success.
