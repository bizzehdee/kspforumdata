It\u0027s that they somehow don\u0027t realize that Bernoulli Principle isn\u0027t applicable to pressure differential on an airfoil. After all, technically, an air flow over a foil with no camber and positive angle of attack is still faster than flow bellow such a foil. Faster flow? Bernoulli! The misconception of \u0022Lift is caused by Bernoulli\u0022 is hammered from so early on, that they have hard time overcoming it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the case of not being familiar with D\u0027Alembert paradox (which, admittedly, I never knew by name). It just seems like the fact that there is no lift for same reason that there is no drag isn\u0027t as obvious as it maybe should be. But then again, they probably learn the concept long before they start thinking about lift in these terms, so that might be the reason for it. Still, I find it really funny that rather than just connecting and causing a \u0022Doh!\u0022 moment, it causes more of a reset that I\u0027ve mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, I\u0027ve always been able to get through. Just never on the first try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S., it should be noted that it\u0027s entirely fair to approximate lift via Bernoulli Principle at low mach numbers, since low viscosity and low compressibility approximations are fair, so the boundary layer is thin and pressure gradient across it is very small. Meaning pressure differential in flows a small distance away from the wing surface is a fair approximation for a pressure differential at the wing surface. But distinction is important to understand, as well as the fact that this breaks down at higher mach numbers, when compressibility of the flow becomes a significant factor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-26T08:58:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2014 08:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K^2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T09:22:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe misconception of \u0022Lift is caused by Bernoulli\u0022 is hammered from so early on, that they have hard time overcoming it.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s true, it\u0027s routinely taught to aircrew.
