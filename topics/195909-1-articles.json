(Sound familiar? That\u0027s why I\u0027m perplexed by Mercury, I need to know what happened!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenus\u0027 entire surface is apparently about 600 million years old. That means the entire planet erupted in one giant volcanic event at that time, possibly even while Earth was frozen over. Who knows what the planet looked like before then (probably about the same, since there\u0027s been enough time that this could have happened many times, but maybe it had less atmosphere and less CO2 before)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile all the planets are layered, Earth has one\u00A0layer that no other planet has, to our knowledge: the biosphere. Almost the entire surface and most of the volume of the oceans is alive, and elements and chemicals are recycled through quadrillions of active, interactive bodies in a way unlike anywhere else we\u0027ve seen. Recently, Earth has gained the ability to observe itself and deduce complex information, even looking out to the most distant galaxies and learning about them, and even to send living pieces of itself to other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars is curiously similar to Earth, except there does not appear to be much life there at all. Once there was water flowing on its surface, but now only a little ice remains underground and in the poles. Still, though, Mars is home to the largest mountain in the solar system and the (second?) largest valley, making for stunningly beautiful\u00A0landscapes all around the planet. I would love to visit Mars someday, even if I have to spend several years away from my home, Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJupiter is the largest planet around and it is so heavy on itself that hydrogen turns into a strange molten metal in its core. It has beautiful colored cloud bands with swirling storms with lightning strikes so powerful they would arc across a continent here on Earth. It would be excellent to watch the storms swirl - from a safe distance, of course - perhaps from the surface of one of the four amazing large moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaturn is notable because it has the brightest rings in the solar system right now, which swirl and crash together in waves with the icy remains of a destroyed moon. Come to think of it, one of its other moons looks very similar to a fictional device that was made to destroy moons. Hmmm.... Saturn has the most diverse and exciting moon system around it, with geysers of snow coming from mysterious subterranean oceans, and a moon where it actually rains and there are rivers and lakes, with so much air that a person with wings could fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUranus has the strangest axial tilt, and all its moons orbit along with that tilt as well. One of those moons has a sheer cliff with a drop bigger than the altitude of Mount Everest. In the sky above that cliff you can see the perfectly blue-green planet, which doesn\u0027t have a lot of weather because it\u0027s so cold that there is not enough energy for storms. What a view!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeptune is very blue and very windy, with storms racing around and around several times faster than they ever could on Earth. Its largest moon, Triton, gets a great view from outside the ring plane in its retrograde orbit, and you can also watch the geysers erupt from its surface and the clouds roll by overhead. The surface is very active, maybe there is even more going on underneath it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other solar system bodies are also very exciting. We have comets made of ice and the building blocks of what we\u0027re made of, asteroids of all shapes and with moons and rings, icy worlds in the outer solar system which have mountains made of water and plains made of nitrogen. Some of these planets are shaped like pancakes, and some of them are shaped like\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0pancakes. I made a guess that we\u0027d find a donut, but that\u0027s almost as weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Nerd","CreatedById":198691,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-28T14:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaturn, because of the rings and moons and the view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sien","CreatedById":206479,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-29T10:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer the Earth because I like what I can touch with my own hands)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-30T01:08:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nuranus\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbecause reasons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-30T01:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I couldn\u0027t answer the poll because that wasn\u0027t an option)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DDE","CreatedById":146349,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-01T08:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPluto!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-01T14:25:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarth... but if we are counting other ones Titan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuper cold thick atmosphere, so thick it has underwater pressure just walking the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be a nuclear airplane\u0027s dream!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoodbye engine overheating, not going to happen on Titan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust don\u0027t turn it off.
