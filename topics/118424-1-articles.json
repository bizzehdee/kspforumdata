You can use Auto Pruner to automatically rename parts so they won\u0027t be loaded. I use Procedural parts (and B9 Procedural wings, and Procedural Fairings) so I can remove all the (circular cross section) fuel tanks, structural parts, probe cores, all the fairings, and all the wings, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T23:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh this...
