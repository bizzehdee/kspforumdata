I realised upon launch that I needed to make an adjustment so I reverted back to the VAB, added the missing part (can\u0027t remember what it was) and went to launch again. That was when I lost the Kerbals from the lab; you need to add the Kerbals again after reverting back to the assembly building. I don\u0027t think that applies when reverting back to the launch pad though.
