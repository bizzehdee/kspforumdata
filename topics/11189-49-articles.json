The OP states the rules clearly and all mods are allowed except those which alter stock flight physics. Mechjeb is perfectly acceptable. Personally I would encourage anyone playing KSP to experiment with manual control as it is rewarding when you get the knack and you feel like you have learnt something when you begin to understand the relationship between navball and craft flight, though I admit it can be a long and quite explodey learning curve.\n\nAh ok i just love misinformation, And to clearifly I do not make use of the mechjeb\u0027s ascent, or lander auto pilots I only set them up and use em as a guild. I also HATE the ingame way to make maneuver nodes as they are so fekking hard to make so i use the maneuver planer also. The only times i use mechjebs auto pilot is to approach and dock with other craft since I\u0027ve not found a way to make it show me a guild, yet and docking well last time i tried to do that on my own i destroyed the docking ports somehow.... and no i was not moving fast together. \n\nWill be putting together a few submissions for this once I get a stock install loaded up and ready to go, I currently have restore installed and i don\u0027t want to accidentally use a item from there. Even though its just a bunch of scripts to \u0022weld\u0022 stock parts into one, or enlargements of squad parts. \n\nAlso Since the current minimalistic winner is a probe is there a title for a manned version? I have one in my head that i\u0027ma going to whip up and see how it goes. \n\nDamaske"},{"CreatedByName":"immelman","CreatedById":90345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T20:02:25Z","Content":"Hi boolybooly, can I join Mesklin in the making it to Laythe party?\n\nLaythe and back in my \u0022Big Silly Bird 3\u0022, the Joolian system is gorgeous, especially using some of the graphics mod textures out there.\n\nWith more landing gears and drogues landing on Laythe was a lot more straight forward, this craft has more than 8200 delta v, so when I have time I should have a try at Eeloo.\n\nThank you for an awesome challenge!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I dont know how \u0022restore\u0022 works but it sounds like it alters mechanical properties of stock parts which would be against the rules, but I am willing to be corrected if anyone knows different. With docking it helps to set the target port as target and use \u0022control from here\u0022 on the approaching port then setting the camera to chase can also help though the navball should give you all the info you need for RCS control, also btw 0.3m/s max final fyi."},{"CreatedByName":"immelman","CreatedById":90345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T21:47:24Z","Content":"Come and join the party!\n\nRegarding the best way to return from Jool: I\u0027d like to know how you manage 1k/s, when I looked at it I quickly checked out using Tylo for a slingshot, but could not get an intercept. Should I have explored this further?"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T21:58:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Come and join the party!\n\u003E Regarding the best way to return from Jool: I\u0027d like to know how you manage 1k/s, when I looked at it I quickly checked out using Tylo for a slingshot, but could not get an intercept. Should I have explored this further?\n\nUsing a pork chop generator, e.g. [http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) type in that you\u0027re leaving from Jool at a circular orbit of 27184 km -- you are, because you\u0027re leaving from Laythe. That tells you that you need to leave that circular orbit with a roughly 1550 m/s burn. Burn when Kerbin is at -115 degrees phase, and when Laythe is 137 degrees to Jool\u0027s retrograde.\n\nBut that\u0027s assuming you were in orbit there on your own; actually, you\u0027re orbiting Laythe. On the one hand you have to fight its gravity, but on the other you already have ~1900 m/s relative to Laythe since you\u0027re in orbit. I have a [script](https://github.com/numerobis/KSP-scripts/blob/master/planet.py#L213) to do that calculation (based on a [thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/16511-Tutorial-Interplanetary-How-To-Guide) by Kosmo-not), which tells me that if I\u0027m orbiting at 55km and want to be going 1550 m/s at the border of Laythe\u0027s SOI, I need to burn 1024 m/s. I have successfully used this calculation quite a few times.\n\nMy calculation doesn\u0027t say where you should be to Laythe\u0027s prograde. The goal is that you\u0027re going 1550 m/s at the border of Laythe\u0027s SOI and going parallel to Laythe\u0027s orbit, so you probably want to burn a bit before 90 degrees to Laythe\u0027s prograde, maybe 120 degrees? I don\u0027t know how to calculate this (it\u0027s probably easy?)\n\nThat assumes a circular 55km orbit. On Laythe you can be going much faster off your jets alone. If you set periapsis in the right place (somewhere between 90-120 degrees to prograde), every m/s extra you go is a m/s less you need to burn on that escape burn: conceivably you might be well under 1km/s of interplanetary burn.\n\nI did all of this sometime early last year, except I read the phase angle wrong, and ended up precisely where Kerbin would have been had Kerbin not been 180 degrees away in its orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-20T22:10:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2014 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by numerobis**"},{"CreatedByName":"immelman","CreatedById":90345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T00:09:48Z","Content":"This is very helpful, I have been looking for information like this, the thread by Kosmo-not is what I needed. \n\nThank you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-21T00:30:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2014 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by immelman**"},{"CreatedByName":"jmiki8","CreatedById":94688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T21:10:46Z","Content":"Here is my new minmus-capable SSTO, the \u0022Atomic\u0022 which has a seat for a pilot and one passenger.

Just a test flight so far; this plane will go further yet (but with some minor modifications):\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/jznKT)\n\nThe design has hab modules way out on the wingtips so that it can be spun up for artificial gravity during the long interplanetary transfer. Also, long, thick wings for STOL characteristics -- handy when you\u0027re trying to land in the wilderness. Three pilots; all the science equipment except the high-gain antennas; three hab modules. Enough fuel, theoretically, to make it to Laythe and back, but I need some practice piloting to achieve that.\n\nI messed up the bit where you reach orbital speed: I had too much vertical speed, too little horizontal speed (I was going over 100m/s vertical when I ran out of air). That cost me about 1km/s worth of jet fuel, more than I can afford to waste.\n\nI might also practice my landings; Bill had to go out and pump the burst tires after I hit the runway hard and overshot. I won\u0027t be flying with those wheels -- all they do is let me get a 17 m/s head start on liftoff, which is fun but not highly pointful.

With too small a baseline, a Kerbal standing up in one of the hab modules would feel a lot more gravity at its feet than at its head, and they\u0027d get dizzy looking out the window. Practicable designs I\u0027ve seen call for a tether between the habitable parts and a counterbalance (eg spent fuel tanks), and then you spin around the mutual center of mass. The tether can be made quite long, which allows for a slow rotation and little difference in apparent gravity from head to toe."},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T10:54:34Z","Content":"numerobis, I am assuming that by LKO you mean orbit with PE \u003E 70km and I also made up a name for your craft.
