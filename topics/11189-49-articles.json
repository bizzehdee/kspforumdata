The OP states the rules clearly and all mods are allowed except those which alter stock flight physics. Mechjeb is perfectly acceptable. Personally I would encourage anyone playing KSP to experiment with manual control as it is rewarding when you get the knack and you feel like you have learnt something when you begin to understand the relationship between navball and craft flight, though I admit it can be a long and quite explodey learning curve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh ok i just love misinformation, And to clearifly I do not make use of the mechjeb\u0027s ascent, or lander auto pilots I only set them up and use em as a guild. I also HATE the ingame way to make maneuver nodes as they are so fekking hard to make so i use the maneuver planer also. The only times i use mechjebs auto pilot is to approach and dock with other craft since I\u0027ve not found a way to make it show me a guild, yet and docking well last time i tried to do that on my own i destroyed the docking ports somehow.... and no i was not moving fast together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill be putting together a few submissions for this once I get a stock install loaded up and ready to go, I currently have restore installed and i don\u0027t want to accidentally use a item from there.

That tells you that you need to leave that circular orbit with a roughly 1550 m/s burn.

I have successfully used this calculation quite a few times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy calculation doesn\u0027t say where you should be to Laythe\u0027s prograde. The goal is that you\u0027re going 1550 m/s at the border of Laythe\u0027s SOI and going parallel to Laythe\u0027s orbit, so you probably want to burn a bit before 90 degrees to Laythe\u0027s prograde, maybe 120 degrees?
