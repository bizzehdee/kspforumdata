He did cut out the door, hinged it and made a locking mechanism. I cut out the door with an x-acto and access is as good as I could hope for now. Being not only my first plane but also my first scale, I don\u0027t mind the decals got slightly roughed up where I cut the door. If this model survives my first take offs and landings, I\u0027m looking into going super scale on it as far as weight allows (got around 200 grams to spend before a new motor \u002B ESC are needed) and if so, then those decals will go anyway. Found the one to model it after, if I can find more photos/documentations.\u00A0Securing the door should be easy enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong term goal is\u00A0to make it look like this one\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223a1e357e0.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.dhc-2.com/3a1e357e0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-03T09:35:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2017 09:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-03T15:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nonly r/c plane i owned was a foamy spitfire and the wing was a completely separate piece. this was attached with rubber bands to a couple of bamboo rods and the main load bearing structure in the fusalage seemed to be a laser cut balsa panel glued to the foam. the bamboo rods were placed above this. the top of the fusalage was a removable foam peice that just attached with a single screw at the front. i didnt have much trouble installing electronics in that model. the panel was accesible at both the top and under the wing. servos installed into laser cut holes which were line up to the tubes through which control cables were passed. the aileron servo was installed directly in the wing and the cable was passed through a hole provided for passing cables. the model seemed to be pre-balanced as there was a dedicated location for each component, the motor controller, motor mount (really just a piece square dowel glued to the foam frame) even the place for the receiver were all well designated before hand. it was real easy to put together. before long it was held together by epoxy, duct tape and broken dreams and finally gave up the ghost in a rather catastrophic crash. i then scraped the parts. i found a cheap $40 heli kit and most of my parts found their home in that. it sits in my closet with about $80 worth of brand new cnc parts (replacing broken plastic ones) that have never flown. overall i find the hobby way to expensive for my budget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
