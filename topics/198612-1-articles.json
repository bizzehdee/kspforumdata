I have tried the Shuttle Orbiter Construction Kit mod but I have had problems, the loading bay does not appear and the wings appear superimposed one on the other, would there be a solution to this problem or could they recommend a mod that is compatible with the ksp version 1.3.1\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheesecake","CreatedById":138400,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-09T21:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy do you use a very old version of KSP with newer Mods?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
