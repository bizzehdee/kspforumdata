I think there should be as many judges as can be managed by the organizer. A single judge choosing for an entire category could easily choose a winner that 9 other judges of equal quality would not have picked. You could VERY easily get a case where the choices are \u0022A or B\u0022 and 9 judges would pick A while 1 would pick B, and with that one judge in charge of the whole category you\u0027ll have a problem as B would incorrectly win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe voting for the videos we JUST did is an example of this potential issue. In one category there was an initial vote of 2 for video A, 2 for video B, 1 for video C, and 0 for the other choices. So clearly videos A and B were \u0022better\u0022 to more judges. If the C judge were solely in charge, video C would win with 1 vote while A and B lose with 2 votes each. That would not be fair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual judging process needed to be streamlined though. There were too many choices for only 5 judges. The votes were bound to get spread around too thinly. There needed to be a round for trimming the choices (like how real Oscars do it) and then a round for real voting (like how real Oscars do it). As it happens that is what DID occur this time, since most of the categories were too thick to narrow the vote focus down in one round. Next year it should be declared that way from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I\u0027d say things went fairly well though. The OP put a lot of work into the early phases of this, and the judges did a lot of quality judging work.
