So, here\u0027s a brief explanation of what ended up happening.\n\n~~~\n\nSo, I have a busier schedule than most and have to budget my time towards a wide variety of very different stuff. To make matters worse, my computer died a horrible death as I was doing final preparations for the first round of Oscar-B\u0027s. This meant I had to give the results over to Bob Fitch (who did a fantastic job of compiling them and creating a video). I figured that I would be able to start the second round as soon as a new computer came.\n\nAnd then it didn\u0027t come. I spent a good long while finding a computer that wouldn\u0027t die prematurely, then waited for an equally long time as the thing was shipped (I still have no idea what took so long there).\n\nOnce the thing actually came, I joyously sent out a PM saying, \u0022Okay, I\u0027m ready to resume; please send in your scores!\u0022 Over the next couple of days, I got replies from most, but not all, of the judges. To make matters worse, the curtain of work descended again. I thought I would have some time to judge the videos myself and then compile results, but I simply didn\u0027t.\n\nThe worst part was that videos are a bit different than channels. While active channels regularly produce content, videos are snapshots of moments in time. There have been a *lot* of videos that have been posted since the start of this process, perhaps including some that are more worthy of the top spot than existing ones (IMO). So as time went on, the awards became more and more obsolete. After another two weeks of trying to work some time into my schedule and failing, I decided to give the project up.\n\nI\u0027m sorry I never told you guys this. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t have more time. To be honest, I sort of wish I had handed this idea over to someone more capable than me. But I guess that\u0027s just the way the cookie crumbles.\n\nSo if you guys need any more help, please send me a PM. I think I still have all of the video-judging entries, though I can\u0027t remember for certain...\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T21:52:56Z","Content":"Here\u0027s where we are on this.\n\nI received all the votes from all the judges, but only two of the categories had a clear cut winner.

We could get better results if we simply had an expert judge for each category to fairly analyse each nominee, no voting. Which would mean the winners are actually the best, and not just drawn from a compromise. It would remove a lot of the complications we\u0027ve had. We should also make sure to nominate only videos made in the previous year, though it makes sense that this year had to be an exception as it was the first. Anyway, congrats to all the winners ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThat would be a lot easier on the judges as well, giving them a smaller pile of videos to sift through."},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T20:33:56Z","Content":"I\u0027ll have to disagree there. I think there should be as many judges as can be managed by the organizer. A single judge choosing for an entire category could easily choose a winner that 9 other judges of equal quality would not have picked. You could VERY easily get a case where the choices are \u0022A or B\u0022 and 9 judges would pick A while 1 would pick B, and with that one judge in charge of the whole category you\u0027ll have a problem as B would incorrectly win.\n\nThe voting for the videos we JUST did is an example of this potential issue. In one category there was an initial vote of 2 for video A, 2 for video B, 1 for video C, and 0 for the other choices. So clearly videos A and B were \u0022better\u0022 to more judges. If the C judge were solely in charge, video C would win with 1 vote while A and B lose with 2 votes each. That would not be fair.\n\nThe actual judging process needed to be streamlined though. There were too many choices for only 5 judges. The votes were bound to get spread around too thinly. There needed to be a round for trimming the choices (like how real Oscars do it) and then a round for real voting (like how real Oscars do it). As it happens that is what DID occur this time, since most of the categories were too thick to narrow the vote focus down in one round. Next year it should be declared that way from the start.\n\nOverall I\u0027d say things went fairly well though.

I love debate.\n\nYou\u0027ve restated your point and it\u0027s even more clear to me now that I *have* understood you all along. I still disagree. If you want to argue for multiple \u0022content expert\u0022 judges per category then we can entertain that argument. I think you\u0027d be hard pressed to find lots of experts in a subject matter that did not have entries in the category though. I think it\u0027s critical that the judges NOT have a vested interest in the outcome. It\u0027s why I did not volunteer.\n\nAlso, your argument suggests that I can\u0027t possibly rate a movie unless I am in the film industry, or that I can\u0027t judge the quality of food unless I am a chef. Consumers can very well judge produced content, regardless of whether they make that content themselves. It\u0027s kind of the point of public judging.\n\nI do agree with you that next year more care can go into the judge selections. I think this year could be a fluke and the five judges were awesome, but who knows what might happen next year. I also agree that it\u0027s less ideal to say \u0022nominate anything you want but only once\u0022 and \u0022we need judges, hey who wants to help.\u0022 There should be standards to ensure next year is as good as this year.
