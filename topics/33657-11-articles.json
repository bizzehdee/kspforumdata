Making the center port be a 2.5m one would help a lot, as it has a higher magnetic bonding strength; plus, it\u0027s a bigger target, so docking\u0027s a bit easier. Also, I like the FusTek mod (common berthing mechanisms, specifically) which adds a set of four ports (0.625m, 1.25m, 2.5m, 3.75m) that weight a bit more but have considerably more magnetic force. They also look a bit nicer, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the real problem with building a giant ship for long trips is the sheer amount of fuel it\u0027ll require to function. Until we get a resource system for creating fuel on-site (or if you don\u0027t use Kethane now), you won\u0027t be able to refuel the ship without sending out a large bunker from Kerbin every time. The larger the ship, the less effective that\u0027d be. This is a big part of why my own Grand Tour ship only massed about 55 tons, fully loaded; I had fuel depots all over the place, but it would have caused me fuel issues if I\u0027d gone with my original plan to make a giant ship with detachable landers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T20:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...advice...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, now I\u0027m absolutely RARING to go.

Tonight\u0027s plan. I\u0027m going to build a core segment, where it\u0027ll have the 6\u002B1 docking rings on the fore and aft sides (z axis?) but for port startboard top and bottom, I\u0027m going to alter those sides into side docking ports for maneuvering engine clusters. I remapped my action groups to sit on the numpad. Maneuvering thrusters would probably be sufficient with atomic engines, even with a big ship. After all, I don\u0027t need to turn *fast*. The actual pushers I might just set up as a giant array of atomics. Fuel will be a concern, but not an insurmountable one, I think. I can always do fuel ferries. And if I decide to finally mod up, there\u0027s always kethane plants. I can always unseam the ship from the middle and add another module. Kethane refinery?
