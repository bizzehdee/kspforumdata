I tried getting the 1.2\u00A0version back instead, but that made it even worse. It happens\u00A0only in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E/plane hangar. It happens when I press ctrl\u002Bz/x/c/v\u00A0 or just at regular random Intervals. I have 16 gb of ram, and when I start building(even vehicles with less than 50 parts) It gets more often and often until\u00A0it\u0027s unplayable and I have to save/reload game. My memory usage at a point shoots up from 4 gb out of 16gb being used by the system AND ksp,- to 14 gb being used by ksp alone. I saw people calling these problems Memory Leaks, as I\u0027m not too familiar with this term I\u0027m\u00A0guessing it means an absurd amount of ram usage \u003Cspan\u003E:).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSystem specs:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU-Intel Core i3-6100 --3.70GHz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPU-Radeon RX 580 4gb vram\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRAM- 4 sticks of Hyperx fury 4gb ram, in total 16 Gb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use an m.2 ssd for my operating system\u00A0and games that don\u0027t take up mutch space(I.e Kerbal Space Program).

All of these problems started appearing after the 1.3 update up. I love playing realism overhaul, and it recently updated to 1.3 so did I. But it ended up not as fun as I\u0027d expected it to be. Any help would be appreciated ^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
