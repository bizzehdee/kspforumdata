However, ship builders, especially those of aircraft carriers, have a much harder time, even with mods. Infinite Dice\u0026#39;s carrier is old and needs a lot of work to revamp, and Fengist\u0026#39;s Maritime parts mod\u0026#39;s future is uncertain. Neither modder can currently spend the time doing the work either.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt might be time to rethink what boat part mods actually need:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Decent sized hull parts to make large vessels without absurd part counts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Negatively buoyant keel parts will both make ship hulls look like the real deal, and prevent topheavy designs. They could fit flush to flat-bottomed, more buoyant hull parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Carrier deck storage should take advantage of cargo bay occlusion, both from air and water. I understand new hydro and new aero obey this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A workable ballast system to stop listing without excessive complexity. The simplest method is carrying a dense Ballast resource and manually transferring it around. Some cfg hacks already use this method.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- a range of generators, prop engines and control surfaces to power them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- a sensible means of docking aircraft to the carrier. I proposed dockable landing gear (like a Klaw) to ID, which he implemented in his ICE mod. This allows planes to reload on the carrier (leaving them loose is catastrophic) and prevents flopping through the deck if docked by other means. This latter problem could alternatively be solved using a custom carrier deck or landing gear that remains unclippable by parts of the same craft, a method I recall Ferram using for cargo bays.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Launching ships is tricky. The current best way to do it is Bahamuto D\u0026#39;s VesselMover mod. Kerbal Konstructs and the Oceania pack are currently incompatible with 1.0.5\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m no modder; but I can offer a few ideas. I also would like feedback. First, what mods have parts that work right now in 1.0.5 which help address the points above? Second, what modders have WIPs towards the same?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T17:37:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 05:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by colmo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zuthal","CreatedById":136262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T02:35:27Z","Content":"\nOne other thing for launching ships could be something which just allows you to spawn a ship in the water, say, 200 m off the coast of KSC, which could probably be set up with the Kerbinside mod.
