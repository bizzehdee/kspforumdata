I launched two separate kerbal rescue missions today. Both used the same vessel (three Mk1 capsules each with their own engine and parachute). The first, when I was still using 4.8, worked as expected: popped the decoupler and the reentry vehicle drifted away from the ship at about 0.7 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the second, after seeing you had updated DRE and my installing v5.0, behaved much differently. The decoupler made the appropriate noises and visuals, but the reentry vehicle did not move at all. After switching to the now separate vehicle, I had it roll in place and that caused it to move away from the mothership as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw in another thread something about decouplers not behaving correctly in x64, but I was not having this problem until I did the DRE v5 update (from v4.8).

I recommend 2 passes, maybe more if needed... set the first PE to 40-ish, it may or may not be enough to bring you all the way in on the first pass, but it will reduce your AP (thereby reducing your speed when you come back in for the next pass) and also lower your PE for the second pass. With enough patience and multiple passes you can sometimes pull a re-entry with no heat shields, so long as you keep engines on your last stage, though its not recommended...

It takes longer to de-orbit, so running TACLS and using this method can get iffy if you are low on resources, but it will bring you down eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that, at higher altitudes, if you are perpendicular to your direction of travel, you are increasing your drag, and slowing yourself more than if you are facing retrograde.

Chill. I wasn\u0027t blaming you for it, I was trying to provide info on what specifically happened to me when I got the problem. The facts are that it was the only change I made and the problem appeared after the change. In my 30 years of troubleshooting experience a change that was made is, 49 times out of 50, the root cause of the problem (\u0022No, Mr Techsupport guy, I didn\u0027t make any changes. When the problem happened I was using the software just after installing the driver update I didn\u0027t mention until now. Of course, it \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be the driver ...\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it clearly matters so much to you that you think I\u0027m accusing you of breaking things, I decided to revert back to 4.8 to see what happens. I ran a mission just now using DRE 4.8 and the TT-18A between stages 4 and 5 decoupled as expected (74km up, level \u0022flight\u0022, free-fall). I reverted back to the launch pad, shutdown the game swapped back to DRE 5.0 and launched again with the same ascent profile, and checking the same TT-18A at the same point in the flight. Once again, the problem ONLY appears when DRE 5.0 is installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, while the problem may also randomly happen in all x64 games, it CONSISTENTLY happens in my game when I have DRE 5 installed and DOES NOT happen when DRE 4.8 is installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: Reading the post above mine, I decided to try the same test with DRE as the only mod installed. I closed the game again. Moved all the mods except DRE 5.0 and MM 2.2.0 (came with 5.0) to another directory (outside the KSP directory structure), started a sandbox game and build a rocket similar to what I tested above. With 5.0 the TT-18As has zero force. I then reverted the flight to the launch pad (as I did above), shut down the game and switched back to DRE 4.8 again. Interestingly enough, with both TT-18A separations, it also had the problem (zero force).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this tells me that the difference between DRE 4.8 and 5.0 more than likely isn\u0027t the cause, despite initial appearances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, of course, makes me wonder why I didn\u0027t experience the problem before I installed DRE 5.0. The mods I removed were KER 0.6.2.5, FAR 0.14, Kethane 0.8.8, Kerbal Alarm Clock 2.7.7, TAC Life Support 0.9.0.9 pre3, and RT2 1.4.0 (built for 0.23.5). I wonder if something in one of those mods removes the problem with DRE 4.8 but not with DRE 5.0?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-22T00:49:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2014 12:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by krenshala\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding more QA info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snacksquatch","CreatedById":115366,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T02:31:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheDamDog\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheDamDog\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this is entirely a bug, but here goes. Apologies if it\u0027s already been reported.\u003Cp\u003EHeat from the engines appears to be transferring into fuel tanks in 64-bit KSP, resulting in the tanks heating up at the same rate as the engines, or faster in the case of small engines. The heating appears to go on even after the engines reach their \u0027running temperature\u0027. Once outside the atmosphere, the problem seems to vanish as the tanks cool down. Securing the rocket to the launch pad appears to keep the destruction from occurring...but it happens instantly once the launch clams detach. Got a fuel tank up to 10,000 degrees that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part I\u0027m certain is a bug is that the fuel tanks, when destroyed, apparently retain their attachment points. Engines are not destroyed by this process and remain fixed in space below the rocket, drawing fuel from the non-existent tanks. This also creates some really weird camera bugs, as it appears to cause the camera to assume the point between the rocket\u0027s present position and the destruction of the tanks is the center of mass. If you continue flying the rocket in this state, the crew is eventually killed due to g-force damage, regardless of the meter remaining in the green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running a heavily modded game, but nothing that I think would directly interfere with DE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting this too on Win7x64 ksp64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso heavily modded, and the behavior disappears once I uninstall DRE 5.
