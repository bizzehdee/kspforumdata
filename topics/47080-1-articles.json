I was quite happily snoozing, eyes closed but not yet asleep when I was startled by a large orange/yellow flash in my right eye. Immediately following this my eye started watering like crazy and felt rather warmer than it should do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought was I\u0027d just managed to poke myself in the eye whilst half asleep. I did however consider another possibility - cosmic rays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you think - did I just subconsciously punch myself in the retina (something like a dog running in it\u0027s sleep) or was my left eyeball pummeled by a high-energy cosmic ray in a million-to-one happenstance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnswers and discussion below please!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion","CreatedById":75111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T14:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard of the flashes and flickers experienced by astronauts and other exposed people during various activities, but to get such a large flash and eye irritation after the fact must have made it quite a high energy event, by the sounds of things. I think it\u0027s perfectly possible that it could have been a rogue high energy particle, but other conditions vie with it equally to explain it. Maybe it was just some normal physical event (you actually did touch your eye, some small bit of particulate matter in the cabin air got into your eye, et cetera), or maybe less likely, it was a sensory hallucination from the edge of consciousness - funny things happen to your various senses when you\u0027re falling asleep, most everyone knows the feeling where your sense of balance/orientation fails and you wake up from a feeling of tumbling, and auditory hallucinations of name-calls and other things when falling asleep are common too. I\u0027ve never had it myself but it seems credible that one\u0027s vision could experience that kind of brain noise too when snoozing, I don\u0027t have any special knowledge though so I\u0027m just putting ideas out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-01T14:52:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2013 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rodion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Excalibur","CreatedById":12839,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T14:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess I\u0027ll just never know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I always try to be open-minded, and agree that being on the edge of sleep can produce some interesting experiences, however I\u0027ve never once had a pronounced physical effect from what may have been a \u0027sensory hallucination\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I get a cataract in the near future in that eye then I may have a suspect...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T15:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOption 3: You were snoring and the passenger next to you tried a novel way to stop it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Excalibur","CreatedById":12839,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T15:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOption 3: You were snoring and the passenger next to you tried a novel way to stop it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaha!
