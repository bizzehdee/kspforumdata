Sorry if it had already been discussed, but \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 why mod supports only RealChutes parachutes, and doesn\u0027t support stock ones? I look though the code and it looks like to treat vessels with stock chute as controllable you just need to add another check (not only for RealChuteModule, but also for stock ModuleParachute).
