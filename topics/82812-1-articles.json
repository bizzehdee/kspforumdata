Pretend you are in the future, and talk about events that occurred in the future. To prevent a flame war, we will all happily assume that NASA doesn\u0027t get its SLS cancelled and Orion is fully funded throughout its development and China builds its spacestation and goes to the moon while NASA gets its wish of going to Mars and stuff happens and we aren\u0027t a nuclear wasteland yet.

The rocket made it off the pad safely, and the sound quality of the live stream was pretty fantastic. I hope the crew gets to the asteroid safely and all that. We should really fund NASA more, these SLS rockets are pretty awesome. A lot of people are saying NASA is back in its Apollo days, and I sure hope it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sun","CreatedById":66710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T14:24:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027s nice that we finally got back to the moon after 59 years!
