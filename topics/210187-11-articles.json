As in that case, we would just start building our new settlements not only in the Kerbol system like before, but on Gurdamma as well, out of thin air?

My guess is that for the first few updates all parts will be basically free, giving players total design freedom to build all kinds of wild things, which probably gives them a lot more feedback on just how all the basic part interactions, masses, efficiencies, etc. are playing out. It\u0027s not like resource collection and processing can be accomplished by slapping on a few drills and a processor or two. It\u0027s probably one of the most complex and hard to tune systems in the game, and I\u0027m guessing they want everything else running relatively smoothly before they introduce it. As someone pointed out though while some players (me) will probably start a new save on each update, others will likely plow ahead in a single save right until resources come in and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E start over. My guess is the devs would ideally like to see players dive into interstellar travel, all the new engines, whatever UI tricks they\u0027ve got up their sleeves, and the new planets themselves as soon as they\u0027re released, so they\u0027re giving players the easiest possible road to work up to building those missions. Rather than build up a whole resource economy anyone who\u0027s built an orbital shipyard can load up a massive interstellar vessel and go.\u00A0 The only drawback I see is that players will be pretty spoiled by then on free parts, so having to go back and put in the work to gather materials to build them might feel more onerous than it would if it were introduced earlier and skew perceptions of balance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-10-22T23:08:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2022 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aliquido","CreatedById":223019,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-22T23:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you purchase early access, do you have to purchase the full game after that\u0027s released?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stephensan","CreatedById":222320,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-22T23:16:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224189421\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666480144\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223019\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aliquido\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, Aliquido said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you purchase early access, do you have to purchase the full game after that\u0027s released?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nits early access of the full game, so yes if you buy now, you keep forever (unless there is DLC\u0027s that require purchase)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aliquido","CreatedById":223019,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-22T23:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224189423\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666480567\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222320\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stephensan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Stephensan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nits early access of the full game, so yes if you buy now, you keep forever (unless there is DLC\u0027s that require purchase)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOhhhhhhh, thank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-22T23:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224189421\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210187\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666480144\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223019\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aliquido\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 minutes ago, Aliquido said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you purchase early access, do you have to purchase the full game after that\u0027s released?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually that\u0027s the whole point of early access, the developers get some extra funding while development still continues and players get the full game on release while also getting to mess around with the game in development.

Ie: you haven\u0027t unlocked a nerva yet, every tech node above what you have that you unlock it (costs $, but you don\u0027t yet have the points to unlock it) adds some % of failure to the part, maybe some tiny % checked at engine start/stop/throttle, then at time intervals while running.
