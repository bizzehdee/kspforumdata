Then I can set it up so that A and B are still space-like separated, but A actually triggers B. Furthermore, I can have event A be truly and absolutely random, like a thousandth click of a Geiger Counter, or some other quantum event. Then event B can be something simple, like turning on a light because you got instruction from event A to do so. But now the traveler on the rocket will see the light come on before the Geiger Counter registered its thousandth click. In fact, before the atom that resulted in radiation that produced the click even decayed. And that\u0027s a perfectly random process. It cannot be predicted. Yet, if you have faster than light communication, it is predicted by the traveler on the rocket. This is causality violation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrictly speaking, it isn\u0027t a huge problem, because it can also be resolved via entanglement. But this is something that absolutely requires quantum physics. Classically, it is an impossibility leading to all sorts of bad paradoxes. Of course, all that this tells you is that once you start describing space time with a field theory (General Relativity), you need to be describing the rest of the world from perspective of field theory as well. (E.g., Quantum Field Theory.) The unfortunate side of things is that we do not have mutually consistent field theories to describe both matter and gravity. There are approximations one can do, like QFT in curved space-time, but they do not describe all possibilities. And things like Second-Quantized Gravity just flat out fail. Which is why search for Quantum Gravity, or some alternative (strictly speaking, unified field theory need not be quantum) is so important.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T12:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EK^2: its the frame or rather the restriction I don\u0027t get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut an clock at the geiger counter at the light and in the rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 2:00:00 the counter is triggered and send the signal to the light, as the signal goes 100 times faster than light the light goes on say 10 seconds later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the rocket is 2 light minutes from the light and 10 from the counter they see the light goes on at 2:02:10 and get the radio signal from the counter at 2:10:00. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever its no way the crew can do anything with the information, they can not call the geiger counter and stop it from triggering the light even with instant communication or any hard paradoxes.

Even if warp drives are possible, the universe must have some way to prevent them from going FTL, otherwise, the basis of our physical reality- causality- breaks down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some relatively simple thought experiments you can perform that proves this to be the case. Imagine a flat bed train car. In the center of the car, there is a light source, a light detector, and a bomb. The light source sends out two beams of light at the same time, one towards the front of the train car, and the other towards the back of the train car. At each end of the train car is a mirror that reflects the light back towards the source/detector/bomb. As the source, detector, and bomb are in the center of the flatbed car, the two beams of light return to and strike the detector at the same time. The detector is configured so that if the return beams of light strike it a different time, the bomb detonates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that no matter your frame of reference, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethe speed of light is always measured to be the same\u003C/span\u003E. So, we put the flatbed car in motion down the train track, and set up two observers, one observer on a train that is running parallel to the flatbed car, and one observer who is standing on the ground and watching as the train flatbed car passes by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first experiment, we simply fire a beam of light in both directions. Let\u0027s say that the flatbed car is moving at 10 m/s down the track on a foggy morning where it is possible to actually see the beams of light as they travel through the air. The observer on the ground sees both beams of light travelling 3x10^8 m/s relative to the landscape upon which he is standing (his inertial reference frame) of course, but \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Erelative to the flatbed car above which they are travelling\u003C/span\u003E, the beam of light moving in the direction of the car\u0027s motion is going 3x10^8 m/s - 10 m/s, and the beam of light going in the opposite direction of the flatbed car\u0027s motion is going 3x10^8 m/s \u002B 10 m/s. Thus, the observer on the ground witnesses the beams of light strike the two mirrors at different times. However, on the return trip, the beams of light are now travelling the opposite directions, so the one that was going 10 m/s slower than the speed of light relative to the flatbed car is now going 10 m/s faster than the speed of light relative to the flatbed car, and vice versa. So they make up the \u0022time lost\u0022 on the return trip, and end up striking the detector in the center of the flatbed car at the same time. Thus, the bomb does not go off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this experiment, the observer travelling on the train that is paralleling the flatbed car and matching its speed sees exactly what you would expect- the beams of light both move at 3x10^8 m/s relative to the flatbed car (which shares his inertial reference frame), the beams of light strike the two mirrors at the same time, and return to strike the detector at the same time, preventing the bomb blast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, let\u0027s say that instead of a mirror at each end of the train flatbed car, we have replaced each of the mirrors with a light detector and an instantaneous communicator. Instead of a beam of light returning to the central detector from each end of the flatbed car, an instantaneous signal will be sent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the observer on the train paralleling the flatbed car, sharing the flatbed car\u0027s inertial frame of reference, witnesses the two beams of light leave the emitter, travelling at the same speed relative to the flatbed car, strike the detectors at the same time, which sends the instantaneous signals to the central detector at the exact same time, preventing the bomb from detonating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, what does the stationary observer on the ground see? As already stated, he sees the two beams of light travelling at different speeds \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Erelative to the flatbed car\u003C/span\u003E- the one going in the direction of the flatbed car\u0027s motion is going 10 m/s slower than the speed of light \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Erelative to the flatbed car\u003C/span\u003E, and the one going the opposite direction of the flatbed car\u0027s motion is going 10 m/s faster than the speed of light relative to the flatbed car. (But of course, relative to the landscape on which this observer is standing, both beams of light are going the speed of light, 3x10^8 m/s.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the observer on the ground sees the beam of light travelling opposite the flatbed car\u0027s motion reach the back detector/instantaneous communicator BEFORE the other beam of light arrives at the front detector/instantaneous communicator. The observer on the ground witnesses the two signals from the two instantaneous communicators arrive at \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Edifferent\u003C/span\u003E times to the central detector/bomb. The bomb EXPLODES, killing the observer on the train \u003Cem\u003Ewho just witnessed the bomb \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E explode\u003C/em\u003E. What happens when the observer on the train tries to get off the train and shake hands with the guy who just saw him get blown into tiny pieces?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact is, the two observers would observe very different things happening, and yet, still be in the \u003Cem\u003Esame universe\u003C/em\u003E with each other. They would be experiencing different realities, yet, be in the SAME reality. How can this be possible? Easy answer: it\u0027s not. FTL communication is a fantasy that will \u003Cstrong\u003Enever\u003C/strong\u003E become reality, because the very nature of our reality denies its possibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThis is why it is impossible to send anything faster than the speed of light.\u003C/span\u003E Any such device could be used to create a scenario similar to the one I detailed above. Two observers won\u0027t even be able to agree that the same events happened, and will experience different physical realities while being in the same physical reality, which is, obviously, impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it gets worse. The simplest example, as I give above, using instantaneous communicators, but the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eexact same thing\u003C/span\u003E would happen if they had used tiny warp drive ships operating at 2X the speed of light instead of instantaneous communicators. The chances of FTL travel or communication being possible one day are about the same chance as there actually being a Santa Claus. Less chance, in fact, as flying reindeer are not expressly prohibited by the laws of physics, but FTL \u003Cstrong\u003EIS\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put- warp drives travelling faster than the speed of light are a fantasy, PERIOD, and we have repeated experimental verification of this. We have, time and time again, measured and confirmed that the speed of light is always measured to be 3x10^8 meters per second no matter what your reference frame is!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might even be that warp drives are POSSIBLE, and it\u0027s just that travelling faster than the speed of light with them is impossible. That is, in fact, what some researchers have claimed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.universetoday.com/28549/warp-drives-probably-impossible-after-all/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.universetoday.com/28549/warp-drives-probably-impossible-after-all/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically- warp drives would be destroyed by Hawking radiation coming off the inside of the warp bubble once they reached the speed of light and tried to exceed it. So no, funding into warp drives is not necessarily wasted. I\u0027m not sure if they are possible or not. If we could use one to go just 20% the speed of light, that would still open up the stars to colonization- they don\u0027t have to travel at FTL speeds to be useful!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, I just wanted to add that the speed of light isn\u0027t really the speed of light- it\u0027s the maximum speed at which two spatially separated events/things can possibly affect each other. Electromagnetism operates at this speed, as does gravity, the strong force, and, (maybe?) the weak force. We really should be calling it the \u0022speed of causality\u0022, not the \u0022speed of light\u0022. Calling it the \u0022speed of light\u0022 defines it much more narrowly than the fundamental limit that it really represents, and helps to contribute to the misguided thinking that it could ever be broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, please consider the above thought experiment, and you will see why FTL communication would violate the very foundations of the universe and reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-10T15:00:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2013 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
