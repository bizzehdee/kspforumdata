I currentely have a station in orbit at Duna, and am preparing to send a superstation (weighs at least 800 tons) there, and fuel is a serious issue, and this goes for all flights, really. Also, with the better aerodynamic physics, I think you\u0027ll probably be fine as far gliding goes without an engine, but if you really need to, just go with one engine and maybe 600-ish fuel to cut down on weight and size. With a medium sized jet, I\u0027ve gotten 100\u002B kilometers range out of that much fuel, and that jet was supersonic, so you might have slightly better efficiency with something subsonic (not sure about that though). I can\u0027t give too much help with the other stuff, as I\u0027m more of an plane guy. Although this is still a game, I still highly reccomend doing R\u0026amp;D flights, like flying a section just into orbit, then back to test reentry stuff, or something along these lines. Very, very helpful. Also, you might want to try a super/hypersonic setup for your jets, because it is possible to to keep your supersonic speed all the way down to sea level from reentry, even if your spaceplane isn\u0027t capable of breaking the sound barrier in normal flight. If you can stay supersonic, you can also cut WAY back on wing area, and therefore drag and some mass. The JX-4s produce over 1000 thrust at supersonic speeds (mach 3 I think), so that could potentially solve some issues with gliding assistance on reentry. Just my two cents. I feel like supersonic flight is the way to go if you can on the reentry portion of the flight, but that\u0027s just me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, could you post some pictures?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T17:47:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the \u0027bomb bay\u0027 approach, just put a docking clamp on a girder in the middle of the rover and dock it to the ceiling of the bay.

Takeoff and land from Kerbin with the jets, switch to the Thuds when you\u0027re in atmo/taking off from Duna, switch to the Nerv for the interplanetary portion of the flight. The tricky bit would be Duna takeoff...there\u0027s air on Duna, but not a whole lot, so I wouldn\u0027t expect the wings to be of much use. At least your Thuds/RAPIERs would give you sufficient TWR for the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 Kerbals...since you\u0027re going to be pressed for mass, I might suggest a command module area consisting of 4 Mk1 Lander Cans in series with a nosecone up front and the rest of the plane in the rear.

As others have stated, building something that flies on kerbin AND on duna is hard enough. Building something that flies to duna, lands and takes of horizontally will be incredibly difficult as the larger wing needed on duna will increase your drag on kerbin to a level where it will be near impossible to reach orbit with enough fuel to even get to duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever if you insist (and if the fusion engines are efficient enough) I would say land and take of from duna vertically. It should be possible to build something that has a TWR of greater than one on Duna due to the reduced mass (burnt fuel) and the lower gravity. You said VTOL, have you ever tried building a VTOL aircraft? it is incredibly hard (and really inefficient) to balance a plane for VTOL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Dunas atmosphere is so thing that you do not even need a plane since there is no pressure and no resistance to speak of.
