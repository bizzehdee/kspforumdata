A craft that has completely centered CoM and CoL has the potential to flip rapidly out of control depending on the streamlining of the craft. The engine speeds are also aligned with aircraft speed, and the with how high the craft is in the atmosphere. The higher you go, the thrust will begin to further cut off. I find that about 12-11km a sweetspot for air-breathing crafts (including semi-airbreathing SSTO\u0027s). By the time you\u0027re at about 16-20km, the thrust on the engines is down to about 30-10.

It looks like you have some wing surfaces on the underside, and they\u0027re draggier than ever before in 1.0.2 (and you may not need them all). You may just need a bit more speed before you begin your ascent properly.\n\nBest advice is a reactive flight path where you follow the mach effect visuals. This will keep your engines effectively turbocharged and delivering 2-3x as much power.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Turns out the key is to follow the Mach effects, without blowing up. Basically, the closer you are to Mach effect territory, the more air you will have for your engines and the higher their thrust will get (the effect is quite dramatic, actually). If you go too slow, they won\u0027t give you enough oomph, so pull down AoA again until you get mach effects and a decent acceleration, then go up basically as fast as you can. But, once you get close to the thermal barrier (about 1km/s at 20kms, less if lower) you have to pull up to go higher, faster and thus avoid burning up.\n\n**TLDR**: stay ASL until you see white air effects around the plane. Pilot so\u0027s to stay in the white fog during ascent, without entering the red mist until 20km\u002B. Level off if you lose the fog, pull up more if it goes orange.

Two ways to solve this, both include switching to ram air intakes.\n\n1) Moar boosters! Or...\n\n2) Change the way you\u0027re flying it. Rather than lighting the rockets earlier, you can always descend to use gravity and let it help you gain some more airspeed. It seems that this plane\u0027s problem is that it suffers massively at the transonic boundary and simply cannot push through it. So you can either flip on the rockets to push through it. Or you can dive to get gravity to help you push through it. Once you\u0027re through the sound barrier, you\u0027ll see that your TWR goes up the faster you go, until you hit Mach 3.7.\n\nHere\u0027s an image album that might help. You\u0027ll have to find the sweet spot for your Firebird, but I let it climb to around 15km before I just told the crew to hold prograde, let it drop down a couple of thousand metres before pointing the nose back up to start getting positive rate of climb.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The way I\u0027ve been flying is a gentle 10-15 degrees off the runway until the visuals appear, then nose up to just keep on the edge of the air disturbance, usually around 30-40 degrees. Around 15km that gets a lot more shallow, but by 20km I\u0027m doing 650-750m/s even with just turbojets. Rapiers keep pushing for at least 4 more km and should take you beyond 850.\n\nOf course, if you\u0027re never getting mach effects, even ASL... you may have too much drag going on. Without the visuals, your engines aren\u0027t getting the full airflow, and you\u0027re bumbling along at half power or worse; which of course just makes reaching the sweet spot even harder.\n\nWhat sort of kN are your engines pushing out? I\u0027m getting ~200-250 per turbojet with the ascent profile above.\n\nI don\u0027t *think* there\u0027s a terminal velocity issue going on, but the 1.0.1-2 patches did make the air thicker below 14km, so it\u0027s possible that a high drag ship might well be hitting it."},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T10:30:04Z","Content":"Looking at your mass, you might need an extra engine. \n\nYour ship weighs in at 52-53 tonnes.

As a rule of thumb, I go by 1 engine per 10 tonnes of plane. Though your fuel consumption will go up too obviously.\n\nIdeally, you want to be going 1000\u002B m/s when switching to closed cycle. It\u0027s more involved piloting that it was before, and thus a bit harder. My best was 1120 m/s at switch. The faster and higher you end up going while on air, the less dV needs to come from your LF\u002BO supply. It\u0027s a delicate balance, quite fun in fact!

What actually happened was an increase in wing lift, and an increase in drag all around - it was meant to enable capsules to return to ground sensibly, without having to deploy parachutes (which now burn in 1.0.2 if you deploy them while in the fire). The aero change is apparently much heavier below 14km - although like you, I\u0027ve taken a rapier based plane to above that and so far it\u0027s still not willing to go at any decent speed.\n\nUpshot of this is you don\u0027t want any more wing than you absolutely have to have, but it\u0027s ok because falling speed is now much slower anyway.

I\u0027m finding that a combination of rapiers and turbojets can be good though; the turbo produces more thrust at low altitudes and speeds, and can kick the rapiers into the sort of speed that they need to become effective.
