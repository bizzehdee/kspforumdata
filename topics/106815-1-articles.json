A craft that has completely centered CoM and CoL has the potential to flip rapidly out of control depending on the streamlining of the craft. The engine speeds are also aligned with aircraft speed, and the with how high the craft is in the atmosphere. The higher you go, the thrust will begin to further cut off. I find that about 12-11km a sweetspot for air-breathing crafts (including semi-airbreathing SSTO\u0027s). By the time you\u0027re at about 16-20km, the thrust on the engines is down to about 30-10. In-case you didn\u0027t know about any of this, KSP has had a very large aerodynamics overhaul, which now pretty much mimics FAR (a mod that made the aerodynamics somewhat realistic), and has made aerodynamics far more realistic than pre-1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the quick respons ToTheMun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t flip or anything... its just stuck on speed ~300m/s (surface) at about 15km up with TWR 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts coasting at that altitude and speed until fuel runs out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that works is to use an rocket motor to push me higher up... then the RAPIER\u0027s start to get some power again, it just looks like there is a wall of soupyness at about 10-20km\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought is that you\u0027re climbing too aggressively for that particular airframe.

Basically, the closer you are to Mach effect territory, the more air you will have for your engines and the higher their thrust will get (the effect is quite dramatic, actually). If you go too slow, they won\u0027t give you enough oomph, so pull down AoA again until you get mach effects and a decent acceleration, then go up basically as fast as you can. But, once you get close to the thermal barrier (about 1km/s at 20kms, less if lower) you have to pull up to go higher, faster and thus avoid burning up.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008080;\u0022\u003ETLDR\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E: stay ASL until you see white air effects around the plane.

Around 15km that gets a lot more shallow, but by 20km I\u0027m doing 650-750m/s even with just turbojets.
