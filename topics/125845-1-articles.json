In fact, there was a substantial effort in the 1980s to create \u0022standard\u0022 probe designs for large and medium/small missions, the Mariner Mark II and Observer-class spacecraft, because people back then thought that standardization might help save money. In fact, this meant that you had designs poorly suited to their missions (for instance, they were planning on launching Cassini and a mission they called CRAF which was basically Rosetta on the same Mariner Mark II bus, which forced a lot of awkward compromises on the design), and, in the event, there wasn\u0026#39;t the budget to launch more than one probe of the same type anyways. Of the first two Mariner Mark II missions, CRAF was killed relatively soon, while all of the Observer missions except Mars Observer also soon went away.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd...well...Mars Observer also tried to use standard communications satellite designs to save money. It, uh, didn\u0026#39;t go too well (it blew up while entering Mars orbit). The only good part about the whole saga was that Mars Observer paid for all of the instruments that went on Mars Global Surveyor, which is a good part of why that mission was so very cheap (seriously, compare the two missions and you\u0026#39;ll see that their instrument suites were virtually isomorphic).\n"}]}
