If you head \u0022inwards\u0022 from a circular orbit, your orbit heads downwards at that point. That means that a quarter of an orbit away you will be closer to the body (and therefore faster than if you hadn\u0027t made a radial burn), at the opposite side your angle will head away from the body, and three quarters of an orbit later you will be further out and slower. Assuming your orbit is eastwards, then looking from above (from the north) you will have made your orbit \u0022slant\u0022 to the left, \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Erotating about your present position which cannot change\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly with prograde: you speed up at your current position, so you will be slower at the opposite side, and the most significant change is a quarter of an orbit later (your trajectory will be angled further away from the body) or three-quarters of an orbit later (you\u0027ll be angled in towards the body).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo obviously, prograde at one point in the orbit is very similar in effect to radial-out a quarter of an orbit later, which is similar to retrograde a quarter of an orbit after that, which is similar to radial-in a quarter orbit after that, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main difference is efficiency: one prograde burn is the same as doing two slightly smaller (and opposing) radial burns a quarter and three-quarters of an orbit later: so if all you want to do is raise your Ap, it is far more efficient to do one prograde burn. Conversely (although the situation arises less frequently), if you want to change Ap and Pe in opposite directions (such as to circularise to match a satellite\u0027s orbit as you cross it) one radial burn wil probably be more efficient than two separate prograde/retrograde burns at Ap and Pe.
