But not every possible binder is reactive. I think I\u0027d start by researching silicone options. It has some organics, so it does have some reactivity, but that\u0027s basically just going to allow it to disintegrate as oxidizer is consumed. It shouldn\u0027t be capable of self reacting under any conditions, I don\u0027t think.
