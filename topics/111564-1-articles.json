I\u0027ve built multiple-launch orbital stations, sent a crewed mission to Duna, sent probes to Jool, Moho and Eve, played around with nukes and Ion engines. I\u0027ve also downloaded a few parts mods - nothing too far from stock, so no antimatter, no warp, no liquid hydrogen for nukes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m toying with the idea of a massive interplanetary ship that will be built in high kerbin orbit from several sections - CM, SM, engine block - before having a few smaller craft attached to it for independent landings. It\u0027s powered by six nukes and when fuelled, currently has around 8k Dv (though I anticipate this will drop to 6k once it\u0027s fully equipped). I figure that\u0027s enough to get to Jool from HKO and have a bit of a poke around. However, getting back is hard - and my plan for this ship is that it\u0027s 100% self-contained once it leaves Kerbin\u0027s SoI. So basically I want some help with the design of its refuelling unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see three possible ISRU strategies:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) refine on surface, ship fuel only back to mothership. This seems to be the most efficient, but given that it will leave its refinery, drill and ore containment behind, it\u0027s not self-contained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) refinery drop-ship that mines, refines, and returns. This seems horridly inefficient - experiments on minmus with a similar setup produced poor results; the lander used up almost all the fuel it produced returning to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) lander mines, mothership refines. I\u0027ve also toyed with this idea on Minmus, but with little luck. Getting enough Dv to lug the drills, tanks and ore around burns a lot of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts? Should I give up on the self-contained idea, and just start flinging scanning probes, automated surface refineries and orbital tankers at various parts of the system? Or is a self-contained interplanetary voyager possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just thought of a possible option 4: refinery, drill and ore tanks in one ship, tanker as a second one, with the tanker making several runs to refuel the mothership.

Just integrate everything into a single vehicle: one or two drills, an ISRU, an ore tank, biiiiig fuel tanks, and a big efficient engine or twelve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, you can get away with having just one of the smallest ore tanks, for a start.

The Rhino engine is probably your best choice, it has nice TWR, high thrust, and one of the highest ISP among chemical engines of KSP. This would let you get intersects to any planet and have enough left for landing comfortably afterward, anywhere. Well you might need to stop by Pol or Bop for refuel before attempting to land on Tylo, but that\u0027s the only limitation I can foresee. Ah, and you\u0027ll need fuel cells, of course. You can fully power the mining and refining processes from a fuel cell from the LFO they produce (no, this does not contradicts the laws of thermodynamics, because the ore is not really an \u0022ash\u0022 and is very different from the by-products of burning the LFO for thrust or for electricity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunching it: you don\u0027t have to make it an SSTO ! Except for exploring Laythe or Eve surface, you\u0027ll only need to push it once through any significant atmosphere. So, you can safely assume it\u0027ll only do vacuum landings. Have launch stages on it for the initial climb out of Kerbin, and don\u0027t bother any further. You can even expend all but 1500-2000 m/s of its last deltaV, and plan to refuel at Minmus before leaving Kerbin. This way, you can make it simpler and lighter than anticipated, and it\u0027ll give you an opportunity to train at landing-refuels in one of the easiest setting possible (yeah, Minmus is easy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat leaves the problem of Kerbin return...

I\u0027ve recently struck Laythe from the list of possible landing sites: a simple jet can touch all biomes without refuelling and return the data to orbit, after all. The latest variant has two KR2L instead of the four Mainsails, still enough for Tylo and saving 12 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve modded my Nervas to weigh 20t@360kn; in stock parts, that would be 48 nuclear engines (and another 150 structural and radiator pieces). With ISRU, I find that I can well afford 4-5m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 from nuclear engines, but sadly, my computer can not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ksp.schnobs.de/stuff/ISRU_GT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ISRU_GT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T18:11:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 06:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYe goode olde three-point connection goes a long way.
