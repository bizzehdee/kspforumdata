Serenade no. 13 \u0022Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\u0022 - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Another famous and relaxing piece, also played a lot in Little Einstein\u0027s)\n\n2. Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 in D -Edward Elgar (Adapted as graduation theme, and a sung version, \u0022Land of Hope and Glory\u0022.)\n\n3. Canon in D - Johann Pachelbel (Frequently used as Wedding March, and overall causes \u0022feels.\u0022 \\*tears up)\n\n4. Turkish March - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Another famed Mozart piece. Surely, Turkish soldiers marching to this must have really, really quick feet!)\n\n5. Symphony 5, Op. 67 - Ludwig van Beethoven (The victory theme! Epic in the first movement, but rather relaxing and slow in the others.)\n\n6. Four Seasons - Antonio Vivaldi (I\u0027ve never heard such a relaxing piece before..)\n\nThere are more, of course, but it\u0027s quite a lot, especially if I mention all in one thread.\n\nSo, what about you guys?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T06:35:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 06:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Columbia**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T13:48:39Z","Content":"I\u0027m a keyboard (Any kind of instrument with a keyboard will do ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ) player myself so i play/listen alot of bach (on harpsichord not piano you savages!) and French composers like rameau couperin and stuff.

An Italian nobleman, lutenist, and also murderer (he assassinated his wife Donna Maria d\u0027Avalos and her lover the Duke of Andria in their bed, and according to some sources, he also killed his second son by Maria, after doubting his paternity). Director Werner Herzog, always interested in the frontier between genius and madness, made a good docu-fiction about his life, *Gesualdo : Death for Five Voices*, in 1995.\n\nBack to his music, Gesualdo is a composer of the late Renaissance era, and his work was strongly criticized in its time, as it somehow stands between Renaissance and Baroque music. Gesualdo is praised today for his early use of dissonance and audacious chromatic juxtapositions.\n\n**\u0022In Monte Oliveti\u0022**, from the ***Tenebrae Responsories For Maundy Thursday***, performed by the Schola Cantorum N\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCrnberg.

It\u0027s a beautiful slow-paced version. The musicians were asked to gradually alter the tempo and other elements of the composition.
