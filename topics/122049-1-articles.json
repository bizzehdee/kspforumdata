To get closer to Kerbin you have to reduce your velocity relative. If you are moving in the opposite direction as the moon when you leave, the resulting velocity relative to Kerbin is your velocity relative to the moon MINUS the velocity of that moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe faster you are going when you leave the moon, the closer your PE will be to Kerbin. (If you go too far, you\u0027ll crash into Kerbin or end up orbiting in the opposite direction.) For the best fuel efficiency you will adjust it so that your planned orbit around Kerbin will bring you well within the atmosphere. I\u0027m not sure the best number, but probably a PE of 10km to 40km. The downside is that you will absolutely need a heat shield to survive, and also you won\u0027t be able to adjust your landing point much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T03:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually place a manoeuvre node in roughly the right area on the orbit and pull the prograde handle until there\u0027s about 270m/s (170m/s for Minmus) on it and then move the node around until I have a tangential escape vector before fine tuning the periapsis for an aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v499/swampmonster/Kerbal%20space%20program/MUN%20RETURN_zpsugtqm906.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MUN%20RETURN_zpsugtqm906.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T04:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022QuantumInc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022QuantumInc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure the best number, but probably a PE of 10km to 40km.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what other people do, but I usually target a Pe of about 42 km from LKO, about 30 km from Mun/Minmus, and about 25-30 km from deep space.
