With stock parts I managed to build rockets that flew nearly perfect during ascent, and i managed to reach Eve, Duna, Jool and other planets and moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently I decided to upgrade my KSP experience by downloading som part packs (You gotta start somewhere \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E). With these packs (primarily KW) there follows, of course, bigger engines and this stability problem occured again. Only this time I couldn\u0027t help it even though I used the extra strong struts, which was also included. I am fairly experienced in this game and therefore it frustrates when I find it difficult to find threads with this topic. Btw I can\u0027t explain to you how much I hate struts. They are ugly and you don\u0027t see the on rockets anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I know some, if not many of you will think that \u0022I just have to try and build it a bit stronger\u0022, but just try and hear me out. I agree that you shouldn\u0027t be able to a rocket that is more wide than it\u0027s tall, and I believe in good and not to mention good-looking rocket designs. And because of the forum I know, that a lot of people in the KSP community just can\u0027t get enough realism in this game. Every day there are new discussions about realism vs. gameplay over numerous ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is my idea: How many times have you, in real life, seen at rocket dancing from side to side, parhaps breaking at some point during the launch? You don\u0027t see struts either on real rockets. We see them \u0022arcing straight through the sky\u0022. Yes it would be potentially much easier to liftoff a rocket, but it would undoubtably also be more inviting to new players. Oh yes and did I mention it would be much more realistic?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it would remove pretty much all the challenges we as engineers are currently facing when we design our rockets. So realisticly it should perhaps be implemented together with some sort of optimization of the aerodynamics. That would reward more traditional rockets and it would therefore still be challenging to send up odd sized payloads, but as long as the aerodynamics of the rocket are fine it should in most cases be stable - without the use of the ugly struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS I know that struts was used to connect for instance the external fueltank with the shuttle itself, but when did you ever see struts connecting two segments of the Apollo rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone shares my views\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ernest3.14","CreatedById":75412,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T00:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo rockets have plenty of struts.
