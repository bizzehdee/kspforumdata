In case you didn\u0027t immediately grasp what this means - it translates directly to \u0022not anywhere near the launch site, or anything else manmade for that matter\u0022. You then have to bring expensive, heavy equipment into that fairly remote piece of landscape in order to retrieve your craft... or you have to fish it out of the ocean, where the craft itself will have suffered corrosion damage from the salt water while it was waiting for pickup. In some cases, this may mean that it\u0027s cheaper to just build a new craft than try to repair the old one, meaning you have no reusability, and launch prices will remain high.

SSRBs jettisoned their nozzles just before the spalshdown, to avoid damaging the casing. With a liquid rocket, you\u0027d have to ditch the engine... which is pretty much the whole point of recovering it in the first place. Tanks and SRB nozzles are cheap, engines aren\u0027t. Also, with a parachute-only descent, you can only splash down. In Soviet space program, all capsules that landed with crew used landing rockets. The exception was Vostok, which had another cushioning system - pilot\u0027s own legs (he/she ejected halfway through terminal descent).

For unmanned single-use spacecraft, a \u0022heavy\u0022 landing (typical parachute descent speeds at impact are \u0026lt;10 m/s, equivalent to roughly 20 mph/32 kph) isn\u0027t a big issue, as the hardware can take more of a beating than squishy human bodies. For manned spacecraft, it\u0027s more of an issue, but not a critical one--all of NASA\u0027s capsule-type spacecraft were designed to make land (\u0022contingency\u0022) landings without significantly injuring the crew. (They would have bumps and bruises, but no open wounds, broken bones, or concussion from the impact.) This was done because, under certain wind conditions, a launch abort off the pad or in the first twenty to thirty seconds of ascent could, theoretically, see the spacecraft blown back onto land by the wind, in addition (in Apollo) to providing a \u0022wherever they come down\u0022 landing capability in the event of a post-TLI abort on a lunar mission requiring a turnaround rather than a lunar swing-by a la Apollo 13.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe method used was by using crew couches designed for shock absorption, mounted on struts specifically designed, should there be excess accelerative loadings on impact, to crush and thus provide cushioning to it. (The struts were actually quite similar to the crushable shock absorber structure in the LM landing gear.) A water landing was the preferred option, by far, but a land landing would be survivable, even factoring in the need to exit the spacecraft and survive until the SAR forces found you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one flown exception to this was Apollo 7, where the Block 2 Apollo CM used had to be flown with the Block 1 CM\u0027s crew couches, as the Block 2 couches wouldn\u0027t be ready until Apollo 8. Testing after the AS-204 fire found that the Block 1 couches were marginal, at best, in a \u0022contingency\u0022 landing; as a result, Apollo 7 was the only Apollo mission to have a special mission rule that put more restrictive limitations on the winds at launch, to ensure that an abort would see the spacecraft land in the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENASA has acknowledged that they did NOT want to deliberately target a land landing with a pure parachute design, at least for a round parachute design, because it was likely to beat up the astronauts and they couldn\u0027t *guarantee* that there wouldn\u0027t be serious injuries. (The initial impact would not be a problem; however, if the spacecraft tumbled down a slope, the crew might well be injured.) This is why, during the period when Orion was expected to eventually transfer to landing at Edwards AFB instead of the ocean (to reduce refurbishment requirements for reuse of the capsule), the plan was to carry a Soyuz-type retro-rocket to cushion the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the Gemini spacecraft was originally planned to be the great exception, using a Rogallo parafoil wing to glide to a landing on a runway at Edwards, requiring no impact cushioning at all due to the use of lift to touch down as gently as the Space Shuttle eventually did. (The parafoil was only dropped for time reasons; development had hit snags, and a circular parachute was substituted to keep Gemini\u0027s support of the lunar program on time.) Given that such parafoils are now widely used by skydivers, and the US military is testing combining them with GPS guidance systems to allow precision airdrops of supplies and equipment, use of a parafoil for a runway landing may end up being the preferred primary option in the future, with a circular parachute system as a contingency option...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
