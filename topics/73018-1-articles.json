A few seconds would be all you need for the two objects to drift far enough apart to not be selectable with the [ or ] keys. Additionally, if the spacecraft itself went below 23km, the game likely automatically deleted it, as it does all orbiting objects not focused upon that breach that altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T00:23:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly way I can think of saving that mission is if you\u0027ve quicksaved.
