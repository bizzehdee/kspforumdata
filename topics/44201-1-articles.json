It contains somewhat practical engine test results as well as data gleaned from the KSP game editor (VAB/ SPH) and Wiki. It is sorted by the max mass each engine was able to successfully launch with from sea level, what I designate as \u0022strength\u0022. This is sometimes in line with Squad\u0027s thrust data, but sometimes not. Altitude figures of a second test at sea level are of each engine using a small tank, which sometimes is in line with iSP, but again, sometimes not. I refer to this as \u0022efficiency\u0022. You may also compare Squad\u0027s T/WR (and other characteristics) of the engines. All engines are compared (inline, radial; liquid fueled [rocket \u0026amp; jet], solid boosters, monopropellant thrusters, ion; even a Kerbalnaut with EVA pack). Common questions are addressed by the info at the side and keys \u0026amp; comments at the bottom of the chart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone wishing to sort Squad\u0027s data may do so using the interactive page of stock parts at the KSP Wiki.

You spent a lot of time in game converting the thrust values of stock engines into mass ratings via testing instead of math, and then measured burn rate in terms of some random tank instead of ISP, in such a way that the values in your chart are only useful immediately after launch because every engine except the toroidal aerospike has curves pertaining to velocity and atmospheric density?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou did know that thrust \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eis\u003C/span\u003E strength, and ISP \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eis\u003C/span\u003E efficiency, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T03:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreys, the chart is a result of my wanting to actually experiment with the engines and test them ... sort of like someone wanting to ... build and fly things in KSP. I didn\u0027t suffer from the experience; rather enjoyed it actually. I decided to put the data on a chart to share. The tests result in real simulation information. As for thrust (power) and specific impulse, they do not always correlate in sequence (although they tend to do so). The chart is a way of visualizing data in ways that might not be obvious to everyone. For example, 3 radial 24\u0027s are quite capable in some applications, but I\u0027d not normally think of using them due to the mere look and sound of them in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody is twisting your arm to use the chart, much less download it. My motivation to make the chart was as a tool for me, and I do use it along with other design considerations in my craft. But I share the chart for anyone that might find it to be useful, or at least entertaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: while the mass at lift off may only have meaning at that moment, the column next to it shows max altitude figures, which have some meaning only at the peak of the flight. Also, the test using the small fuel tank yields results which only have meaning at the peak of the flight. It follows that the same view can be had about any data (inc. thrust, iSP or TWR), since those values are maximums and may be made variable by throttle settings, loss of fuel mass and loss of decoupled mass. All of these are static values and it is true that they are best compared in view of changing dynamics (such as graphing the math you mentioned to show a range of possibilities).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-31T16:10:18Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2013 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdditional info.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"egreSS","CreatedById":75821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T12:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was searching to see if anyone has done it yet and this is the closest to what I found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking of creating a simple in-game mod that will plot selectable metrics for 2 or more parts, e.g. TWR - \u0022Mainsail\u0022 vs \u0022Skipper\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen graph them, could be done fairly easily even by me and of course support any applicable part including all of a user\u0027s installed mod parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot aware of anything like it so far, but I just started looking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
