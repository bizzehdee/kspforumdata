As some other mods use custom plugins to use the resources. So infinite fuel does not work.\n\nIt works as a rtg texture that is able to be right clicked and access the menu..\n\nTLDR it is a generator module that adds has a big number. To add resources to the craft (tanks not included!!)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T01:50:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 01:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Joshwoo69**"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T08:33:33Z","Content":"new mod.. fixed some stuff so update."}]}
