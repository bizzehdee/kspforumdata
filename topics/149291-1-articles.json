I have trouble not exploding the thing on relatively gentle reentry angles (40km periapsis) just returning from 450k orbits (still true in 1.2 despite pointy-object aerodynamic changes).\u00A0The inline Mk2\u00A0and Mk3 cockpits have separate parts as noses (like a shielded docking port) which seems to disperse\u00A0the heat better and solve the issue. Just about any re-entry is quite harrowing with the Mk2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this the intended (rather than simply emergent) behavior of the Mk2 cockpit?

Blunt objects get to benefit from something called shockwave detachment (creating a bow shock). This is effectively caused by the air immediately in front of the nose not being able to get out of the way fast enough, and thus creating a sort of barrier between the nose and the supersonic/hypersonic airflow. This results in the shockwave (which is what we hear as a sonic boom) being moved forward, away from the nose. This greatly reduces the amount of heat which thee nose must endure. That being said, it does produce a rather significant amount of drag\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-06T13:44:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheres a reason why high speed aircraft or spacecraft (spaceshuttle) have blunt noses.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSharp edges tend to soften or even melt faster then a more blunt end on a fuselage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLess of a volumetric area means it absorbs and dissipates heat more quikly.
