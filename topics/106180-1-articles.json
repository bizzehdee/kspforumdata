It\u0027s weird, the problem isn\u0027t present near the beginning of a launch (say, I launch my rocket and have it immediately crash into the ground), but once I gain altitude (say ~5 km and more), any explosions will have the choppy sound, including any debris that hits the ground through staging (Kerbal X stock rocket\u0027s boosters for example). It seems like the sound engine is having issues dealing with multiple instances of a single sound being played simultaneously. I was hoping this would be resolved in 1.0, but it\u0027s still there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if it\u0027s just me since I haven\u0027t found anyone else reporting the problem. This has become too much of a noticeable problem for me to ignore while I have been developing a new plugin that revolves around explosions. I have updated my sound drivers, re-installed them etc., and I have no sound issues in any other game/application. I\u0027ve tried changing the audio settings in-game and I think that bumping the responsiveness in the normalizer to max may have helped very slightly, but I cannot tell. OpenGL mode seems to reduce the issue, but it\u0027s still there. All other sounds are fine in game, and it\u0027s definitely not the general sound stutter that can be common with the Unity engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESystem Specs\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 7 Ultimate x64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti (Primary Monitor)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GT (2nd \u0026amp; 3rd Monitors)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntegrated Audio (Realtek HD) on an ASUS P8 Z68-V Pro Motherboard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel i7-2600K CPU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16 GB DDR3 RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E128 GB Corsair SSD / 2 TB Seagate HDD\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T02:02:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stevehead\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corovaneer","CreatedById":26202,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame here, but I even kinda like it.
