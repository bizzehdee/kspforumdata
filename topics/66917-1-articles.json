It\u0027s a pretty simple design consisting of four parts: The core propulsion module, an extra fuel module, science lab and habitat module, and a separate orbital vehicle for its two-man crew to use. It was originally planned to use a proper crew return vehicle, but that proved a bit heavy so the \u0022orbital rendezvous\u0022 return plan was developed. The mission was a success, but unfortunately the flight computer got a bit wonky once in Eve\u0027s SoI, so the crew had to wait there for a replacement guidance system and refueling mission. It had been planned to use the \u003Cem\u003EDyson\u003C/em\u003E for at least one more mission, possibly a Moho flyby, but the current plan is to break down the ship and reuse its (nuclear powered) propulsion module as the generator for a ground base on Minmus or the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7300/13320859573_b95753f94e_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213320859573_b95753f94e_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next interplanetary design, the \u003Cem\u003EOberth\u003C/em\u003E.

Currently its first mission is still in the planning stages, its target will likely either be Duna for a manned Ike landing, or Eve of a manned landing on Gilly, though Dres is also a possibility.
