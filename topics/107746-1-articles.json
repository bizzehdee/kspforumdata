If someone knows what it does, please correct me.\n\nAlso, I was looking at Ore.cfg in the Squad Resources folder, and I was wondering if there are other places to define resources. In the config, global definitions, planetary definitions, and biome definitions were made. Is there a way to do atmospheric ones?\n\nAnd about the tech tree- I have heard that I can use ModuleManager to add new nodes to the tree, kind of like what techManager used to do. If this is right, how do I go about doing it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Merill","CreatedById":136069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T15:52:08Z","Content":"Specific Heat Capacity\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity#Extensive_and_intensive_quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity#Extensive_and_intensive_quantities)\n\nand it\u0027s hsp, not shp.
