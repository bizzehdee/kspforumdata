I was playing KSP right now, I crashed my little science rover, so I clicked on \u0027Revert\u0027, but missed the \u0027Hangar\u0027 button so I went back to the runway.\n\nRight after it loaded, I pressed Esc \u003E Revert \u003E Hangar. \n\nPoof! No more KSP! Only a small error window telling me where the log was and that I should give it to the devs. So here is my crash folder: [http://we.tl/zYYwTTiNIr](http://we.tl/zYYwTTiNIr)\n\n-Sorry for bad english"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:52:43Z","Content":"This is a bit of an old issue I think. It happens if you are quick on the revert button right as the physics is loading up. I doubt this one will ever get fixed. However, if you wait a couple more seconds, it should bE fine to revert.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
