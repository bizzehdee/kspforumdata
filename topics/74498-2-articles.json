I have actually removed a lot of fuel from the tanks to get a reasonable TWR on liftoff. I haven\u0027t done any sort of calculations, but based on the amount of fuel that I\u0027ve removed, it\u0027s possible that the clipped areas do not actually provide an unrealistic fuel volume. The other thing I would point to is that the arrangement of tanks is supposed to represent a 6.4m cylindrical structure. Since\u0027s it\u0027s not perfectly cylindrical due to game constraints, there is some extra volume there, albeit imaginary. Here\u0027s an MS Paint representation of the tank structure, showing the \u0022imaginary\u0022 tank space shaded in grey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wFRpftW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wFRpftW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main goal here was to create something with the size and scale of the real Saturn V, while functioning very closely like the real thing. The real Saturn V would make quick work of KSP\u0027s tiny scale, so I had to make some compromises to keep things believable within the KSP context. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually am a bit disappointed that I had to resort to clipping two Mainsails together for each of the F1 engines in the first stage. Thanks to ARM, there is an engine in-game that would be able to pull off the lifting capabilities I needed: the KR-2L Advanced Engine. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0027t get that engine to look right in terms of scale. I\u0027m willing to consider releasing an alternate version with those engines so I can have a less \u0022cheating\u0022 version of this craft. It would also have the benefit of reducing the parts count.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T14:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeautiful \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Truly beautiful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GusTurbo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main goal here was to create something with the size and scale of the real Saturn V\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks for me to be too large.
