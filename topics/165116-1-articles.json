If you can dock spacecraft in orbit already then you\u0027re ready to go to other planets. If you can\u0027t, practice rendezvous maneuvers around Minmus (because it\u0027s cheap on fuel so mistakes won\u0027t be too serious) and keep practicing until you can reliably and easily dock around Kerbin when the orbits of the two spacecraft are no more than 10km apart. The reason I say you need to be able to dock is because a direct ascent Duna mission is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esignificantly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0more difficult than a direct ascent Mun mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027re able to dock in orbit, use the usual method of designing the spacecraft payload-first. Your most important payload is the ascent module of the lander (I\u0027m assuming a two-stage lander but you could do a single-stage lander for Duna). This should have a delta-v of about 1500m/s once you get experienced, but you should start with about 1750m/s so you have a good margin for error (I\u0027m assuming you\u0027ll be landing near the equator and using prograde orbits, otherwise the delta-v costs are more).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe descent module of the lander is next. If you use a parachute-assisted landing (which is what I would recommend) add enough parachutes that you\u0027d be able to land safely on Kerbin, as well as landing gear, science equipment, and a reasonably-powerful propulsion system\u00A0with a delta-v of about 600m/s because the parachutes aren\u0027t enough on Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, you want to design the transfer vehicle. Assuming no aerobraking, the transfer vehicle alone needs about 1900m/s (so you have a reasonable error margin) to get from Duna to Kerbin, as well as another 1900m/s with the lander attached to get from Kerbin to Duna. Remember that designing an overpowered vehicle is safer than trying to optimize before you\u0027re experienced, so I\u0027d suggest just designing a vehicle with 3800m/s when the payload is attached. You\u0027ll probably also want landing systems for when you return to Kerbin, unless you plan on sending up a new rocket to recover the crew once they\u0027re back in Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, design launch vehicles. I would generally launch the transfer vehicle separately from the lander, and dock them in Kerbin orbit (and usually my transfer vehicle would itself consist of several modules to be assembled in orbit), but you can launch the entire assembly in a single launch if it\u0027s not too massive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis method of planning works for any destination, not just Duna.
