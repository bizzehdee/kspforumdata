I had a rocket that worked and now the engines don\u0027t ignite. Other rockets had struts disappear and the stages don\u0027t seem to be connected anymore. They\u0027re stacked right, but they\u0027re not bound together so the rocket falls apart, sometimes on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines are on the bottom of the launch order and I have them throttled up. None of them start. Some of them are solid boosters and they don\u0027t start either. Is there a cure for this kind of glitch?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T14:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epress F3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote which component broke during launchpad stacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFix your assembly to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is happening is a connection structural failure between your command pod and the lower rocket.

If struts disappear it means that the parts they were joining are no longer part of the same ship, that you\u0027ve had something break somewhere. F3 will let you know what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
