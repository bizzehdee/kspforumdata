My thoughts is no, we couldn\u0027t and here\u0027s my reasoning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just did some quick calculations to get a rough guestimate of what the construction would entail. Using a large modern day cruise liner as a starting point: Royal Caribbean\u0027s Oasis of the Seas. I\u0027m using a cruise liner because it\u0027s the best analog I could think of.
