IMO such mechanic would be beneficial for the career mode as right now I (and probably some other people too) end up early in the career with either too much money or not enough to launch anything. I guess that\u0027s not a problem since there are initial rewards for accepting contracts, but they tend to be insufficient. Especially when the rewards are set to low and you can have only two of them active at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
