Sorry if this question has been asked before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone knows how the AUTO camera flips when you transition into/from a good enough sub/orbital trajectory. Or how the camera flips when you manually change the mode. And how the right click \u002B drag option gets disabled for the transition. Which is infuriating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, it\u0027s just a pet peeve (even though I can easily imagine a situation where it could become dangerous), and it can be bypassed by choosing a camera mode manually and sticking to it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...But it would be nice if the camera flip happened faster or left you in control during the transition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a mod that does this, or even better a simple cfg edit I can make? Or is it just ingrained in the engine/game and cannot be changed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T23:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI remember there was a mod that made Free cam the default camera mode, but I don\u0027t remember its name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87286-Free-camera-by-default?p=1292551\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1292551\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis post\u003C/a\u003E seems to show a way how you can make \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80112\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis mod\u003C/a\u003E disable auto cam entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T23:08:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T23:40:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mind the way AUTO camera works, in fact I\u0027m used to it.
