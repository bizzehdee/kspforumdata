Spacecraft, with a few exceptions, are always launched in \u0027new\u0027 condition.  There should be minimal \u0027weathering\u0027 or \u0027grunge\u0027.  The exceptions to this might be space stations, as there is certainly some degree of damage from exposure (uv / meteoroids).  (so.. maybe that applies more to \u0027payloads\u0027 than the rockets themselves; some of the rockets sit around for years before being used... and those would have some accumulation of wear and dirt)\n\nHowever, nothing that human beings have built has ever been \u0027perfect\u0027.  Freshly manufactured goods nearly always come with some minor variation across their surface, from differences in cooling, tooling, or so many other factors.  Some manufacturing techniques introduce obvious \u0027defects\u0027, such as weld-lines or various metal finishes.  Smudges in exterior finish can easily occur from handling and assembly, minor scratches can happen during handling/shipping/assembly, and dust accumulation on anything outside of a clean room is constant.  With rockets, even in pre-launch condition there might be ports or vents with some notable discoloration from exhaust/dripping.  Engines may have been test fired prior to flight use and already have soot accumulation or some heat discoloration.\n\nThis is why I stated that I would be using noise/generators/etc for \u0027surface details\u0027.  Minor imperfections and inconsistencies in the surface of the materials (splotchiness, streaks, etc).  Some smooth/rough adjustments added to sharp edges for a bit of \u0027wear\u0027 (e.g. very light edge-damage).  What I won\u0027t be doing much of is hand-placed and highly visible scratches/dings/etc; those belong on a \u0027per-unique-article\u0027 basis, which would be difficult to do in KSP (it always bugged me that every single copy of a stock fuel tank had the -exact same scratches in it-).\n\nE.G. in the \u0027reflective\u0027 Apollo capsule texture, I included the details such as minor surface warping and the seams between the lines of reflective tape (can\u0027t see it in the images from that distance).  There are also noise layers masking those to various extents; the seams and warping are themselves inconsistent (not yet done is some variation between each strip of tape; in high-res images, some appear slightly more reflective than others).  Not planned are adding are areas of the tape peeling up, or a big scratch going through it."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-21T22:45:09Z","Content":"![moon-base-two.jpg](http://www.technovelgy.com/graphics/content08/moon-base-two.jpg)\n\n![ft36-4i1.jpg](https://media.wired.com/photos/593394a758b0d64bb35d61bd/master/w_640,c_limit/ft36-4i1.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-21T22:59:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2017 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-21T23:24:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This is why I stated that I would be using noise/generators/etc for \u0027surface details\u0027.

The options that I would be able to setup are either a top/bottom node decoupler, or radial decoupler attached to the central truss.\n\nIf using the existing SSTU modules for it, you could have a basic setup with the central truss having multiple length options and adjustable diameter/scaling for the entire part.  The top/bottom caps could be setup as the adapters, and those could have varying numbers and layouts of attach nodes (so you could have a 2,3,4,5,6/etc attach nodes on each end).  The fairing is the one bit that wouldn\u0027t work \u0027out of the box\u0027 with the current SSTU code; I would have to add in a bit of support for full-body-length fairing calculation and link it in with the cargo bay/fuel tank module that manages the rest of the models.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Mike\u0060 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is it possible that the RL-10 A4 in sstu has a slightly off-center thrust vector?

The poor support for animations is perplexing, but yes I\u0027m sure you\u0027re right that that would be a pain. Is there any reasonably easy mechanism where we could have an attachment node at the end for the probes/satellites that could extend out of the bay? The way this should work is that happens and the detachment mechanism has no ejection force and retracts, leaving the probe at rest next to the main vehicle.\n\nCentral truss of lengths from N meters to N\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003Em, with attachment nodes, could easily make various size cargo containers to attach to truss nodes so it can also be used in cargo mode or a combination. Basic sizes from .625 to 5m with 2 to 8 cells around the central truss. Optional attachment nodes at top, bottom, or both (could go with long bay and attach probes at both ends). Optional aerodynamic cover, best would be one that slides out of the way on the inside of the bay, but since that is probably difficult, at least have them open/close with an option to jettison.\n\nAnd then for the sake of feature creep, integrated probe core, antenna, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, optional tankage, all your top/bottom attachment options, chrome trim, 6 gigawatt subwoofer, and a replicator that only makes bacon cheeseburgers.\n\nAnyway I\u0027ll noodle around with it. Work is not helping, been working all weekend on another crisis. Been on bridges most of yesterday and today, and team is online working a deadline to get some data out before a checkpoint with the execs at 9PM. And I probably have to be online for the 6AM flash meeting to bring a bunch of groups up to speed. Please stop the world, I want to get off and play KSP instead.\n\nOk, just made myself laugh thinking of another option, basically tubes with bottom attach nodes, in that mode you\u0027d want an attachment mechanism that has the maximum sustainable force or a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E. In this case, you\u0027d be launching your probes like photon torpedoes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) Even cooler would the the whole thing rotating around the central axis to bring tubes in alignment with a launch tube.\n\nThe first idea is better but it would be fun to make that too. And put Kerbals on the front of the probes in command seats, being fired like torpedoes, with a thin shrieking dopplerized scream on the radio for a sound effect.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-22T23:27:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2017 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by vossiewulf**"}]}
