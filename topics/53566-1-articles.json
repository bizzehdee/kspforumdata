Yes. Orbiting the Sun seems to be the most thing I\u0027ve ever done...quite frankly, the one thing I\u0027ve done often...because I try to reach other planets but fail to do so because I never create decent enough rockets capable of doing that, let alone enough fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, at first I was thinking, shoot lets get a Station in orbit of Eeloo!! I\u0027ve seen that some people have made it there, or more than some, but never figured out how...well I tried to get the station, and once my Mission Report is visible, if approved, sure hope so, you will see that my first station, K.S.S. Alpha, aka Kerbal Space Station Alpha (already see some design flaws in this current version, DARN YOU SOLAR PANELS!! Lol), WAS going to be orbiting Eeloo but once I ran out of fuel it was stuck orbiting the Sun, which at this point I thought...why not turn it into a fueling station for other players!! Oh forgot to mention, I launched it in a KMP server, Area 51, ksp2. Pretty easy to find if you google for KMP Unofficial Server list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple players tried to get a fueling pod to my station, one attempted and some how lost 2 of the 4 fuel tanks he had as well as his main rocket booster thus leaving nothing but RCS. Then he had to leave and someone else took control of it and tried to get it to my station under RCS but then ran out of fuel and left for school. So now I decided that since that fuel pod is useless with no fuel or rocket booster to move it, I terminated it for them and decided I need to do it myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I am trying to be a really helpful person in this server even if it can only hold 12 players, so that if anyone wants to try to reach other planets and make videos and what not, please feel free to use my station. I will set it back to Public once I can get some fuel tanks up there, but for now its set to Private so using it is not quite an option. Plus I\u0027m afraid of some griefers (I\u0027ve played multiple games, anyone played Star Quest Online? [NO ATTEMPT TO ADVERTISE, HONEST!] A lot of griefing players there :/ ... its sad and the game is about to be shut down anyways due to lack of players and that the original designers abandoned it long ago....) that some griefers would take control of my station and find some way to destroy it like...spin it out of control to where the solar panels fly off or send my Astro-Kerbans to space doom with no way of returning. In which case, I do have the KSS Alpha saved in vehicle assembly and it was a pain in the butt to get it off the ground because various versions of the rocket just kept blowing up until I finally got it right, and yes I did save it after getting it right, but I really won\u0027t be happy if I have to re-deploy my station because of some griefers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that I\u0027m worried about anyone here being that but just saying. Otherwise, I can\u0027t wait to play with others, be part of the community and have some fun!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T02:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, you certainly seem eager enough about the game. Good thing you found the rest of us; you\u0027re just crazy enough to fit right in \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But seriously, it really is a fantastic experience that pushes you to do new things, then keep doing them better once you can do them, and there are plenty of people here who will encourage you and one another to do bigger and better things. Feel free to ask questions about anything you don\u0027t understand, or to check out any tutorials that you think might be beneficial. Also, I see you\u0027ve already found the Mission Reports section, which is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy, and hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazeKerba","CreatedById":93609,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T02:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do try and I recently visited a rover construction on youtube and after launching that station and all that, I decided to use the same rocket design and replaced the station with the Rover. Now I don\u0027t know if you guys support KMP or not, but strangely enough, it started lagging really bad and at so I looked into it to see what was wrong. I restarted the server a number of times and the game number of times and the strangest part is that I compared the rocket \u002B rover with the rocket \u002B station, only 2 additional parts, probably because of the rover and whatever else. And of course, rocket \u002B station is a 7 stage while the rocket \u002B rover is 11 stage...still lagged like crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecided, maybe its just the sever...tried other servers...maybe its just the MP and it needs a break...tried the same rocket in SP, lagged like crazy there as well. So I finally just decided to restart the whole laptop. Well...tried testing the rocket again, instant lag up. Not sure what it is cuz this is a brand new laptop, more or less, and the game ran fine until this rocket, not sure what is going on. The design is right off the very same rocket I used to launch the station and no lag. Slap it underneath this rover, lag spike. Not sure what to do D:\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
