That way, instead of trying to guess which dots are slightly bigger/brighter than other dots of the same color, and where the difference lies, I can easily tell where green turns to red (red being better than green in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as to the accuracy of the orbital scan overly, remember the following points about how the whole Ore system works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Ore concentration is defined per biome. It appears to be that every patch of biome with the same name will have the same concentration regardless of where it is on the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The config file for Ore says there is zero Ore in Kerbol and Jool in total, and zero in the oceans of Eve, Kerbin, and Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The Ore config also says the max concentration everywhere else on all planets is 15 with a variance of 50. I\u0027m not sure what this means but observations so far suggest than the max concentration on any given planet cannot be higher than 22.5% nor less than 7.5%, with most falling somewhere in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Only the NBS appears to tell the truth. It shows exactly how much Ore is in each biome it can see from where it currently is, and multiple NBS agree with each other exactly. The NBS shows the exact same concentration of Ore throughout the extent of each biome, and in all non-contiguous patches of the same biome name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The ground scanner only gives you a text reading of the concentration of the biome it is currently located in. This is pretty accurate, closely agreeing with the value reported for that biome by the NBS. However, it\u0027s usually a fraction different, and multiple ground scanners in the same biome can report slightly different values. Which isn\u0027t surprising given the ground scanner is lower tech than the NBS. However, once you do the NBS in an certain area, it appears that the ground scanners agree with it and each other in that area thereafter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The orbital scanner is wildly inaccurate both as to location and concentration, especially if the planet is like Kerbin or Minmus, where many biomes with different concentrations are all jammed closely together. That really confuses it, as explained below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how to interpret the orbital scanner overlay....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, don\u0027t for a minute believe the \u0022cut-off\u0022 value directly correlates to Ore concentration because you can have it only show 80% or greater when you know that really the max concentration is about 15%, maybe less. What the orbital overly is really saying is that the large general region it shows with a ridiculously higher cut-off value than the rest of the planet just has more of the high-concentration biome(s) located in it. It does NOT tell you which biomes those are, nor what their real concentrations are. IOW, it\u0027s an invitation to investigate more thoroughly with the ground sensor and/or NBS, but that\u0027s all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that just because the orbital scanner shows a higher density of good biomes in a given region doesn\u0027t mean that\u0027s the best region to mine. What you\u0027re trying to do is figure out which BIOME has the best stuff, then find a patch of that biome in a convenient location for your operations (such as on/near the equator on a large expanse of flat ground), not necessarily in that region. Because all patches of the same biome have the same concentration, it doesn\u0027t matter where on the planet that patch of biome is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, in the game I use for experimenting with this stuff, Kerbin\u0027s biomes are about like this (per the NBS):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShore: 7.5%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMountain: 6%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesert: 5%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything else: 2-3%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOcean: 0%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbital scan shows nearly nothing in anywhere near KSC because that area is all grass (very low concentration) with a few isolated mountains and a thin border of shore (high concentrations). However, the highest concentration anywhere on the planet is readily available just off the end of the runway. Small islands far out at sea show the highest concentrations on the orbital scan, like 90% cut-offs, but that\u0027s just because they\u0027re mostly shore (high concentration) surrounded by ocean (zero). The most tempting spot on the orbital scan is actually the desert and especially in mountains along the north edge of the desert, which shows up as a huge area of like 70-80% cut-off. But this is because there\u0027s lots of both desert and mountain biomes there, and those have relatively high concentrations (but not the highest).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when interpreting the orbital scan, remember that it\u0027s showing where large areas of good biomes are, nothing else. You really need to compare the orbital scan to the biome map (in the debug menu) to really understand what it\u0027s saying. This will help you deduce which biomes are more likely to be better than others, which will tell you where to send your ground scanner and/or NBS to confirm the actual biome values. Then you just find a patch of that biome in a convenient location.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, as to the accuracy of the orbital scan overly, remember the following points about how the whole Ore system works:\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;bigsnip\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for this.
