Soter\u0027s planetary discriminant says that the difference between Mercury and Jupiter is a factor of 7. The difference between Mars and Ceres is a factor of 500000. According to the Stern-Levison parameter, the difference between Mercury and Jupiter is about the same as between Mars and Ceres.\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of \u0022clearing the neighbourhood\u0022 the 8 planets are clearly within one league.

People are so intent on this Soter\u0027s planetary discriminant, but I am arguing that is a rather random factor as it. If you want a definition of something to include certain objects and exclude others is is always possible to come up with some value or factor that suits your needs, that does not make it a good scientific requirement in my book. Since the definition has been disputed since day one by people who know their business, I appear not to be alone in this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt rather looks like people have been hunting for some kind of definition that would only include the historic planets.

That is the important bit. The fact that Jupiter scooped up much gas, and is able to hold it, doesn\u0027t differentiate it.

I\u0027m not sure about the derivation of the Stern-Levison parameter, it is, essentially, a measure of the capability of an orbiting object to scatter other objects (within a certain large amount of time). It is tied to the Hubble time which, I accept, is somewhat arbitrary. There is, however, nothing arbitrary about scattering power alone, which would allow us to use that as a criterion of \u003Cem\u003Ethe capability\u003C/em\u003E of a planet to clear its neighborhood (yes, in any star system where Newtonian physics work).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoter\u0027s discriminant and the Stern-Levison parameter are by no means \u0022the same for all intents and purposes\u0022.

Again, they are merely several rocks (some estimates suggest a possibility of hundreds of object that have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium in the Kuiper Belt) in one big trans-neptunian asteroid field. I would reconsider my point of view, had we had no asteroid belt or Kuiper belt. In that case there would have been little reason not to include the dwarf planets in the planet\u0027s club. If we find out that other star systems do not generally have a cloud of debris around them, such as the Kuiper belt, it would also be a case to reconsider.
