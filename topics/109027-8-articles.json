I didn\u0027t see this behavior.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, I did only test with an upgrade order of 1,2,3,3, because I\u0027m building an instance with Kerbal Construction Time, and the building upgrade routine from that doesn\u0027t change buildings to tier 3 graphics at all if it comes tied to level 4. Since this order seems to work, maybe you can use it as a workaround.\n\u003E \n\nHm, that works. Seems like you can only add levels to the end, not in between regarding the visuals.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, sarbian said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is it only the visual or is it both the visual \u0026 values  ?\n\u003E \n\nSeems to only affect the visuals.\n\nedit: And does not happen when entering the R\u0026D building instead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-03T12:15:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2017 12:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Yemo**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-03T12:53:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 45 minutes ago, Yemo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Seems to only affect the visuals.\n\u003E \n\nMy code looks far to simple to work ![:/](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png \u0022:/\u0022) I ll see if I can find the will tonight"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-03T13:31:16Z","Content":"If your code is too simple, maybe the stock space center code is reacting in an oddway to a situation it doesn\u0027t expect?"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-04T07:39:01Z","Content":"Quick note that the KSP AVC link doesn\u0027t land on this thread (forum index instead).
