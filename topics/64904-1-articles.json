KSP has a few ways to generate power, but not many. The most you have is Solar Power and RTGs, as well as slight generation from firing your engines. That gave me an idea. What about a module that has it\u0027s own supply of solid fuel and gave no thrust. But, it would give out electricity. It also sparked ideas of Solid Fuel/Electricity to LFO but it seemed unrealistic. In the end I came up with making a series of parts that would generate electricity in return for LFO or Solid Fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be a few problems though, which could end up making this idea/addon go nowhere. I can model, but can\u0027t texture or use unity. Which means that if I don\u0027t learn how, or find someone who does know how, I will get nowhere. So, I\u0027ll accept volunteers if anyone wants to help. And finally, I am open to any ideas or suggestions you may have. Now, onto the more interesting stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a few concepts and made them look as good as I could just to show what I was generally thinking of. For KSP, the textures will have to be much simpler and probably be made to fit the theme of the game. As a note, I did not make the textures, they came from a texturing kit I got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolid Fuel to Electricity:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be used as a \u0022last resort\u0022 kind of thing. It is a fire-and-forget generator, meaning once it is out of fuel you decouple it and de-orbit it. It burns for around two minutes outputting a total of 4k units of power in this time. This module will weigh about 1-2 tons. But, all measurements are subject to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fdcsUaY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fdcsUaY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELFO to Electricity:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is more of a long term source of power. This can be refueled as much as you need. It is recommended that you attach it to a docking port and prevent cross feeding so it doesn\u0027t suck the fuel the rest of your craft.
