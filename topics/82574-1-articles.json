I\u0027ve got it working in editor. The way it works is by attaching C# scripts to an empty game object. These scripts generate FX\u0027s. One instantiate an animated volumetric explosion. Others instantiate empty game objects that they then apply shaders to that create FX\u0027s such as shock waves. Or, they generate a particle systems that make sparks or debris. I\u0027m just having trouble getting it working in KSP. These are my problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How to export a shader\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How to export a script that is attached to a game object as a .mu or .prefab if that even works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E is a .mu?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. how to reference a prefab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. How to allow the script a reference to the compiled shader. Currently it gets its reference via this line of code\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShader.Find(\u0022Hidden/PyroTechnix/Shockwave\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and use it to make a public Material.
