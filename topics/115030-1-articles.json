This little flare spawning and following me around is becoming a real pain in my bum. It ruins all my set pieces and all my screenshots and there ain\u0027t a landing site on Mun where this flare isn\u0027t perched on top of the landing stage debris like the squalid little glitch that it is! - I don\u0027t much care for his friends the puffs of smoke and the spawning launch-clamps either! ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nPS: Big apologies if this is considered double posting or impatient or something but it\u0027s pretty clear that putting Linux at the front of the topic pretty much means it dies a cold and lonely death, especially if it\u0027s a rare/strange occurrence. The original post is here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127536-Spawning-n-following-white-flares-graphical-errors](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127536-Spawning-n-following-white-flares-graphical-errors)\n\nPPS: I tried to post this without a prefix like some other people but it wouldn\u0027t let me. Basically this is a cross platform issue and whilst I originally mentioned it in relation to Linux I will point out that this screenshot was taken in a modded version of Windows."}]}
