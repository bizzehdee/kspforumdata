If I add two more engines to the top/bottom for a total of 8 placed symmetrically will it be able to fly straight? \n\nThanks! Its a simple ship, but it was meant to orbit multiple planets with a high max liquid fuel load (14,000\u002B) so I can send my kerbinaughts across the solar system. At least that\u0027s what I imagine being a high max liquid fuel capacity : p Tips and improvements welcome.\n\nA quick update after flying it around as is. Turning off the side engines allowed it to fly straight... Its slow as molassis! I might consider using large rocket engines instead. I was looking to make a ship that would launch or be assembled in space, but never land - just orbit and run science experiments with a full crew. I see a lot of SSTO\u0027s and one shot rockets - anyone have a link to permanent space ships that run long missions and refuel back at a station?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Can happen because the reaction wheels can compensate for the imbalance at lower accelerations. You might want to get RCS Build Aid and see if your craft is really balanced: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996)\n\nPS: Yes, I use tugs with NERVAs that can drag other vehicles from one planet to another. They only carry liquid fuel and their TWR to low to land anywhere but at my Minmus refueling station.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T07:40:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 07:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Col\\_Jessep**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mars Mullo","CreatedById":110160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T10:30:38Z","Content":"All those things Col jessep says are very good tips. \n\nAlso you could turn on the thrust indication button in the VAB on your build just to check that the thrust is in fact centered. \n\nOr try turning off pairs of symmetry engines to see which pair is giving the off centered push.
