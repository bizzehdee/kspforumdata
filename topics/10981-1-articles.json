It doesn\\\u0027t look very elegant, but that\\\u0027s what you get for compromise designs like that. Good job of using the engine types for what they are stated to be for.\n\nThe engines tend to perform differently than the stated performance, though. The high-altitude turbojet engines work reasonably well as low-altitude engines as well, thus making the low-altitude ones pretty much obsolete except for craft never intended to go to high altitudes; When designing for suborbital hops, there seems to be no reason at all to include the low-altitude engines. Avoiding them and planning for a glide landing might have saved enough weight to get outside the atmosphere, plus allowed for a smaller wingspan and therefore even less drag, leading to more altitude and range.\n\nI made the initial question about why you were using feet, and I apologize if that\\\u0027s what caused everyone else to focus on it; I think instead it was your own response to my question that caused that focus, since you had more of an interest in real-world aviation standards than Kerbal Space Program standards, and this became a barrier to getting people to appreciate and try out your aircraft. (Damion, I hope you can forgive this; I\\\u0027m trying to explain to him why people got sidetracked, since he really didn\\\u0027t seem to get why. If not, let me know and I\\\u0027ll remove this paragraph - the rest of it is actual feedback on the craft and I\\\u0027d like that to survive.)\n\nI still haven\\\u0027t tried out the aircraft, but I definitely have learned from it. My usual inclination in design is to go for delta wings, and your design points out that it\\\u0027s better to put a broad wingspan right at CoM (or CoP, but once you go with a broad wingspan in this game, it tends to put CoP where ever the wing is.)"},{"CreatedByName":"noneyabidnis","CreatedById":20531,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T21:17:37Z","Content":"I haven\\\u0027t spent much time using planes in the game yet, so I downloaded this one and gave it a go.

U-2 spyplanes fly at around 80000ft (~25000m) on air breathing turbojet engines, so it makes sense for the game\\\u0027s turbojet to be adjusted or a vanilla \u0027high-altitude engine\u0027 to be made.\n\nIt would be fun if we had to use conventional jet engines in our designs because the turbojets could barely function at low altitude, SR-71 style.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I really like it.
