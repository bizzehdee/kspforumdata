Do an EVA on the launchpad, take a sample of the launchpad, do an EVA report, get back in the capsule and do a crew report, recover the mission.

This time, though, walk off of the launchpad onto the grass nearby and take a sample. That\u0027s another 13 science (20 total now) and enough to unlock one of three tier-3 tech. I\u0027d go for \u0022Survivability\u0022 because after that you can unlock \u0022Science Tech\u0022 to get the materials bay component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow build a small, simple rocket and do some science while in the air.
