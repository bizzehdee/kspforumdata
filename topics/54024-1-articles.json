Not in the \u0022your stupid\u0022 way, but in a extremely racist and in a way that performs very obscene verbal attacks of my reputation and family (So yes, he is slandering me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong the way, he is somehow turning my own friends against me, and is acting good to others to obtain their loyalty. It\u0027s as of he\u0027s just targeting me. He taunts me all day, and cannot stop insulting my ideals and dignity despite several attempts to get him to stop. If I try to make peace, he rebuffs it and it makes it even worser. And I have tried many, many times. The school officials have intervened, and he\u0027s not changing. It\u0027s as if his sole life purpose is to destroy my social standing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, I have no options left, but to fight.
