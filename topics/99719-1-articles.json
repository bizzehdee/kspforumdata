I have to make it really big because of the motor rotary thing and I\u0027m trying to test out whether the paddle will turn. I try putting different braces on and I\u0027m wondering what can I do to keep it from cracking. Also I want to see if the jet engine will blow the paddle but I don\u0027t know why it doesn\u0027t fire. What am I missing from the jet engine to make it blast a puff of air? Sorry if my questions sound so beginner. If there was something that explained what parts require to function that would be really helpful, but so far I\u0027ve just had to put in tons of hours on every little thing so there are still a lot of gaps in what I know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ku13Kra.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ku13Kra.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4fIRoCj.png\u0022 alt=\u00224fIRoCj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-15T08:31:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2015 08:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Little Katie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T07:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can at least tell you why the jet isn\u0027t going ... no air intake, you need atmosphere not oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T07:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERun Cross- struts from one row to the other, to create a braced structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike these struts - if they run across they strengthen the one next to it, and the next, and the next, etc. As long as every row has a cross attach to the row next to it it will hold together.
