With the Jupiter rocket being a Shuttle-derived vehicle, this also allows for construction of properly scaled STS stacks as well as SLS and the Ares rocket family. In future the mod will also include Orion and Altair parts for use with the giant rockets this mod allows.

The reason the launchers are bigger are because I have some pretty high-mass things planned for the Duna/interplanetary stuff. The main thing is a centrifuge, which I\u0027ll go into a bit more detail about here. \n\nThe problem with most centrifuge designs is the engineering difficulty of maintaining an airtight seal which is also in constant motion. While that may be possible on Earth, in a hard vacuum, eventually something\u0027s going to fail from the constant friction. They seem pretty unrealistic unless you have a seal kept airtight by some sort of ionic liquid which would boil away in deep space anyway. So the most realistic solutions are either a) having a fixed centrifuge and rotate the entire ship, as in the Endurance from Interstellar, or ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) have an internal centrifuge instead, as in the Discovery One from 2001. I\u0027m intending this pack to allow for voyages out to Jool and even the Outer Planets Mod planets, at least if used in combination with Near Future Propulsion or something like it, so from a realism standpoint you do need a centrifuge of some sort. The trouble is that everything in KSP is so small that the form factors we have give centrifuges which are basically useless IRL. I intend to create internal centrifuge parts, either 7m or 10m in size as these are at least slightly practical in creating simulated Moon-Mars level gravity without having ridiculously high rotation speeds or creating too much nausea through the Coriolis effect (especially for Kerbals, who are much shorter than humans so the difference in rotational velocity from head to toe would be lower)\n\nThe centrifuge would make up pretty much the entire habitable part of the craft but would be extremely heavy given that it includes all the rotation tech and the life support systems, as well as all the consumables for the trip. A deep space ship is also likely gonna need a nuclear reactor, and those things aren\u0027t exactly light. \n\nThe static habs for Duna are also gonna be pretty big. Think a hitchhiker, but maybe 7m in diameter, split up into various different rooms, supporting maybe 12 or more kerbals at a time for a year or more. I\u0027m thinking about a multi-floor design, perhaps done in a similar way to Universal storage where you have a core \u0026 framework and then slot \u0027wedges\u0027 in to make up the configuration you want. E.g with a hab wedge, a science instrument wedge, ISRU wedges, lab wedge, a cargo bay door to facilitate rovers, stuff like that. \n\nIn short, the 7m tanks stay, partly for the reasons above, partly because I just love ridiculously gigantic rockets ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI like the engine configuration on the second Jupiter pic, with two on one side and one on the other (presumably to provide the asymetric thrust the STS stack is designed to endure) Will have to see if that\u0027s practical in KSP or not with high enough gimbal ranges."},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T21:01:57Z","Content":"Aweh!

There\u0027s also an upper stage, so that\u0027d need an engine and a stack separator if I went in that direction.
