So one thing you might do is try adding detail to the normal map (ribbing on the nozzle, a pipe going from the top section to that diffuser ring, more details on that big top housing thing...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also suggest maybe considering doing non-uniform scales of engines to see if you can make them look better. It\u0027ll stretch those rings into elliptical rather than circular tori, but it may be worth it to get better-looking nozzles. For example, making the 24-77 twice as tall as it is now (but still .625 wide) makes it look much better IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T22:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the KW look, and would encourage you in your work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I would only be interested in retexturing / normal maps.
