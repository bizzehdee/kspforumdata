Thrust: 225 kn, iSP at surface is 800 and while the Wiki says 1200 in vacuum, that would be zero in practical terms, since it cannot function in a vacuum. The \u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E iSP is 1000 and more realistic as you near flame out. The Wiki listed its max dV as 11760. Its TWR is listed as 12.7. Launching vertically with no aerodynamic parts, it is able to lift about 5.651 tons (including its own 1.2 ton mass) and carry the non fuel mass up to about 23729 meters with a single simple air intake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts fairly fuel efficient. Using only one small octagonal tank of fuel (which in turn carries unused oxidizer as well), the vertically launched turbojet engine can get its very small non fuel payload up to 10526 meters altitude. For the interested, it generates an electric charge of 5 units per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the above, it appears that one could succeed in the challenge on two \u0022fronts\u0022; by spamming air intakes and of course using aerodynamic parts for lift: the greater the surface area of a single pair of wings, the need for fewer wings overall, with their attendant drag. I\u0027m guessing that one might use one of two approaches in flight. Either max your horizontal speed before attempting to thrust higher, or spam the jet engines for enough thrust to brute force your momentum up to the target altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck to you who accept the challenge!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T16:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00221096bimu\u0022 data-cite=\u00221096bimu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt complies with every rule and is a valid entry, now add it in.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope.
