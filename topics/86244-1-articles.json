Where is it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) So because there were plant and animal species that adapted to a warmer Earth long ago (and these species are now extinct), and the Earth is now cooler, with a new, different set of species adapted to a cooler planet, then if the Earth turned warmer again, none of these new species would go extinct? /facepalm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) No one seriously believes that global warming will make Earth uninhabitable by itself. Even in the worst-case warming scenario, Earth remains a relatively verdant cornucopia of plants and animals. It\u0027s just that a few species around now might not be in the picture then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The above assumes that Earth life does not face additional negative effects from humans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The above is not a valid assumption. Global warming\u0027s real cost comes to human civilization. It could create some very expensive problems (cities swamped and even entire countries that must be relocate due to rising sea levels, for example), and reduce our ability to produce the food necessary for our overpopulated species. That in turn could lead us to take some very negative environmental actions to sustain ourselves. Humanity\u0027s reaction to global warming is likely to be more damaging to Earth\u0027s life than global warming itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-06T21:47:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2014 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T21:51:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe could do so much about it but humans are just humans and we are all doomed.

If you don\u0027t believe me, then you have no idea with what reckless disregard people 100 years ago treated this planet with. The question is, will society evolve to the point where we are good stewards of the Earth before it\u0027s too late? Also, is society capable of evolving to the degree necessary? I think that it is, but I think the changes necessary might break forum rules about discussing religion. I guess to put it nicely, people need to start caring about Earth, life, and conservation the way they currently care about God.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-06T22:18:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2014 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T22:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave you read the comment I was responding to?
