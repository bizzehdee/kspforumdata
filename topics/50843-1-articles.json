Otherwise, here\u0027s a good rule rule of thumb: your insertion delta-v on arriving at your target will be roughly the same as your ejection delta-v when leaving. Likewise, your takeoff delta-v will be roughly the same as your landing delta-v. So, simply add the insertion and landing delta-vs, and that\u0027s how much extra you should budget to get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a case like Duna, you obviously will be using aerobraking to save fuel on the insertion and parachutes to help with the landing.

(Typically, this will come to a little less than 2 km/s delta-v, so the total trip budget is about 3 km/s starting from LKO.
