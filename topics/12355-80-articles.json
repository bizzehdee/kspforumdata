I launch to rendezvous in the right orbital plane and altitude. I get into space maybe 0.5 degrees out. I switch to rendezvous autopilot. Rendezvous autopilot spends a half hour trying to match planes with the target. When it does, the target is now long gone. It sets up a climb to transfer 100km-\u0026gt;215km-\u0026gt;100km. It gets an intercept - and then starts lagging like crazy. It says it will start match velocities with the target... in 68 years, 68 days... I disable that, and let the crafts come closer together. Then I reengage autopilot, and it needs to make more adjustments. At this point, I\u0027ve nearly doubled the Delta-V I had planned to spend in space. Often, the readjustments are too much, and it starts swinging like crazy trying to get a perfect target approach - and the result is that it slams through the target like a battering ram.

Microsoft pulled yet another dick move w/ W8, that being that all the files on your hard drive belong not to you, the user, but to the Trusted Installer user. And because Microsoft hates DLLs, this system is blocking KSP\u0027s access to the MechJeb2.dll file. I used the take ownership ability on the folder (link here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/\u003C/a\u003E ) and then MechJeb (and a whole bunch of other mods) started working perfectly, regardless of install location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I\u0027ve helped someone!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T02:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s odd.

I launch to rendezvous in the right orbital plane and altitude. I get into space maybe 0.5 degrees out. I switch to rendezvous autopilot. Rendezvous autopilot spends a half hour trying to match planes with the target. When it does, the target is now long gone. It sets up a climb to transfer 100km-\u0026gt;215km-\u0026gt;100km. It gets an intercept - and then starts lagging like crazy. It says it will start match velocities with the target... in 68 years, 68 days... I disable that, and let the crafts come closer together. Then I reengage autopilot, and it needs to make more adjustments. At this point, I\u0027ve nearly doubled the Delta-V I had planned to spend in space. Often, the readjustments are too much, and it starts swinging like crazy trying to get a perfect target approach - and the result is that it slams through the target like a battering ram.
