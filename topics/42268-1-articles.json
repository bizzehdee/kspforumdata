I think it\u0027s used for scenarios or something). The game already autosaves as soon as you cut throttle after exiting atmosphere (because it can\u0027t save in atmosphere), and it autosaves quite regularly so you don\u0027t lose things to a random crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I consider even the quicksave a little cop-out. It\u0027s a neat feature to have when you\u0027re about to try something absolutely ridiculous (I tried sending my refuelling station on a mission to Eeloo with just a Poodle for propulsion... almost made it, too - was 1500m/s deltaV too short of completing the final correction; next time, I\u0027ll send some NERVAs up first).
