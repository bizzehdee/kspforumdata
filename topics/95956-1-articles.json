Put another structural radial point connector inside the bay also facing down below the lander or on the ends of the cargo bay. Connect a small docking port to radial connector in either of these locations. Put a small docking port on the rover facing the way you want it to connect inside the bay. Use structural supports to stabilize the rover while inside the bay until you disconnect it if necessary. Use fairly long landing gear or connect the landing gear to the mk2 bay as the bottom of the lander itself to ensure that once you touch down, open the bay, and undo the docking port the rover drops out without difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse radial point connectors on the far ends of the bay to connect lower stages to it for launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T02:39:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 02:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maelstrom Vortex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T03:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketBlam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RocketBlam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, I hate to be obvious about this, but there are three problems with your solution.\u003Cp\u003E1.
