Still annoyed by that.)\n\n**VAB/SPH** - I was sceptical about this one at first, as I thought that the VAB is fiddly enough with a KB/mouse. It\u0027s actually quite simple! You have two modes - \u0022stack\u0022 and \u0022symmetry\u0022 \n\nWhen in stack mode the part you select will automatically place itself at the bottom of the vessel stack. Symmetry mode (activated by R1 - each time you press R1 you go up a level (ie 2x symmetry, 4x etc) - parts will auto snap radially to a piece. You then use the left stick to select the part you want them attached to, and the right stick to fine tune. I think it would work quite well. Hell, I think auto snap is something the PC version could benefit from.\n\nThe thing is though... and this is my main concern. Who is going to buy it!? Is there a massive clamouring for a semi-realistic space simulator on PS4? Am I missing something? There is a reason that simulators don\u0027t do well on console... players aren\u0027t interested! (obvious exception - Ace Combat - although that\u0027s not exactly a simulator - I\u0027m probably forgetting a few). Or if they are, they own a PC!"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T08:54:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also in my few years with this game I have never seen anyone asking for the console version.\n\nI have seen it asked, though it\u0027s rare.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E They should really put 64 bit support/Unity 5 first.\n\nIf you check on what\u0027s been announced so far, Harvester says that the Unity 5 port was actually sped up by this decision because the company that they\u0027re outsourcing the PS4 port to has more Unity 5 experience than Squad does, and was willing to help out in the initial work. Really, we\u0027re going to see Unity 5 and probably 64 bit Win support before the PS4 port is released.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E in both cases there\u0027s a chance that PC users will be from this moment more or less ignored due to focus on other platform.\n\nThere\u0027s also a chance that an asteroid will kill us all before any of that happens. Simply saying \u0022a chance\u0022 without even a guess at the probability kind of feels like fear mongering.\n\nSince squad themselves are sticking with the desktop platforms and outsourcing the PS4 port, I really don\u0027t think you could call this a \u0022focus on other platform\u0022s. I do agree that the PC version of KSP could be harmed if they switched to primarily developing a PS4 version and then porting that to the desktop platforms, but that\u0027s not what\u0027s happening here unless Squad is lying out of their rear orifice. I just don\u0027t see that happening prior to KSP 2 or some other update that is almost a complete rewrite.\n\nPersonally, I\u0027ve got no firm concerns about this announcement. It\u0027s possible that they may actually lose money on this, it\u0027s possible that the PS4 port may not be as playable as the PC version, and it\u0027s possible that they could flip around the prioritization, but really, none of these are likely enough to affect the current players of KSP. I\u0027ll keep my eyes open to see if anything like that is coming down the pike, but it\u0027s way too early to start fretting over it.\n\nThe closest thing to a concern was the fact that the announcement replaced the dev notes instead of being the big item on the dev notes.

PC users are usually much more forgiving when it comes to bugs, because they can simply patch it or add mods, PS4 players are not. They expect a finished and polished game or rip it apart.\n\nAs happy as the devs might be right now, I am pretty sure that will boomerang back. The sales will - sophisticated guess - barely cover the cost, and during the development time too many bugs have been ignored to make anyone else happy. I just recommended the game to a friend, and after playing the demo he summarized it as: \u0022Fun game, but with all the bugs not worth 40 bucks\u0022. Scale that, then take a guess how many customers Squad lost by focusing on PS4 instead of PC."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T10:43:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have seen it asked, though it\u0027s rare.\n\u003E If you check on what\u0027s been announced so far, Harvester says that the Unity 5 port was actually sped up by this decision because the company that they\u0027re outsourcing the PS4 port to has more Unity 5 experience than Squad does, and was willing to help out in the initial work.

However its no time pressure, real time strategy games don\u0027t work on consoles because of controls and time pressure. Flying should work well probably better. \n\nNow as long as an external company do the porting I don\u0027t see the problem. It will increase sales, pc will stay the main platform and I don\u0027t see that changes. \n\nit also makes sense to start the work now even if the game need more fixing as the porting will take time."},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T10:55:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Flying should work well probably better.\n\nExcept action groups.

I agree with your first paragraph, but what do you have in mind?\n\nHere\u0027s more or less what I had in mind. Perhaps it strikes you as na\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AFve, but at least it\u0027s *some*thing.\n\nLet\u0027s say we had a system in place where at least one developer was on the Forum daily. This developer would mostly be reading the stuff in the Suggestions and Development subforum and General Discussions. If there was a dedicated group of people who wanted a certain reasonable change to occur with the game, that dev *would respond to the thread*, stating, \u0022Yes; I hear your statements; give me a little time and I\u0027ll talk to my fellow members of SQUAD about the feasibility of that feature.\u0022 Then, s/he would talk with the developers and reach a conclusion about the change, saying either \u0022This looks like a possibility\u0022 or \u0022Sorry, but this probably won\u0027t happen because of *these* reasons.\u0022 \n\nWhile I\u0027m sure some would complain about \u0027wasted time,\u0027 I think it would be nice have a little more say in how SQUAD\u0027s time is actually spent.\n\nIn exchange for this added transparency, Forum-goers would be held to a higher standard in terms of politeness and courteousness, perhaps with slightly increased moderation. The thing is, I think that if there was a steady two-way conversation going, there would be fewer people screaming, because they would not have to scream to make their voices heard. I think that a lot of Forum-goers aren\u0027t cautious with their words because they think that SQUAD isn\u0027t listening too hard. If they could prove to us that they understood our points, the Forum would likely be a more positive place.\n\nAgain, some of you guys may think that this is sappy and unlikely to work, but I haven\u0027t heard many other suggestions here. Perhaps others can think of a better way to improve the Forum?\n\nIf this is discussed too much more, though, we might as well start a new thread.

I\u0027d expect them to be more common there since Reddit has a wider user base, not being restricted to KSP players.
