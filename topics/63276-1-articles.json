If a contractor picks this competitor, then the ai has a 75% chance of getting his job done (could be adjusted with difficulty settings). As squad wants to implement career mode aswell as sandbox to multiplayer, this could be used as \u0022player1 launches at this agency\u0022 and \u0022player 2 at another agency\u0022 .
