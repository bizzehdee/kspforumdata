Once you invest them in the reader\u0027s mind, you really need to carry them all the way through the story. By nature, most stories involving KSP will eventually focus on a smallish group far away from home, even if only briefly. That gets a lot harder if you have dozens of characters sitting at home, begging for page time. Kerbal names tend to make this even worse-- they all start to look the same after a while. I try to keep the names as recognizable as I can, to the point of not recruiting a kerbal if they have a name too close to someone else already on the roster.

Good writing focuses the reader\u0027s limited attention on the important elements of the story. In great writing, EVERY element of the story is important. An example of IMO terrible writing I\u0027ve encountered is the \u0022Warriors\u0022 series in which clans of cats apparently scratch each other to death and try to not get run over by cars. I am often in the unfortunate position of having to read a chapter to one of my kids at bedtime. A typical scene will have half a dozen or so cats in it, all of which have names, distinguishing features, personalities, relationships, backstories, etc--this signals from author to reader, \u0022Hey--this character is important, pay attention!\u0022 But very few of these cats really have much to do with the central plot (such as it is) So, the reader goes crazy trying to remember what relationship Featherduster has to Toolkit (or whatever their stupid names are) and that investment never really pays off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ten Key\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ten Key\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a lot of screenshots that are fairly dark (in the, \u0022dim light\u0022 sense of the word). I like them. . .star fields are very pretty. But the thing about the human eye is that it is designed to see contrasts. On a black background, everything is fine, but move that picture over to the forum, and that white background messes things up. The eye adjusts to the white, and suddenly you lose a lot of definition in the picture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had some luck adding a dark gray border to \u0022low light\u0022 screenshots-- your mileage may vary. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good idea!
