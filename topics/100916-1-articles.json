It allows a small, fragile, non-aerodynamic and non heat shielded vessel to survive Kerbin atmospheric re-entry and landing unharmed. The platform contains all fuel, power and systems needed for the decent. I have two sizes, one for very small vessels such as \u0022micro-landers\u0022, and one for standard lander sized vehicles. These are the easiest way to return scientific landers and all their materials to the surface of Kerbin for a big science payoff. I\u0027m a noob on this forum and now sure how to post files yet though. If anyone wants these, let me know.
