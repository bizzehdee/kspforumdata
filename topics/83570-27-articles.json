Also swapped 2 crew, I like simulating crew rotations ISS style in my careers, don\u0027t think leaving the same kerbals in orbit for very long periods of time is good for them. Also brought some KAS parts like the pipes I used and other odds and ends in KAS containers, like the 4 round RCS pods on the water drill miner visible in one of the pictures, it has 2 PP tanks, big center one is for water, other front one was meant for RCS for docking with the station, but I forgot to change it to RCS, so I had to dock RCS-less, that\u0027s always fun...
