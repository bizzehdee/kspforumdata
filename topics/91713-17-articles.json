I do approve of aligned CoM and 1.25 nodes though, and the more rectangular bay could also come in handy for certain rovers I\u0027ve got no way to transport.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what you mean with that precisely. Those aren\u0027t nodes, it\u0027s just the end of a fuselage chunk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Orange_Ignition\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Orange_Ignition\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat i do like about the current shape is the fact that it looks fluid from the top(the \u0027edge points\u0027?) like a giant shell, the new one has a break and then pops out a bit. i definitely prefer the old one in that regard. who knows, maybe it will look great in 3d... the interior on the other hand i think is great on the new drawing. much better clearance with the squaring of the lower portion of the bay.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight get some tweaking in approximate angles of things for sure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re redoing the shape, would you consider to create tail cargo ramp sections with different ramp angles at the open position? maybe one more shallow and one a bit more aggressive, just to give us more options on the height and where to place landing gear?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a terribly inefficient idea.
