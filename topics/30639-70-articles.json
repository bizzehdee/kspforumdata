The issue is with the small scale of KSP that works much worse with spaceplanes than with rockets. While KSP rockets behave roughly in the same way as real rockets, spaceplanes feel more like stuff from not-so-realistic science fiction.

I think all these part clipping/air hogging or mod designs only make the problem worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there are limitations of KSP that make things harder:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inability to have two craft flying in the atmosphere farther away than 2.5 km/under some form of control at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou simply cannot do an X-15 or Spaceship1 style space plane without the carrier plane \u0022despawning\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich means if you want to have a 100% recoverable system, you\u0027ve got to take all your aerodynamic surfaces and airbreathing engines with you into space. I would much rather be able to launch a scramjet powered craft at 25km, and have an autopilot bring the \u0022mothership\u0022 or \u0022carrier\u0022 back to the spaceport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic jet engines: seem fine, I guess\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurbojet engines: Function more like ramjets or scramjets.... not too unrealistic. consider the SR-71, A combination Turbojet/ramjet, reached speeds of nearly 1,000 m/s, which is the speed at which turbojets thrust starts to decline, but the speeds attainable are more into scramjet territory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here we get into the problem of the scale that you mentioned: with such a small planet, orbital speed isn\u0027t that high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-51A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-51A\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet#Advantages_and_disadvantages_of_scramjets\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet#Advantages_and_disadvantages_of_scramjets\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA scramjet in practice has reached speeds in excess of 3km/sec -\u0026gt; far less than orbital velocity for earth, but far more than orbital velocity for Kerbin. I\u0027m not sure if its \u0022reasonable\u0022 to scale that speed down to the roughly 1,500 m/s that is attainable in KSP (without air hogging with many clipped intakes, or cubic struts to put ram air intakes all over the place)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we have the ISP issue. The ISP for scramjets (as stated in wikipedia) is between 1,000 to 4,000 seconds. KSP turbojets are operating at about 800 when high in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem (I think) is that they are listing *effective* ISP. If you halve the exhaust velocity, with the same energy, you can accelerate 4x the amount of propellant/reaction mass. IRL jet engines are so much more efficient than rockets for 2 reasons, and neither is a higher real exhaust velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doubles the change in momentum per unit energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1) They don\u0027t carry oxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No explanation needed, is there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2) They don\u0027t carry much reaction mass to speak of\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The mass of the fuel compared to the mass of air accelerated, is quite small\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet fuel is basically an energy source, not reaction mass. Turbofans are more efficient than turbojets because they accelerate more air, at lower speeds. For practical purposes, we can say they have a higher effective ISP \u0022change in momentum per unit of fuel\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is... KSP takes this into account twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ISP value for Jet engines would be realistic as an \u0022effective ISP\u0022. The problem is this ISP is then multiplied by ~15 to reach an effective ISP that is 15x higher. Jet engines consume intake air to jet fuel in a 15:1 ratio. If intake air were considered massless like electric charge, this would be fine.... but its not, it has mass, and I\u0027m pretty sure jet engines have effective ISPs that are about 15x too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither they need to reduce jet engine ISP, and then play with the intake air:jet fuel burning ratios, or keep their high ISP, and treat intake air as massless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I think in this case, we\u0027d also need jet fuel containers that contain more jet fuel (In KSP, rocket fuel tanks hold much more weight in fuel \u002B oxidizer than the weight of liquid fuel that a jet fuel container holds. Rocket fuel containers are also much \u0022denser\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the issues are:15x too high effective jet ISP, and kerbin is too small. (and the aerodynamic model is still pretty bad, I hear FAR can fix that though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a first fix, I\u0027d change intake air to be massless - that is the simplest fix, rather than tweaking the engine ISPs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo into your file, set intake air to have no mass, then try to make SSTOs... its going to be a lot harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T12:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fellow314\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fellow314\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe same could be said of playing with rockets.

Next mods are what make KSP fun, the stock base, KSP is pretty bland and incomplete currently. It can be fun for a a few hours but once you have a basic understanding on how the game works you can do anything. The first time I played KSP my first rocket I launched made it to a 250km x 250km orbit. All I did to learn how to do that, was watch a single Scott Manley video. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is in real life there are some jet engines that can operate at super high altitudes, look at the U-2 and the SR-71, both were capable of operating well above 20km altitude.

As a result, we can pretty much simulate the CBC by a stack of two jumbo fuel tanks and a Mainsail. The Delta IV Heavy has one CBC as the first stage and two as boosters. The second stage is quite tiny: 13.7 m long and 5 m wide. In KSP, I would probably simulate it with an LV-T909 engine and an X200-32 fuel tank.
