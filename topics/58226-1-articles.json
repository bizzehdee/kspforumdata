If you somehow managed to stop it, and then let go, it\u0027d still expand. Why gravity suddenly turns repulsive on grand scale is the million dollar question in cosmology right now. GR predicts that to this repulsion corresponds a so-called dark energy, and there is bloody lot of it in the universe, except, for some reason, nowhere where we can see it. So yeah, a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartan125","CreatedById":79494,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T12:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would happen if gravity didn\u0027t exist all of a sudden?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T12:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will die.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T01:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou would slowly begin accelerating towards the nearest massive object.

You can slow a photon\u0027s forward progress by making it pass through dense materials, but that\u0027s just because it\u0027s ricocheting around inside.
