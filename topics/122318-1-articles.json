I don\u0027t know what the tilmestep length for physics calculations is in KSP, but I imagine it won\u0027t be shorter than order 0.01 s of gameplay time. This means at 10x warp your physics time step rises to 0.1 s and at 100x it\u0027s 1 s. A 1 s time step is probably enough for the physics calculations, even simple ones, to become numerically unstable. This would manifest itself as wild uncontrollable oscillations that grow with time, parts heating and cooling in an oscillating manner that grows with time and forces between parts oscillating and growing with time. In a matter of a few seconds of gameplay, your ship would suffer a rapid unplanned disassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you set your physics bubble to be 15 m from the root part, you have a couple more problems. First, plenty of larger craft are larger than this, so you would have parts on the same craft that are outside the physics bubble. Secondly, if you have a longer time step and only a 15 m physics bubble, interacting ships will travel a significant distance in a single time step. Going back to the 100x example with a 1 s time step, if your relative velocity is 10 m/s, you will travel 10 m in a single computational time step. This means in time step 1 you are outside of the physics bubble. In timestep 2 you are nearly in collision with the other craft and in time step 3 you have passed through it and out the other side. In this scenario the time step interval is simply too coarse to resolve the physics calculations that might need to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of making the calculations numerically stable and allowing some sort of meaningful interaction between craft, the limit on the time acceleration is likely to be somewhere around 4x time acceleration, which is what is currently available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
