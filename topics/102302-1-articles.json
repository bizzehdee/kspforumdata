Someone could copy it, put pictures of genitalia all over it, and then tell people far and wide to download the \u0022Korion capsule\u0022 and point at their modified version.

That\u0027s what happened to ISA Mapsat, and it was a while before people wrote SCANsat as a replacement.

Once it\u0027s out there, you often cannot move back to a more restrictive license. Because if even one person has already forked or reused your work, you have absolutely no power to intervene. And because that forked/reused work was public domain at the time it was forked/reused, it remains public domain even if you tighten up the license of the original, so other people can take just take the fork and fork/reuse it some more.\n\nThat\u0027s why you generally start with a restrictive license and then free it up as much as you consider prudent.\n\nOf course, \u0022what you consider prudent\u0022 may still end up being public domain after all.

That\u0027s a big downside. You made a texture in blender in 2 hours one night and it could have made you a millionaire but the license you released it under allowed someone to use it.\n\nThen again doing a less restrictive license may help other modders out there and get you some fame (here\u0027s lookin at RoverDude) in the process."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T22:40:22Z","Content":"The issue that I have with public domain is that someone can build something on a PD work and keep all of its rights to themselves, instead of sharing with the community as the author of the PD work did. \u0022Copyleft\u0022 licenses, like the GNU GPL, were made to address that concern: a copylefted work may be used by anyone for any purpose, but if they build something on it\\*, they have to release that stuff under the same license (and thus grant the same freedoms to everyone else that the original author granted to them).\n\n\\*(I\u0027ve oversimplified matters a little here. Less simplified: the GNU GPL distinguishes between \u0022propagating\u0022 a work, which in the case of KSP addons includes things like making videos about an addon and getting paid for it, and \u0022conveying\u0022 a work, which involves redistributing the addon or an addon which is based on it. You can propagate a work without restriction, but if you \u0022convey\u0022 it, you have to release that under the GPL as well. On the other hand, CC-BY-SA makes no such distinction -- Adapted Material is Adapted Material.)\n\nIf you don\u0027t care to copyleft something, a permissive license (e.g. MIT, various flavors of BSD, CC-BY) can be an improvement upon public domain by disclaiming liability (probably not an issue here, but weirder things have happened) and requiring derivative works to credit you (or not, at your option -- CC-BY in particular has an option for an author to tell a derivative work to *not* credit them, if some derivative work is particularly odious to you)."},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T00:08:53Z","Content":"Slightly tounge in cheek version:\n\nAdvantages: People can do whatever they want with it.
