However, I recall that similar questions are asked answered by ferram in old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E thread.

IIRC, one of assumptions is that wings are thin and it does not calculate curved top/flat bootom wing cross section shape for fluid separations.

For better optimised planes I prefer B9PW. Reason is that for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E you want on some craft designs specific wing swept angles and surface areas where 1-2 degree in shape makes significant changes. It is difficult to achieve that with cluttered wing parts overlaping each other etc. if you build it with fixed shape/size wing parts. You end up then with much more parts on craft then you should be necessary and your craft weight more then it need to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is quite possible to create good crafts with fixed wing size/shape though, being stock or moded, but only for certain overall craft size and weight. And it is more difficult to optimize such craft to fly better in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is being mentioned before, but might be good to mention again. How to notice if you have craft parts that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E does not handle properly. Usually, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E replace lift blue ball with arrow indicator to just ball.

For better optimised planes I prefer B9PW. Reason is that for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E you want on some craft designs specific wing swept angles and surface areas where 1-2 degree in shape makes significant changes. It is difficult to achieve that with cluttered wing parts overlaping each other etc. if you build it with fixed shape/size wing parts. You end up then with much more parts on craft then you should be necessary and your craft weight more then it need to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is quite possible to create good crafts with fixed wing size/shape though, being stock or moded, but only for certain overall craft size and weight. And it is more difficult to optimize such craft to fly better in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is being mentioned before, but might be good to mention again.
