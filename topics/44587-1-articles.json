First time poster so sorry if I have forgotten to follow any conventions or have put this in the wrong place or anything like that.

It is an interplanetary exploration vehichle, capable of scanning, drilling and converting kethane at each stop. This vehicle is capable of going pretty much anywhere, including landing and taking off from on any celestial body except Eve (needs a refuel after a Laythe landing but hey... it\u0027ll get to orbit!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe feature I\u0027m most pleased with is the mixed engine groupings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/6yyvXpv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6yyvXpv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226yyvXpv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use three Hybrid Engines for most of my injection and transfer burns, and switch to the H.O.M.E. Aerospikes when I need a high TWR. Power for the engines is provided by the Kethane generator, which also re-fuels the three small Xenon tanks. The large H.O.M.E. parachute is enough for most landings without using much fuel, and the whole design is rugged enough to take the force well upon reentry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship has been in-flight for 9 years game-time now.

I\u0027m pretty proud of how it came out, let me know what you think! I shall be posting my Laythe colony pics next.... Thanks for viewing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
