It\u0027s a little hard to think about with that image. I\u0027ll have to look at the map generation code carefully anyway.\u003Cp\u003ECan you send me instructions/code so I can look at this scene myself?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary issue with SCANsatRPM code (whose code I have barely looked at at all) is that the aspect ratio is assumed of the map is assumed in SCANsat proper to be fixed (2:1?). Not only do the IVA screens \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E have this aspect ratio, but they have several different aspect ratios (in ALCOR, for instance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: I\u0027m about to release the v8/v9 series of SCANsat; so this is moot -- but you are posting SCANsat 7.0 material in the release thread. And, in fact, SCANsatRPM code was integrated into SCANsat with the version you have. I highly doubt this is causing the behavior you are seeing, though -- primarily because we changed so little when we brought it in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the rectangular -\u0026gt; spherical projection, that seems like perhaps you are doing something incorrectly? Again, I\u0027d like to look at what you\u0027re playing around with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyeah this was done with SCANsatRPM\u0027s maprenderer background handler; with a special RPM page defined to display the SCANSat map on a sphere instead of normal flat surface. From what I understand, RPM screen is mapped to UV space from 0,0 to 1,1. upper left corner being 0,0. non-square texture displayed is either stretched to fill the UV space, or some flat color is used to fill the extra space. Which is what I think I\u0027m seeing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe upper right inset is the RPMscreen at the time I took the screen shot; the middle band is part of the large map, centered on the active vessel. then spill overs of the large map is used to fill the top and bottom bands that\u0027s not filled by the large map initially. The large map is 2x1; so it could simply be shifted up so it fills the top 1/2 of the UV space. Rescaled to 1x0.5 in other words, with upper left corner at 0,0. and I can map the sphere (or curved cylindrical) surface accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how I would do this at all with the newer SCANsat versions. I\u0027ll get the prop and config together for you look at tomrrow. Although this might be as far as it gets since transparent shaders doesn\u0027t render in correctly on internal props. a solid sphere in IVA is more annoying than none at all I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T22:19:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nli2work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technogeeky","CreatedById":107155,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T22:17:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hremsfeld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hremsfeld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe download still has it bundled, though.

The only non-anonymous part of the ModStatistics data collection was the fact that it communicated directly: that is, your (public facing) IP address. There is no realistic way to subvert this (unless you route data through something like tor). And this IP adddress is \u003Cstrong\u003E*the only*\u003C/strong\u003E potentially identifying data (that is, the actual information transmitted contained no identifying information).
