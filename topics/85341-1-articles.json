That should be easy to figure out just from looking at a savegame. However, I suggest you don\u0027t even try: you\u0027d also need to edit every part\u0027s position relative to everything else, and that\u0027s not trivial. Have the ports come together in the game, that\u0027s far easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your ports look as if they were aligned properly, you can try to undock-and-quicksave; when you load that savegame, the ports no longer know that they have undocked recently and can connect immediately. If this doesn\u0027t work, chances are that some of your ports have already become stuck during your previous docking attempts. This can happen if ports want to connect but cannot, because they\u0027re held ever-so-slightly apart by the misalignment of another port. In that case, you may edit your savegame to make them become unstuck again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook for any post from Claw, and follow the link in his signature.

Editing the save file can be tricky. Adding a second docked connection itself isn\u0027t easy, but possible. The other problem is that the first connected port must also have the correct rotation/orientation in order to keep the dual docking ports from ripping themselves apart. And I think the rotation vectors are stored as quarternions, which require some extensive math and understanding. (You can\u0027t just simply input a turn of \u00222 degrees\u0022 or equivalent radians or fraction thereof, for example.) It\u0027s not impossible, just be prepared to do some homework and trial/error (and be patient).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive the quicksave/quickload trick a try. That\u0027s the usual method I do and you can get very good docking alignment with it.

There are also several docking alignment add-ons that might work if you\u0027re not opposed to mods.
