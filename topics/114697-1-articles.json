All of it is now transmitted, except for three surface samples, two of which have been processed. The third can\u0027t be processed because there isn\u0027t enough data capacity.\n\nIn theory I could just make room by removing the processed experiments and putting them in a command pod, for instance. Unfortunately I can\u0027t figure out how to do this, because there is only the option to take all data, not some of it. All I can do is transmit one of them, which is suboptimal. I\u0027d really rather take them back to Kerbin, and I have a little spacecraft ready to do just that (I sent it on the same rocket as the lab itself).\n\nIs it possible to remove only the processed experiments without transmitting them, so I can process the unprocessed ones?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T13:28:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thrawcheld**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T07:58:17Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think the mobile processing lab works like you think it does...\n\n(And it\u0027s possible that the same applies to me, I\u0027ve only looked at it very briefly. But here\u0027s what I believe to understand about it.)\n\nWhen you review the report for a science experiment you did (or moved to the relevant vessel), you get three options: keep, transmit, or send to the lab.\n\n- When you choose to keep the experiment, you get nothing, but you have the option to recover it or choose one of the other two options later-on.\n\n- When you choose to transmit, you get a certain amount of science, and the science experiment is consumed.\n\n- When you choose to send it to the lab, you add a certain amount of data to the lab, and the science experiment is consumed.\n\nIn other words, you can\u0027t take any processed experiments out of the lab. This is not a thing ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Any processed experiment is gone.\n\nHow much \u0022room\u0022 a mobile processing lab has is not governed by what experiments you put into it, but rather by how much data it has stored. It can store up to 500 data. Each experiment you send to the lab adds some data to that storage, based on what experiment it is and how much science it would be worth if returned (I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s an easy way for the user to know besides trying and memorizing). When the cap of 500 data has been reached, you can no longer send more experiments to the lab until you make room for more data.\n\nYou do that by letting the lab work. The lab will generate a certain amount of science each day (this is shown in the rightclick menu), and for every 5 science it generates this way, it will consume 1 data. So the amount of data stored declines over time as the lab does its thing, meaning that after a while, you will once again have room to receive another experiment.\n\nThe transmit option sends the science that has been generated so far (there\u0027s a cap of 500 on that, too). It does not in any way interact with the transmit option of specific experiments. In fact, the lab does not interact with the transmit or recover values of any experiment at all. If you recover an experiment and get the full value, you can still send another copy of the (now worthless) experiment to the lab, and you\u0027ll *still* get the full amount of lab data. Similarly, you can send an experiment to the lab and get data for it, process that data and send it home, and *still* return another copy of that experiment home for the full recover value.\n\nHowever, the \u0022another copy\u0022 part is significant. If you decided to send a surface sample to the lab, then you cannot also return it home unless you go back to the surface and fetch another sample.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T08:00:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:03:13Z","Content":"You can send experimental data to the lab and still return/transmit the original report (at it\u0027s normal value); it is not consumed.\n\nAt least, you can if that behaviour wasn\u0027t changed between 1.0.2 and 1.0.3/4.\n\nEverything else you say is correct as far as I know.\n\nETA: I\u0027m 90% sure the amount of data used by a given experiment is the same as the data size given in the experiment report.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T08:09:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AlexinTokyo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:28:31Z","Content":"So you don\u0027t have to get another copy? Weird, I thought you had. But it\u0027s been a while since I last poked at it, oh well.\n\nThe data you get for an experiment is definitely not equal to the transmit size. That would make an atmosphere analysis taken standing still on the runway at KSC give you 8 times the data of a materials study while landed on Eeloo. Taking a quick peek at the wiki, it has this to say: \u0022An experimental result produces an amount of data based on its own relative value and the location of the lab at the time the data is generated. A lab on the surface of a body produces more data per experiment than one in orbit, and if the experiment is from the same body as the one the lab is orbiting or landed on the data value is greater. The exception to this is Kerbin, a lab landed on Kerbin produces less data than one in orbit of Kerbin.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T08:32:39Z","Content":"Actually:\n\n- the moment you add an experiment to the lab, it is consumed and its processing starts (it\u0027s nowhere to be found at that moment, but you get a message with percentage progress of processing)\n\n- the moment processing ends, the same experiment is produced again, without the option to add it to the lab.

This is apparently fully intended to be a(nother) way to farm an infinite amount of science points, from what RoverDude explained after the lab was released. But then again, even without ever touching the MPL or the Klaw, you can complete the tech tree with just Kerbin and the Mun, and maybe a little bit of Minmus. So it\u0027s not really as big a deal as it sounds.\n\nAll it boils down to is essentially a small but steady amount of passive income after you finish every tech node and activate a science -\u003E money conversion strategy at 100%, provided you have an efficient launcher/spacecraft that doesn\u0027t cost too much to launch new labs and ferry them around the Kerbin system."},{"CreatedByName":"Thrawcheld","CreatedById":147203,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T13:26:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You can also store experiments in a lab without \u0022adding\u0022 them, just by the old plain \u0022store data\u0022 option - this is desirable if you have the 500 data quota filled, and still want to keep more processable experiments at hand.
