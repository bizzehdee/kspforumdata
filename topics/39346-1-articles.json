With the the plugin you can easily cycle through the available nodes and edit their attributes either with the help of keyboard or mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally released somewhere around 0.17 I guess, I have not updated this plugin for a while. The new version adds buttons to enable mouse-only usage, buttons for changing patched conics mode, and a toggle switch that will allow you to edit the previously active node even if the bloody Gizmo closes. Try not to double-click too much, or you\u0027re going to change the camera focus to something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also realize(d recently) that MechJeb sports a very similar tool, Maneuver Node Editor. If you already use MechJeb, you might prefer that one of course. I haven\u0027t checked it out, but there are probably some differences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EQuickstart\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key you use to cycle through maneuver nodes is by default O (as in Orange). Pressing this key opens the last node you had open before it closed. If no node was open before, it opens the first node in the node list. If a node was already open, it opens the next node in the list. So if you accidentally close the node you were editing, just hit O to bring it back open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the window, you can adjust the universal time when the node happens. Pgd stands for prograde (green buttons on the node gizmo), Rad stands for Radial (blue buttons on the gizmo) and Nml stands for Normal (purple buttons on the gizmo). You can edit the node values with your keyboard or by using mouse. If you use mouse, you should tick the \u0022Keep open\u0022 toggle to ensure that the window doesn\u0027t close when your node closes (KSP feature, no can do!). There are four buttons: -, a number, \u002B and S. Use - and \u002B to adjust the number. Use S to flip the sign of the number (positive/negative). Click the number to add it to the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe window also displays total Delta V required for the node and you can quickly change patched conics mode. Changing patched conics mode is very useful when you\u0027re trying to create an accurate encounter. You can set camera focus on the destination planet and change the conics mode to help you visualize the encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EScreenshot\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://eiden.fi/ksp/nodetool/img.png\u0022 alt=\u0022img.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/maneuver-node-improvement/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload from Spaceport!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.github.com/voneiden/ksp-nodetool\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESource code\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-09T21:15:41Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2013 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by voneiden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benie","CreatedById":70327,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T08:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh neat.
