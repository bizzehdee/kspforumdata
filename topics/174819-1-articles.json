I wanted to add a habitat, but I could at first even figure out how to get that airborne. By the time I had that going I had also figured it might be easier to stick them together in orbit, along with all the other expansions and then just land that in it\u0027s entirety. Docking the habitat proved to be it\u0027s own kettle of piranhas, as the damn thing went bananas and just slammed into the the hub. This is where you learn the importance of savegames.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, yeah. The K\u0026amp;K Planetary Base stuff confuses me a bit. How do I get it where I want it? I\u0027ve screwed around a bit with the removable landing gears, but that puts the docking ports at different heights. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t seem to be very helpfull either, if docking in orbit, but that might be my placement. I used the aerodynamically shielded fiveway port, with one in the middle of the roof on the front end and two on each side at the back end. I figured with five blowholes that would give MechJeb enough to work with. Also did the needed Control From Here things, as MechJeb won\u0027t do anything anyway, so I think I couldn\u0027t forget anything there....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m rambling.
