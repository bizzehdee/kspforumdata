Low level performance is pretty anemic but up at 20,000m the Corgi really comes into its own and will happily get to Minmus and back on a tank of fuel, not bad for a single engine VTOL. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ERnHky6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ERnHky6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt comes with two hard-points which can be fitted with detachable RCS pods or other accessories.

In space nobody can hear the audience scream. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FosmkEn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FosmkEn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EINSTRUCTIONS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EYou can download the ship from here:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/jccxg7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://goo.gl/jccxg7\u003C/a\u003E It needs to go into your SPH folder. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Corgi is controlled by a horizontally placed probe head mounted slightly towards the stern, if you prefer you can also fly it like a regular rocket by switching command over to the docking port, which must be used when navigating. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EOnce you launch the vessel your two Kerbals will be sat in the fuel tanker, the first thing you\u0027ll want to do (assuming you want a manned mission) is put on the handbrake and transfer your Kerbals to the seats. You can do this by climbing up the ladder and walking along the gangway or dropping down and using the ladders on the ship. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter driving the fuel tanker out the way you\u0027ll be ready to launch, activate the ASAS (recommended) and press 1 to fire up the jet. If you\u0027re not doing any docking eject the RCS pods to add lightness. Once the ship takes off now will be a good time to make a coffee, check emails, watch some Victor Lewis Smith videos on Youtube or look at pictures of cats. After about 5 minutes you will have reached your target altitude of 12,000m, pitch over to 50\u0060 and start building up speed. Once you get to 20,000m pitch down enough to slow your rate of ascent, from here on in you\u0027ll want to squeeze every bit of speed you can from the jet. At this point the air pressure will try and force the nose down but the new ASAS does a commendable job of keeping you on course. When changing pitch you might just have to crank it up about 20\u0060 past your target elevation then let it take it over and lock. I\u0027ve added an air intake aft of the vessel which acts like a dive brake and makes the Corgi controllable at almost any speed (this is a big improvement over the R-type and Scythe).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI\u0027m still experimenting with the ideal ascent profile for the Corgi (and am a really lazy pilot) so I don\u0027t want to give too much advice, but as a rough rule of thumb if the craft isn\u0027t glowing red-hot you aint going fast enough! Once you\u0027ve air-hogged yourself silly press 2 to fire up the rocket engines, then 1 and 0 to shut down the jet and close the intakes. Upon your return to Kerbin Pressing 3 will set you in landing mode by shutting down/activating 2 of the four rocket engines which will help get rid of the throttle lag from the main jet engine while still maintaining a relatively broad throttle response. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf things go a bit pear shaped you\u0027ve two ejector seats and parachutes, these work great on Kerbin, not so well on the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWith the tanker I recommend you drive it off the runway and park it somewhere, you can then use it to re-fuel the Corgi later on. You can also use it as a tow truck to haul the ship back to base. It\u0027s pretty heavily laden with fuel so needs to be driven with a light touch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Corgi has quite a narrow undercarriage compared to Herbie so a bit of care needs be taken on landings and I recommend keeping the brakes off until after touchdown.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Corgi relies on its engines and two small solar panels for power, the solar panels can soak up sun at most angles but if the batteries do go dead you can use your Kerbal\u0027s jet packs to rotate the Corgi if needbe.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ESometimes after saving/loading you\u0027ll see your Kerbals sat at odd angles in the seats, it doesn\u0027t seem to affect anything but if it bothers you just make them leave the seats and board again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECONTROLS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E1 - Toggle Jet\u003Cbr\u003E2 - Toggle Rocket Assist\u003Cbr\u003E3 - Toggle Landing Mode\u003Cbr\u003E5 - Toggle Docking Port Light (Fuel Tanker)\u003Cbr\u003E6 - Toggle Docking Port Mating Engines (Fuel Tanker)\u003Cbr\u003E9 - Toggle ASAS Torque \u003Cbr\u003E0 - Toggle Intakes\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EABORT - De-couple\u003Cbr\u003ESPACE - Detach RCS PODs/Eject!
