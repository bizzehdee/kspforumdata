If you\u0027re looking to enhance your experience without actually affecting the gameplay, then look at Aesthetics and Utilities. None of them really add parts (well, Kerbal Engineer adds two optional ones). All those will do is give you little tools, quality of life fixes, and better graphics. If you\u0027re unsure about what exactly each ones does - you can find threads for all of them somewhere here on the forums. Just one or two might actually be hidden in someone\u0027s \u0022big collection of small plugins\u0022 thread, but if you just search for the name it should turn up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-21T08:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two big ones I can think of off the top of my head (one in \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s list) are Contract Configurator and Strategia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"evileye.x","CreatedById":153755,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-21T09:08:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think, community tech tree and unmanned before manned as well\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd add life support (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E or Kerbalism), EVA fuel, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, Persistant Rotation, Precise Maneuver, EVA chutes... , ScanSat, Dmagic Orbital Science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started to mod my game with visuals, then gameplay effects, and then, oh boy...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPARTSSS!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoubleUU","CreatedById":173389,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-22T22:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222992133\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157986\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490049524\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022173805\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CEVgaming\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/20/2017 at 3:38 PM, CEVgaming said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure a ton of people already asked this, but can any of you guys give me a list of a few add-ons that can enhance, yet not completely overhaul Career Mode.
