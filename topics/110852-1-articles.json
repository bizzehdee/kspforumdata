In other words, the RAPIERs on the first stage were taking fuel from the second stage, and the RAPIERs on the second stage were taking fuel from the third stage. I tried this with the two other jet engines and strangely enough while the \u0022Whiplash\u0022 also acted the same the \u0022Wheesley\u0022 doesn\u0027t do this."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T07:48:20Z","Content":"This is a feature change in 1.0. Air breather engines suck fuel from nearly everywhere, including lower stages.
