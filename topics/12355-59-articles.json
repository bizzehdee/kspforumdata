A bit nervous about it, hearing about bugginess and all, but decided to try it out. Works like a dream in my opinion, love the new system using nodes so I can make sure all goes well, and I love the window editor with all the information I never knew I needed, really puts alot of mods together into one... I use a number of other mods, like haystack and Crew Manifest, Quantum strut, as well as some parts packs like KW rocketry, and the old KerbX parts packs to name a few... With all these mods, it still worked fine, did transfers okay, never perfect, sometimes the occasional disaster, but for the most part just fine, like a dream...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, getting to the main issue here, I turn on my KSP again and load up the spacestation with my orbital tug attached... and now MEchjeb\u0027s windows have become entirely see-through, and the letters are all black and scrambled all over the place!

Trying to land a kethane mining and refinery rig on Duna. It\u0027s got a cluster of 7 NTRs on it, but lost one of the outboards during a recontact mishap (which the RCS was able to correct for, until I just shut the opposite engine off). When I activate autoland, it does a pretty good initial deorbit burn, and then starts issuing absolutely stupid course corrections that end up pushing the Peridune back up into the mid atmosphere. The second to last burn it does, it actually stops attempting to steer and just lets it drift while the engines run. The final burn expends all fuel, while the listed Delta V of the course correction goes UP as it burns. The net result is a crash approximately 1/3rd to 1/4th of the way around the planet past the landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProximate cause seems to be that the \u0027Landing Prediction\u0027 module is malfunctioning while the auto-land is turned on, giving obviously incorrect predictions that are EXTREMELY short of the mark.

I started ksp and it took 10 minutes to load. The longest loading was the mech_jeb parts. Can someone explain why it takes so long to load. Then I made a new save file and checked if it works. Only the parts work but I don\u0027t have those windows for the mechjeb is this supose to happen? Or do I need to download mechjeb2 instead of mechjeb1 or use both? I also tested if only mechjeb 2 works but most of my parts went black or didn\u0027t load in the parts section and were black when placing them but the windows for the mechjeb appeared.

Either I missed in, or I\u0027m the first, Easy to miss in over 140 some pages... ^^;\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve been using the 2.07 version of Mechjeb since I started playing again after a brief hiatus to refresh the feel of the game... A bit nervous about it, hearing about bugginess and all, but decided to try it out. Works like a dream in my opinion, love the new system using nodes so I can make sure all goes well, and I love the window editor with all the information I never knew I needed, really puts alot of mods together into one... I use a number of other mods, like haystack and Crew Manifest, Quantum strut, as well as some parts packs like KW rocketry, and the old KerbX parts packs to name a few... With all these mods, it still worked fine, did transfers okay, never perfect, sometimes the occasional disaster, but for the most part just fine, like a dream...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, getting to the main issue here, I turn on my KSP again and load up the spacestation with my orbital tug attached... and now MEchjeb\u0027s windows have become entirely see-through, and the letters are all black and scrambled all over the place! I can\u0027t tell where a window starts or ends! Even the tab at the side is just the black letters, and you can guess how hard it is t make anything black out in space... ^^;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked fine up till now, and I haven\u0027t recently changed anything at all in the plugin side of things that may be causing conflicts or errors behind the scenes, it seems to have just quit on me... any suggestions? I\u0027ve tried deleting some other of the more recent plugins like B9\u0027s firespitter, but nothing seems to be working... I\u0027d really like to not have to wipe my entire game and start over again, especially if this\u0027ll keep happening...
