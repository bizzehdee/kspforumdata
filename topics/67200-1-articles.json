You can calculate the portion of the orbit in the \u0022shadow\u0022, or more precisely, the angle (theta) that the \u0022shadow\u0022 subtends with respect to the center of Kerbin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esin (theta/2) = R_K / r\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere R_K = radius of Kerbin = 600 km, and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er = radius of the orbit (now we only look at circular orbits)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Here we assume that your probe is far away from Kerbin. You can treat \u0022far\u0022 as the distance being much greater than R_K.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a period T = 2 hr given in your sketch (nice use of the compass!), the corresponding radius (the distance from the center, not the altitude) of the orbit is r = 1667.6 km, and the angle subtended is 42.2 degrees, or 11.7% of the orbit, so the down time is 2 hr * 11.7% which is about 14 min. Moving a maneuver node 14 min ahead/behind is not really a big deal compared to the whole interplanetary flight. It might become an issue in critical moments like a capture burn / landing, but you can always plan ahead to arrive earlier or later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, as Starstrider42 has pointed out, if the probe gets far enough away from Kerbin, you can switch the pointing to a single satellite to just Kerbin (always quicksave first\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6) and still have the dish covering everything, and now you have zero down time!
