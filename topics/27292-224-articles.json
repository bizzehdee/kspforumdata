When I went to repeat the docking test with a slight difference (not staging off the fairings until docked to avoid damage to the nuclear engines) on the second launch I ran into a small issue.

It was just as tedious as I expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been toying with Eve lander designs before. Because setting up asparagus staging takes a lot of work, and modifying the design usually requires starting over from scratch, I always got bored before I managed to build a good enough lander. This time I was able to get 9800-9900 m/s of delta-v in a reasonably compact package, so I decided to try it. With most of its fuel tanks empty, the mass of the lander went down from 110 tons to 60 tons, so I could lift with my existing rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/eve_lander.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_lander.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was also the first time I found any use for Aerospike engines.

I built a custom fuel tanker for the task, and even put in somewhat balanced RCS to make refueling quicker. Upon reaching orbit, I realized that the launcher still had so much fuel left that I didn\u0027t need a second tanker, so I hauled the entire rocket with the tanker to rendezvous. So much for RCS balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/eve_lander_refueling.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_lander_refueling.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final launch contained the transfer stage and a return ship/utility tug hybrid.

Because of my limited delta-v budget, I tried to land above 4 km. Unfortunately the game doesn\u0027t really provide better tools than the abuse of quicksave/quickload for this. When I finally found an acceptable landing site, I faced my first major mistake. Deploying parachutes pull much harder at Eve than at Kerbin, so I had to waste about 200 m/s to slow down just before the drogue chutes opened. That required a couple of tries more, but eventually I managed to land at around 4280 m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/eve_lander_parachutes.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_lander_parachutes.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/eve_lander_landed.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eve_lander_landed.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was time to depart.
