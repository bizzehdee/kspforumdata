Unfortunately, there\u0027s nothing I can really do about it, especially for Squad\u0027s tweakables (fuel tanks, etc).

I\u0027m not doing anything with the event either, but other mods do. FloatRange tweakables that result in irrational behavior will spam the event and without trying to rebalance every part and every tweakable that exhibits the behaviour there\u0027s nothing I can do about it. I\u0027m unwilling to do that; if you find a part that causes that issue you can ask the author if he wants to address it (feel free to link my posts here explaining the issue), or take it on yourself to find a solution that works (probably by moving the default value around a bit) and offer a patch to the author.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor clarity: this is a Squad bug that results in event spam. TweakableEverything (and any other mod that presents a tweakable in this condition) exposes the bug, it doesn\u0027t cause it. Other mods that rely on the onEditorShipModified event will exacerbate the bug by increasing the slowdown when it happens. The best I can do is post a bug for Squad; I\u0027ll do that once I have a chance to write up a proper report.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dc4bs","CreatedById":76642,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T07:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022toadicus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022toadicus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s unrelated to this particular issue, but I\u0027ll give it a look.
