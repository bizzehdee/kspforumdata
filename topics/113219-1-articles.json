With MM I have tried making a patch with the following code:\n\n    // Adds difficulty multiplier to science lab@PART[Large_Crewed_Lab]{\t@MODULE[ModuleScienceConverter]\t{\t\t@scienceMultiplier *= 0.3\t}}\n\nwhen that didn\u0027t work, I tried:\n\n    // Adds difficulty multiplier to science lab@PART[Large_Crewed_Lab]{\t@MODULE[ModuleScienceConverter]\t{\t\t@scienceMultiplier = 1.5\t}}\n\nWhen that also didn\u0027t work, I went into the actual cfg file for the lab, largeCrewedLab.cfg, when down changed this:\n\n    \tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleScienceConverter\t\tscientistBonus = 0.25\t//Bonus per scientist star - need at least one! So 0.25x - 2.5x \t\tresearchTime = 7\t    //Larger = slower.  Exponential!\t\tscienceMultiplier = 5\t//How much science does data turn into?\t\tscienceCap = 500\t    //How much science can we store before having to transmit?\t\t\t\tpowerRequirement = 5\t//EC/Sec to research\t\tConverterName = Research\t\tStartActionName = Start Research\t\tStopActionName = Stop Research\t}\n\nto this:\n\n    \tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleScienceConverter\t\tscientistBonus = 0.25\t//Bonus per scientist star - need at least one! So 0.25x - 2.5x \t\tresearchTime = 7\t    //Larger = slower.  Exponential!\t\tscienceMultiplier = [B]1.5[/B]\t//How much science does data turn into?\t\tscienceCap = 500\t    //How much science can we store before having to transmit?\t\t\t\tpowerRequirement = 5\t//EC/Sec to research\t\tConverterName = Research\t\tStartActionName = Start Research\t\tStopActionName = Stop Research\t}\n\nNot even this changed the outcome. The lab keeps on producing science at a rate of 5 sci/data. Ofc I\u0027m using a lab that is already sent up before trying to modify this, but I stopped the research, and restarted it after the change. I even checked the persistent.sfs file for the save, to see if the modifier gets saved there to the vessel itself, but I couldn\u0027t find any indication of that.\n\nAnyone else tried and succeed in doing this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T15:58:18Z","Content":"Well, you\u0027re actually decreasing the multiplier.
