The statistical likelihood that no organisms have survived the journey and the Europan environment is quite unlikely. Under the layer of ice, which is only 20km thick on average, there is a global ocean far more expansive than any on earth. Conditions in this ocean are very similar to those of the ocean trenches and abyssal plains of earth, and in those environments on earth there are, not just microbes, but macroscopic, complex life forms, who thrive in the extreme conditions. Europa is really the last place in the solar system besides earth that could still hold undiscovered multicellular organisms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMars: The next series of probes to reach mars should focus less on finding life and more on preparing to bring humans there. SpaceX and Mars One are already planning to colonize the planet, and many rapidly growing nations are planning their own expeditions. The primary purposes of a precursor mission would be testing fuel, water and oxygen ISRU, measuring exact radiation levels, and locating the best landing sites for human exploration and colonization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnceladus: Similar case to Europa\u0027s, except the number of earth rocks to reach the surface is much less. This is due to enceladus\u0027 small size and gravity as well as it\u0027s distance from earth, which makes it a smaller target and means it needs a bigger \u0027kick\u0027 to get there. Additionally, less microbes would survive the much longer flight outwards from earth. Enceladus still holds some potential, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETitan: It has seas of Methane rocket fuel and liquefied natural gas. Enough said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Moon: The moon is similar to mars in terms of its potential strategic value. Like mars, the moon has water ice at the poles which can be electrolyzed into water, fuel and oxygen. The moon also has large mineral reserves, including deposits of things that are much rarer on earth, such as uranium or Helium-3. Underground lava tubes could provide natural radiation shielding for colonies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Mineral-Rich Asteroid: A mineral-rich asteroid, even a small one, could holds hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars of platinum.
