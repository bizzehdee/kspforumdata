I really like the idea of it but when it comes to actually spending my time building up cash so I can upgrade this and that, I end up not having time to launch the missions I WANT to do. Luckily a fair amount of times the contracts will coincide with something I want to do, but a lot of times it\u0027s like work and then after a couple launches I wanted to play around with, it\u0027s back to grinding. I\u0027ve played a little in Career mode in the latest version and I like the new features, but I still feel like I\u0027m grinding. I look at how much the upgrades cost and think I\u0027m going to have to do a lot of contracts just so I can start building my Mun space station, or whatever. I get that it can be done and it\u0027s \u0022not that hard\u0022 but I don\u0027t always want to spend the time I have allotted by staging random parts in random places, sending up the same satellite 5 times, and rolling around a rover on Minmus looking for something that doesn\u0027t exist. At the same time I enjoy that my SSTOs have a more useful purpose and can bring down old satellites for some cash, and I appreciate the idea that \u0022messing around\u0022 launches come at a price. I guess I\u0027m just glad they left Science mode an option and I may be going mainly back to that. At the moment I\u0027m doing a little of both but I keep getting frustrated. This is something I don\u0027t think I really mentioned before, but it\u0027s a main reason I was taking a break from KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how plausible it would be to have an in-game contract editor? Design your own contracts in game, and the game decides how much it\u0027s worth. Would that completely defeat the point? It\u0027d still sort of be grinding, but it\u0027d be more enjoyable. Again I\u0027m not saying the current system is \u0022too hard\u0022 or \u0022not enough funds\u0022, I\u0027m just saying it\u0027s not as fun for me to grind like that. Now if I was playing the game like a non-sandbox game and going through contracts deliberately and in a linear fashion to complete the game, it\u0027d be completely different and there probably would be \u0022too much funds\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harlikwin","CreatedById":103213,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T21:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never felt that the \u0022normal\u0022 mode campaign is all that hard.

You can reach orbit quite easily without an upgrade, you need a pad upgrade for the mun, you need a tracking centre upgrade for minmus and then a VAB upgrade for interplanetary.
