With it already plugged in it seems to partially function in the game, right clicks are not recognized. Not sure if this is a KSP2 issue, but could be worth looking at as a USB device plugging in (like a controller) and hard crashing shouldn\u0027t be the case. Though the Wacom is not a purely USB class compliant only device, it does have its own drivers/software manager as well. Though many mice and other controls have gone that way as well like logitech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T20:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut of curiosity, are you using it with the little mouse accessory it comes with (or was that just on the Intuos 3?
