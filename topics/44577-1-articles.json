Note that the five small engine mounts on the Thunder Max adapter are unused. There *is* such a thing as too much thrust. P.S. Plus just means it\u0027s had another engine and a Rockamax 64 shoved in between the AARP Stock Lander 1 and the Thunder Max first stage. RD is for Reduced Diameter, which it is compared to the asparagus monstrosity of stock parts this replaced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7444/9640471327_5a2756c44d_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229640471327_5a2756c44d_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this configuration, the vehicle barely makes it to a 70KM orbit with a bit of fuel left in the Rockamax 64, an essential component of the planned mission after refueling at the Depot Marko 1-0. A minor modification with four small diameter stretchy tanks attached to the Rockamax was required to leave enough fuel for maneuvers to rendezvous with the depot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7389/9643707068_450b959148_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229643707068_450b959148_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s two full Rockamax 64 tanks in a 70KM orbit with a Skipper strapped onto one end with enough fuel to de-orbit after the big tanks are emptied, or fuel can be transferred to the small tank to boost the depot to a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third vehicle in the mission plan is the L2B-FT, which is simply the L2B-M1 with the ladders, landing legs, and four Kerbal storage compartment removed and the compartment replaced with a second fuel tank. Our chief engineer has forgotten what the L2B stands for but he does remember that FT is for Fuel Transfer and the M1 was a one-off used for crew transfer tests from the RD-BLB-70K-plus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7320/9640469511_e573e5feaf_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229640469511_e573e5feaf_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have the RD-BLB-70K-plus with Rockamax 64 still connected and refilled. docked to the Depot along with an L2B-FT. The L2B-FT was launched first and only then was it discovered that there wasn\u0027t enough fuel remaining in its big tank to finish the rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe decision was made before (hastily modifying then) launching the RD-BLB to transfer most of the fuel from the L2B-FT to the depot after filling the RD-BLB\u0027s tank. This turned out to be a fortunate event because attempts to save fuel in the RD\u0027s big tank resulted in problems docking, leaving only 7 units of monopropellant when a secure dock was finally achieved. 100% of the remaining monopropellant in the L2B-FT\u0027s tank was transferred then the ship was undocked and deorbited into the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VAB crew is hard at work, modifying an L2B-FT to enable it to reach orbit with more fuel remaining. After it docks and refills, the two ships will leave for the Mun and should arrive with plenty of extra fuel to top off the lander for its return to Kerbin. Prior to decoupling from its Rockamax tank to prepare for Mun landing, the RD-BLB will dock with the L2B-FT and transfer all remaining fuel to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T08:35:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d thought about adding an RCS tank to the depot but had enough problems getting just the two big tanks in orbit.
