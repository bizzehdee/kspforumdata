Space Engine is a game where you can explore the universe, endlessly, and galaxies will be randomly generated with planets of all types and stars of all types. You can land on an ice giant and watch the sun rise or visit a planet just like earth millions of light years away. All planets, or most planets have 3D terrain with randomly generated textures for that terrain. You can also explore our solar system and the Milky Way.\n\nThis game is amazing. If you like space, this is going to be one of your new favorite games. (not taking the place of KSP of course. ;P)\n\nAnyway,\n\n[http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/04/19/another-free-space-pun-space-engine/](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/04/19/another-free-space-pun-space-engine/)\n\n(all pictures are of the game with a scaled down window, to fit the forums, I run at full screen 1366x738.)\n\nEvery one of those stars is visit-able, most of them even have planets. Or you can just fly around freely. \n\n![ZoEwr.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZoEwr.png)\n\nThat looks familiar.\n\n![rvOBg.jpg](http://imgur.com/rvOBg.jpg)\n\nA very warm selena(?) with no atmosphere.\n\n![onXaR.jpg](http://imgur.com/onXaR.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"greatorder","CreatedById":1213,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-29T20:11:53Z","Content":"\\*raised eyebrow\\* \n\n ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)\n\n ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)\n\n ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)\n\nthat was my reaction."},{"CreatedByName":"iamwearingpants","CreatedById":27,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-03T19:02:40Z","Content":"Very warm selena probably means a hot moon."},{"CreatedByName":"Ataulf","CreatedById":375,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-03T23:49:32Z","Content":"In my slavic language \u0027vselena\u0027 means universe, cosmos, world. \n\nIn Russian, it is an emphatic for \u0027moon\u0027 (like English \u0027luna\u0027).
