It may be chemical, it may be some variety of nuclear thermal, it might be fusion at a pinch (pun not intended). Either way, I\u0027ll be scouring the depths of Project Rho, looking for engine designs that have at least been worked out to some extent and come with actual values for thrust and specific impulse - although I\u0027ll probably assume that my fictional engines are operating at the upper end of any performance ranges described.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI probably won\u0027t be going into the details of how - for example - a solid core nuclear thermal rocket works and I\u0027ll almost certainly never give actual numbers for engine performance but I will have them to hand. So, if the story calls for a journey to Planet X, I\u0027ll plan it out in broad strokes: pick a likely sounding total delta-V for the journey and from that, work backwards to figure out how much fuel I need. In turn, that gives me a rough idea of what the spacecraft looks like and what sort of capabilities it might have. Is this basically a flying fuel tank on a one way journey? Does it need to be capable of aerobraking? Are the engines efficient enough that I have spare cargo capacity for a orbit-to-surface shuttle? Can I go for a bigger design with a built in centrifuge, or are my crew just going to have to deal with zero-g for the journey? That sort of thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore fictional spaceships are actually fairly easy to make capable without being overpowered. The problems tend to come in if you insist on using acceleration to create artificial gravity.\u00A0 If you\u0027re okay with assuming some kind of artificial gravity generator (which, to my mind is no more outlandish than your SCI drive), then the need for a constant 1g acceleration drive disappears. Alternatively, if you\u0027re okay with a hyperdrive, then you can effectively do point to point interstellar travel with almost arbitrarily short journey times. Healthwise, it doesn\u0027t much matter if your crew are in zero-g for a few hours, or even a couple of days.\u00A0 Heck - you could go for a biological solution and assume that your crew is genetically engineered to overcome the effects of living in zero-g. Or just accept that the effects of zero-g can\u0027t be fully mitigated and have a setting where some planets are simply off-limits to certain space-faring characters because their gravity is too strong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a reason that some technologies (like artificial gravity) have become sci-fi tropes. They solve a particular problem without going too far down the rabbit hole of unintended consequences.\u00A0 If you want the story to \u003Cem\u003Einvolve\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a futuristic technology (rather than the technology just being Trek-like background stuff that makes things happen), then a good way of doing it - in my opinion at least - is pick some limitations and follow the consequences of those limitations, rather than tying yourself in epicycles trying to solve every last problem. And don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eexplain \u003C/em\u003Ethe technology - any \u0027explanation\u0027 is likely to be technobabble at best, and leave you open to those pesky unintended consequences at worst.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, in \u003Cem\u003EThe Mote in God\u0027s Eye\u003C/em\u003E, spacecraft have a shield (I forget what it\u0027s called but it\u0027s named after an in-universe character). If I remember rightly it\u0027s basically a perfect energy absorber - right up to the point where it overloads and releases all the stored up energy in one go. Which tends to be bad news for whatever it\u0027s shielding.\u00A0 So you can fly through the upper atmosphere of a star and be absolutely fine - but you\u0027d better make sure not to stay in there too long, and you probably want to plan for a few days downtime afterwards whilst your shield radiates all the stored up energy away.
