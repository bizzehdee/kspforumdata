Since SQUAD has yet to implement a proper method of moving Kerbals internally between crew compartments, I recommended players to use my parts in conjunction with the Crew Manifest mod, while also introducing the Improved Androgynous Common Berthing Mechanisms (IACBMs), which besides being docking ports also allows players to rescue trapped Kerbals from rapidly-disintergating space stations.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Unfortunately, certain players assumed that the IACBMs worked like Wayland Corp\u0027s faux Port-O-Hatches and got frustrated when they placed them on nodes without airlocks.
