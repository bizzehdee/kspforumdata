I heard it is possible but time warping can mess it up, is this still true as of 0.19? Any tips on getting to it if it is possible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iamaphazael","CreatedById":49843,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T01:29:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2869 km circular orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bulletrhli","CreatedById":55960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T01:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease search the forums before posting.

Even real satellites need stationkeeping in order to stay put in a synchronous orbit, so it\u0027s not too unrealistic to need the same in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
