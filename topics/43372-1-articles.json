Mars-one thinks that they can fund their missions by donations from people and by selling Merchandise. And when the crew has arrived they sell the rights to a production company to prduce a big brother kinda show. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first heard of the idea I was exited, it had a solid idea and not only was there tech talk but also financial talk (something most space exploration lovers forget). But now, one and a half year later I got my doubts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all. The astronaut selection program consists of signing up on a website and making a video about why you should go to Mars... We\u0027ve sure come a long way since the Mercury 7.... This seems rather odd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecond. Mars one still has no solid plans on the technology, there are currently no suitable spacecraft in development for such a mission. There are no blueprints on how such a spacecraft should work. Not only would it be needed to serve the crew during the trip... But after landing it has to function as a base for at least till the next launch window\u002B9 months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethird. There is no launcher. Since nothing is known about the craft there is no knowing how much the launcher should be capable of lifting. Mars-one says on the website that they will use the Falcon nine Heavy. that launcher is capable (when it is finished) of transporting 13 tons to Mars. The Apollo spacecraft was about 30 tons. and that could only serve a crew of 3 for about a week!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd forth. The finances. According to MArs-one, a single launch will cost about 6 and a half billion dollars. At the moment they got : $ 132,575 . That si about 1/5000th of what they need for simply the first mission (an unmanned mission that will bring the first supplies). I do not see how they can get 20 billion dollars (The plan is to send 2 unmanned missions for supplies and a rover) before 2022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunkrobot","CreatedById":58034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T15:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.

Somebody has been reading too much Kim Stanley Robinson. First of all, there is the issue of the radiation. Forgive me for not remembering the exact figures, but if memory serves, anyone spending any long duration on the surface of Mars would be rendered sterile and at higher risk for various cancers. Not the type of place for tens of thousands of people to setup residence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard Sci Fi response to this is to setup vast underground residences to protect from the radiation. Couple of responses to this: anyone who has not lived in such a residence for an extended period has no business postulating it. In sum, if you want to propose building an underground base on Mars to house 10,000 people, first thing you ought to do is simply demonstrate that a community of even just 100 people can survive and thrive in an analogous underground structure in a harsh setting on Earth. Someplace in the remote Mongolian highlands might suffice, or else someplace like Novaya Zemlya. Even this would be a poor comparison because the \u0027colonists\u0027 in simulated Mars colony in a harsh environment on Earth would always know (as do Antarctic research teams) that their tour of duty is soon to be over and that it is possible to get help in the event of an emergency. Not to mention the gravity, air, radation, circadian cycles all being different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from the radiation, what else is a problem with humans living for even a short period of time on Mars?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, lack of large quantities of water or at minimum obstacles and problems with acquiring water. Yes I know that there is water there, but the mere presence of water, even large quantities of it, does not mean that it will be easy to acquire and use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreathable air is another major issue, though that is probably more readily addressed given the abundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Obviously any long-term human presence on Mars is likely to require establishment of some sort of agriculture which I\u0027m sure is doable even with current technology, but obviously much MUCH more constrained and risky than it might seem. One minor technical glitch ala Challenger disaster O-ring and you could very easily have starvation to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly is the issue of gravity. I shudder to imagine the harm that will be caused to people living in that sort of low gravity for prolonged periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, we may conclusively have the technology to address each and all of these issues without question or concern. However, even then, what exactly is the point of people living on Mars? If the technology were rock solid, the economics were favorable and the obvious scientific missions were the focus, I can definitely see how some research outposts on Mars would be quite useful for myriad reasons. But 10,000 \u0022colonists!?\u0022 That is quite simply insane.

Space and every other celestial body in the solar system cannot sustain human life without extensive artificial means, which are both technically complex, risky and costly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The costs of building a caravel or noa and sending a boat load of dirty peasants with a couple of bourgeois ex-soldiers / adventurers as officers off for a long ocean voyage for a Monarch of the early 1500s is no where near the ballpark of sending even a small crew of highly trained astronauts and scientists into orbit, much less to other planets, and to say nothing of colonies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Even accepting the limited utilty of the analogy: You\u0027ve got to walk before you run. Long before the voyages of Magellanes around the Cape, long before Columbus\u0027 voyage to the West Indies, there were literally thousands of years of development of nautical technology. There had been steady progressive evolution in nautical technology for hundreds of years in the late middle ages and progressively more and more exploration and trade.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small innovations that had occurred in the decades preceding these watershed events were tiny by comparison to the huge amount of evolution in seaborne exploration and trade during the preceding centuries. Moreover, there were already extensive trade networks that extended substantial distances in every direction. Thousands of military and trade ships had been plying the waterways of Europe, the Meditteranean the coast of Africa and even around the African Cape of Good Hope for quite some distance. If memory serves, Portugese explorers had already managed to get to India via the African cape when Magellanes set out to find a shortcut (oh the irony!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn sum, by the time the era of European colonization to which you are drawing an analogy took place, the social and technological institutions that made this possible had already been firmly in place for centuries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make the analogy more valid. With the discovery of flight we put our first boat in the water. The Apollo missions were the equivalent of the first oar driven single mast galley. The space shuttle a failed attempt to use a more efficient sail design. SpaceX\u0027s delivery of a load of cargo to the ISS the first merchant vessel to safely finish an ocean-going trade journey (say the equivalent of going from Athens to Alexandria).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArguing that we are ready to colonize other planets because we are at a watershed in history equivalent to the \u0022Age of Discovery\u0022 is misleading I believe. Rather, we are in the early phases of the very first oceangoing exploration and trade and suggesting that we are ready to colonize other planets is like suggesting that the ancient Carthaginians could easily have colonized the New World had thus just been a bit more intrepid.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T13:11:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T18:08:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1: No, it doesn\u0027t.
