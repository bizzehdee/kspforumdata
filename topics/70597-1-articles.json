Today I installed the Ubuntu system, and then I downloaded the KSP 0.23.5 of Linux version. Then I started the game, only to find that the graph is of lower quality than which in Windows8.1. The outline of every ship was jagged, and I feel uncomfortable to see such graph effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody run KSP in Linux system? Have you met such problems before? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx~\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoatRider","CreatedById":103681,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T14:24:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds to me like you have your resolution set low and it\u0027s showing it full screen. Check the settings to make sure the game resolution is set the same as your monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amagi82","CreatedById":43131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T20:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I run Ubuntu and it works just fine.

It may be possible to force it, either for KSP or for all programs, using your system\u0027s configuration. I believe the \u003Cem\u003ENVIDIA X Server Settings\u003C/em\u003E tool will let you do that; not sure about other graphics cards or adapters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T09:43:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmm, no, Intel drivers work great. There were issues during move to GEM and KMS, but that was years ago. Intel chips definitely lack lifting power though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T09:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem here is anti-aliasing, Unity\u0027s built-in anti-aliasing was found to cause severe instability on AMD drivers around the time of the Linux version release and had to be disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest versions of Unity have now broken the built-in anti-aliasing for Nvidia drivers, and it\u0027s never worked with Intel and the Mesa driver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can use the graphics drivers own software to force per-program anti-aliasing or force it system wide however.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
