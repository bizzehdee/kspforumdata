One thing that\u0027s frustrating me is on building the solution, it is creating .DLL\u0027s for all my reference libraries as well as the plugin I\u0027m building. In other words, my output directory not only contains MyMod.dll (or whatever I call it) but also Assembly-CSharp.dll, UnityEngine.dll, Mono.Cecil.dll, etc. This is frustrating because in Visual Studio it JUST outputs the library I\u0027m compiling (MyMod.dll or whatever). That makes it easy to run a batch file to copy the file over for testing in KSP. It\u0027s driving me nuts that I can\u0027t figure out how to get the same behavior from Xamarin.
