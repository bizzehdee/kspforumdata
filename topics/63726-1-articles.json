Don\u0027t ask me why, but I thought of KSP immediately. There is no replay feature, nor a way for you to view the statistics associated with your savefile. Here are my suggestions for a stats system in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A statistics screen with Achievements (Bodies visited, landed on, etc.), missions completed, and the like. It could even include favorite craft based on number of launches and/or time with the craft as the focus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A flight recorder a la Flight Simulator. This could record flight inputs and relevant forces and replay them in a different replay scene. This would allow for mission analysis (and just reminiscing I suppose).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T00:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStats screen is, I believe, already in the works... At the very least, some stats are recorded (I think first orbit is and a few other things at present), and there\u0027s precedent in some form (the Science Archives are a kind of achievements screen, really).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the flight recorder... I\u0027m not sure how complex that\u0027d be to set up and have running, really.
