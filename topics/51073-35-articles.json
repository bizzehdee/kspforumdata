But ideally, you want a bit of overlap from 1 pass to the next so you can finish the job faster. That\u0027s why it\u0027s usually better to fly a bit above the \u0022best\u0022 altitude shown in the CFG files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 2 main reasons for using a bit less than 90^ inclination. The primary one is so your probe crosses the equator as close to 90^ as possible, which makes a neater pattern if you\u0027ve got the altitude right. But you don\u0027t want too much less than 90^ or you\u0027ll leave a gap at the pole that you\u0027ll have to change your inclination to get later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is only really a factor for the Multispectral thing, because it works best between 250-300km. The SAR out at 750-800km is such that it only makes a nice 90^ equatorial crossing on big planets like Kerbin, Eve, and Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there are places like Moho, Tylo, Pol, and Bop, that don\u0027t rotate fast enough to get a good asynchronous orbit with. For these, there\u0027s really no combination of altitude and inclination that\u0027s any better or worse than others, other than not wanting to be more than 1/2 the scan width from the pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMeCripp, minimum altitudes for all those probes are 5Km? so why is my BIO and Anom scan not working at 75Km?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never gotten the red messages like you do, but I have had the sensors not work if I don\u0027t have enough power.

I was in fact just experimenting with higher warp levels than I\u0027d ever used before with this mod. As you warp faster, the more electrical power you need to keep the mapping working, for whatever reason. But as mentioned, 2x Gigantors is enough for 10,000x warp at least as far out as Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for my experimentation here was to see if I could make the mod work at such high warps, to take advantage of the wonderful background mapping feature while controlling other ships on long interplanetary flights.
