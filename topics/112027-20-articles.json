As that implies, you could create a few sub parts if you wanted to complicate it a bit more. You could create specialized tanks, that were relatively small, with a half life, or better, a complete decay over time. After it lost a specific percentage, it would destroy the tank and most likely the attached part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFiguring out the plugin or module for this to work, with the heating/cooling addition, is something I know you can do.

First, been a fan of your mods since I first got into KSP back in like March. High quality stuff that goes well with some of my other favorites (like OPT).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for what looks like a odd issue I\u0027ve had with heat control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried out this mod with an OPT-based spaceplane design. I was having heat problems and the stock radiators weren\u0027t well suited for my intended design (at least aesthetically). The static radiators you have in this mod seemed like the perfect fit (they look like lifting surfaces on a spaceplane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I noticed an issue during testing that the radiator tended to spontaneously explode. Further testing indicated that your custom radiators (ones using your heat plugin and not the stock module) would for some reason start generating internal heat after reaching some sort of temperature threshold. I would have to deactivate them to get them to cool. The minute I turn them back on, they heat up again (despite the rest of the vessel being essential in equilibrium with the environment, be it space or atmosphere.) Given time, they would explode due to overheat. They would work fine for a while initially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey seem to have issues with time warp as well: time warping cooled the rest of my vessel while your custom radiators would seem to loop back to cold and heat up again. I had the colored heat overlay on to test that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould this a plug-in bug or do you think it\u0027s a mod conflict? I wound up testing the stock and stock-based Atomic Age mod radiators and had no issues. Your heat exchangers work fine as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand if you don\u0027t/can\u0027t touch your mods until after 1.1 is released.

Each engine has an \u0022electric efficiency\u0022 - not as a stat ingame, but rather as a balance target. If an engine is set as 70% efficient, then 30% of its Ec/s usage is set as heat output (this has no effect on its performance, it\u0027s simply a useful method to have heat output scale with power consumption). Then the heat output is multiplied by five to produce heat values that actually have an noticable effect ingame. (Originally this multiplier was x10, but people felt the engines ran too hot, so it was reduced.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectric efficiency varies mostly between engine technologies: gridded ion thrusters have a very high efficiency, for instance, while the VASIMRs have the worst - partly to balance out just how good they are in other respects. So you\u0027ll find that a pair of VX-100\u0027s will affect the cooling design of your spacecraft more than a DS4G will, even though both setups consume about the same amount of Ec/s. Efficiency varying between individual engines of the same technology is rare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027ve been thinking about ways to better advertise the heat output in the VAB, though since not even stock engines do that, it\u0027s a bit tricky.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tal Biohazard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tal Biohazard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWill this mod get support for 1.0.5 and 1.1?\u003Cp\u003EI like the radiators very much\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible, but we don\u0027t know yet.

For some reason they don\u0027t seem to dissipate the heat of a reactor (Like literally nothing..)? Also reactors seem to just not generate electricity. What the hell am I doing wrong?

It turns out that there is a stock bug that means that a radiator always pulls *all* of its power radiation capacity out of a part, even if the part\u0027s rules say that it can\u0027t (the small reactor for example is supposed to only allow the extraction of 200 kW of heat). The giant radiators you are using are pulling thousands of kW while the reactor is generating\u00A0100 or 180 kW. What this means effectively is that if a reactor is overcooled, it will have trouble starting up. Either use somewhere around the recommended value of radiators or retract some radiators until the reactor gets started. The Garnet needs up to 1200 kW and the smaller needs 200 kW.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-28T01:21:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nertea\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
