Each surface or atmospheric sample yields 5 materials, and generally material values will correspond to how hard to reach they are. Once activated, the Materials bay will expose the samples it contains for 30 days, with each sample paying off based on its own multiplier as well as the multiplier of the biome it was exposed in. Once exposed those samples are dead and the Materials bay cannot be re-used unless reloaded by an adequately staffed Science Lab. This means that collecting and distributing samples becomes a real game mechanic, rather than just filing a checklist. The materials bay consumes no energy, but results can only be transmitted at 25%. This could be a great thing to run in orbital stations or bases. I would normally not be a fan of long-duration experiments, but I think the non-repeatability of it makes time-warping possible but not advantageous or broken in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESensor Array Computing Nose Cone\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 This experiment collects atmospheric samples, but must run at a roughly constant speed and altitude for 10 seconds to successfully collect a sample. It consumes .5 e/s while activated, shuts off automatically after 10 seconds, and can collect up to 10 samples. These samples, like surface samples, can be loaded into the Materials Bay for additional science payout. Results pay out only 25% on transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGRAVMAX Negative Gravoli Detetector\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 This instrument like the 2HOT Thermometer is toggleable, but is now essentially the biome-mapping instrument. Best used in a polar orbit, it pays off based on how much surface area it maps. It could have a detection radius of 200km or so, be 90% transmittable, but consume .25 e/s while running for balance. Once recorded, the biomes would be a visible in map mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDouble-C Seismic Accelerometer\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 This now becomes the impactor instrument. Placeable only by level 4 scientists, it burrows itself in the surface, detecting a range of 300km or so, and pays out based on the overlapping area between its sensor range and the impact area, which is determined by impactor inertia. In addition to large science payouts, this could detect the richness of resource deposits within range. (In this paradigm, the resource detector would tell you where resources are, but not how rich they are without a surface sample or impactor study.) The experiment requires no outside electricity, and its results are 90% transmittable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T14:39:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T15:54:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI assume the seismometer is placed, then a \u003Cem\u003Eseparate\u003C/em\u003E impactor is used? I see no reason to require a scientist (or even a kerbal) to place it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I think that having to wait to unlock science instruments is bizarre. Can land on another world\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 can\u0027t figure out a thermometer, but can figure out some more complex experiments. The whole set of instrumentation needs to be evaluated outside the box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think science transmission should be more based upon data sent (via coms) than just the experiment. Clearly sample return has little no no transmission value, but pictures depend on the data rate (lower data rate, fewer good pics sent, or more, crappy images sent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps science communication can be done out of focus after a fashion? (hit send, do something else, revisit craft later and it dumps the transpired time worth of data). Have experiments generate science per unit data. So you can have stuff that makes huge amounts of data quantity, but low science per unit data. This requires bringing the experiment back to Kerbin (full science upon landing), or you can broadcast, but it might take years to dump the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to see:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommunications realism bump.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Complex satellite relays should not be required, but meaningful differences in antennas, and a simple LOS check (assume Kerbin-wide ground stations are available). This impacts probes, since they might need an orbiter relay if they are farside from Kerbin. Omnis from the start, high gains soon afterwards (maybe make a non-folding version very soon, then the folding a little later). Any connection could be stored, and rebroadcast later, though, no need for instantaneous relays I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECamera\u003C/strong\u003E (these ideally would work like scansat or something, regardless \u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E transmittable, but data rate should matter)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Wide field camera. Available from the start. Improved science gained by lowering orbit. Broad survey. Past the scansat type useful science, perhaps coverage of the planet could equal science gain (each % of surface imaged equals 1 science, weighted up or down based on altitude?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Hi-res camera. Available from the start, or soon thereafter. More narrow field. Specific \u0022visual observation\u0022 contract type instrument using current \u0022contracts\u0022 as an example (even if I don\u0027t like the science contracts to be 3d party). Hi-res images make X science per % of the world imaged. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Transmission should be set such that the data rate of the antenna matters. You can scan the whole world, but if it takes a month to cover the whole planet and 100 years to transmit, not terribly useful. If you send an impactor with a camera (like Ranger) you need to have the coms capable of sending the images before it hits. Assign a size per pic to above cameras, and a data rate per antenna type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThermometer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess science per use than now, particularly if geomes/regions are going to matter (temp on airless worlds depends on sunlight, period). Available from the start. Ideas above are OK, except on airless worlds where there should not be much variation. Also, importantly, the data is just a number, so 100% transmittable, but set science value per unit data generated so bit rate matters (this is low bit rate stuff, though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGoo\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever. This should be a later experiment than the above few, not the first. Have it generate large amounts of data per unit science, so that the transmission rate matters a lot. Land it for full value, or transmit from orbit for a LONG time.

Parachutes that care about pressure, but no barometers? Really? Ideas above for generating science are good, science per unit data can be tweaked as needed.

You could perhaps make a multiplier if placed by a scientist, and set the base science a little lower to encourage such placement. Data, again, is numbers, so 100% transmission, balanced via data rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEVA reports\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is where skill matters. EVA reports should have science based upon the science skill of the astronaut generally. Note that the \u0022Explore\u0022 contract could give substantial science for the first EVA report regardless of astronaut type. The first impressions of Jeb are scientifically useful, bit for later region/geome/biome hopping, you need a scientist or don\u0027t bother. If the current is 25 (40?) per region as an example, I\u0027d say that is what a level 5 science kerbal gets, so 5(8) for a lvl 1 scientist, and perhaps 1 per level for non-scientists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESample Collection\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
