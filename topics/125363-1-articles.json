Just about everything already runs with mass ratios or mass-related metrics, IIRC. Engines for example completely ignore the resource definition.

Turn it around where you have a fixed timespan of 1 second and a certain amount of thrust, and you can calculate a mass flow rate in kg/s. Only after all that is said and done, the game looks at the resource definition in order to convert the mass flow rate into a \u0022volume\u0022 flow rate (well more like a \u0022unit\u0022 flow rate really) by multiplying in the density, in order to show the player a number in the game UI that\u0026#39;s easily understood.
