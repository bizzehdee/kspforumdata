On the opposite, I can see it as a challenge booster. You see someone doing something on the forums and he did it using a mod and tell yourself \u0022well guess what, I can do it pure stock\u0022 and then proceed to do it only with stock parts. \u002Bchallenge for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, absolutely no one is limiting you in any way? \u003Cem\u003EOther people playing the game like they want to and as modded as they want to is not forcing you to play it like that in any way\u003C/em\u003E.

The developers are totally unrelated to mods, they just left the game open to it. Now you\u0027re asking them to spend some time developing a system to track mod use. Ridiculous. And you why wouldn\u0027t you be able to challenge other people? It\u0027s not because I like building than no one else likes flying like you and that you won\u0027t have anyone to challenge. Don\u0027t worry, there will be plenty of people like you that will want to keep their game stock only and give challenges to other people that do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf devs state that it is indeed ridiculous and they simply will not do it then I\u0027m fine with that.
