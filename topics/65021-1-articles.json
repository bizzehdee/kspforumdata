Debris Section\u0027s purpose is to prevent the damage or destruction of satellites, space stations and spacecraft from collision with debris in Earth\u0027s and the Moon\u0027s orbits. They use a number of methods to dispose of the debris (mainly by burning it via atmospheric reentry or through salvage), accomplished through the use of EVA suits.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe episodes sometimes revolve around debris collection itself, but more often the concept of collecting \u0022trash\u0022 in space is merely a storytelling method for building character development. The members of the Debris Section are looked down upon as the lowest members of the company (and also occupy the lowest decks of the orbital station on which they live and work) and they must work hard to prove their worth to others and accomplish their dreams.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOngoing plot elements include an upcoming exploratory mission to Jupiter on the new fusion powered ship, Von Braun, and the lead character\u0027s decision to join the mission, no matter the cost.

It\u0027s a bit too long and misses out on a lot of help from Oberth. The first burn was about 700 dV and put the tank into an elliptical orbit.

The drones still have probe cores which made it a bit easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder acceleration it\u0027s actually pretty stable, provided you get a good alignment of the payload (the tank, in this case). If the payload alignment is off too much, the center of mass is too far off to the side and it causes the whole mess to skew wildly off course. Hence, pushing the elephant. If you get a good alignment, it\u0027s all hands off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ wasn\u0027t cooperating for a couple reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I don\u0027t think it liked being ejected from the mothership. Sometimes it did a poor job of tracking dV and TWR of the nukes. Also, the dV and TWR is a lie since the payload isn\u0027t actually attached. So MJ doesn\u0027t know about this extra weight. This, in turn, caused MJ to have problems determining when to start firing the engines and they would come on way to late.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I found the ships were much more stable if I just set the course, got a good payload alignment, accelerated the engines, then left it alone. If the tank alignment was a little off and the rocket wasn\u0027t pointed right at the maneuver node guidance, I just left it alone. Adding input sometimes caused too much other motion that just made the steering worse. MJ likes to keep adjusting, which can make the payload tank wiggle more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry about the score. I sort of spotted this as the best bet for me simply because I\u0027ve done the grapple design in stock before. Sending them on solar escape seemed easier to me than trying to land them safely at KSC 2, because I can\u0027t really do that in stock. Especially since they don\u0027t have docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I didn\u0027t anticipate was just how close I shaved the dV for the tanks with fuel. I think I tried more than a dozen attempts at a single burn before I had to split it into two burns. The Kraken doesn\u0027t like having two ships like this, and time warping invariably messes everything up.
