There\u0027s also a way to change settings based on altitude and fade them in/out.\n\nA bunch of under-the-hood changes and lots of bugfixes are also included. You will find a shiny new album in the OP as well as a full changelog and a short explanation on how the new config system/UI works.\n\nPost-processing effect in OpenGL seems to be completely broken in this version but I\u0027ll try to fix it in the next week.\n\nI recommend using the mod in conjuction with rbray\u0027s EVE (I personally use grandma 7-4 version and I haven\u0027t had much time for testing with wip-EVE) and distant object enhancements for the simulated exposure/stars dimming effect (thanks to Proot for this tip).\n\nI\u0027ve added a donate option in the OP so you can support the mod (and me) if you like it.\n\nI\u0027ll be uploading to kerbalstuff in a minute.\n\nHave fun!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T11:36:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 11:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"brusura","CreatedById":57899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T11:39:06Z","Content":"wow ^^ first?
