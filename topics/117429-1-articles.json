The \u0022caveman\u0022 technology has no building upgrades. The fully loaded Kickback SRB cannot be handled by the VAB/SPH team. Everything will be assembled with docking ports on land and in orbit. The tracking station and mission control offer some assistance but no targeting a celestial body. Rocks are what cavemen know.\n\n**The idea is to boldly go interplanetary with \u0022cavemen\u0022 and their technology.**\n\nTo use successive approximation and launch shotgun style and carve out a path for the following rocks(probes) which will then narrow the path for the Duna Boulder Explorer. The probes will allow for course correction by following the probe that makes an intercept. The probes that do not make intercept are used as the limits. More extra fuel will follow and is being sent as remotes probes for plotting and navigating the return to Kerbin.\n\n**Plotting a course to Duna**\n\nCalculations for the Duna transfer window will allow a reasonable attempt to intercept Duna.\n\nThe Duna transfer window requires calculations of: phase angle, ejection velocity and ejection angle.\n\nFirst send a fleet of rocks (probes) to gauge the calculations for the Duna transfer window. This preliminary data is essential before going further.\n\nThe following years close to the launch window eight probes will be sent on intercept with Duna.\n\nThe probes that make near misses are tracked and their orbital paths outline a window that lead to Duna.\n\nProbes that intercept Duna will have the flight data heavily scrutinized.\n\n This successive approximation technique will start to illustrate a boundary and a clear path the Duna Boulder Explorer should take.\n\nPrior to and following the launch of Duna Boulder Explorer another fleet of probes will be used to scout and guide the team to facilitate course corrections.\n\n **** **The Duna Boulder Explorer**\n\nHitchhiker crew quarters, command pod and lander module will be assembled in low Kerbin orbit. The design will use four Poodle engines and drop tanks that will be reduced to a pair of the \u0022Poodle\u0022 engines for the voyage home. \n\nThe Duna Boulder Explorer is intended to have a lander go to the surface and return. Upon return the drop tank is replaced with another and the lander will return to the surface and return. Landings for Ike are also planned.\n\n**Vessel Assembly**\n\nModular rocket building is a method that allows grand scales that the current VAB/SPH team cannot deal with due to union rules and a crappy facility.\n\nThe Kickback SRB must have about a third of its fuel removed just for VAB/SPH handling.\n\nOutside and far away from the facilities the union doesn\u0027t care as long as no VAB/SPH employee are in danger. \n\n The pieces will be assembled on the Vehicle Assembly Lawn and then brought together for final assembly at the launchpad.\n\nThe initial vessels launched will be fuel and engines for the voyage. These will be docked in low kerbin orbit and finally the hitchhiker crew quarters, command pod and lander module will be launched and brought together and assembled. \n\n**Planning Phase and Construction Feasibility**\n\n **Initial Testing**\n\nThis evidence that fuel can be attached and used exclusively. This allows for vessels to incorporate drop tanks. Refueling the vessel is completed by docking with another drop tank.\n\nThe vessel assembly and strength of the docking port was tested. This test also revealed the fuel flow direction issue. \n\n![XTU4h7M.png](http://i.imgur.com/XTU4h7M.png)\n\n**Tools for exploration**\n\nBill has a bag of tricks available but some might prove incompatible with the current technology.\n\n![ygWw2qs.png](http://i.imgur.com/ygWw2qs.png)\n\nThe use of a simulator has been used for feasibility testing but for this mission it will be limited. Thinking about just using essentials such as Delta V and Horizontal speed with altimeter. Apoapsis/Periapsis indicators and would also be helpful. Bill is not sure what else to take.\n\n **The Vehicle Assembly Lawn**\n\nThe VAL can cause many headaches and has many things to educate by failure.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

In either case having control in the vertical plane is important for the final docking sequence. When attempting to connect docking ports a brief change in height can bring the two together. Wheels that retract or landing legs can help facilitate this brief vertical movement.\n\nFor a horizontal approach on an even surface which have both ports aligned. Drift slowly towards the stationary port and be certain the ports are not askew. Brake just in front and let the magnets pull the two together.\n\nWith the surface uneven as it is at the runway vertical docking is accomplished with a stationary docking port on top and then the lower port moving upwards. The two docking ports need to be very close together but should not make contact the magnetic force needs to pull them together. Having the stationary docking port at the bottom then the top port might have to be lifted briefly. \n\nWith landing gear it is possible to crouch and move forward. Duty cycle the Gears button while moving forward and stay at a crouch and make the docking port connection.\n\nI have the docking port slightly lower on my carts. Someone with OCD at the SPH/VAB always releases the parking brake. The carts have to have its wheels retracted to prevent it from rolling away. The launch clamp or probe core could be attached but that wastes one part. Using the small gear bay the Engineering Room crouches briefly and makes the connection. The cart also doubles as a launch platform for the finished rocket. The wheels are retracted and the rocket should be suspended above the ground and stable.\n\n[When the job is completed Bill lights off fireworks.](https://vimeo.com/135479373) \n\n[https://vimeo.com/135479373](https://vimeo.com/135479373)\n\nThis experience has changed my outlook on construction using docking ports. Before I considered rocket building outside the VAB/SPH too much a chore and headache. The gizmos in the VAB/SPH have brought me 180 degree and now see this as so much a part of the kerbal experience. \n\n Use launch clamps to hold a component and then a cart loads up and delivers it to the launch pad where the surface is level and assembly easier. This allows for the VAB/SPH personnel to produce rocket components and Bill and other engineers to construct. If it was not for all those pesky VAB/SPH personnel Bill could have build it inside. Never seen rain or wind on Kerbin yet, so building outside is acceptable.\n\n When the parts started to join in my initial trials I was excited and the outlook was positive, however, after launching an assembled rocket the outlook quickly turned negative. Only having one docking port as a radial connection made a flimsy rocket. When a two part Clamp-O-tron connection was made this opened up new possibilities. The decouple feature is also very important. **Never undock an active or depleted booster**. Next was the use of the Kickback SRB for structural support and by trimming the fuel can also be used as a booster. Building a cart that can transport 18 tonne is also important. \n\nIt would be interesting to see if engineers could have construction buffs similar to pilots and scientists. Fix a tire or repack a chute is nowhere near as awesome as breaking the limits using Kerbal Rocket Konstruction techniques. Maybe an even smaller docking port or light duty connection node with no decouple and engineers make and break connections. The parts still need to be moved into place just as in docking but are joined only when the engineer connects them. The Mod KAS/KIS looks to be on the list to try in the next career.\n\nFor now back to building the bag of rocks (cluster of probes) I plan on chucking towards Duna.\n\nBill has been pressured to reveal his plans for payload attachment.
