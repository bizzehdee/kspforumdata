Even if a change doesn\u0027t make it worse, if it doesn\u0027t solve the problem, there\u0027s no improvement. No improvement can be just as bad is making it worse (or, uh, worse: at least making something worse is a sign they\u0027re willing to make changes. Keeping it the same means they aren\u0027t listening, don\u0027t care, or think there is no issue. Consumers are a finicky bunch and will view things in ways that\u0027ll serve their need first and foremost. Remember, humans are selfish.)

BTW, I was with KSP since release, too, and went through no science to science but no biomes (loved it, btw, as it gave just about the right balance for science progression), to current iterations (cool but utterly useless and game-breaking).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. It is not a waste of effort - all the mechanics are there already and are working, it is just the balance that is screwed.\u00A0 Tweaking that will be a minimal effort with major results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 You are still not getting the math.\u00A0 My idea is that you can get full science from the first experiment, but any subsequent biomes will give you only 1/2 or 3/4 of the first result in terms of science gain (e.g.: first surface sample - 100; second surface sample on the same planet but from a different biome - 50, from a third biome - 25, etc)\u00A0 That means that you will not be able to get more than x2 (with 1/2 multiplier) or x4 (with 3/4) no matter how much you grind a particular planet, and results are diminishing with every mission (as opposed to current constant and reliable totals of x9 for Minmus and x15 for Mun).\u00A0 Grind will become inefficient very quickly, and the player will be forced to try extraplanetray expeditions instead of being assured that the next technology level lies just behind yet another Mun landing (boooooring... first time is exciting, second time is ok, third time is a routine, forth time... \u0022no, thanks\u0022, unless it is an anomaly or a surface base mission).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople who want to use science multiplier can always do so... or just play sandbox.\u00A0 This change would not affect this category of players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4 (\u0022Why do we need game modes\u0022): Absolutely irrelevant to the subject being discussed here.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. We already have a system (however broken) in place.\u00A0 What are the chances that it will suddenly be scrapped and replaced with a totally new, \u0022better\u0022 one?\u00A0 I\u0027d say just about ZERO, especially considering that it is obviously not a priority for developers at the moment.\u00A0 On the other hand, tweaking the existing system (minimal effort, see above) to satisfy a certain (non-negligible) subset of players while not affecting the others, and yet potentially driving up the interest and retention of players (including new/casual, KSP fans/oldfags liker myself, and those coming from the EDU branch) is a totally different story, IMHO, with significantly higher chance of ever seeing the light of day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-11T03:39:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2016 03:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tau137\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
