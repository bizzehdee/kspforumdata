In addition to the command module (cockpit), I have one RGU near the CoM and a reaction control wheel unit between the above units (which is to say that it is not at an extreme distance from the CoM). The RGU is there in case I needed to switch control to it and compare flights, but it wasn\u0027t necessary. I also made sure that the ship\u0027s mass is within the starting TWR limits of the engine. Results: very nice, smooth control on climbs (its a rocket plane) and near apoapsis controls are quick and stable.
