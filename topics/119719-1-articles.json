Rifles have recoil and limited ammo, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ehalfway to your destination you turn around to decelerate\u003C/span\u003E, and spacesuits have catheters. Sadly, like most fiction, this attention to detail does not extend to basic physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Clasp Hand Formation\u0022 - In the show, it is shown that if you want to make a mecha fly fast in space, give it a big jetpack. So far so good. Next, if you want to make a mecha fly even faster in space, have it hold hands with another mecha with a jetpack. Keep in mind that both mecha fire their jetpacks and run out of fuel at the same time. Then if you want go REALLY REALLY fast, have 256 Mecha with jetpacks hold hands... and fire their engines at the same time, thus running out of fuel at the same time. (Keep in mind that the jetpacks are heavy and can be ejected.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERailgun Mecha Launcher - At the same time as the \u0022try not to run out of fuel\u0022 speech, the Mecha\u0027s are being launched out of the FRONT of the ship when the enemy they are fighting is BEHIND the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacecraft Turn in Wide Circles - No comment. Clearly spacecraft have the maneuverability of oil tankers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccelerating at 5g\u0027s - To escape, the Sidonia fires the right engine while keeping the left engine off, in order to accelerate and turn rapidly. So far so good. If you do this while the engines are firing at 5g\u0027s, you get 5g\u0027s worth of structural damage inside the spacecraft due to \u0022perceived\u0022 gravity coming from a 90 degree angle from where it normally does. Wait a sec - if you have a craft approx 30km long and 5km wide, the center of mass is near the center, and you accelerate from a single engine at the rear of your craft... here\u0027s a diagram:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXOOOOX????????????????????XMMMMEngine Firing This Way ----\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXOOOOX????????????????????XMMMMX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXOOOOX????????????????????XMMMMEngine Turned Off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX=Hull\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EO=Ocean (heavy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E?=Open air and hollow structures (light)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM=Engine Stuff(heavy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, firing only one engine will cause gravity to come from a up to a 90 degree angle relative to the rest of the craft from the perspective of the people in the area labelled \u0022??????\u0022. Clearly, firing only a single engine at 5g\u0027s imparts imparts 5g\u0027s worth of apparent gravity at a 90 to 45 degree angle... Note that the craft only turns about 45 degrees, so centrifugal force is not an issue. Anyway, the resulting trajectory is at a 45 degree angle compared to the original vector. The original vector was the result of periodically firing the engines over a thousand years, and the new trajectory was obtained after just a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T19:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd in spite of all of this, I still enjoyed Knights of Sidonia.

Just so we have one nice big place to talk about this without having to sort between physics discussions and general comments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, here\u0027s my answers to OP\u0027s comments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Last I checked, the clasp formation isn\u0027t really to boost speed so much as keep the Guardians together. I suppose also it ensures that if one engine underperforms, that guy doesn\u0027t get left behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I don\u0027t think that Kidonia\u0027s engines are capable of producing more than 1 G (I may be wrong). My thinking is that the artificial gravity is running parallel to the engine. Assuming they don\u0027t have a way to flip it to negative, then as the engines power up, the artificial gravity can power down to maintain roughly 1 G. At full throttle, the engines\u0027 acceleration would provide all the artificial gravity - but if they went above that, yeah, people would get pancaked and buildings would collapse. Of course this only applies when both engines are firing symmetrically; fire one or the other and yeah, you\u0027ll get sideways gravity as shown in the manga / anime and the OP here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I think they launched Guardians out of the front because they didn\u0027t have launchers in the back. Guardians can just fly around to the back anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I have a bigger problem with the fact that the center of thrust on the Guardians seems to be way off center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- So they tried to save resources by making humans photosynthetic. But we still have the law of conservation of mass. Humans will still need to consume the same amount of matter to stay alive - it\u0027s just changed from conventional food to uh, other chemicals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Course I still loved the anime and the manga. I\u0027m not a mecha person, but fortunately it\u0027s not overly heavy on the mecha motif.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T23:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGotta say, even if it \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E realistic, I find the concept of a bunch of Mecha in such a formation to be rather silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m scared.
