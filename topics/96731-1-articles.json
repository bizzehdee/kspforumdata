The Escape Pods were delivered and were a lot of fun docking them in their Cargo Bays. I am still not sure if I should Jettison the Launch Rockets from it\u0027s sides because they look nice, but there are solar panels on each side of the craft that look really nice also when they are deployed. Also there are large Bay Doors on Kerbin Gazer for entry of small crafts and it has two docking stations inside. I\u0027ve removed one door on a previous build and it didn\u0027t stay together as I hoped it would and if so it could have been controlled to close after crafts entered. Still tweaking it and having fun as always in KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/VMXnhMo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VMXnhMo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/qI8g3Pg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qI8g3Pg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/W4LebnB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W4LebnB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscape Pods: Gallery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/d7QXa#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/d7QXa#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin Gazer: Gallery\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/A233h#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/A233h#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-17T14:58:54Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2015 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by castille7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
