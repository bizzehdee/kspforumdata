When the mod is not in there, the game loads, but the framerate is too low to be playable (like 4 or 5 fps). So the conclusion is that I NEED ATM with the amount of mods that I have and the system I am running on, but for some reason it is messing up my system. I looked in the appropriate folder for a error log, but none was found. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any questions, let me know. Any help is appreciated.
