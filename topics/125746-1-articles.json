Suborbital flights, even with an apoapsis below 70km, can be unrecoverable because of going too steep: this is much more an issue than with 1.0.4 (even crafts going as low as 30km with a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ascent angle can be too fast). You\u0026#39;ll have to put much more horizontal speed than you had to until now, you\u0026#39;ll need larger rockets to even reach space but this solution works.
