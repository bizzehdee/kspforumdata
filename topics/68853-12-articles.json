He never played it before, but he is quickly learning. (GregTech mod for minecraft, which he plays and records, is not a thing for noobs). His idea was to make the \u0022videos about history of spaceflight\u0022. I\u0027ve told him that there\u0027s a guy, his name is Bob and he makes Project Alexandria. Now he is watching your videos and really inspired by them. So, you may not get The Great Answer, but you get subscribers AND followers who want to make interesting KSP stuff.
