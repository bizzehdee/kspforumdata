Jools extremely hot and dense atmosphere (I remember dropping a probe into jool sometime back and the pressure and temperature readouts were imporessive to say the least), the high velocity at Pe due to the strong gravity, and the fact that in KSP atmosphere just start, instead of there being a huge gas cloud around the planet, might really make it nearly impossible to aerocapture at Jool. You might be able to slow yourself enough to easily aerocapture at laythe though. If I understand it correctly the only place where aerocapture is realistic is Duna, as a realworld counterpart to Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T12:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could see hitting Laythe to aerocapture into Jool orbit, then returning for another pass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T13:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, there\u0027s an excellent reason to use Laythe aerobraking for Jool capture, even if you don\u0027t have other problems with Jool itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use Laythe, then your resulting orbit around Jool will be much less eccentric than if you had aerobraked on Jool itself, since your periapsis will be up at the altitude of Laythe\u0027s orbit rather than down by Jool\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, in turn, means that you need a lot less dV to visit all the various moons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Palec","CreatedById":64875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T13:50:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, as I can see, its not a bug but feature \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E After multiple attempts, I found out that PE 197,5km will capture me, but my spaceplane will survive it.

Nothing gets hot at all and the process hardly lasts any time due to the very shallow penetration needed these days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you\u0027re the 2nd person I\u0027ve read today saying you\u0027re blowing up even just scratching the surface. The 1st guy was hitting the air at about 9km/s, though, even with a perfect transfer that minimized his relative velocity with Jool. I really wonder how that\u0027s possible because I\u0027ve never had a ship doing more than 5km/s when hitting Jool\u0027s air, even with my customarily sloppy transfers. Where did all his extra speed come from? All I can say is that I always aerocapture prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to doing aerocapture at Laythe to start with instead of bouncing off Jool first, that\u0027s a different story. I recently had 2 ships try this. The 1st one hit Laythe\u0027s air about 5km/s, had a 28.5km Pe, and still needed a retroburn of about 200m/s to capture. INTENSE flames but nothing burned up. The 2nd ship arrived at 3.5km/s and a Pe of 31.5km also didn\u0027t quite capture it, but in the process a retracted dish antenna on the side burned off. Both ships had probes covered with intact fairings that limited damage and also no doubt limited braking. These were also prograde aerocaptures (or rather aerobrakings, as I had to capture with engines after both).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in my experience, going straight in at Laythe is quite intense and runs the risk of burning stuff up, but Jool\u0027s a doddle (other than the warp-preventing bug). Also, it often works out that you can\u0027t hit Laythe directly anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
