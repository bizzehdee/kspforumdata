That drops weight without dropping engines, keeping more thrust available longer. I also like to put probe cores on upper stages that end up in orbit, and forward facing separatrons to deorbit them. But due to this one limitation with auto staging I have to use one of the workarounds to keep ascent guidance from firing the separatrons at the same time as the engine(s) in the stage below them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother configuration incompatible with auto staging is radially attached fuel tanks and engines on a stage, that you do not want burning until after the core they\u0027re stuck onto is empty.

I\u0027ve been trying to fix issues in the KER deltaV calculations for quite a while and there are all sorts of tricky examples that are either difficult or impossible to simulate without more input. E.g. if you create a lander with detachable science pods with legs on, designed to be decoupled on lift-off but otherwise only having one real stage (i.e. one engine that is used for landing and ascent) then, the following your actual mission profile will use some of the fuel during the landing and then the rest on take-off once the extra weight has been dropped. There is no (easy and foolproof) way (at present) that the mod can know how much of the fuel is burnt during landing so it can account for the reduced mass during the ascent.
