The liquid fuel, inline turbojet in the Karbonite Mod uses a different thrust/velocity range then the standard turbojet. You don\u0027t reach peak thrust until 1350m/s and it drops to nothing at something like 1522m/s. I tweaked it\u0027s numbers to match the standard turbojets (mostly cause I prefer how they look) and my planes performance changed dramatically. The plane in the below screen shots managed to reach a stable 150km orbit using less then 130m/s deltaV from it\u0027s rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using a bunch of mods but the ones that play a role in this spaceplane would be Procedural Wings (to limit part count), Karbonite and Deadly Reentry.

I managed to meet up with, capture and redirect the orbit of a 524.88t asteroid. Admittedly the plane I used was barely able to nudge the asteroid (think I went from 900 deltaV potential before contact to 22 deltaV after contact and had to use 15 of that for the redirect maneuver) but it was enough to put it into an eliptical orbit (8.7m - 82.3m) around Kerbin. Plus I was able to return to KSC. Of course, the return required something like six aerobrake maneurvers and it was sheer luck that the last maneuver happened to take me close enough to KSC to make the landing.
