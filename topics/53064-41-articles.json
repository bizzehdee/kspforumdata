While I\u0027m guessing that this means you\u0027ve really fleshed out your science experiments, I am concerned that this will force anyone using this mod into a single scientific path rather than allowing for departures based on personal preference. I would suggest keeping science parts lower in the tech tree so that they could be used in conjunction with your experiment mechanic.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also noticed that you are tightly intertwining RPL with RSS by highlighting specific planetary probes in the tech tree. While I can\u0027t be sure of your intentions, this does have me concerned that you will also carry this theme over to the experiment progression, completely removing that option for those of us who, for one reason or another, don\u0027t use the full blown RSS (even when it\u0027s up and running with terrain on all of the planets, I will be using a rescaled Kerbol rather than Sol). If this is where you want to take this mod, that is your choice, but I would request that you either provide instructions to write / modify the experiments so they work with stock planet names or provide a second version designed to work without the Sol system and it\u0027s planet names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi SpaceInvader,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the feedback. Have you read the disclaimer on the OP? The challenges of developing separate settings for stock \u0026amp; RPL would be extremely complicated, more importantly so it would require me to create 2 trees. (One stock the other RPL flavored) I\u0027m not discounting this possibility in the distant future, but until then I will continue along the same path as described in the initial mission statement. (RPL/RO focused, with a potential stock alternative)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the stock science tools being higher up in the tree, you are spot on. There will be (future tense) enough science points to reach them using the custom experiments. The reason I\u0027ve placed them so high was to help with balancing. (IE, how much science can you acquire, and at what point.) The stock science instruments make this somewhat more complex since they aren\u0027t locked to specific bodies. So you personally have to make a call \u0027how far\u0027 would the average user get. Once balance is more strong, I\u0027d be willing to consider either having them as a generic seperate science tools, or something of the sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just to be clear, although the science tree will be lightly linear in some sections, there will be more \u0027optional\u0027 science modules strapped on to the body/planet tech lines. If you look at Moon, Mars, Venus. They are somewhat dependent on the first node of each line, but the others are optional. So you don\u0027t have to do \u0027all mars, all moon, all venus\u0027 experiments before moving on. Although you\u0027ll probably want to get those science points at some point! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E So you will be deciding what\u0027s the next step int eh program without following a linear progression path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I started this I had no idea the magnitude of work that would be involved in creating/updating/implementing all these mods \u0026amp; ideas. This is literally the first mod ever I\u0027ve created and shared. So it\u0027s a bit of a haphazard process as I get my bearings through all the ever revolving changes of other people\u0027s mod, core game and design decisions I do on my side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the core design of RPL gets a good footing, perhaps I\u0027d consider forking the project and finding some insane person willing to try and maintain/update/develop a vanilla version of RPL. (A hefty task if I do say so myself)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, I\u0027m struggling and I have massive support from Nathan, the community and some really kind posters.
