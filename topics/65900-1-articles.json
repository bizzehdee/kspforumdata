Try to check fertilizers, you\u0027ll probably find something with high amount of it (or at least ammonium nitrate, but that doesn\u0027t pack as much oxidative power).

Rubber based solid rocket motors use a solid oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate, usually a metal fuel such as aluminum or magnesium, and a binder, almost always HTPB rubber which acts as both a fuel and a source of the propellant gas.\u003Cp\u003E Binders are the glue that keeps everything together in a solid rocket motor, and after the individual propellant chemicals are mixed, the rubber monomers are ploymerized into rubber. Tire rubbers are already polymerizer so they will not act as a binder unless you to add more rubber monomers to turn a mixture into a solid rubber. This will not make a better propellant than just starting with the proper chemical composition in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Commercial binders are unpolymerized rubber monomers of Polybutadiene-acrylic acid-acrylonitrile (PBAN) rubber or Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) rubber. Below is a drawing of how 1,3-butadiene is polymerized into rubber. By adjusting the curing conditions and the amount of cross-linking additives, you can alter the properties of the polybutadiene rubber. If ammonium perchlorate is used as the oxidizer, these class of propellants are called APCP (ammonium perchlorate composite propellants)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/1%2C3-Butadiene_Polymerization.PNG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/1%2C3-Butadiene_Polymerization.PNG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E PBAN gives very slightly higher Isp initially than HTPB as a binder, but doesn\u0027t age well, is expensive and has no other commercial use. HTPB has many commercial uses, is inexpensive and ages well, so it is the binder of choice for commercial solid rocket motors. There are enegetic binders such as GAP that will provide a few percent gain in Isp, however these binders are explosives, require special handling, and are again too expensive for all commercial and virtually all military applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A good general reference for rocket propulsion in general is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/mtcr/text/mtcr_handbook_item4.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.fas.org/nuke/control/mtcr/text/mtcr_handbook_item4.pdf\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Does sound like alot of work though and maybe not entirely relevant to the OP\u0027s question, but it just popped up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
