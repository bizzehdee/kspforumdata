This built on earlier tests of the \u0022EM Drive\u0022 a similar, but bulkier and better-performing drive, which was tested back in January (but the results were not released until NASA had also tested the Cannae Drive in August) and appeared to work as well. I suggest reading the Wikipedia article for a more complete history of the devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EmDrive\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EmDrive\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this hit the media, there were two waves of articles. The first wave simply expressed astonishment at the exciting discovery and its possible implications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second wave largely criticized the device- based either on the \u0022it\u0027s too good to be true\u0022 line of logic (with no evidence to back up these criticisms other than that the device *appeared* to violate known laws of physics- but remember, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea law of science is only a law of science *until we find an exception to it*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. Theory, must explain results, rather than the other way around..) or on pulling apart the abstract of the NASA paper (which was released ahead of the full article) and making dangerous assumptions about the paper (and that the tests were performed improperly) which turned out not to be true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an actual scientist in real life, I was quite upset by all of this. First, very few scientists ASK for this kind of publicity- in fact the Chinese professor who validated the EmDrive ahead of NASA actually said \u0022the publicity was \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Every unwelcome\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. Second, the buffoonery of automatically assuming an experiment is wrong, simply because it defies established notions of how things works, simply baffled me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent a period of time working in an equally controversial (perhaps more so) field to theoretical physics- stem cell research. And the degree to which people outside of the field would *consistently* mis-understand and mis-represent results in the field (especially when they challenged established notions, such as how aging and cancer work), never ceased to irritate or amaze me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, having some sympathy for the poor physicists whose results and credibility were being unjustly attacked (I can *guarantee* you many of them were hesitant to publish their data for precisely this reason), and the idea behind an EmDrive actually being one I had independently thought of myself one day when pondering what would happen when you shined light (or microwaves) in an asymmetrical resonant cavity (although clearly I never did anything with this idea- since I never majored in physics, and figured there was probably some reason I didn\u0027t know of it wouldn\u0027t work...), I largely kept my quiet (after a few ill-fated attempts to defend the scientists\u0027 credibility to people who were simply unwilling to listen), and waited for more facts to come out about the drive, and for myself to have time to look them up...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, anyways, long explanation aside, there *were* more facts to the story. Some of them didn\u0027t take very long to come out at all. For instance, just a week or so after the major wave of criticism, Wired released the following Q\u0026amp;A to clear up common misconceptions about the drive:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-08/07/10-qs-about-nasa-impossible-drive\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-08/07/10-qs-about-nasa-impossible-drive\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, one of the most COMMON misconceptions about the NASA test, which was fairly obvious to me even back when the abstract was released, was that people were mis-understanding what was going on with the \u0022Null\u0022 device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the situation was this: the lead scientist behind the \u0022Cannae Drive\u0022 (Fetta), had certain theoretical ideas about how such a device should/would work, and what were the reasons for that. These led to him engraving \u0022slots\u0022 into one of the ends in his resonant cavity of his device, which he THOUGHT were necessary for the drive to work. However NASA tested versions of the device with *and* without the slots, and BOTH produce thrust. Many *INCORRECTLY* interpreted this to mean that the \u0022control\u0022 had produced thrust as well- which would have obviously invalidated the results. \u003Cstrong\u003ETHIS WAS NOT IN FACT THE CASE.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone who had bothered even to *carefully* read the abstract, and maybe educate themselves a little about Fetta\u0027s underlying theory, would have immediately realized that the no-slots device only invalidated the need for SLOTS in the device. In fact, NASA tested a *THIRD* device- this one with a resistive, rather than resonant, cavity. THIS was the control- and as expected THIS produced absolutely no thrust. All NASA proved with the slots vs. no-slots device is that Fetta\u0027s underlying explanation for how his device worked was wrong, and there was absolutely need to carve slots into the device in order to make it work (in fact, this slightly *decreases* the performance of the device). The *actual* control produced no thrust- so the test was valid. To quote the scientists at NASA:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Finally, a 50 ohm RF resistive load was used in place of the test article to verify no significant systemic effects that would cause apparent or real torsion pendulum displacements. The RF load was energised twice at an amplifier output power of approximately 28 watts and no significant pendulum arm displacements were observed.\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I pointed out earlier, \u003Cstrong\u003ETHEORY FOLLOWS FACT\u003C/strong\u003E. This is *absolutely essential* to understanding science/technology, and a key lesson for any good scientist. That means, we don\u0027t start with a theory, and then twist the facts to support it (in fact this is one major mistake many researchers in biology make- which better scientists such as those I trained under as a student at friggin\u0027 \u003Cstrong\u003ECornell University\u003C/strong\u003E, a school I am *VERY* proud of being able to call my alma mater, had to *constantly* point out is the WRONG way to do things...) Rather, we *must* start out with observed results, and adjust our hypotheses (which is any ideas we have before those results) to come up with a theory that can explain our results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo take a famous, but probably fictitious story from the life of the very scientist whose \u0022laws\u0022 the EmDrive results are purported to violate; Isaac Newton didn\u0027t *start* with the theory of gravity, and then use the fall of an apple to justify it- rather he started with the fall of an apple, and then came up with the theory to *explain* observed results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same needs to hold with the Canne/EmDrive. If the device appears to violate the Conservation of Momentum by using no propellent, we can\u0027t simply state that it\u0027s impossible because it violated preconceived notions- this is *exactly* the kind of thinking that used to trap us in the faulty scientific theories of the late Middle Ages (where many results that violated the prevailing theories of the day were rejected simply because they did not conform to faulty expectations- it was not until the introduction of the Scientific Method that this kind of thinking *truly* got thrown out the window...) Rather, we need to carefully analyze the results and experimental methods with a critical eye. If no fault can be found with them, we have to *consider* that our preconceived notions (that there are no exceptions to the Conservation of Momentum, for instance), may in fact be false...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow note I\u0027m NOT saying the Cannae Drive *did* really prove Newton was wrong, or that all our existing theory should be thrown out the window- only that the criticism leveled against it was, largely, illegitimate. The masses of people who jumped on the band wagon about the no-slots version of the Cannae Drive is just one example of what I\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I would like to revive discussion of this apparently \u0022old\u0022 news here. Largely, because the Cannae/EmDrive \u003Cstrong\u003EHASN\u0027T\u003C/strong\u003E gone away. The media (with its 3-second attention-span, and the scientific literacy of a 5 year old to match) simply lost interest in the subject, and many people implicitly assumed that the ill-founded criticism against it was valid, and the whole thing had been dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is, of course, not the case.\u003C/strong\u003E NASA\u0027s \u0022Eagleworks\u0022 division continues to work on improved versions of the testing apparatus (and higher-powered versions of the device itself), while additional labs at NASA, and across the country (including John Hopkins University, for starters) line up to test the devices after NASA is done with it. There will be *quite* a few more articles on the Em/Canne Drives in the not-too-distant future, it hasn\u0027t been discredited in any way *yet*, and may not ever be. It is quite possible that 30 or 40 years from now, we may indeed be flying in EmDrive airplanes (most likely powered by wireless power transmission, as the EmDrive requires no propellent, but DOES require large amounts of electricity to produce usable thrust levels), spaceplanes, and even rockets to Mars. If you can circumvent the need for propellent, you can circumvent the Rocket Equation, and then the sky (truly) no longer becomes the limit in a \u003Cstrong\u003E*very*\u003C/strong\u003E real way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E If you\u0027re curious, there are *several* possible theoretical explanations for the EmDrive. The Chinese team justified it with a certain interpretation of Maxwell\u0027s Equation. Fetta defended it with a theory that required the use of slots, and turned out to be wrong. And perhaps my *favorite* explanation, because it means there actually *is* a propellent, even if it never enters or leaves the drive in a conventional manner, is that it pushes against particles that spontaneously pop in and out of existence anywhere in the universe as predicted by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle- particles that have sometimes (incorrectly) been referred to as the \u0022quantum vacuum plasma\u0022 (they \u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E behave as a plasma, at least not in the classical sense of the word- but there *ARE* such particles, this much was already well-studied and extensively validated *long* before the invention of the EmDrive...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T10:20:33Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 10:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T12:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought the general consensus among the scientific community was \u0022more experimentation is necessary\u0022, which is appropriate when an anomalous result is obtained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe media are going to do what media always do, sensationalize one way or the other to sell copies or bait clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T12:31:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the write up Northstar, with so much testing being done on this it makes me very excited for the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T14:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are aware you can have multiple controls in the same experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*one* of their controls produced thrust, and one didn\u0027t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next question is if the one that didn\u0027t was an appropriate control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider a very simple PCR reaction... lets say you are screening colonies for a successful transformation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have a negative control that is just water instead of a PCR mix - then when its negative, and all your other colonies are positive, do you conclude they were all successfully transformed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you include a PCR mix without the fwd primer? without the rv? without the polymerase? without the DNTPs? without the template?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you do a ligation, and in one you have ligase\u002BDNA insert\u002B backbone, and as negative control you also try insert\u002B backbone but no ligase, another that is backbone and ligase but no insert?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you include any colonies from those as negative controls in your PCR screen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA positive result for any of those could mean a problem with your PCR screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood experiments have good controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because one negative control works, doesn\u0027t mean anything if it wasn\u0027t a good negative control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid they put that Rf load in the same cavity? was the RF load device otherwise the same as the RF test device\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid they alter the shape so that its not resonant?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould they replace the microwave emitter with a LED emitting visible light (presumably, given the different wavelength, it wouldn\u0027t be resonant)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe paper only states:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022the test article was replaced by an RF load to verify that the force was not being generated by effects not associated with the test article.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are all kinds of other explanations (magnetic interactions, interactions with the air, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey had no controls to rule out other possible explanations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey did have a prediction specific to the effect they are trying to prove, and the negative control for that prediction failed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir RF test load is not worth much as a control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe device produced a force.
