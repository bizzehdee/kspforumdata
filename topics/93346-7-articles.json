Especially the bad paying \u0022test x landed at kerbin\u0022 or \u0022in flight over kerbin\u0022 give an incredible amount of science sometimes. Easy to farm a couple hundred science with only equipment testing on launchpad in some minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same with a couple other contracts. My first mun visit in 0.90 (orbit only) brought 1.5 Million cash, some hundred reputation and 1500 science back to kerbin. Only with the basic mun contracts and i think 7 or 8 \u0022perform visual survey\u0022 contracts at once around mun. (Nothing better then upgrading contract building to maximum before anything else)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T05:11:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zarakon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zarakon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree about the outsourced R\u0026amp;D problem, but I don\u0027t understand why people are saying contracts give too much science.

It\u0027s so hard in the beginning because of a lack of aircraft. The survey contracts will be your only hope for the first half-hour or so. And it becomes a huge grind-fest with rockets. We need aircraft early on to balance it out. Plus, the Survey contracts could be a bit easier, by removing the altitude limit ( still in the atmosphere though) and making the survey automatic. Sometimes you\u0027re going too fast to right click the Command Pod, and find the crew report button, and click it. It should be automatic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerdansig","CreatedById":107741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T06:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still haven\u0027t completed a single survey, and I honestly think let\u0027s just remove them.
