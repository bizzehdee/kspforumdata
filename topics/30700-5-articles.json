Now that we can steer with reaction wheel we don\u0027t need steering authority from RCS any more. And with a pair of R24-77 for deorbit you can translate retrograde fine too. So really the only thing that\u0027ll be missing from the new build is the ability to translate forwards and sideways.

This results in a TWR curve of something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIgnition: 1.7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st booster pair separation: 1.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd booster pair separation: 1.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd booster pair separation: 1.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this is that first and second pair of boosters are used for the vertical climb stage where engines are fighting gravity and drag so they need good TWR. Once you cut loose the 2nd pair of boosters the air is pretty thin and you start gravity turn, by the time the last pair of boosters burn out you are getting close to horizontal (so minimal gravity loss) and in near vacuum. With both gravity drag and air drag near zero you can then finish the climb to orbit at a leisurely pace. Having a low TWR for final stage means you\u0027re not lugging as many engines up to the final orbit (so more payload) and the gentle TWR means it\u0027s easier to achieve circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay we aim for core stage TWR of 1.2 at separation for your rocket. That means core stage \u002B payload is around 276 tons. With a 138 ton payload you are left with 138 tons of rocket. So minus the weight of your engines and guidance systems and you are left with the target wet weight of fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut is the TWR supposed to be reduced when gravity turn has started?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe eff. thrust to fight gravity, (the thrust used in calc. of TWR) is thrust*sin(vertical angle of rocket)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif i have a mainsail, the thrust is 1500*sin(30)=750 when the rocket\u0027s vert.angle is 30 degrees\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T22:35:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes TWR becomes less important the more horizontal your rocket becomes since the more horizontal the less loss due to gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut it this way, it\u0027s not so much \u0022upper stage need less TWR\u0022, instead it\u0027s more \u0022upper stage doesn\u0027t need as many engines since it\u0027s thrusting sideways\u0022.
