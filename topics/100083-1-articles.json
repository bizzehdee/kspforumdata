What the heck do you do if the axis of your model is not up\u0027down, left\u0027right but at odd angles?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlender lets me create a box in just the right location but, the axis\u0027s are all over the place and Blender is braindead when it comes to a simple function as AXIS ROTATION!!!! Something older programs for the Amiga had in 1985.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity lets me move the axis but this moves the entire box. I can create a transform in Unity that allows me to move it around but not the actual \u0027airlock\u0027 mesh itself. That moves as the axis does. And I have not seen a tutorial that says to use a transform for an airlock. The box, turned into a collider and set as trigger is, as far as my research is, is the way to do it. Undoable from what I can find out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I missing? What tutorial have I not seen/read at least 10 times each? What thread, in the deep dark recesses of this forum, have I missed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still am not 100% sure that Z has to face out and Y \u0027up\u0027 but 99.8% is close enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had Unity and KSP blowup on me as I\u0027ve fiddled around and I don\u0027t want to have to reinstall Unity again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help, even if it\u0027s a \u0022DUCK!\u0022 when someone else starts throwing things at me, would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bac9","CreatedById":57757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T06:23:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUh, create a box primitive in Unity, remove it\u0027s mesh renderer component, scale it to dimensions you need, rotate it into orientation you need and move it to position you need?
