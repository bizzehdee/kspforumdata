I\u0027ve manually and very tediously installed all the required and highly recommended mods plus MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: RCS Thrusters dont connect to their fuel tank. With the correct fuel in the tank (any fuel, I\u0027ve tried all of them) the RCS thrusters wont fire on the launchpad or in space. Regular thrusters will give the option to automatically put the right fuel in the attachd fuel tank, RCS thrusters don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: The RemoteTech transmitter on Earth like Kerbin is somewhere in the northern part of south America and there are no launch sites there. Thus its not possible to launch unmanned missions on day 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Coms relays placed at a couple hundred meters from the launchpad lose their antenna upon launching a new rocket from the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: The Mk1 and Mk1-2 Command pods weigh about 300kg, is that correct? They get no reentry effects because they are so light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: The Mk1 Parachute placed well inside fairings burns up \u0022on reentry\u0022 while launching, this is with a max TWR of 3. One side of the procedural fairings will heat up (while going up through the atmosphere) by up to 300-400\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C more than the other half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: While launching the camera will at some part of the launch clip down far below the rocket, or far above it for no apparent reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this is the right place to get some help to resolve these issues. I\u0027ve tried several solutions to solve these.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T11:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom your various symptoms my guess would be that one or more of the mods are not correctly installed.

Depending on your ascent profile, if this PE \u0022hovers\u0022 momentarily at the camera\u0027s transition threshold, then the camera may spend a few seconds hesitating. Given that RO alters the size of the planet and, proportionately, the atmospheric altitude and density profile (the edge-altitude reaches higher than the game\u0027s default 68km) but cannot alter the camera\u0027s orbital transition threshold altitude, this might contribute to camera hesitation, especially if the ascent profile would be prone to causing such hesitation on stock-FAR Kerbin anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T20:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking at that log, I notice that Real Fuels doesn\u0027t work for you, which would explain a few of your problems. AFAIK the latest ModuleManager introduced some pretty big changes, which broke Real Fuels (Nathankell is working on an update to fix this) and quite possibly some other relevant mods as well. The solution would probably be to revert to an older version of Module Manager for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T22:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the issues remain even after you get RF installed and working properly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. As of the latest RealFuels, you should see an autoconfigure option in a fuel tank for attached RCS. Note, however, that RCS propellants follow stack flow rules, not allvessel rules, so you need a valid crossfeed between the fuel tank and the thruster. If in doubt, place a 24-77 in the same spot and configure the fuel tank for that engine; if it doesn\u0027t fire, neither will RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2,3. Please check the 2nd post in the Realism Overhaul thread. It has various extra patches, including one for RT2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. That sounds very incorrect. I would suggest following the troubleshooting steps in the RO thread\u0027s first post, and if that fails post there to let RedAV8R know. The Mk1 pod should have a mass of about a ton, and the MK1-2 about 4 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I\u0027ll check that out.
