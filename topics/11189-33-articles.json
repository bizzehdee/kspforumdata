Would explain how the solar panels are mounted radially sense you cant do that to RCS tanks that I first though they where. Also it seems that RCS is used as propulsion not just maneuvering sens theres no other reason for so many RSC thrusters.\n\nYou can use mods I think but the rules say stock wings, stock engines so if he has boosters that are not stock its not valid for k-prize.\n\nAny way not complaining. Just nice if people post more then one low res picture and maybe a short description of the craft so people can understand how it works,\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T22:54:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983**"},{"CreatedByName":"glacierre","CreatedById":63209,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T06:34:32Z","Content":"If those are boosters and they are solid, then it would not be even completely refuellable.
