You can do ultra heavy loads like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for this idea, what you do is make a payload \u002B orbital transfer \u002B interplanetary stage (with a primary pusher like nuclear rockets, so you can use 100% liquid fuel) that will fit symmetrically between an even number of envelopes. Then you size the envelope number onto your superstructure so that the payload is essentially weightless up to at least 25k. Easy to test.. just launch this by itself and wait. If it reaches above 25k, you\u0027re all set. You attach the payload stage with docking clamps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, you attach a segmented, single winged body on the outside of each airship envelope and attach Jet Engines, fuel, control, electrics, etc. I like putting Kerbals into everything, personally, so I use Mk1 cockpits on each side, but you could use probe bodies for everything. I use a probe body for the orbital transfer stage. You want to keep the tanks symmetrically distributed along the center of of the airship envelope, and THEN attach wings to determine lift characteristics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fly it, launch it from the runway at low thrust.. it should lift very easily, or it may even liftoff without thrust..if it does that, lower the buoyancy or set the altitude control to 0.00 meters per second.... you want to bite into the air a bit to get forward momentum.. and just be gentle with the throttle and controls. Don\u0027t get to high speeds until you are above 10k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes some learning to get used to.. and I lost a lot of them.. but I have gotten the profile down pretty well. With this idea, you can lift huge payloads to orbit with minimal fuel expended. You may have to add nuclear rockets to the Airship rig to maintain thrust at very high altitudes, but here the trick is to get higher altitudes with longer dwell time because this craft will have a lot of drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo recover is very very easy. Don\u0027t try to use the altitude control while plummeting... it ends up making you like a cork bobbing up and down.. unless you want to just leave it running for 3 hours while it figures itself out :-) Anyhoo, I would set the altitude control to -20 meters per second or so and have a few chutes for safety, but the wing body should bring it all down pretty easily on a glide. If you are gentle, you won\u0027t even see reheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next step is to try to figure out how to take the whole thing into orbit, thus removing the need for an additional stage :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, FWIW.
