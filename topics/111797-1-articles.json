Today I want to start a thread on this, because I seriously need motivation to continue my pursuits without any blocks. I want to avoid the mistakes I committed previous summers and make this one a very productive one. I am most comfortable with this forum than with any other community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring school, obviously I have no time to pursue any personal endeavors. The teachers are hammering out homework (the due dates to be clumped every other week), my brother wants to play games with me in my free time, and my friends are too busy talking to their other friends. People in my class \u003Cem\u003Erespect\u003C/em\u003E me for my immense knowledge in computing, and this isn\u0027t my ego talking. As a result, my friend A tends to ask me to start on big coding project Y, even though we haven\u0027t even begun big coding project X, because friend A believes that I am capable of carrying \u0022half\u0022 the codebase (which I cannot due to poor design and experience, so it could take me about 8-12 man-hours (excluding initial research times, looking for libraries, setting up the project) to go from no code to \u0022got \u003Cem\u003Esomething \u003C/em\u003Eon the screen\u0022) before I could even say \u0022no, this is too complex for me to ever finish.\u0022 And then the next week, I push the code, and Friend A says, \u0022Hey, your code doesn\u0027t work, did you even test it? Ugh, what an ugly mess.\u0022 But I can\u0027t do much about it, because it\u0027s my first time doing anything related to project Y and I spend too much time fixing bugs that I could have avoided if I thought about the design in my head correctly in the first place. And, of course, Friend A codes 500 lines of code in one day (\u0022how\u0027d you do it so fast?\u0022) and then goes inactive because he has no free time. Right, neither do I, so why did I agree to start this project in the first place if we both know it\u0027s not going to get finished?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\u0027s June, and summer is coming. Yay, no homework. \u003Cem\u003EBut\u003C/em\u003E with strings attached! First, I have to continue a four-year summer program that basically works like school and spans for two-thirds of the summer (but Fridays are free). It keeps me busy, but it also puts load on me so I can\u0027t really pursue coding for anything longer than half an hour in one sitting before getting called to do something or getting distracted looking at something in the forums. Second... oh right, the projects that I started last summer and the projects that I \u0022started\u0022 on during the school year that I vowed to work on when I have the time! Two of them I have made substantial progress (over 1-2 years\u0027 worth of time), and the others are just sitting there. I\u0027ve heard some popular coders have a massive graveyard of unstarted/unfinished projects, but I don\u0027t want to be like them with their tiny success-to-failure rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy daily schedule is totally fragmented: there\u0027s tiny bits of free time all over the place but that I can\u0027t use due to set-up times (turn on computer, remember what I was working on, etc). A lot of that time I end up either (1) wasting on looking at forums, or (2) daydreaming to figure out what I\u0027m going to do the next time I get a good hunk of free time. \u003Cem\u003EI need help defragmenting it.\u003C/em\u003E It\u0027s what turns a perfectly good afternoon into a completely worthless one very quickly and wastes on motivation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for motivation, I have another problem: \u003Cem\u003Ewhy do I code so slowly?\u003C/em\u003E When other coders do livestreaming, in half an hour they can get something pretty good going, no hitches, few design issues, and very few random bugs. They also don\u0027t have to fiddle with libraries when some error comes up. As I said, it takes me a frustratingly large amount of time to get anything going, so it is easy to abandon what I\u0027ve started out of frustration. So I code quickly, but my code fails quickly because I don\u0027t design or diagram anything (every time I try to diagram, there are just arrows going all over the place with no particular meaning), while my friends are completely backward: they could talk about how they want their game to be like for \u003Cem\u003Edays \u003C/em\u003Eon end, but not a single line of code would be written. I\u0027m trying to be the no-nonsense guy, while they\u0027re trying to be the dreamers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can comfortably do \u0022hello world\u0022 and do algorithms, but how exactly does one go from boring things like parsing files to small games? I want to make a small game, but the contests that are held in my area end up being things very similar to UIL CS hands-on, which I\u0027m quite tired of. Especially when they make us do it in Java. Java is comfortable for me, but it\u0027s awfully redundant and nothing fit for file parsing and algorithms. (One time, the contest host pulled out his solutions in Scala when he was going over each question, since apparently it was a more efficient language for the given problems. He did not seem to even bother making any sample Java solutions.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have similar free time/productivity issues?

The main difference there is not being able to do it or not being able to do it, but mostly the speed at which you are able to do it and the elegance of the resulting code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a horrible programmer at best, but I recognize the steps you have to follow in my own area of expertise.
