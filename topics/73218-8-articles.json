The tar used for roads is basically a low-value waste from oil refining and other stuff mixed in (used tires...). In other words, this stuff is cheap and easy to lay. You just heat it up and pour it. \u003Cp\u003EIt also tends to be slightly flexible so it can withstand temperature variations, granulous enough to evacuate water, and sticky enough to provide good adherence.
