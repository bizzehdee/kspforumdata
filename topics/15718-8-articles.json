It was never my intent to be a rebel and develop parts with unique diameters but KSP is a little confusing when it comes to dimensions. The whole KSP universe is scaled by 125%... or was it 80%... or... whatever. So a 1m diameter part isn\u0027t exactly 1m in game. Plenty of people figured it all out and I can too but I was too lazy to care back in the day (I started Anvil a year ago). My assumption was that my parts were not meant to be mixed and matched.

The First Light will be capable of delivering that crew and a mission payload to any planet in the system with an on-board capacity of 8000 m/s Delta-V (subject to change).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have shown textured pictures but my problems prevented me from finishing the last two so I just left them all plain for now. The only things missing at this point are those last few textures and a working docking mechanism. Everything else is ready for full scale testing. The large craft set off to the side is the resupply ship which is meant to deliver crew and supplies for a full mission. It turned out a little bigger than I imagined it so that may get redesigned later. Also, my supply section turned out a little smaller so that too will need some work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe First Light modules are based on a 5m diameter payload capability which is why I developed a 5m standard for the Anvil IV. There are 5 separate modules (Command, Habitation, Docking Hub, Supply, Engines) which will require 4 different configurations of Anvil IV to launch. In an effort to keep the numbers reasonable I needed to keep the ship as light as possible. Despite that when fully fueled and mission capable the First Light weighs a whopping 173 tonnes; 100 of which is just fuel. The three engines produce approximately 1500kN of thrust which is sufficient to accelerate the First Light to transit speeds in under 5 minutes. I did that intentionally to limit the amount of time you had to sit there and manage the burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines have an Isp rating of 950s which is well in science fiction territory for a chemical rocket but if I had kept it realistic (~350s) the fuel requirements would have been staggering requiring three refueling trips, at least, by the supply ship. I found that unreasonable so the compromise was made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did investigate alternative, realistic, propulsion methods and I strongly considered a VASIMIR type system. It\u0027s got more than enough Isp to do the job but, like all electric engines, produces very little thrust. I don\u0027t want to make people sit there for several hours while such a system nudges the spacecraft to the desired velocity. Maybe I can revisit that when a smart auto-pilot system is developed for KSP but not before. I could of scaled the system up to meet my needs but the power requirements were comical. I needed to find a way of producing ~60MW for a sustained 5 minute burn. That requires a large nuclear reactor or some scary large batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo considering all that I went with a more believable chemical rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"betaking","CreatedById":58281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T19:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Absolution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you might be interested in the looking at some commercial crew vehicles for inspiration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esuch as Blue Origin\u0027s design for a re-entry vehicle, a lifting body (but very conical). or Boeings CTS-100\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esomething like it could be made to fit with the sort of design-style of the CORE rockets..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that it would be interesting to see inflatable components.. where like you have the pannel texture split down each row of panels as the station inflates, possibly having windows and other hard-points on said panels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I\u0027m just spouting ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-13T20:19:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2013 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by betaking\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Absolution","CreatedById":4156,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T22:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime for an update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve limited my time for the last week to rest and research and what I\u0027ve come up with isn\u0027t encouraging.
