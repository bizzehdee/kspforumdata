I\u0027ve used it in KSP versions 1.2.2 and 1.3.0.  I\u0027d say it works fine in 1.3.1 as well, especially now that GPP is now updated for 1.3.1.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-11T20:31:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2017 08:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by MaxxQ**"}]}
