I think the entry velocity vector thing in the first picture is wrong as it should only have the black vector (amirite? Someone confirm, please) because the instant you enter Jupiter\u0027s SOI, it has not yet changed your velocity at all. But you get the point. Vectors. Simply put, the gravity assist is the sum of your exit velocity vector and the planet\u0027s orbital velocity vector.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
