I would love to try it\n\nedit: please fill this thread up, your recommendations would be very much appreciated\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T04:54:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 04:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by noobsrtoast**"},{"CreatedByName":"godarklight","CreatedById":92588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T05:01:08Z","Content":"Because lots of mods are kind of a pain to track down and install, you can always use [CKAN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager) to install things for you, it makes modded installs slightly easier.\n\nAlso, I believe [DMP](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79111) is your only option for multiplayer, although I definitely wouldn\u0027t call it \u0022stable\u0022 or bug free by any means. Give it a try - if it works well enough for you then good, otherwise send me some bug reports ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"0jam3290","CreatedById":37975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T05:13:47Z","Content":"Well, for realism the obvious one would be Realism Overhaul, but there\u0027s also FAR, Remote Tech, Deadly Reentry, TAC Life Support, Real Fuels, and Kerbal Construction Time. For rocket parts there\u0027s AIES, Tantares, FASA, Near Future (more for advanced engines/power generation), KSO shuttle, US Probes Pack, and a bunch of other recreation parts packs. As for resources, the main mod now is Karbonite, but Kethane is still around. There are also mods such as KAS/KIS and MKS/OKS colonization that allow you to do more on the surface/EVA. And finally, there are also beautification mods such as EVE and Better Atmospheres that add such things as clouds and city lights. But all you need to do to find new mods is to just check the released add-ons section, they\u0027re all there."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T05:30:16Z","Content":"Moved to Add-on Affairs."},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T05:35:00Z","Content":"Well, since your question is so broad in range, I suggest a good place to do some digging, instead of waiting for, and wading thru the ton of responses you may get here, would be to check this thread out:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401-Community-Mods-and-Plugins-Library)"},{"CreatedByName":"eurybaric","CreatedById":33541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T06:33:00Z","Content":"go to [Kerbal Stuff](kerbalstuff.com) and check out the featured mods category.. and the whole site anyway.
