(And where would all that angular momentum go? At the very least, the rest of the Earth would have to \u003Cem\u003Espeed up\u003C/em\u003E.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The Earth\u0027s outer core weighs in at 1.8 \u003Cem\u003Esextillion\u003C/em\u003E metric tons. You\u0027d have to throw one \u003Cem\u003Ehell\u003C/em\u003E of a monkey wrench into the path of \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E spinning freight train to brake it from one-rotation-every-24-hours to a dead stop. Not to mention we haven\u0027t developed a single nuclear warhead powerful enough to even break 6.0 on the Moment Magnitude scale. Krakatoa laughs at our most powerful nuke. So how can you expect a nuke to even give so much as a nudge to all that molten iron?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. On the subject of the core\u0027s weight (and thus, density), at some point they get the surprise that the core is supposedly of a different density than they \u003Cem\u003Ethought\u003C/em\u003E (emphasis added) it had. The movie handwaves it with a variant of \u0022hey, nobody has ever been down there to \u003Cem\u003Emeasure\u003C/em\u003E the core\u0027s density\u0022 (again, emphasis added). Never mind that said density \u003Cem\u003Ehas\u003C/em\u003E been accurately \u003Cem\u003Emeasured\u003C/em\u003E by how it affects the propagation seismic waves (from earthquakes of known origin), a measurement that has been verified by how it\u0027s used to accurately calculate back the position of new quakes by their seismic waves\u0027 propagation through the core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. The \u003Cem\u003EVirgil\u003C/em\u003E encounters an underground equivalent of an asteroid belt composed of gigantic diamonds. Diamonds cannot form as deep at the ship\u0027s level, since carbon could not possibly crystallize in those kinds of temperatures; the crystals would be constantly breaking down before they could fully form. Plus, carbon is far too light to remain below the mantle for very long; it would be like popping a balloon at ground level and expecting the helium to remain where it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. When the \u003Cem\u003EVirgil\u003C/em\u003E descends through the Earth\u0027s crust and into the mantle (and, later, when it has to travel upward through the mantle to escape), the mantle shown is clearly supposed to be a liquid, thereby not requiring the use of their drilling laser. In real life, the lower and middle mantles are semi-liquid goop that flow like pitch (at best), and the upper mantle is most decidedly solid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. A cavernous gas-filled geode, surrounded by 800,000 pounds per square inch of pressure at several thousand degrees, would never be able to form in the first place, much less endure for the years or millennia before the \u003Cem\u003EVirgil\u003C/em\u003E encountered it. This one gets some babbling in the movie, with two of the scientists discussing how it should be impossible. It eventually gets a justification that boils down to \u0022look, it must be possible, as it\u0027s right here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. When the impeller is jammed by a fallen amethyst crystal and the geode starts leaking magma from above, the team keep right on cutting through the crystal at the cost of one member\u0027s life, even as the pooled magma gets closer and closer. But amethyst \u003Cem\u003Emelts\u003C/em\u003E at the kind of temperatures which liquefy magma; it\u0027s only compression that keeps such crystals intact, and the geode\u0027s open interior should give heated minerals enough space to deform freely. By all rights, the crew should have just gone back inside and waited for the magma (which their vessel is \u003Cem\u003Edesigned\u003C/em\u003E to withstand) to engulf the \u003Cem\u003EVirgil\u003C/em\u003E and melt the thing loose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. The geomagnetic field protects the surface of the Earth from charged particles (like the solar wind and cosmic rays), but it has no effect on electromagnetic radiation such as microwaves. If the Earth was hit by an evil microwave death ray from the sun, like the one shown in the movie, we\u0027d be fried whether the Earth\u0027s magnetic field was there or not. (And if space really was filled with that much microwave radiation, every one of our satellites would be fried instantly.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. When the \u003Cem\u003EVirgil\u003C/em\u003E begins its journey toward the core, it begins at the Marianas Trench, which rends itself apart to form a whirlpool that sucks the ship downward. The problem: the Marianas Trench is on a \u003Cstrong\u003Econvergent\u003C/strong\u003E plate boundary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10. The 5 bombs in the movie have a yield of 200 megatons each. No real life nuclear weapon larger than 50 megatons (The Tsar Bomba) has ever been detonated, and no weapon larger than a \u003Cem\u003Etheoretical\u003C/em\u003E 100 megatons has ever even been built. Even using the most compact bang-for-your-buck nuclear weapons technology available, a single 200 megaton device would be larger than a whole \u003Cem\u003Ecompartment\u003C/em\u003E on the \u003Cem\u003EVirgil\u003C/em\u003E (Which about the size of large freight train).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11. Our hero has to boost the warhead yield of the last bomb (the 5th bomb) by 30%. How does he do this? By taking 6 pounds of plutonium from the \u003Cem\u003EVirgil\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s nuclear reactor and \u003Cem\u003Eplacing it next to the bomb\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s doubtful the writers were aware that multimegaton nuclear devices use the nuclear \u003Cem\u003Efusion\u003C/em\u003E of heavy-hydrogen isotopes as their primary energy source, and only use the nuclear fission of plutonium-239 (which has to be weapons grade, not reactor grade) to set the fusion reaction off. Now, fission-fusion-fission bombs \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E employ a uranium-238 tamper around the outside, which absorbs the neutrons generated by the fusion reaction and undergoes spontaneous fission. This doubles or even quadruples the warhead yield. At the 200 megaton level, it\u0027s likely that all the bombs \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E to be fission-fusion-fission devices. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever\u003C/strong\u003E, the uranium tamper must \u003Cem\u003Esurround\u003C/em\u003E the fusion core to do this. Having a chunk of uranium (or plutonium) sitting off to one side would only create some atomized uranium (or plutonium) shrapnel. In other words, placing anything \u0022nuclear\u0022 or \u0022radioactive\u0022 near the exploding nuclear bomb won\u0027t improve the bomb\u0027s yield, and a reactor-grade plutonium is not the same with the one with weapon-grade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n12. Sound waves do \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E change frequency when they pass from one medium to the next. (They do change wavelength, though, since the speed of propagation always equals the frequency times the wavelength.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n13. The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in particular, takes a mighty shellackin\u0027 in this movie. Even if unobtainium were a perfect insulator, so that no external heat could get in \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E, the interior of the \u003Cem\u003EVirgil\u003C/em\u003E would still generate an enormous amount of its own waste heat from human bodies, life support systems, electronics, the motors running the impellers, and so on. Just look at how hot the nuclear reactor\u0027s core was. The only \u0022heat sink\u0022 they brought along was some liquid nitrogen. Even if half the entire payload mass was liquid nitrogen, it would certainly have absorbed all the heat it could within the first \u003Cem\u003Ehour\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n14. Likewise, generating electric energy simply because it\u0027s hot outside won\u0027t work. You can only generate power if there\u0027s a temperature \u003Cem\u003Edifference\u003C/em\u003E, and heat is allowed to flow \u003Cem\u003Ealong\u003C/em\u003E that temperature difference \u2014 unobtainium or no unobtainium. Any theoretically-possible scheme for using the hull to generate impeller power would have fried the contents within seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n15. Not only does the Space Shuttle not rely exclusively on a magnetic compass for navigation, a magnetic compass isn\u0027t even part of its navigation package. Earth\u0027s normal geomagnetic field changes not only with latitude and longitude, but also with altitude; and at the altitude for Low Earth Orbit, it\u0027s very different than it is down here on the surface. The shuttle determines its location partly by data fed to it from the ground \u2014 which also doesn\u0027t rely on magnetic compasses \u2014 and partly by extrapolating this data via its very limited onboard computers. (And nowadays, one would suppose, from GPS.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16. The sun does not emit evil microwave death rays that can boil San Francisco Bay and melt the Golden Gate Bridge. (And if it did, a magnetic field wouldn\u0027t stop them.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in the side of plot, some of them just doesn\u0027t care at all about anything \u0022scientific\u0022 part in \u0022Sci-Fi\u0022. The 2014 film \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAsteroid vs Earth\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E hinges on stupidity that may not even be quantifiable. Faced with an Earth destroying asteroid 1/4th the size and weight of the moon, one of the characters correctly informs the military that firing nukes at it won\u0027t work. He soon loses these \u0022did his homework\u0022 points by raising another plan, that requires that nukes be set off in and around the Ring of Fire in the Pacific. By doing so, he hopes to create a magnitude \u003Cem\u003E18\u003C/em\u003E earthquake that will move the planet out of the way of the asteroid. That would be 18 on the Richter Scale. For reference: every step up on the scale releases 31 times more energy. A little math shows that an earthquake of magnitude 18 would release a force equivalent to 12 \u003Cstrong\u003Ezettatons\u003C/strong\u003E (zettaton = 10 ^ 21 tons) of TNT. The crater from the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs only released 100 teratons (teraton = 10 ^ 12 tons). At this point, the plot is a non issue: no matter what is done, everybody on Earth is going to die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally though, I do love sci-fi movies, even if some scientific accuracy had to be ignored for the sake of the plot. What I don\u0027t like is when the movie treats it\u0027s own \u0022science\u0022 as if it was a real scientific fact.

By that standard, Jules Verne should have written about steam engines, smog and abject poverty, with no airplanes or water purification. And there were many people at that time who would prove to you with elaborate theories and justification why a good living standard for most people is impossible, how the internal combustion engine is impossible, how heavier than air flight is impossible etc. Yes, things like wormholes are speculative, but you are wrong to make claims like \u0022nothing can go through them\u0022. First, as of now, they are theoretical, second, metrics that would allow for wormhole travel are allowed by theory:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole#Traversable_wormholes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole#Traversable_wormholes\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0.

You\u0027re the type of people who\u0027d drone on endlessly how the internal combustion engine is a stupid idea and how people could never travel in vehicles whose engines are effectively in a constant state of explosion in the 19th century. It is science FICTION, not a crystal ball, it includes speculative science else it\u0027s not science fiction. It may or may not turn out to work, or it may work in a different way (for example Baxter\u0027s Manifold series had foldable portable computers by 2010, we didn\u0027t get foldable ones yet, but the average smartphone has more power than your average laptop from 2009). Of course, some things are just plainly done, but normal people are not going obsessive over them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think some people just enjoy to be \u0022that guy\u0022 and instead of using their supposed brainpower to actually improve science they go to online boards to explain why x isn\u0027t possible, even if they turn out to be wrong later. It isn\u0027t a new phenomena, after all, The Times called airplane research a waste of time and stated rockets cannot fly in a vacuum.

I would put many ridiculous disaster movies into \u0022the science is too bad\u0022\u00A0category as well. But overall, if I\u0027m watching a soft scifi series, I honestly don\u0027t care about the \u0022scientific accuracy\u0022. What mildly irritates me in some space opera is Star Trek style technobabble, for example the endless contradictory statements about Warp Drive - Farscape just says the ships go FTL using \u0022hetch
