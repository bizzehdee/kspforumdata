I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E installed, and the fuel cells show that they require Liquid Hydrogen, Liquid Oxygen, LiquidFuel, and Oxidizer.

But there is a slow rate of conversion (and I\u0027m currently searching for it\u0027s origin, might be realheat) between LH2 to H2 and LOX to OX if you have both tanks and the not-liquid one was drained. Actually this transfer happens at a very low rate and I think this is now only practicle for emergency power source rather than long duration electric supply from fuel cells....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
