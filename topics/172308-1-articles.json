They reject my credit card (which is the one I buy with steam), and I have tried it for paypal (which is the one I bought the game with 2 years ago) and I do not miss payment error either. I want the expansion as I have to do? Call NASA?\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
