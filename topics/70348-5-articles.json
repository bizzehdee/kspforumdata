There is considerable evidence that new kinds of rockets often fail catastrophically. As long as there is no significant evidence on the reliability of refurbished rockets, it\u0027s best to assume that they are less reliable than new rockets of the same kind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T02:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maccollo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maccollo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you know THAT?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause, debris is flying at faster velocities with even more force in almost all directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022R0cketC0der\u0022 data-cite=\u0022R0cketC0der\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think 10 milliseconds is the time the escape tower fires, it\u0027s the time it need to react to an emergency.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if that emergency happens before it reacts?

They are slower and less powerful when not induced by a RSO. If a consequence of break up of the rocket, it takes seconds to ignite all the fuel in the tanks. Most debris follows a narrow cone along the speed vector of the rocket. So LAS has to get the pod away and to the side from the rocket. There is always going to be a chance that the a stray fragment or a SRB out of control will hit the pod, but based on the descriptions and videos of Orion LES, I\u0027d say it raises the chances of crew survival, in the event of a launch failure significantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, debris that hit the crew pod, have to damage it as well, and red hot aluminium is not well known for its armor piercing properties and damage potential.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
