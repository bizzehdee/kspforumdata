Would it be possible to have a toggle to disable landing gear deployment during auto-land? I\u0027ve been bringing some pretty convoluted payloads down to my Mun base recently, often encased in shipping rigs, and when all the landing legs deploy at once things get...

Built a compact multi-part payload that has some landing legs in the middle of the stack that should remain stowed. MechJeb deploys *all* the landing legs, though, which causes premature explosion. A simple checkbox to disable landing gear auto-deploy would be more than sufficient. I can assign the ones needed for landing to a group and trigger them manually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere does not, unfortunately, appear to be a way to change which parts are associated with the default landing gear action group, or at least it doesn\u0027t work. There is a \u0022gear\u0022 group, but removing the unwanted legs from it doesn\u0027t stop them from deploying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, add my vote to yours, along with a pretty-please to the developer and a heaping amount of thanks for the amazing MechJeb mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
