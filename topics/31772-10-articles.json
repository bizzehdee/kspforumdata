Each regions were now controlled by different leaders, and, as wars raged on, life became worse. Lives were lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe war was not over until the leaders negotiated and compromised on a government controlled by military leaders. The compromise was passed, however being a confederacy, the government was inept in stabilizing the countries. Soon another civil war broke out, this time the people rose up against the rebels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Americans were wary of war, but they are debating as war continued. Naturally, the Americans sided with the revolutionaries. (Read the American Revolutionary War and you\u0027ll see why.) Americans began to provide materiel for the democratic rebels (rebels favoring democracy). That caused the terrorist group (which was thought to have been decimated during a sweep done by the former government of Kerbonisia) to sided with the regimes, but it didn\u0027t help them a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually the country falls into the hands of the Rebels, and Kerbollo (leading the democratic rebels) took over as the leader, announcing the creation of the Kethane Nation and set it toward democratic paths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E==================================================================================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is approximate, but it is not completely true.
