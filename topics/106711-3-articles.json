Get the basic hang of the aerodynamics before trying the super hard stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, I\u0027ve found a new love for the RAPIER engines. Used to hate \u0027em because a proper Turbo-Nuke SSTO was so much more efficient, but with the changes to the Nukes and the properly balanced jet engines, Turbo-Nuke is not the viable option. Turbo-RAPIER is what I\u0027ve been using, and dumping the excess weight (the turbojets and 50% of the wing surface, only needed in lower atmosphere flight, along with ditching my landing gear, because I\u0027ll land under parachutes) and finding that, with a little refinement, I could have a viable Turbo-RAPIER SSTO. Sure, it\u0027ll get you only to LKO, but that\u0027s more than enough to send crew to a nearby station, carry up a can or two of spare fuel, drain whatever\u0027s left from the SSTO onto the refueling station, and use RCS to deorbit the whole mess and send the probe-piloted thing back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all, that is what I used to do, just with different engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion: Try to make a non-SSTO spaceplane first, then once you\u0027ve figured out what the atmosphere is like, figured your ascent profile, and figured out your required Delta-V, then make your SSTO. Making SSTO attempts and then flinging them at an unknown atmosphere is like leaping off of a diving board without making sure the pool you\u0027re diving into even has water in it. After all, I\u0027m fairly sure in the early days of KSP, people didn\u0027t magically know \u0022Oh, yeah, this combination of parts will make an SSTO.\u0022 No, they probably had days, weeks, or months of trial and error to figure out how to put the perfect combination of parts together to make even the cheaty air-hoggers. With no Infiniglide and no Airhog, a revised and improved aerodynamic model, and more realistic jet engines, we\u0027re having to learn SSTO from scratch. And that\u0027s, in my mind, a perfectly good thing. We\u0027re not just following the old formulas of \u00223 jet engines, 2 nukes, cover the ship in air intakes and wrap it in a shell made of wing pieces, fly to 58,000 meters, shut the outer jets down, ride the throttle until 70km causes the jets to die, fire rockets, and you\u0027re in orbit.\u0022 We\u0027re having to write the new formula, find out the new ascent path that works best, find out where the jets are no longer useful, where we need to fire off a rocket, and picking the right rocket for the job. We\u0027re finding out what the new aerodynamics and the new atmospheric heating is capable of. We\u0027re finding out what the changes are, and we will eventually, as a community, figure out how to SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just needs some time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe plane I got into 100k orbit in 1.0.0 with 800 m/s remaining, with a new flight profile and a bit of oxidiser level tweaking now gets there with 550m/s left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow hopefully this won\u0027t happen all over again for 1.0.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.sarahlizzy.com/KSP_102_PhoenixMk3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_102_PhoenixMk3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ion Man","CreatedById":138259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:35:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Radam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Radam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIon man, that plane is big.

Im not saying it is impossible to actually SSTO, heck i have a working craft right now, but it feels that 1.0 has truly killed any viability in SSTOs, with the new drag increases. I know that its most likely more realistic, but common, i think even FAR is easier to work with now.\u003Cp\u003ENow im not questioning whether its realistic or not, thats a discussion for another thread, but is it actually more fun this way? SSTOs were already exponentially harder to make once 1.0 hit, and now it just doesnt feel enjoyable anymore to try to engineer something that just lags, flies liek a pig, and barely manages to bring any useful payload when i can make a basic rocket in 3 minutes and have whatever payload i wanted to get in jool orbit much faster then before. Now to get to anywhere you need insane part counts and weight, and things like laythe roundtrips are as good as dead, despite managing to pull it off under 1.0\u0027s drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm still going to enjoy this game, but it seems that SSTOs have been excessively hard hit by the recent updates, to the point of loosing almost all practicality over rockets. Or at least thats my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, does anyone think its even remotely possible (without using exploits and bugs) to get to laythe and back without any refueling or IRSU useage? I used to make many SSTOs with an excess of 5K dV, now it seems that there is no way to make a long range SSTO, as small sized craft dont have the fuel to burn to orbit, and larger craft arent really my thing. Is it even possible to get a SSTO thats under 10t to the mun and back, as thats what im trying to pull off, but it doesnt look very promising?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not normally a stock player but I can say that even in 1.01 and 1.0.2 I can still build a SSTO space plane. It took me two tries to figure out the difference from .90 to 1.0 but no more than 15min of trials and I had one working. I imagine a rocket tail sitter SSTO would be easier than a space plane design but hey that is probably true in real life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have said, just have to fly differently, now you cant get away with intake spam to get you to space with the uber-efficient jet engines that were so far from reality it wasn\u0027t even cartoonishly funny. Now the jets are less efficient, they are far more altitude dependent and they can no longer launch you into space on intake spam and jets alone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo try different things I know I did and was surprised at how well they still worked, and I am a dedicated FAR user, for me to say that it was fun to try the NuStock aero says something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first I struggled with a 1.0.X rebuild of my favourite 0.90 SSTO plane (NEAR).

In 0.90, the aerodynamics rewarded giant 500\u002B ships that looked truly unique since the body was constructed out of wing parts giving the craft a lego-like level of customisation.
