Basically, the closer you are to Mach effect territory, the more air you will have for your engines and the higher their thrust will get (the effect is quite dramatic, actually). If you go too slow, they won\u0027t give you enough oomph, so pull down AoA again until you get mach effects and a decent acceleration, then go up basically as fast as you can. But, once you get close to the thermal barrier (about 1km/s at 20kms, less if lower) you have to pull up to go higher, faster and thus avoid burning up.\n\nNow SST-Interplanetary... that\u0027s another matter and I don\u0027t know (yet).

I\u0027ve been cutting my teeth with 3STO and 2STO spaceplanes, learning the new aero while planning my proper SSTO. Why? Because then I\u0027m not throwing plane after plane in the air and wondering why I can\u0027t make the most difficult method of space travel work.\n\nThis is the same method I used in the soup-o-sphere when first learning KSP, it\u0027s the same methods I used in my early dealings with FAR. Get the basic hang of the aerodynamics before trying the super hard stuff.\n\nPlus, I\u0027ve found a new love for the RAPIER engines. Used to hate \u0027em because a proper Turbo-Nuke SSTO was so much more efficient, but with the changes to the Nukes and the properly balanced jet engines, Turbo-Nuke is not the viable option. Turbo-RAPIER is what I\u0027ve been using, and dumping the excess weight (the turbojets and 50% of the wing surface, only needed in lower atmosphere flight, along with ditching my landing gear, because I\u0027ll land under parachutes) and finding that, with a little refinement, I could have a viable Turbo-RAPIER SSTO. Sure, it\u0027ll get you only to LKO, but that\u0027s more than enough to send crew to a nearby station, carry up a can or two of spare fuel, drain whatever\u0027s left from the SSTO onto the refueling station, and use RCS to deorbit the whole mess and send the probe-piloted thing back home.\n\nAfter all, that is what I used to do, just with different engines.\n\nMy suggestion: Try to make a non-SSTO spaceplane first, then once you\u0027ve figured out what the atmosphere is like, figured your ascent profile, and figured out your required Delta-V, then make your SSTO. Making SSTO attempts and then flinging them at an unknown atmosphere is like leaping off of a diving board without making sure the pool you\u0027re diving into even has water in it. After all, I\u0027m fairly sure in the early days of KSP, people didn\u0027t magically know \u0022Oh, yeah, this combination of parts will make an SSTO.\u0022 No, they probably had days, weeks, or months of trial and error to figure out how to put the perfect combination of parts together to make even the cheaty air-hoggers. With no Infiniglide and no Airhog, a revised and improved aerodynamic model, and more realistic jet engines, we\u0027re having to learn SSTO from scratch. And that\u0027s, in my mind, a perfectly good thing. We\u0027re not just following the old formulas of \u00223 jet engines, 2 nukes, cover the ship in air intakes and wrap it in a shell made of wing pieces, fly to 58,000 meters, shut the outer jets down, ride the throttle until 70km causes the jets to die, fire rockets, and you\u0027re in orbit.\u0022 We\u0027re having to write the new formula, find out the new ascent path that works best, find out where the jets are no longer useful, where we need to fire off a rocket, and picking the right rocket for the job. We\u0027re finding out what the new aerodynamics and the new atmospheric heating is capable of. We\u0027re finding out what the changes are, and we will eventually, as a community, figure out how to SSTO.\n\nIt just needs some time."},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:27:01Z","Content":"The plane I got into 100k orbit in 1.0.0 with 800 m/s remaining, with a new flight profile and a bit of oxidiser level tweaking now gets there with 550m/s left.\n\nNow hopefully this won\u0027t happen all over again for 1.0.3\n\n![KSP_102_PhoenixMk3.png](http://www.sarahlizzy.com/KSP_102_PhoenixMk3.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Ion Man","CreatedById":138259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:35:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ion man, that plane is big.

SSTOs were already exponentially harder to make once 1.0 hit, and now it just doesnt feel enjoyable anymore to try to engineer something that just lags, flies liek a pig, and barely manages to bring any useful payload when i can make a basic rocket in 3 minutes and have whatever payload i wanted to get in jool orbit much faster then before.

It took me two tries to figure out the difference from .90 to 1.0 but no more than 15min of trials and I had one working. I imagine a rocket tail sitter SSTO would be easier than a space plane design but hey that is probably true in real life. \n\nAs others have said, just have to fly differently, now you cant get away with intake spam to get you to space with the uber-efficient jet engines that were so far from reality it wasn\u0027t even cartoonishly funny.
