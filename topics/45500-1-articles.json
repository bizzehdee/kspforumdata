The confirmation dialog seems unnecessary for \u0027debris\u0027 objects since the debris tab must be deliberately selected. After some orbital construction projects, I am looking to remove a large chunk of debris from orbit. The extra mouse clicks add up. It\u0027s a trivial point, yes, but it\u0027s a quality-of-life thing and would be a relatively simple adjustment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather not use the max debris slider, since I\u0027m only after some specific bits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeroignite","CreatedById":1377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T07:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMakes sense to me.

All deletions should require a confirmation. Always!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI often bring station pieces to orbit (or build them with orbital construction) to be picked up by a tug. These pieces most of the time do not have a control node, automatically marking them as debris.

To make Tex happy, I think the debris to be mass deleted should be listed in the confirm dialog. Speaking of space station construction, I haven\u0027t done that in a while.
