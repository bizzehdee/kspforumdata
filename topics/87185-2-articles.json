In Earth we talk about variations couple of degrees in temperature or less than a percent in gas concentrations, if we discuss about cosmic or geologic climate catastrophes. It is negligible problem compared to terraforming of Mars.

This makes it VASTLY easier to build a space elevator there, as it hugely reduces the required cable tensile strength.
