A few suggestions, though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. why don\u0027t you use another probe core (like OKTO, OKTO2, HECS or QBE) as a model to your \u0022probe container\u0022? Let me explain: aside from automatic collecting science from multiple experiments, I think it is intended to be used as detachable probe to send science home at certain (dangerous?) points of the mission. To better accomplish this, I think the probe should be as small as possible and a round probe core makes it a little harder to do (e.g. it doesn\u0027t allow to attach a parachute)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I think that some nodes are more suited to your parts... For example: I think the Science Tech node would be better suited to the Science Container Probe. The same can be said about General Construction and 2.5m Science Container.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirDargon","CreatedById":118968,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T16:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood news! I have an made a module that will collect all the science on a vessel automatically, without the need of manually clicking a button (as in, every time a new experiment is done, it\u0027s collected)! It\u0027s not yet in any of the downloads because I want to work some things out first with them, but I should have my 1st version of them out tomorrow!

Is science supposed to be locked into the part once it gets hoovered up from experiments? Like others I snagged this since I figured it\u0027d make doing science sweeps much easier - but after doing so, I found out I couldn\u0027t retrieve it from the part via right-click, and my research vehicle is a separate one from my return vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: OK, after whipping up a ModuleManager config to insert the collection script into cockpits, it seems you can nab those on EVA even if not from the science parts themselves. Maybe a better way to go about this would be to just insert the manual collection script into cockpits and then only have new parts for automatic collection, which some folks might not even want?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-17T02:58:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2014 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SorensonPA\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
