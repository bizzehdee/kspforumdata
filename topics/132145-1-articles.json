(about mach 3.6) this happens at around 18km, I level off a bit from 15km to pick up speed, and then start climbing again, and turn on the rocket engine at about ~20km, which leads to the next issue - getting up thru the atmosphere quickly. To keep max speed, when I switch on the rocket engine, I am only climbing at about 120m/s, which I feel is really slow, and I am not really sure how to go about the problem. I could gain speed lower in the atmosphere, pull up steeper, which would get me thru the atmosphere quicker, but, with low TWR I would need to ignite the rocket engine at a lower altitude to keep a high speed. So I am in a pickle, not sure where to get this last 400m/s dV...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-15T09:12:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2016 09:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ketatrypt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T09:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy do you want to spaceplane to the Mun?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ketatrypt","CreatedById":157561,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T09:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222409986\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132145\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455528958\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002224430\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temstar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Temstar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy do you want to spaceplane to the Mun?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo deliver/retrieve cargo..

It could be higher, but I often can\u0027t reach any higher on Whiplashes. It might just originates from the plane\u0027s TWR. Rapiers feel better in this regard, though I don\u0027t think it will be needed for your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ascent profile stays important in rocket mode too. If you have a high TWR at that point, it\u0027s good to pitch up to escape the remaining atmo, but it doesn\u0027t worth it if your TWR is lower than ~1. In this case, the speed you lose by raising your AoA thus accelerating slower and presenting that huge wide profile to the airflow is a lot more than you save by leaving the atmo faster. Nuke planes leave to orbit by a 10-15\u00B0 AoA. I\u0027d aim 20-25 maximum 30\u00B0 in rocket mode with your plane. I wouldn\u0027t shoot for more than 40\u00B0, even with a very high TWR plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind, you don\u0027t have to fully reach an AP of 70km on the first go. It\u0027s no problem if you only manage to get it to ~60km, but you can raise PE to ~71km (so it becomes the new AP), it won\u0027t decrease much. Than it just takes a tiny burn on the other side to circularize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T15:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222410002\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132145\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455529539\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157561\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ketatrypt\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Ketatrypt said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo deliver/retrieve cargo..
