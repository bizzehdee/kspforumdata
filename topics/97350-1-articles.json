Many professions would become extinct leading to mass unemployment. Many professions would be suddenly overwhelmed and it\u0027s not like the unemployed IT techs are going to be trained in analog banking methods or logistics. The logistics industrry would collapse on itself and food/mail/equipment/water deliveries would become much harder to plan\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Thought of a few more to add to the list... Blood donor banks, hospitals, power grid, construction industry, any cloud based company, insurance companies (imagine if all of a sudden everything had to be handled on paper and by hand), cellphone companies and infrastructure (much of the info is stored globally on servers), the intelligence industry (governments intelligence is oft communicated and stored via internet). Not to mention just the sheer cost of changing all these industried back to paper-based.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-21T18:09:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2015 06:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zuqq\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T17:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI imagine it would be akin to an extended power outage, which we \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E had fairly recently in the northeastern US.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s assuming the effect is limited to the system and the \u003Cem\u003Ecause\u003C/em\u003E of that damage is not itself a disaster.
