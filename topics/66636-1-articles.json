This has been theorized for a while, and with the recent discoveries pertaining to the Big Bang is mostly proven to be true with some estimates stating that during the moments after the Big Bang space stretched at speeds in excess of 10,000-100,000 times the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Matter inside of stretched/bent space (within reasonable amounts of stretched/bent, IE blackholes go too far!) is unaffected by this, except that it is dragged along for the ride, see gravity (sort of, it is a simplistic example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Because space stretching/bending pulls matter with it and because space can stretch/bend FTL, the matter therefor moves at FTL speed. However! The matter is only \u0022moving\u0022 within its frame of reference at however fast it was moving before the drive was activated. IE, if you were going 10 kph and you activate the drive to go 10 times light speed, your speed (theoretically) should be 10 times light speed \u002B 10 kph to an outside observer, but as far as relativity is concerned (with time dialation) you are only moving 10 kph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddendum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 times the speed of light is NOT a speed limit. To date as far as I am aware there is no known speed limit for the movement of space itself. The 10 times light speed comes from one of the recent papers by a scientist named Harold \u0022Sonny\u0022 White (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_G._White_(NASA)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_G._White_(NASA)\u003C/a\u003E) of NASA\u0027s White-Juday Micro Warp Field Interferometer Laboratory (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%E2%80%93Juday_warp-field_interferometer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%E2%80%93Juday_warp-field_interferometer\u003C/a\u003E), when he designed a revision of Alcubierre\u0027s original warp drive. Alcubierre could achieve some amoung of FTL speed, at the cost of converting Jupiter into energy, infeasable. Sonny discovered that if you change the shape of the warp field from sphereical to more oval, you get dramatic energy reductions. His paper stated that to acheive 10 times the speed of light with a ship of X kilograms (I forget how many) it would take converting 1,600 lbs (roughly) of matter into energy. That is \u0027barely\u0027 outside our capabilities now (give it 40-50 years). For some reason most news outlets interpreted this to mean that the actual speed limit is 10c, which is not true. You can make a faster engine, the 10c engine was chosen because it was a nice round number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, at the time of his first paper, he had not completed the calculations about a second idea he had (pulsing the engine on/off instead of always on), but insinuated that preliminary results indicated that adding this method of engine operation on top of his other change should result in a similar scale energy requirement drop. He later announced his calculations proved this to be correct. For some reason the news agencies never cared much about this second statement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent status of the warp-field interferometer: Results indicate a small, but non-zero effect achieved by the interferometer setup.

I was observing the live stream when Sonny gave his results last year. He showed us a graph that measured the interference patterns in the laser for the experiment, they showed a definite spike where it was expected to be, but rather than jump up and down and shout \u0022SEE! IT WORKS!\u0022 they are doing proper science and declaring that they need a more obvious result (which can only happen through greater noise cancelation, a greater signal, or greater computational power) as well as external varification. What most papers don\u0027t mention is that after they performed the experiment, their two grad/PHD interns went back to their universities and replicated the experiment attempting to find the desired result using two different methods (both different from Sonny\u0027s) and both of them had similar spikes in the data where they were expected to be. It is as a result of these three data points that NASA had granted them increased funding for the upcoming year to help them with their noise problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put a little context into the noise problem they have. Their system is so sensitive to vibration, that the moving mass of a fully laden truck on the highway several miles away from their test facility was a detectable event. The big deal last year was that they had to move their lab into a special vibration canceling lab that NASA had constructed for use in the Apollo program. This helped out, but the vibration canceling equipment is the best we could make 30-40\u002B years ago, if they got the funding to construct a new system or upgrade the existing one, then they can cancel out more \u0027noise\u0027 and be able to see their spike better. Another method is very Kerbal in nature \u0022Add moar boosters!\u0022, basically crank up the power on the capacitor they are using. Which is already operating at something like 20K volts. Either one of these methods (ideally both of them together) should result in the spike becoming more prominant and less likely to be a statistical anomaly brought on by the local area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, while the results so far have been labeled \u0027inconclusive\u0027 the more verbose answer they provided was something like \u0022The results are inconclusive pending increased test capabilities, however we can state that there is SOMETHING going on.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere in the middle of that they also proved something called a Q Thruster was a viable engine. I don\u0027t understand exactly how this thing works because honestly it is somewhat magical. Ever hear of virtual particles? Little bits of matter and antimatter that pop into existence on super tiny scales, both heading towards a collision. An instant before collision they wink out of existence. These have been proven to exist and are one of the big parts of Hawking Radiation (how Black Holes dissolve). They are basically eveywhere at all times (even inside you, as I said super tiny scales here). A traditional engine works by pushing something out the back, either chemical, ion, or even just shining a really bright light. The Q thruster operates by \u0027pushing\u0027 off of virtual particles similar to how a submarine propellor pushes off of water. Just as the submarine is not throwing anything off of the boat to move, a ship with a Q thruster does not actually expend any mass to move, it is an entirely electrical system with nothing leaving the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T22:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could solve the forward facing gamma ray burst problem by \u0022exiting\u0022 warp towards a star or a gas giant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T23:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI may be thinking about this the wrong way. You don\u0027t actually go faster than the speed of light. This is because by compressing space you are shortening the distance that you will have to travel and not increasing your speed. It will only appear to the outside observer that you have travelled faster than light because the distance will appear the same to them. For example, you want to drive a 60 miles to your friends house, but want to do it in 30 minutes without breaking the 60 mph speedlimit. If you take a shortcut that is 30 miles long, then you will get there in 30 mins and it will appear to your friend that you drove 120mph on the way over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: \u0022Also, this method of travel does not actually involve moving faster than light in a local sense, since a light beam within the bubble would still always move faster than the ship; it is only \u0022faster than light\u0022 in the sense that, thanks to the contraction of the space in front of it, the ship could reach its destination faster than a light beam restricted to travelling outside the warp bubble.
