I sent a ship with landers out but ran too short of fuel to get in orbit of the moons to land drones, so I figured I should send some people, but with a lot more fuel. The white tanks feed to eachother, and you can jettison them when empty. All this fuel goes to power three LN-N rockets to speed up the burn time, I used two before and it worked pretty well, but with three I will need to find a way to lift it without connecting to those as the fairings break the engines apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not quite sure how I will get this heavy load into orbit, I took a fairly long break from KSP and my rocket making skills seem to have vanished :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://tinypic.com/r/2gwbcox/8\u0022 alt=\u00228\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/4md93.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224md93.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/qzj3et.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qzj3et.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/16llee8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002216llee8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i62.tinypic.com/2s9zyj7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222s9zyj7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spaceman1999","CreatedById":68861,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T23:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiple launches and docking would be a good place to start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XOIIO","CreatedById":100854,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T23:46:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, multiple launches gets a bit old though, it may be a better route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried winging it though, the first attempt at the rocket and it actually worked pretty well which was surprising, so I think I will keep trying to do it in one go.
