The mod aims to create a cluster of local stars. They all need something to orbit, an the most realistic thing would be a black hole. The way KSP works makes it that you can\u0027t change the center of the game to something other than the Sun. To deal with this, the stock Sun was made to a black hole, and a new identical Sun called Kerbol was made orbiting that black hole. The stock planets were made to orbit the new Kerbol.

Looks like the last post to the thread was January of this year and it\u0027s the end of November now.

I just want to make sure before I say goodbye to all of my current saves that things are going to work okay. The main concern I have right now besides if this mod will work with the latest updates to the game is that somebody mentioned that all of Jool\u0027s moons have been disrupted and I\u0027ll need those as I would plan to use them as my final refueling point before leaving the Kerbol system."},{"CreatedByName":"jm764","CreatedById":99762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T00:37:38Z","Content":"It seems that KG2 still works in 1.05 with the new updated version of Kopernicus, but all the stars that were added seem to render as Kerbol, including the black hole(s), when viewed up close.\n\nI\u0027ll play around with the settings and update EVE\u0027s clouds to see if those will fix/break anything.\n\nI hope there will be an \u0022official\u0022 update to this mod, if not I\u0027ll see if I can patch it for everyone."},{"CreatedByName":"DarthJeb","CreatedById":153640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T23:22:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 11/22/2015, 9:26:04, Sahadara said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [quote name=\u0027DarthJeb\u0027]Hi,I heard this mod transfigured Kerbol into a black hole which has sort of put me off as I thought the mod would be essentially an add-on.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E While I like the idea and,after a little practice,would like to contribute with a gas giant or even micro star (brown dwarf) system orbiting a larger star,I\u0027m wondering if there is a version that doesn\u0027t incorporate the black hole/kerbol change  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for any replies and good luck on the mod  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E I think you misunderstood.
