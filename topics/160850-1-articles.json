I have build a reasonable little K\u0026amp;K base, but I am trying to figure out what to do for supplies. I am most used to using the K\u0026amp;K way of making fertilizer with algae from ore, not through MKS with gypsum or minerals. Yet gilly has 0.1% ore and .4% gypsum and 1.4% minerals. I would like to know how to do the math here on how much I will receive for each to make enough fertilizer to keep it going. I am fine with making separate collection/conversion modules for each planet and I have included an algae converter just in case I have to send emergency shipments of ore, I would prefer not to though. How do you calculate the rates of drilling and generation for these products included in the community resource project? I know I can find the conversion rates of other stuff in the MKS documentation, but I do not know if the community resource pack works on the same rate as ore extraction from stock. Hell I don\u0027t even know if the drill rates of my non-stock parts factor into it (which they probably do). I am really confused as to how to approach this problem. I could just send ore resupplies, but that just seems like giving up, ya know? Is there anywhere I can find this info?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso how does scan-sat detection cutoff factor in. I have cutoff really low on gilly for some items but really high on moho. Also I have .3% ore on moho but the map shows nothing. I am very confused about how this entire situation works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-20T15:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, first off: You should mention which life support mod you\u0027re using. \u00A0From inference, I\u0027m guessing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS. \u00A0(And really, this question should therefore be asked over in that mod\u0027s thread, so you\u0027ll attract the attention of those who know about the mod.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext: CRP (Community Resource Pack) resources work just like stock resources for the extraction mechanic - as they rely entirely on stock to do the work. \u00A0(The CRP just defines the resources, and KSP does the rest.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that...
