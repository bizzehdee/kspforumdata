Move the Pe, Ap nodes along your orbit) and a retrograde burn is used to decrease Semi Major Axis (ie. Lower your orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to how to find where to optimal point is I don\u0027t know.

This is because a radial \u002B burn brings Apoapsis closer to you and a retro lowers Periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
