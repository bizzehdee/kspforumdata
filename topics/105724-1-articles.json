There\u0027s a lot of great stuff in the game that suffers from some kind of malady. Like, as cool as the new chutes are, you can currently only deploy them at 300m (too early for impatient folks like me) or at 50m (too late with the new chutes). The same cause prevents you from setting an engine to 95-99.5% thrust. Technically speaking, the tweakables have dead zones.\n\nOr tourists! I love me tourists. I\u0027d love them more if it wasn\u0027t such a headache to figure out who needs to board a particular vessel. I\u0027m actually making notes, like, on paper! In this year of our lord two thousand and fifteen, that should no longer be necessary.\n\nThe first should be quite easy to fix; the latter would require a major UI overhaul. Basically, what I\u0027m trying to get at: many things in the game are -technically- possible, but more twiddly/clumsy/difficult to do than is necessary. If Squad promised to lift these to a level of \u0022just do it\u0022, I\u0027d be quite hyped."},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:56:56Z","Content":"*The engines seems to glow all the time after ignition, even ehen fuel ran out, that\u0027s a little strange*\n\nThat isn\u0027t a bug, that\u0027s blackbody radiation from the remaining heat of the part.
