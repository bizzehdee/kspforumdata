I used to imagine them living like Hobbits, but there are no roads. I use E.V.E. with its city lights. At first I imagined the Kerbals were nocturnal and lit up their world at night, but even if their homes are underground, there are no daytime roads. So my latest theory is they are subterranean, coming out in the daytime only to launch spacecraft. All the city lights I see from above are not city lights at all. They are the naturally occurring bioluminescence of the fauna similar to the forests in Avatar. That explains why the lights disappear when a ship gets close to the ground.
