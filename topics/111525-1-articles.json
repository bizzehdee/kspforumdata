My first suggestion would be to re-install KSP, but that should not be necessary given that you just installed it, but its worth a shot none-the-less. My best guess is that KSP is missing some important file or there are extra files in the KSP install directory. That happens a lot when there is a major update to the game such as 1.0. So have steam wipe all files in the install directory, then re-install the game and see if it works. If not, see what other details you can glean and post them here"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:42:01Z","Content":"If quietghost\u0027s suggestion doesn\u0027t help, please see the support stickies and post your game logs.\n\nThe symptoms you describe sound like the graphics drivers were updated but you have not yet rebooted your PC though."},{"CreatedByName":"SkeeterKermin","CreatedById":145379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:54:09Z","Content":"I\u0027ve played previous versions and didn\u0027t have this issue.
