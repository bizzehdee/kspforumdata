My first suggestion would be to re-install KSP, but that should not be necessary given that you just installed it, but its worth a shot none-the-less. My best guess is that KSP is missing some important file or there are extra files in the KSP install directory. That happens a lot when there is a major update to the game such as 1.0. So have steam wipe all files in the install directory, then re-install the game and see if it works. If not, see what other details you can glean and post them here\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:42:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf quietghost\u0027s suggestion doesn\u0027t help, please see the support stickies and post your game logs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe symptoms you describe sound like the graphics drivers were updated but you have not yet rebooted your PC though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkeeterKermin","CreatedById":145379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played previous versions and didn\u0027t have this issue.
