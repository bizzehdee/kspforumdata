They need to be watered as well and need to be kept at steady temperature. Plus they grow slowly and we don\u0027t know how long the satellite stays in operation. They also probably need more space to grow than water based organisms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne option would be Spirulina algae. I\u0027m not entirely sure what kind of growth conditions it requires, but it\u0027s a cyanobacteria so basically it needs water, nutrients and CO2. You can do a microgrowth experiment in a very small container, probably 10 milliliters is more than enough, the experiment is very fast as they grow quickly so the satellite doesn\u0027t even need to live for that long, just a few days. I don\u0027t know how representative a microgrowth experiment is though but a normal lab microgrowth is done in the milliliter range and sometimes even less than one milliliter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpirulina is actually soon going to be sent to the ISS to study how it grows in microgravity. It\u0027s a possible solution to creating a bioreactor which would scrub CO2 from the air, use it for growth and actually in my university they\u0027ve studied a way to make food especially for astronauts from spirulina (it\u0027s actually used as a supplement already and tastes very bland). There\u0027s an ESA project called Melissa (Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative) which has been studing different species for this purpose and they\u0027ve found Spirulina to be a good candidate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA basic bioreactor is just a tube with the nutrient solution with the organism inside. Usually air is pumped through it, probably in this case air spiked with CO2 and there needs to be a way to extract the outflow of gas. With small growth chambers you could use one pump system for all experiments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the sake of science you\u0027ll need replicate experiments, preferably at least 3 to confirm anything. It\u0027s much more uesful to get one reliable result from one situation than shakier data from several situations. Of course if space and weight permits, do both gravities but start with getting one good dataset. If there\u0027s space it\u0027s easy to do for example one set of experiments in lunar gravity, spin up to martian and then do a second set of experiments. If you use for example 3 tubes @ 30 grams each, that\u0027s 90 grams for one experiment set and roughly 200 for 2 sets. Only restriction here is how much space and weight there is available. The defining factor here is also the heating mechanism. No matter what you plan to grow, it won\u0027t grow in freezing temperatures and will probably burn up in anything above 50 celsius.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T01:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a shame we lost our sticky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I have good news!

Outdoors, it seems that an increase in temperature up to 39 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C for a few hours does not harm the blue-green alga, or its photosynthetic ability. Thermophilic or thermotolerant strains of spirulina can be cultivated at temperatures between 35 and 40 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C. Such a property has the advantage of eliminating microbial mesophilic contaminants. The minimum temperature at which growth of spirulina takes place is around 15 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C during the day. At night, spirulina can tolerate relatively low temperatures.
