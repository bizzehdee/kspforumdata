Ap is just inside Kerbin\u0027s SOI, further out than Minmus (if Minmus was in a polar orbit, anyway), and Pe is about 200km so I don\u0027t have these things screaming through my populated equatorial belt in LKO. They spend most of their time hovering high up over the poles for weeks, then drop down and zip over the opposite pole before flinging themselves back out and away from the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ensures that they pretty much always have sunlight to power their systems and that their line of sight to other planets doesn\u0027t get blocked by Kerbin or the Mun. There are brief outages as they make their flybys of Kerbin, but the Zenith and Nadir Relays have their orbits synchronized so that one of them is always at Ap while one of them is at Pe. Due to their low velocities near Ap, they are both usually far, far away from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI chose this configuration over a wide, circular polar orbit because that would still leave the relays in shadow or blocked by Kerbin for significant periods of time. The high eccentricity results in more outages, but they are much shorter. And the other relay is generally always available if one of them is blocked. The polar orbit is important because it gets the satellites away from Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane and minimizes obstructions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-30T21:35:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2014 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T21:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice setup idea, I use 5 GEO sats that are all connecting to a rather big relay in a polar orbit at 25Mm (about half way between Mun and Minmus).
