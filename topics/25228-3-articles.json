Higher than that, to a first order approximation, you can maintain the same top speed at any altitude. A few effects modulate this: the Isp goes down with increasing altitude, which means you need more airflow as the air gets scarcer, which lowers your top speed -- but this is a small effect at the altitudes we\u0027re talking about: Isp is in the low 1200s no matter what, so we\u0027re talking single-digit percentages. Also, gravity goes down, which changes how well you can maintain altitude in ways that I\u0027ve never carefully calculated. And throttle goes down, which means it takes longer to burn all your fuel, and it takes longer to accelerate to your top speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause you can basically fly at whatever altitude you want, you can fly high enough to be where Jeb barely needs to hold on at all. A simple calculation shows that if your jet engine is pushing itself (ignore fuel tanks, intakes, and Jeb) at a steady 2340 m/s at full throttle, that means the engine is accelerating itself at 14 m/s^2, and drag is exactly counteracting it. Fly 5 km higher and the force Jeb feels on that ladder is equivalent to half his weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Oscar-B has awful dry mass for its size. However, even when full, it is lighter than any empty jet fuel tank. That makes it a great choice for a record-setting run.

Thrust goes from half of the engine\u0027s rating at 2 km/s down to zero at 2.4 km/s. So now we know the thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I\u0027m way off on the mass of m1xte\u0027s \u0022plane\u0022 given I ignored the hundreds of air intakes (and the cockpit and the fuel tank). The drag Jeb would feel is far lower than what I wrote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the other bit is that drag is linear in air pressure, but so is air supply, and thus throttle (and therefore thrust). So they cancel out: you can fly at any altitude at the same speed, as long as your throttle isn\u0027t maxed out. That means that if you\u0027re worried drag is too much, just fly higher -- drag will be less, and you won\u0027t lose speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStelith seems convinced this is impossible, but the lightest manned lifters off Kerbin and Eve have Kerbals on ladders all the way, even in the low atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m1xte","CreatedById":53528,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T21:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www19.zippyshare.com/v/35649641/file.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExploitter 2344.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(mechjeb removed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont mind if someone makes new record with this craft or its modification.
