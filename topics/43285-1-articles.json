During which you are orbiting and changing direction. Do you point directly retrograde, at the blue reticle, or somewhere else? For a 15 minute burn, I\u0027ll start 10 minutes out (the change in dv making Pe take longer). As it stands, I\u0027ve tried both retrograde and towards the blue node reticle and I\u0027m wasting about 40% of my fuel, which is kind of obscene, and makes me think this could totally be done better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnappingTurtle","CreatedById":69795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T22:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the planet has an atmosphere you can aerobrake.

So if I need 5km/s for a transfer, I give the ship 6km/s of delta-V. That way I can adjust the transfer once I\u0027ve left my current SOI. I\u0027ve also heard of people doing an initial burn of roughly half the delta-V, then doing another once they\u0027ve orbited and reached periapsis, which is at the original burn point, but I\u0027ve never tried it myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T23:09:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe length of any burn depends on thrust used and mass of the craft. If you want a quicker burn slap on a couple more LV-Ns, or try to design minimally. Personally I prefer just chucking engines at the transfer stage until I have sensible burns, with the efficiency of the LV-N you can afford to have a few extra.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for when, I usually burn half \u0027n half each side of PE, mainly retrograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture from one of my missions, manned vall \u002B laythe landings with one outbound trip from Kerbin, 13 LV-N in the transfer stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DSytll0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DSytll0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
