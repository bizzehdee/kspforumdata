Wait in orbit for the sites to rotate under you. Just be sure to get into a sufficiently inclined orbit, and be aware you may need to do manoeuvres.

I also play a Life Support/RT career game, with the added constraint of mandatory crew accommodation for any flight of more than a couple of days. This is what I use at the moment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qKrX3XU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qKrX3XU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFour ion engines on the back and a couple of small Rockomax for initial boosting from LKO to target, with a couple of months of life support, and it will make the minor orbital adjustments needed for these contracts until the Kows come home... It will also land on Minmus and be able to make several hops across the surface from site to site. One of these netted me almost a million funds before returning to resupply at the Mun. Also, watching this ship skimming across the surface and making sedate adjustments with those pretty blue engines is extremely relaxing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landing on Mun, I would definitely reccommend an orbital refuelling station with a nuke powered lander. I launch fuel cans with a spaceplane and haul them up from LKO with a nuke powered tug. When they\u0027re empty, I haul them back to LKO for refuelling. The lander could be something like this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LySovZN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LySovZN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would not recommend ground-based operations from a surface base with a rover, unless you have a lot of spare time to kill.
