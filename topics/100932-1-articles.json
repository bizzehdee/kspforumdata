If it\u0027s not a crew report contract, don\u0027t send a kerbal, just a probe with the instruments needed ^^\n\nGood luck ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T10:43:30Z","Content":"Having multiple satellites on polar/equatorial orbits is also an option, this way, I will pay some extra money at starting up, but later I can make that money back by quickly going through the contracts with no crew report...

I think I\u0027m looking at 25 grand for each of four line items and a further 150 for the overall completion. And I snagged a flag planting contract to do as well.\n\nMy approach has just been a standard Kerballed Mun lander, with a small TACLS supply container to support the Kerbals for a couple of Munths. Wait in orbit for the sites to rotate under you. Just be sure to get into a sufficiently inclined orbit, and be aware you may need to do manoeuvres. Quickloads help if available because you may find you pass either side of the target site on successive orbits."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T11:00:23Z","Content":"Yep, a long term polar satellite with as many instruments as you can give it is always a good call.

I also play a Life Support/RT career game, with the added constraint of mandatory crew accommodation for any flight of more than a couple of days. This is what I use at the moment:\n\n![qKrX3XU.png](http://i.imgur.com/qKrX3XU.png)\n\nFour ion engines on the back and a couple of small Rockomax for initial boosting from LKO to target, with a couple of months of life support, and it will make the minor orbital adjustments needed for these contracts until the Kows come home... It will also land on Minmus and be able to make several hops across the surface from site to site. One of these netted me almost a million funds before returning to resupply at the Mun. Also, watching this ship skimming across the surface and making sedate adjustments with those pretty blue engines is extremely relaxing.\n\nFor landing on Mun, I would definitely reccommend an orbital refuelling station with a nuke powered lander. I launch fuel cans with a spaceplane and haul them up from LKO with a nuke powered tug. When they\u0027re empty, I haul them back to LKO for refuelling. The lander could be something like this...\n\n![LySovZN.png](http://i.imgur.com/LySovZN.png)\n\nI would not recommend ground-based operations from a surface base with a rover, unless you have a lot of spare time to kill. It will take ages to get anywhere... Unless your rover is also a lander...\n\n![nSzHmEP.png](http://i.imgur.com/nSzHmEP.png)\n\nUA"}]}
