We just recently invented pcs and we already have people simulators like the sims and so on... on a quantum computer, the simulation could be much much better, graphics that look exactly like real people, true IA on the charaters, extreme open world like outerra anteworld or ksp. then we could replace the people by aliens. Of course, this would open ethical questions. if they are inteligent, wouldent killing one of them be murder? With some modding and cheats, we would be their god, even if we were just a 6 year old spoiled kid. In other words, if we are a computer simulation (sorry for all religious people) our god can be just a random alien 6 year old or a random person that made a game with persons. in other words, we arent trully people, we are just some lines of code. Of course, if we can replicate that game, wouldent our gods be people from a pc simulation also? so our true god would be the scientist that invented the first game of this kind. In other words, if that 6 year old spoiled kid so wants, we can be all ded with the touch of a button... we already to that with kerbals so its possible. All disasters, from dinossaur extinction to chernobill, and all the dead people and animals resultant from it, could be his fault or just a random game event. This game would kinda be spore, sims, sim city and civilization combined, so every battle in history was the fault of that 6 year old kid or whatever. The 2nd world war would be his fault... the massacre of millions of jews would be his fault... what kind of mad guy would be the one that made that? maybe its just a question of time until he gets bored of us and kills us all... global warming would be an event caused by us, so if he decides he didnt want to lose his save game on this planet, why not murder us all? also, after death life could be possible, cuz why not? anyway its an interesting and creepy theory.

I myself have wondered this question, and you can look at it like some astrobiologists look at life. Humans are made up of DNA, but who is to say that E.T. is \u0022alive\u0022 because of DNA. If we apply that to computers, while humans use silicon plates with gold wires to compute data, who is to say that an alien (or in this case, the creator of our universe) uses human computers to accomplish the task. They could still use computers, but they could look very... alien to us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I recall seeing a quote from a someone who was seriously looking in to the computer simulation theory, and he stated that the universe can have created no more than 10^120 bits of data, which is quite reasonable for a super computer to do AFAIK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you were to ask me about the idea, there is a lot to it. For one thing, there is an limit to how small we can see, as past this point, everything is grainy (like zooming in to far on a digital camera). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, if our creators create programs in the same way that humans do, than perhaps they have at times tried to tinker with the simulation, which from our perspective was divine intervention, and we created organized religions. Such a thing has happened within our own world, as in Vietnam, the natives viewed the Americans as gods because they game the natives wooden crates of food from airplanes, and such airplanes were so far beyond the level of technology that the natives used, that there are now effigies of airplanes to try and call the \u0022gods\u0022 back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, it would explain the big bang. While there is overwhelming evidence that it happened, we don\u0027t really know WHY it happened. What if \u0022God\u0022 really did make the big bang, but God was just a programmer (or a group thereof)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, and probably the most philosophically significant of them all, is what if the programmers ARE human. Humans strive to make better and better simulations of the universe, so what if there comes a point where humans can generate there own version of the universe (cue the above stated 10^120 bits)? This would mean that there is the possibility of infinite recursion whereby while we were made by humans, we will eventually create a computer simulation that makes humans, and our simulation will make it\u0027s own simulation? The implications of this leads to the inverse question of how many recursions in are we from the original creator?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T14:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cheebsta\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cheebsta\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn the realm of possible, this strikes me as a rather close minded theory.

Humans strive to make better and better simulations of the universe, so what if there comes a point where humans can generate there own version of the universe (cue the above stated 10^120 bits)? This would mean that there is the possibility of infinite recursion whereby while we were made by humans, we will eventually create a computer simulation that makes humans, and our simulation will make it\u0027s own simulation?
