Even more, it is something that I really wanted for KSP for some time now. There seems to be a little room for improvement left at the moment though, as discovering planets seems to be (I only had time to watch the video and read the thread so far) either clicking through funds and science on the ground or sending up a telescope and then targeting and discovering all planetary bodies in like 15 min.\n\nTo make the gameplay more interesting it would be good to have more research levels for every body (already hinted by you); most importantly one where they are not even unknown objects yet (so that you can\u0027t just simply target them) and that advancing a research level would take time (already hinted by you too!). So the research levels could be something like \u0022not known\u0022 -\u003E \u0022unknown object\u0022 -\u003E \u0022know the orbit\u0022 -\u003E \u0022know what it looks like\u0022 -\u003E \u0022know its details\u0022 and advancing a level would take some time researching it. The last two levels could even be split down to gaining higher quality images and gaining each fact individually (mass, size, ...). Telescope size would determine how far you can research a certain object (depending on the body\u0027s size and distance) so that you would either have to build a really big telescope or send a probe with a camera (would work exactly like a telescope gameplay wise, just a lot smaller and lighter\u002Bhaving to be really close) to get certain information about further out bodies (especially with stuff like outer planets mod).\n\nSo a telescope can be used to either \u0022Find new body\u0022 or to \u0022Research a body further\u0022 with both costing a monthly (daily?) rate of funds if you let the tracking station do it. With the \u0022Research a body further\u0022 it could be possible to skip the unknown object phase if you point it right. \n\nSorry for going a bit overboard with suggestions here, but I got to say that this mod really excites me with all its potential for making the research of celestial bodies more interesting!"},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T12:02:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just stumbled on this mod and got to say that it is pretty amazing.

My main concern is that at the moment it is too easy to point the telescope at a body by just going in the map view and targeting an \u0022unknown object\u0022 and then using the target on the navball.

Ideas? If this is something people want then I am happy to make the changes to TST if an API to ResearchBodies is available."},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T23:02:43Z","Content":"Hi !
