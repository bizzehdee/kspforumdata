It\u0027s just that while the pause menu was up the isActive flag was not being set. This is because the OnUpdate method was not being called. The visibility of the button is being set using isActive, which basically is set to whether there is an engineer system on the current vessel or not. As there\u0027s no need to show a KER button if there\u0027s not one attached to the vessel. So to narrow down your search, the bug in the toolbar is not with the removal of buttons, but the visibility of them. This bug should still be re-producible by switching between crafts with and without engineer, if that is the case. Hopefully this short blurb on how the system is working my end helps with your bug tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need any more info, just ask away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T13:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cybutek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cybutek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe bug in the toolbar is not with the removal of buttons, but the visibility of them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, that\u0027s what I actually meant \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust another thing: Would it be possible to not require one of the parts be attached to the vessel if the toolbar is available?

The only bug I seem to be hitting is that sometimes the delta-v calculator just stops calculating. (This is with Realism Overhaul and Modular Fuels if that helps.) It\u0027s not a game-breaker for me since I use MechJeb now for delta-v calculations -- I need that sea-level-thrust indicator when building my launch stage. I still use KER during orbital flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T00:35:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible for an implementation that can show a stage\u0027s RCS delta-v?
