I know this a bit off-topic, but how do I get back to Kerbin without turning into a meteorite ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I tried Retrograde burn at Periapsis but the lowest Periapsis I can make is 287km. I can\u0027t figure out how to offset the orbit, if I could reduce the orbit diameter by even half I might survive the re-entry. Problem is I don\u0027t have enough fuel to simply reduce it all the way to atmosphere level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZaHzHAH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZaHzHAH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T11:41:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 11:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Spaceweezle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceweezle","CreatedById":92331,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T12:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes I did it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb is now home safe recovering after a hellish ordeal which nearly claimed his life and the ships!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X3E8oB0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022X3E8oB0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood thing I had those 4 rads. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/geOFrqh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022geOFrqh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T12:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a tip from HighGuard.
