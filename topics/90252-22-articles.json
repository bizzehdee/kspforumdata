It works better than MJ2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s spaceplane guidance. But I had this happen to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had NRE start spamming my log when I docked a rover in a plane. Thinking it might be caused by one of the many other mods I use not playing well with each other or something got messed up in the KSP files. I cleaned out the gamedata folder and pulled a clean install from steam and created a new save. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m using the current CKAN version 1.11.3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a simple rover with a docking port in the sph. I launched then moved it off the runway. I went back to the space center and launch the rover again from the sph. Went over and docked the two rovers together after I opened the PA control window. The NRE will start as soon as the two vehicles dock and continue until I leave the flight scene whether I undock them or not. I can return to the docked craft and everything will be functional. (I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d rather not leave a new craft during flight until I know its controllable.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the NRE I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m getting in the log:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at PilotAssistant.FlightModules.SurfSAS.Update () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at PilotAssistant.FlightModules.AsstVesselModule.Update () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I noticed that if I have two craft in close proximity to one another that a selection button pops up in the control window.
