When you say five times lighter, you\u0027re using a multiple to define a reduction without a referenced unit which is being multiplied. If the reference object was only 100 grams lighter than a base object weighing 10 kilograms, then your multiple of five means 500 grams lighter, so 95% of the original weight. Likewise, if the reference object was 1 kilogram lighter than the base object weighing 10 Kilograms, then five times that would be 5 Kilograms lighter, and 50% of the original weight. Taken literally, your colloquialism has too few variables to find a solution. We\u0027re scientists here, accurate data is mandatory.The method I\u0027d recommend using if you have KAS is to have a mobile refinery and use shuttle craft to get into orbit. The refinery can get away with being a bit heavy because it only has to move when a deposit runs dry, so that\u0027s 1 period of losses due to gravity. The shuttle craft can just be fuel tanks with engines on them, so that would minimize the Delta-V needed to move fuel back and forth between the ground and orbit. As far as an orbital tanker goes, the solution to that is simple, have the tanker itself be the ascent stage. Instead of having tanks that jettison as it leaves Kerbal, keep them. That way when you\u0027re mining later you have somewhere to store all the fuel you refine.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptGentry\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptGentry\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey guys.
