If it shows the difference it isn\u0027t a hardlink.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHardlinking is just adding a separate entry in the MFT that says the same dataspace is used by two files. Symbolics are an actual file that have some kernel implementations. (Since a program never interacts directly with a file, but calls the OS to do so, the OS then returns the altered \u0022symbolic\u0022 path. When a program \u0022calls\u0022 the symbolic). This lets you do absurd things with symbolics (such as linking a directory on one HD to a directory on another HD; [in theory, you could do it to a CD or even removable media... but that may have weird stuff happening... I\u0027m not 100% certain of the implementation]).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, since a symbolic link IS just a file, you can make a hard link to the symbolic as well... and then symbolic the hard link XD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah.... recently I\u0027ve gotten into making crazy amounts of symbolics and hardlinks everywhere; even to the point where I\u0027m moving \u0022logs\u0022 / \u0022saves\u0022 or other space changing files out of my main HD so that it never fragments and I can even set it read-only XD.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T00:45:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot up on current unix filesystems, but the idea certainly used to be that there is literally no difference - a \u0022normal\u0022 file just has a single hard link.
