Imagine a cylinder, it\u0027s sliced up into several discs that interlock into a solid enough cylinder, on the outside of the cylinder are symmetric vertical protruding lines, same number of lines as there are discs, say 4, each disc has a rotating pivot in one of the lines, from the top/bottom the action of the part deploying would look like one circle turning into 5, one in the middle and 4 around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously the discs wouldn\u0027t be completely solid, there would have to be come curves missing to allow for internal structure of the main cylinder without blocking the pivoting action if that makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4 discs that fold out could either be docking ports or allow for mounting docking ports on a node, dock fuel tanks and engines to each circle to make an engine cluster in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nature of the mechanism would stagger each ring on the vertical axis a bit, not sure how big of an issue that would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 1.25, 2.5 and 3.75 version would make sense I think, question is how many radial circles per part? could perhaps make it only 2 and have people use several to get the number they want, I think using 3 each one turned 120 degrees to get 6 total would work nicely etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T00:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose one could avoid the bug for the moment by using KAS\u0027s undocked attach mode.
