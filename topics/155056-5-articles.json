water mode is enabled.\u00A0 Probably keep the base color of the water, but ramp up the color and/or alpha channels proportionally to bring it closer to white and make it more pronounced; possibly even adjust a few of the other parameters to make it more spray and less dust.\u00A0 I also intend to use that water mode effect for wheels in general as several will have water-propulsion enabled as soon as I can write up the code for it.\u00A0 One other bit I was thinking on was using a second particle effect for water mode like the stock spash down effects, replacing or in addition to the

wanting it to grab.\u00A0 We\u0027d also need to adjust things differently for under-water.\u00A0 For wheels, I would stay stick with the ground texture when hitting the ground under-water but, for repulsors especially, I would move the origin of the effect to just below the repulsion plate (or the back of the wheel if the user has them on the craft and still spinning) and make it a very subtle ripple of some sort if it were possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the note of wheels in water... I originally wanted to make them work like the hypnodrive in that they would produce a small amount of thrust when in the water depending on a setting in the module for the wheel that would define it\u0027s tread depth for this purpose specifically.\u00A0 If totally submerged, however, spinning the wheel would cancel out any thrust produced by said wheel unless it\u0027s configured like the hypnodrive.\u00A0 My humorous side was going to make a special Boolean field named \u0022screwed\u0022 so that the hypnodrive could override the under-water-nullification of the thrust.\u00A0 (So it would read \u0022screwed = true\u0022 and complete the really bad joke.\u00A0 Sick eh?)\u00A0 Anyway... in the end this would allow a user to, potentially, make a large paddle-boat using an insanely deep-treaded wheel positioned with its center just above the water line for maximum thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis all looks great on paper... so to speak... but making it actually happen is another thing entirely.\u00A0 My brain is full of ideas but I have a lot less drive, so to speak, to make it happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just glad this thing isn\u0027t my responsibility.\u00A0 It was cool being the lead programmer on a mod, but another thing entirely to actually put in the work for it.\u00A0 Especially when I was just getting a bit burned out on KSP.\u00A0 I\u0027m trying to find the time to get back into it but I can\u0027t ever go back to pure vanilla parts.\u00A0 The modding is going to take some time to get fully fleshed out before my first KSP post-U5 launch is possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-30T18:33:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222939155\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155056\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485794455\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002275832\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vardicd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, vardicd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022138730\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Shadowmage\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I was already recording a video to show you what the repulsors were doing before you explained that underwater they wouldn\u0027t work, but in the making of the video, I discovered something interesting right at the end. your repulsors are going to need a new warning on them.... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETHAT\u003C/em\u003E... was awesome.\u00A0 I know what\u0027s happening there too I think, depending on the current implementation of water-repulsion.\u00A0 In the old days we used an invisible plane that would be kept under the craft (within reasonable speeds anyway... I never got around to adjusting the re-positioning-rate based on craft speed).\u00A0 Under extreme circumstances the repulsor could skip under that plane and get stuck since, technically, it was really just a wheel collider that had no visual model associated with it.\u00A0 Think of it as a wheel that\u0027s reacting to a flat panel clipped just above the top of the stock collider, but below the suspension.\u00A0 The stock wheel will fight that panel a lot and often glitch out completely.\u00A0 Repulsors, however, have extremely strong suspensions and, upon reaching land and no longer needing the slider plane, they will react violently, like a spring-loaded jumper-toy, when the water-slider gets removed and the colliders are free to do their job.\u00A0 My only solution, in theory, was to make water-logged repulsors not actually function at all.\u00A0 However the repulsors in your video were not under the water so technically, if re-booted, they could be made to re-initialize the water slider and slowly re-elevate the craft properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn alternate solution could be to temporarily reduce the suspension height to zero when the water-logged situation is detected, remove the water slider completely, and then either re-initialize and slowly raise the height back to the set value by the user \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E have them remain unusable under the colliders detect the planet surface and then reinitialize the repulsor and slowly step up the height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, the kracken gets a real kick out of people trying to go from under water to land with repulsors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEdit:\u003C/em\u003E one more note... I think that a repulsor could still work under water if the craft is near the planet surface... but I don\u0027t see that being a necessity unless someone is sinking a super-heavy craft that totally overwhelms the buoyancy of its parts.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EEnd edit.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn previous versions of KSP and KF there was no stock underwater behavior.\u00A0 It was all due to camera bugs and workarounds that anyone got under water at all.\u00A0 There wasn\u0027t any stock buoyancy interaction with water either... if buoyancy was even a thing in KSP.\u00A0 I took over KF when under-water had just become a thing and did some preliminary work on it before I had to close up shop.\u00A0 I never got anywhere though really.\u00A0 I was still working on the water spray effect when that update came and, at the same time, KF started nullreffing anyone who paused the game or entered a menu during flight and I got overwhelmed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way... with the hovercraft skirt idea, you could just build the parts as if they were single inflatable air-bag like parts.\u00A0 When placed side-by-side they could, as bad as it is, clip through each-other slightly to give the illusion of simply being a bumpy skirt.\u00A0 If the parts then changed shape slightly with compression and movement, then the multiple parts would creat an interesting effect similar to how the tracks react to being on the edge of an incline with each section of the suspension reacting to the shape of the terrain independently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively you just have a set of basic shapes and make use of tweakscale integration to make them fit to the craft the user wants.\u00A0 Procedural shapes for KF-based wheels have been discussed, but the complications were always a bit too part-specific to allow for procedural lengths to correctly spawn a dynamic number of colliders to match.\u00A0 On paper, so to speak, it was very possible but, under Unity, not so doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEDIT:\u003C/em\u003E one last little thing before I finally shut up for the next hour (at least, after that no promises).\u00A0 I saw on the last page a question about turning the dust effects off.\u00A0 My original GUI had that option and I put it in specifically with low-end rigs in mind.\u00A0 Actually, it had two options: one for turning off the camera sampler (which does have some performance drop to it) in favor of hard-coded values that were never fully updated with actual color data, and another for turning the entire thing off globally.\u00A0 I may have also had a slider for capping the effect thickness, but I don\u0027t remember if that ever got released to the main distribution or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was also experimenting with the ability to have a craft with lots of wheels self-limit the dust to a certain number of emitters per a certain unspecified unit of measurement and/or if another wheel part was detected in close proximity in the backward-vector of the part/craft orientation.\u00A0 As you can imagine, the code got really complicated and hard to keep track of.\u00A0 I never got anywhere with detecting the proximity of parts in real time like that without totally revamping how the dust module was applied to any specific part.\u00A0 My most successful attempt basically made use of a dummy module attached to the part itself which would allow setting part-specific parameters for the dust on that wheel.\u00A0 When the craft was loaded into the simulation (\u0022flight scene\u0022 I believe) a vessel module would scan the parts on the craft for the existence of this dummy module and then dynamically add the real dust module to those parts, if the vessel module detected that they were worthy of it after looking for proximity and/or position on the craft of the wheels in question, and load in the data from the dummy module into them for use in fine-tuning the specifics of that part model... and then apply any global settings that had been set in the GUI and/or the config file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s all

the repulsors move from underwater -\u0026gt; above water/detecting ground contact; they go from seeing zero compression to nearly full compression in a single tick, and proceed to launch things into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027m already checking for ground-contact in the water code, I think I merely need to keep checking for ground-contact even when underwater; this would allow the repulsors to see the surface of the ground underwater, and would be using that surface for the repulsion as they were brought to the shore.\u00A0 However this might still cause some \u0027pop\u0027 when the repulsor breaks the surface of the water, as now the water will be what it uses for raycasts (rather than the ground, which may be several meters underwater).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm... Seems like it might be necessary to add a timed / lerped / smoothed term to the spring calc for when returning from underwater status.\u00A0 So, yeah, perhaps your idea of setting spring length to a very small value when underwater is the best way to handle it.\u00A0 The spring would then slowly return to normal as soon as normal ground/water-surface contact was detected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, what is happening in the video is this:\u003Cbr\u003E\nRepulsors are just a bit too submerged to see the surface of the water (it must be just barely too submerged; I bet if they were 0.1m higher on the craft they would float just fine).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey get driven towards the shore.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs they approach the shore, they start to see the ground underneath the water and push up a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow they are ~0.01m above the surface of the water, and they start to see -that- as the new surface, and start to push up from there.\u00A0 Since they are based on a linear spring, and are seen as being at max compression, they exert put out maximum force, and things go flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve got an idea on how to handle this, but need to think on how it would work with repulsors not aligned downwards (I don\u0027t want to turn them into underwater propulsion devices...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-30T19:19:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2017 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-30T19:10:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222939129\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155056\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485792515\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022138730\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be an interesting effect, though I\u0027m not sure how to setup the parts in any sort of lego-like way; it seems any hovercraft skirt would have to be a single-piece with a pre-set shape (e.g. pre-built fuselage piece).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf nobody else takes you up on that offer, I just might (in a few weeks=\\).\u00A0 I really would like to have some more \u0027hover-craft\u0027 style parts available (something a bit more realistic than repulsors \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease feel free to \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Yes, a limitation might be that you have fixed configuration part like the tracks.
