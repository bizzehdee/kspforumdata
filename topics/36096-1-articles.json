But I had one of my Rover/Landers dock with it, and when I tried to dock with my second one, I noticed the solar panels were violently wobbling, like there was a major weight inbalance, and the game\u0027s engine said \u0022WHAT THE HELL?!\u0022 and spazzed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first Rover/Lander is a tiny thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I have ASAS and RCS with the Space Station.

It\u0027s the way ASAS works with the modules capable of producing torques. (E.g. command modules.) All of the modules will try to generate torque to adjust for movement of whichever module is being used as reference by the ASAS. That will cause some flex in the station, which will result in more torque applied than needed, reference module overshooting target, and cycle repeating. The station will try to shake itself apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat seems to work is toggling ASAS off for a bit, letting station calm down, toggling it back on, and repeating that a few times. I\u0027ve found that the station usually stops shaking after a few repetitions. You can also try limiting number of command modules and probe cores docked to the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbility to toggle torque generated by command modules on and off is planned for one of the future updates. Once we have that ability, switching the torque off from all but one modules will resolve the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T07:41:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESAS will slowly eliminate shaking, and then ONLY if there is no....
