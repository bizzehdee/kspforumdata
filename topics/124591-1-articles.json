A MMRTG isn\u0027t going to cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor starters, you\u0027re going to be flying a long time. 20 to 30 years perhaps. Plutonium is going to decay and you\u0027re going to lose power. And what\u0027s more: the thermocouples that create the electricity decay too, and they decay faster than the plutonium. While the half-life of the radioactive elements may be over 80 years, chances are you\u0027ll drop to 50% output in 40 years already. (I guess you could check how Voyager is doing for power nowadays to get a more accurate number.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s pure distance. Consider New Horizons, which also carries a RTG - one that was 10 years old at the time of the flyby, not 20 or 30. Also, that\u0027s not a MMRTG rated at 110 W nominal power, but rather a larger one rated at 250 W. By the time it arrived at Pluto, it was down to 200 W. And the New Horizons team will be waiting for over sixteen months in total just to download all the data they have collected. The reason for that? Distance, and power. The RTG is so weak, it can barely maintain 1 kBit (not byte, \u003Cem\u003Ebit\u003C/em\u003E) worth of transfer rate, even with an antenna the size of the whole spacecraft. During an AMA preceding the flyby event, the New Horizons team even stated that they intentionally didn\u0027t mount bigger telescopes and higher resolution instruments because it was already a pain in the rear to transmit data as is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESedna is twice that distance away, and the MMRTG will be putting out a lot less power once you get there. You\u0027ll have maybe 70 W left. How are you supposed to get \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E data back at all? Your signal might start to get lost in background noise by that point, and even if it doesn\u0027t, you\u0027ll need absurd amounts of expensive DSN time to download even one compressed image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really think that if we were to start a Sedna mission, we would need to give it more than just a couple watts worth of power, if only to drive the antenna. Give it half a kilowatt instead of 0.07 kW, then we might be talking! Of course, to achieve that, you\u0027d have to provide 0.8 to 0.9 kW at launch. That\u0027s comparable to what Cassini-Huygens has onboard. It launched with about 33 kg of plutonium, as opposed to the 4 kg that the MMRTG on Curiosity has. Can your mission proposal deal with purchasing eight times the amount of plutonium? And your spacecraft with four times as much weight dedicated to power generation? Keep in mind that the US may not even have that amount of plutonium in stock, even if you had all the money in the world. You\u0027d have to pay to restart production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it might be worth considering to restart the cancelled ASRG program, which aimed to produce a much higher efficiency generator weighing 25% less than a MMRTG, carrying only a quarter the plutonium, yet still producing 140 W as opposed to 110 W. With six of those things, you could get 840 W power output with just 1/6th the plutonium, with just a slightly worse total weight. And that\u0027s assuming you can\u0027t scale the unit up for significantly improved power/weight, as RTGs usually do when scaled up. Of course, there\u0027s downsides to this too: you\u0027d have to restart and finish the cancelled development program, as mentioned before. And, can you guarantee that the stirling pistons used in these units can survive 20-30 years in deep space without breaking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah... this is not going to work with an MMRTG. You need much, much more power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, patience may be a virtue here. As much as I want to learn more about Sedna, we can still intercept it at perihelion if we launch around 2050 instead of 2030.

Everyone expected Pluto to be either exactly the same as Triton or a cratered dead iceball yet it turned out to be neither of that. Moons of giant planets are all very much different in their geological history and composition and yet they are all similiar sized when it comes to moons for each planet with a few outliers and orbit the same distance from the Sun. The Jupiter system contains both the most active and the least active major solar system body (Io vs Callisto). You might say \u0022but tidal heating...\u0022 except none of the moons of Uranus get any appreciable tidal heating at the moment, yet Miranda is a crazy world of chasms and 25 km high cliffs, Ariel has frozen \u0022rivers\u0022 of ancient half-melted ice \u0022lava\u0022 flows, Titania has a thin CO2 atmosphere and is criss-crossed with chasms, Umbriel is a crater ball - except fully black, yet one crater is bizzarely white, Oberon is a reddish cratered world. Look at Pluto and Charon - drastically different worlds. Sedna is Charon sized, but much colder. At aphelion, it is cold enough to freeze hydrogen. Right now, it might be warm enough for a nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature difference between perihelion and aphelion of Sedna are quite major. Think Pluto has dramatic seasons?

SLS Block II will cost about $600 million to build and launch, and WISPIE will be smaller than New Horizons due to shorter flyby time and constraints on payload mass and electricity usage as we need to fit in a starshield and the thing will only use 1 MMRTG, which provides roughly half the power as NH\u0027s RTG.

A MMRTG isn\u0027t going to cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor starters, you\u0027re going to be flying a long time. 20 to 30 years perhaps. Plutonium is going to decay and you\u0027re going to lose power. And what\u0027s more: the thermocouples that create the electricity decay too, and they decay faster than the plutonium. While the half-life of the radioactive elements may be over 80 years, chances are you\u0027ll drop to 50% output in 40 years already. (I guess you could check how Voyager is doing for power nowadays to get a more accurate number.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s pure distance. Consider New Horizons, which also carries a RTG - one that was 10 years old at the time of the flyby, not 20 or 30. Also, that\u0027s not a MMRTG rated at 110 W nominal power, but rather a larger one rated at 250 W. By the time it arrived at Pluto, it was down to 200 W. And the New Horizons team will be waiting for over sixteen months in total just to download all the data they have collected. The reason for that? Distance, and power. The RTG is so weak, it can barely maintain 1 kBit (not byte, \u003Cem\u003Ebit\u003C/em\u003E) worth of transfer rate, even with an antenna the size of the whole spacecraft. During an AMA preceding the flyby event, the New Horizons team even stated that they intentionally didn\u0027t mount bigger telescopes and higher resolution instruments because it was already a pain in the rear to transmit data as is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESedna is twice that distance away, and the MMRTG will be putting out a lot less power once you get there. You\u0027ll have maybe 70 W left. How are you supposed to get \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E data back at all? Your signal might start to get lost in background noise by that point, and even if it doesn\u0027t, you\u0027ll need absurd amounts of expensive DSN time to download even one compressed image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really think that if we were to start a Sedna mission, we would need to give it more than just a couple watts worth of power, if only to drive the antenna. Give it half a kilowatt instead of 0.07 kW, then we might be talking! Of course, to achieve that, you\u0027d have to provide 0.8 to 0.9 kW at launch. That\u0027s comparable to what Cassini-Huygens has onboard. It launched with about 33 kg of plutonium, as opposed to the 4 kg that the MMRTG on Curiosity has. Can your mission proposal deal with purchasing eight times the amount of plutonium? And your spacecraft with four times as much weight dedicated to power generation? Keep in mind that the US may not even have that amount of plutonium in stock, even if you had all the money in the world. You\u0027d have to pay to restart production.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it might be worth considering to restart the cancelled ASRG program, which aimed to produce a much higher efficiency generator weighing 25% less than a MMRTG, carrying only a quarter the plutonium, yet still producing 140 W as opposed to 110 W. With that thing, yyou could get 840 W power output with just 1/6th the plutonium, with just a slightly worse total weight. And that\u0027s assuming you can\u0027t scale the unit up for significantly improved power/weight, as RTGs usually do when scaled up. Of course, there\u0027s downsides to this too: you\u0027d have to restart and finish the cancelled development program, as mentioned before. And, can you guarantee that the stirling pistons used in these units can survive 20-30 years in deep space without breaking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah... this is not going to work with an MMRTG. You need much, much more power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, patience may be a virtue here. As much as I want to learn more about Sedna, we can still intercept it at perihelion if we launch around 2050 instead of 2030. Just imagine what kind of technology we might be able to throw at the problem then!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Which is why, case and point, this thing will arrive as soon as or maybe a little later than NH did because of using the Oberth effect.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the probe might be able to use future outer Solar System probes as data relays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I will increase it to using 2 MMRTG\u0027s to double the power output.

Jupiter\u0027s SMA is 5.2 AU. Sedna\u0027s perihelion is 76 AU, though if you launch 2030 and want to be there by 2040, it won\u0027t be at perihelion, so we\u0027ll say 80 AU. That means that in the best case scenario, the signal has to travel 75 AU to Jupiter, versus 79 AU to Earth. Considering that those distances are very similar, and the sheer size of the DSN antennas far dwarfs anything that a deep space probe carries, your connection to Earth is always going to be significantly better than your connection to a deep space probe. In other words - deep space probes will likely be unable to even detect, much less resolve a signal coming from Sedna if it is transmitted with just a hundred or so watts of power, and thus won\u0027t be able to play relay. You need the DSN to have a chance to catch it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven at Saturn, with its SMA of 9.6, you\u0027re probably still not far enough away from Earth to make a small portable antenna better than the DSN.

Signal strength is governed by four things: power input, distance, size of the sending antenna, and size of the receiving antenna.\u003Cp\u003EFuture deep space probes will go mostly towards Jupiter, as Europa is one of the key science destinations defined for the near future, along with Mars. Jupiter\u0027s SMA is 5.2 AU. Sedna\u0027s perihelion is 76 AU, though if you launch 2030 and want to be there by 2040, it won\u0027t be at perihelion, so we\u0027ll say 80 AU. That means that in the best case scenario, the signal has to travel 75 AU to Jupiter, versus 79 AU to Earth. Considering that those distances are very similar, and the sheer size of the DSN antennas far dwarfs anything that a deep space probe carries, your connection to Earth is always going to be significantly better than your connection to a deep space probe. In other words - deep space probes will likely be unable to even detect, much less resolve a signal coming from Sedna if it is transmitted with just a hundred or so watts of power, and thus won\u0027t be able to play relay. You need the DSN to have a chance to catch it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven at Saturn, with its SMA of 9.6, you\u0027re probably still not far enough away from Earth to make a small portable antenna better than the DSN.
