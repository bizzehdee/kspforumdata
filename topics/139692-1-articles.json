I wanted to make a comparison between that speed (~300,000,000 m/s) and the fastest airbreathing craft in existence (the X-43 at roughly 3300 m/s). It\u0027s a pretty large gulf.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simplest approach, I decided, would be to depict the distance traversed by a photon next to the distance traversed by the X-43 in some arbitrary period of time. Trouble is, the ratio is 90,333:1. That\u0027s a hard distance to depict in a simple graphic; I don\u0027t know of anybody with a screen large enough to display a 90,333 pixel line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, what about a spiral? If I could create a spiral with an arc length of 90,333 cm, then I could display it next to a 1-cm line. That would be a pretty striking way of depicting the difference. If an arc length of 90,333 cm was impossible, I could make a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eperceived\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Earc length of 90,333 cm...for example, by depicting a spiral with 500 turns and an outer diameter of 180 cm (as if the diameter is constant but the spiral is receding back into the screen).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo idea how I could possibly find a way to render that, though. Any ideas? Or any other ideas of how to depict a scale difference of 90,333:1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T18:42:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this will help \u003Ca href=\u0022http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T19:04:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222579751\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139692\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463164966\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002285708\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Darnok\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, Darnok said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this will help \u003Ca href=\u0022http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I love that illustration, but it doesn\u0027t fit so well in a single graphic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T20:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the problem that\u0027s been bothering me for a few years.
