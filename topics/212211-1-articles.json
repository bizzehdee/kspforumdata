In KSP2, the hydrogen tanks are built from metallic foil and metal trusses. This makes it hard to get that same sci-fi asthetic with smooth surfaces. For this reason, I would like to request that smooth hydrogen tanks be added to KSP2. They would have better aerodynamic and thermal properties, but be slightly heavier. These tanks would also be useful for atmospheric hydrolox-powered rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyFall2489","CreatedById":216984,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-22T22:54:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, mk2 and mk3 hydrogen tanks would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
