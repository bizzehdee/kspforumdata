I myself enjoy the French Romantic period composers, and turn-of-the-(last)-century Russian composers.\n\nDeciding if you are a Mozart or a Beethoven person is a good start, I guess. Are you more into tricky little clever (I find them childlike) melodies (Mozart), or a more robust sense of gravitas, a guy who was basically torturing himself mentally trying to find the perfect creation (Beethoven). I too am a Beethoven guy. But there\u0027s so much more. Those Russians like Tchaikovsky, Shostikovitch, and many others seem to portray a heavier mood, overall. Plus their orchestras were even bigger, more oomph, more textures to play around with. Speaking of textures, that\u0027s why I like those French so much (Ravel, Debussy), they did things with orchestration (the mixing and blending of instruments) and were stretching the bounds of theory (at that time of course) in ways never heard before.\n\nI prefer actual symphonic compositions over music made specifically for movies. The movie music always seems rushed to me, switching moods and themes way too quickly, never exploring things enough. And it all comes across as formulaic (want a sense of wonder? Hey, let\u0027s play a D major chord in the context of a C major piece! Happens all the time, I\u0027m sick of it). But I am a musical snob, so take everything here with large servings of sodium-related products.\n\nIf you want specific recommendations, let me know!\n\nEdit: Oh, and there\u0027s always this: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T20:08:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by justidutch**\n  \nHolst"}]}
