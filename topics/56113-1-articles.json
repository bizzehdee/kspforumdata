I want to be able to do so without much Jeb but if I have to use phase angles that\u0027s fine, but the problem that I can see is every rocket will be different and it would be hard to work out the time for assent through the atmosphere, any idea? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing it\u0027s going to a case of trial and error each time or can you use TWR and delta v to work it out.

For instance my current station is at 125km, I tend to launch off the pad when the station is about 12-15 degrees behind KSC, which leads to direct rendezvous off the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour exact angles are gonna depend on the TWR of your various ascent stages (how long it takes to reach required altitude) and the altitude of the station itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs KvickFlygarn87 (oh look, another swede) says, do a couple of dry runs and before you know it, dock direct off launch will be something you do without even thinking about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-14T14:32:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2013 02:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unimatrix1","CreatedById":67064,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T18:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheer guys i thought so, so here I go with with limited understanding, ignorance and brute force I will succeed (You only fail when you stop trying). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T18:58:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t recommend trying to orbit in a way that the orbital burn ends in rendezvous...

My method makes a few assumptions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You\u0027re flying a consistent launch vehicle, I was always using the same lifter or crew transport rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your station/target is in a circular equatorial orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo some practice launches, get it to the point where you\u0027re consistently flying the same launch profile and circularizing on your target orbit so you\u0027re always ending up in the same orbit, in the same amount of time (this can be done if the rocket is stable and you practice). Take this time, and calculate/guesstimate how far your station travels along it\u0027s orbit arc in that time. Launch when it\u0027s that far from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I never thought to take video, but I\u0027ve done multiple launches where my circularization burn was done using the target retrograde marker with the station selected. I shut down at 0.0m/s relative velocity and I was in a matched orbit ~400m from the station reliably. Then RCS to dock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth the practice, it is really fun, and saves time and fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatt\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
