We left Tomman and Doobald [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122736-Speak!-Roll-over!-Wait-DON-T-roll-over!), finally united on Eve, patiently awaiting the development of a vehicle that might get them to low Eve orbit, and within reach of the rescue vessel *Redemption.* Unfortunately, reality (work? family? really?) and Kerbal engineering skill has made the wait longer than expected. Docktor von Kermann, why has it taken so long?\n\nWernher: Vell, Valter, spaze iz an eazy ting nicht. Ve haf many vehicle konfigurations tried...\n\n![wxKp8Gq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wxKp8Gq.jpg)\n\n![GEIpH5h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GEIpH5h.jpg)\n\n![RX5XwTv.png](http://i.imgur.com/RX5XwTv.png)\n\n![SwTwsNF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SwTwsNF.jpg)\n\n![rRho9Gu.png](http://i.imgur.com/rRho9Gu.png)\n\nWernher: Aber they nicht gut funktion.

A nuclear tug is to be dispatched to drag the heavy, but critical, load to Eve.\n\n![mrxWCd9.png](http://i.imgur.com/mrxWCd9.png)\n\n![UyX1105.png](http://i.imgur.com/UyX1105.png)\n\n![m3UxX0X.png](http://i.imgur.com/m3UxX0X.png)\n\nWernher: Ja, the standard sized docking port vas a bit more flexible than is optimum!\n\n![VJDoF2g.png](http://i.imgur.com/VJDoF2g.png)\n\nWalter: The dedicated KPL controller crew persevered, however.

Upon landing on Eve, strut compression allowed engine contact, engine (harumph) detonation.\n\nWalter: Detonation? That sounds bad!\n\nWernher: Vell, zee vehicle as currently configured (with 1/3 of hitz engines knocked off) doez not haf zee thruzt for liftoff.
