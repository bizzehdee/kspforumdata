While I agree the new simcity is a huge flop, I still don\u0027t think that justified people out right hating EA as they do. Sure disappointed to me is a more normal reaction, but hatred is just too far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have played a few of their recent games, and i can\u0027t say the quality really decreased any. To me it\u0027s equally comparable to anything I played in the past. Such as Need for Speed Hot Pursuit I enjoy just as much as their past games, but I am disappointed there was no multiplayer o.o. It most certainly wasn\u0027t a bad game though. I have not played Mass effect 3, but I absolutely loved 2. More so then the first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
