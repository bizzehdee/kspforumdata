Got orbit, circularised, and managed to dock with the deadweight orbiter, using all but 1 unit of ascent fuel. Very little of the monopropellant was used, however. Jeb transferred over, as did the fuel, and with a little spin, the lander can was flung away. The return burn used up all the fuel and 10 units of monopropellant to get a 22km periapse over Kerbin - enough to return. The concealed roundified tank went untouched. Once I got to the periapse, I activated the abort system (which was tested earlier in a launch) - decoupling the capsule and firing the separatrons. This was in order to make the return more swift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a safe touchdown in the plains, that I didn\u0027t bother to take a picture of. Might modify the rocket a touch: less fuel in the descent stage, less monopropellant brought, less fuel in the lifter and a probe core in the orbiter. Still, not bad for something I threw together in a couple of minutes without using any of the large parts.

So, I built the Type-B 2StageMunLander, which was only 0.055t heavier than the Type-A - still under 75t on the launchpad. It did mean I had to do the docking in Mun-orbit on monopropellant, but that was fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/0fU7qe.png\u0022 alt=\u00220fU7qe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAn image of the Type-B on the launchpad\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/DdYruU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DdYruU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/OvfZT3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OvfZT3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Mini-Apollo twist.

The landing itself was rather routine: using the high-beam spotlights made it rather easy to tell the landing location. Bob managed to land it on a slope, in a biome I had yet to land a kerbal, so he took some reports down and grabbed a sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/BOyFJJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BOyFJJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/M8Hx7B.png\u0022 alt=\u0022M8Hx7B.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemembered to transfer the science over, then decoupled the flight-recorder from the lander-can, leaving it docked to the capsule\u0027s nose. The additional probe core on the bottom of the lander can (just above the LV-1) meant that it could deorbit itself with the remaining monopropellant. Then it was a basic return. I decided to decouple the capsule on the way down and leave the engine burning retrograde so that it would crash elsewhere. I also burned off all the monopropellant, before opening the parachute and descending into the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/yoBGqn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yoBGqn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight-recorder worked perfectly, but because almost all my previous Mun-landers were one-can-only pieces, the \u0022recovery of a vessel landed on the Mun\u0022 was worth no science whatsoever.
