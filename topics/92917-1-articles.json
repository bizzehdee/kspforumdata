Most of the time ingame, we cope with it by moving wings, moving masses, or pumping fuel around, only one of which can realistically be done in the flight scene. My question to you people-smarter-than-myself is, how do aircraft engineers do it? Particularly in the cases of aircraft such as the Harrier and, to a lesser extent, the Lightning II?

For starters, these things don\u0027t have to align quite as well as they do in KSP. You still want CoM ahead of your wing CoP for stable flight. But the trick is that the airplane\u0027s horizontal stabilizers provide \u003Cem\u003Enegative\u003C/em\u003E lift. So as the airplane speeds up, they push the tail down, balancing against airplane\u0027s CoM. In addition to that, you have trim tabs, which allows you to adjust how much negative lift you get with neutral input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese things are in KSP, but because aerodynamics is so much simplified, they don\u0027t work quite right. Specifically, you have one, fixed CoP. On a real aircraft, CoP shifts dynamically. That means that KSP aircraft have a very narrow envelope. CoM can only be a hair ahead of CoP, and CoT has to be on the same line. For a real airplane, CoM has an envelope of good locations. You do still have to check to make sure that CoM is within the envelope.

The wing produces downwash that changes the apparent angle of attack that the horizontal stabilizer experiences. The amount of downwash changes with the circulation (not to be confused with lift) produced by the wing. On large aircraft like airliners, the horizontal stabilizer\u0027s angle of incidence can even be changed in flight. There is a large screw jack (or two) at the front of the trimmable horizontal stab that pivots the stabilizer as required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, symmetrical airfoils are perfectly capable of producing lift. You don\u0027t need camber. What you do need is a sharp trailing edge. All airfoils have one, regardless of whether they are symmetrical, cambered or are composed of a single membrane that has no relevant thickness (like a sail). This is because the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutta_condition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ekutta condition\u003C/a\u003E occurs when an aerodynamic object has a sharp trailing edge.
