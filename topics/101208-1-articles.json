I\u0027ve been wishing for a set between 1.25 and 2.5 meters for a while now and as awsumindyman pointed out, 1.875 meters is the logical size. Some examples that show this is necessary are with building SLS replicas, the boosters are much too narrow and short when using 1.25 meter boosters on 3.75 meter tanks; building Ares I replicas or any rocket that uses a first stage that is narrower than its above upper stage; and for building radial boosters on 2.5 meter tanks \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC 1.25 meter boosters look a bit silly on these. I can\u0027t believe they made 0.23.5 without adding larger boosters, especially with the SLS theme, because you can\u0027t even build an SLS with the standard booster (you can with clipped parts but you shouldn\u0027t have to go through all that work in a polished game). What I also find ridiculous is how shortly for which the SRB\u0027s burn. There is no reason why a booster should run out before the rocket is even doing its gravity turn; i.e., unless you use clipped boosters with thrust limiter set down for longer burn times, you\u0027ll be dropping your boosters straight onto the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBranching off from bigger tanks is my wish for segmented boosters. Adding 1.875 meter SRB\u0027s would be a wonder for constructing large SLS replicas or large STS replicas. Another thing to note is that real life SRB\u0027s are usually in segments, usually consisting of the motor segment, the nose cone with built in separator rockets, and the actual fuel segments. Usually they increase the thrust when adding more segments, like is being done with the Space Launch System. The Space Shuttle used lower thrust four segment boosters whereas the SLS will use higher thrust five segment boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see how it all ties together and it really makes sense. The 2.5 meter parts and 3.75 meter parts blend really nicely and you can make rockets with a 2.5 meter lower stage and 3.75 meter upper stage without looking silly. When trying to apply that to 2.5 meter and 1.25 meter parts it is simply much too small. The 1.25 meter SRB\u0027s can be nice as radial boosters.
