However, I\u0027ve so far only used the T1 capsule whith only a parachute attached after staging. When do I need the heatshield in this release?\n\nAlso, had anyone else been spinning out when attempting to angle to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at around 10-12km? Have rockets had aerodynamics added to then where if I pull too many g\u0027s in one direction, and then the thrust fights inertia in another direction, like a car taking to sharp of a turn, then i spin out?"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:32:59Z","Content":"Basically, the old \u0022gravity turn\u0022 we\u0027ve all been doing, is not really a gravity turn at all. Straight up, angle to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and burn til apoapsis exits the atmosphere just won\u0027t cut it anymore. The reason is that suddenly turning will break the flow of air around your rocket, imparting a much larger drag on the side facing away from the planet, thus flipping you around. If you ever played with FAR pre-1.0, you would have noticed the same effect.\n\nThe solution is to use a true gravity turn, a maneuver which, unsurprisingly, uses gravity to turn your spacecraft. Basically, you need to begin pitching over pretty much straight away off the launchpad. Either turn off SAS or set it to \u0027Prograde\u0027. Then, simply follow the prograde marker, letting it fall towards the horizontal. Your rocket will automatically point towards it. Now, you can control this by throttling your engines. Increase thrust to slow the turn, decrease it to speed it up.\n\nDisclaimer, I am in no means an expert on these turns, and have had much less time than I\u0027d have liked over the past day or two to experiment with the new aero system. As such, take the second paragraph with a grain of salt, as there may be more efficient ways to make this turn. However, I hope this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:08:10Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been angling my rockets a notch over on the launch clamps (as I used to do with FAR). Works well for starting your gravity turn off without risking weird rolling happening ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I recommend not putting SAS on prograde until you have a few hundred m/s going, else it\u0027s easy to turn too fast."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:53:25Z","Content":"Seems to be a couple of alternatives to heat shields. \n\nYou can deploy your chutes to get some high altitude braking.

Its actually easier now than it was before, you can depoy parachutes at any speed or altitude and they will slow you instantly and not break. All the re-entry heating means is that you have to deploy your chute early before you get hot and then wait five minutes to drift down."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:58:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Even with high velocity aerobraking (Jool or Laythe ?)\n\nThe air brakes do.
