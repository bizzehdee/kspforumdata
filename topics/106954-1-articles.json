It displays the contracts you accepted in your little \u0027marketing-hut\u0027 (or whatever it was called again) and it allows you to fold up / unfold every single contract when you click its title.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I had the idea to sort my contracts by using this list, folding up every contract my current vehicle couldnt do - that involved mostly \u0022test ... on escape-trajectory\u0022 for example. I quickly realised that this list doesnt save its states. Everytime you re-open your list, every single contract is also open again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou guessed it: Im suggesting to make the list remember which contracts were open, which were closed. On top of that I could imagine being able to click on single sub-requirements, like \u0022...on escape-trajectory\u0022 to highlight and possibly auto-foldup any contract containing a similar line. In example: I know I wont be able to reach an escape-trajectory from kerbin, so clicking on the line of contract XY stating that requirement closes this contract and any other contract requiring me to reach escape-velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother small sidenote - Contracts in the line of \u0022test part XY\u0022 should show a thumbnail and/or more details about the part in question. I took a contract asking me to test the huge \u0022twin-boar\u0022-liquid boosters on an escape-trajectory away from kerbin - at that time I barely had researched my third node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T06:00:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDang, I was right about to suggest this! Definitely support. I really want to be able to minimize the \u0022Explore Duna\u0022 contracts which I took just to make them go away, until I\u0027m ready to deal with them...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
