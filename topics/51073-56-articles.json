I forget. Something about the way KSP works when one plugin calls functions from another one. Apparently, it only works with the specific version of the plugin you compiled yours with. But from what I read, it\u0027s linked to the version *number*. Apparently, the dev versions of mechjeb used to be drop-in replacements until the buildbot started auto-incrementing the version numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, this applies to the RPM plugins too. I have no idea why, but when I build them myself I get a slightly different build number than the official release, even if I build from the official release\u0027s source. This prevents just rebuilding say, SCANSatRPM.dll and dropping it in. You have to build all three RPM plugins to get them to work with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not hard: the source comes with .csproj files for the three dlls and a .sln for the overall set. When I try to compile it, I get 10 build errors: something something.Orbit.something commands to mechjeb that come up with an error along the lines of \u0027mechjeb doesn\u0027t have an \u0027Orbit\u0027 thing, wtf you talking about\u0027. Changing \u0027\u0026lt;x\u0026gt;.Orbit.\u0026lt;y\u0026gt;\u0027 in those lines to \u0027\u0026lt;x\u0026gt;.orbit.\u0026lt;y\u0026gt;\u0027 leads to a successful build. No idea why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, all it takes is making sure it can find the three KSP .dlls it needs, plus the versions of SCANSat and Mechjeb you want it to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you could figure out some way to get the SCANSatRPM.dll to build by itself with the same version number as the official release, it might work as a drop-in, though...that\u0027s the impression I get, anyway. Otherwise, every time the version number on the SCANSat.dll changes, it\u0027ll break compat until the whole thing is recompiled. Or some such garbage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s some way to integrate into RPM directly without going through a special plugin, which Vesselview does. No idea what it is, but I gather it doesn\u0027t have any of these problems, so that might ultimately be easier than custom-rebuilding RPM each time MJ or SS updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-02T05:53:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2014 05:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T19:49:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technogeeky\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technogeeky\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d need to know the licenses for SCANsatRPM and RPM, but if they are logically compatible, I could just release the SCANsatRPM file in v6rc2 (and obviously in the real v6, assuming I do it right).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s released under GPLv3, which I think is compatible with SCANsat\u0027s 3-clause BSD license (and the license for CLZF2). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now all it requires is recompiling RPM from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eits source\u003C/a\u003E using a reference to the updated SCANsat.dll; both the SCANsatRPM.dll and JSI.dll need to be replaced.
