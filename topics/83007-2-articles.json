You have to remember not every modder/tweaker actually releases their mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes exactly the point - we want oceans and atmos to add up to about 100%. So if an atmo has 100% concentration and 5 elements, adding a 6th generally means, changing the concentrations of others. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition if you remove \u0027useless\u0027 gasses which seem to be common, and make the concentrations of the useful up to 100% you really change the balance of things. This is why it\u0027s very useful to have a dominant gas/liquid. Whenever you\u0027d need to add something new, you\u0027ll take from the major. When I think about it, would be nice if ORS had a concept of default gas/liquid, and automatically adjusted it\u0027s concentration so the total adds up correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also the point of realism - it\u0027s just weird to have green plant-life without nitrogen, water oceans without crustal/atmospheric water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also the \u0027realism\u0027 with how common elements are in universe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO gasses/liquids when harvested should turn to defined resource - eg - water to water, nitrogen to nitrogen.

That way the \u0022costs\u0022 of the resources are not ever modified, except that trying to launch with a bunch of pre-filled resources will cost you a big fee to do so. That would fix the recovery issue and not touch the CRP. Hmmm...
