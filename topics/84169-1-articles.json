In the VAB I could not change orientation but could effect things like symmetry and angle snap. I could select and assemble parts using my trackball, so I made a basic rocket and launched it. In flight I had no control at all, but could switch between IVA/EVA and switch SAS, Gear, etc. Just no directional control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was working perfectly last night with many mods (32bit) so after it happened, I tried with the mods uninstalled with the same result. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then deleted the game and re-installed it as a fresh vanilla install.

It doesn\u0027t crash, doesn\u0027t seem to be throwing errors and after 2 complete wipes and re-installs it is still unplayable as there is no control for parts or flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I am doing a massive backup to my HDD, once finished tomorrow afternoon I will attempt to refresh my OS, this should be relatively simple as I have a legit disk. If that fails for some reason I may just do a destructive re-install, (hence the massive manual backup) and see if maybe it is a Windows or a third party problem. Although sfc/scannow came up clean, as does my anti-virus and anti-malware, and I have not installed anything in the period from it working to not working, it seems to be my final option. I will check the forums before I take such a drastic step just in case a solution presents itself. It is such a bizzare problem that it may be a single case scenario. I will report back if I do take this final step and close out the thread as solved if it works. Thanks though, as many read it, I know if anyone had a clue they would of posted even a guess. Perhaps it is a unique problem originating in an undetected corruption in the OS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit6] Just tried to re-map the keys to IKJLUO combination that translation uses, and that doesn\u0027t work either. Even more odd, the U key (before I remapped) turned on the lights, but remapping U to left roll the key doesn\u0027t work for roll. I then tried to remap to the numpad, that doesn\u0027t work either. Perplexing that the game sees these keys but they if they control orientation or flight control they will not work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery perplexing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-10T10:29:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2014 10:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by pslytely psycho\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pslytely psycho","CreatedById":62775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T10:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESUCCESS!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rolled back the driver for my keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything works perfectly again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then re-updated the driver.
