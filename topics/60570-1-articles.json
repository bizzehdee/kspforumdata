I\u0027ve only been playing this since the end of November and I only did my first orbital rendezvous less than 2 weeks ago but I have been interested in the subject for many years so I picked it up pretty quickly. The first bit of general advice I would give is to always give yourself a bit of breathing room when launching to orbit. I generally always launch to at least 72 km and usually 80\u002B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you still have a reasonable amount of fuel in your rescue ship? For the first \u0022solution\u0022 I presented you will need to make a prograde burn to raise your apoapsis to ~100km. Then, when you reach that point, again burn prograde until the orbit is circular at 100km. Then wait for the relative positions to get much closer (at the moment they are about 130 deg apart, you probably want Mr Kerban to be about 20 degrees behind the rescue ship but there is no harm in experimenting). Then set up a node to do a retrograde burn to get your periapsis back down to 70km. When you do this you should see the intercept markers on the projected path. If you see the top and bottom parts do not line up very well then move the node around your orbit until they line up as close as possible. You can then slightly adjust the burn in various directions to improve the intercept distance further (you should be able to get the closest approach within 0.2km quite easily if the orbits are the same inclination). Wait until you get to the node and do the burn in the usual way. After the burn, check the intercept markers again to check nothing went wrong. At this point, if you have RCS, you can adjust your path with that to get the intercept as close to 0 as you dare. With no RCS the corrections are a bit harder to work out but you can just do a small burst of burn in one direction and see what effect it has on the intercept. If it makes it worse then just turn around and burn the other way. Then switch the navball into target mode (if it isn\u0027t already) and wait until you are nearly at the intercept point. Point your ship at the retrograde marker on the navball and wait until you are nearly as close as you will get before burning until the target speed reads 0.0 (you may need to adjust your heading towards the end of the burn, just keep the ship pointing at the retrograde marker). If you are still quite a distance from the target then point directly at it and burn slightly to get a few m/s of speed. Then turn to retrograde again and wait until close before burning to a stop again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, remember that quicksave is your friend though the only things that can really go wrong during this are you run out of fuel or you overshoot the intercept, drop into the atmosphere and don\u0027t correct it quickly enough (or possibly that your intercept is a bit too good and you manage to hit him, rather unlikely though)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T23:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lizarddan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lizarddan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, basically what I need to do is either widen or lower my orbit...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAvoid excentric ( wide ) parking orbits when doing rendezvous. They work well, but are harder to plan with. On circular orbit, you just create maneuver node, push in minimal delta-v to get shallow intersection of orbits anywhere. Then you just drag that node around the circle until your intersection is where the other ship actually will be (both intersection marks point at same point). With noncircuklar orbit, you have to correct for excentricity by hand to get shallow intersection. Fiddly job at best. And yes, you want meet other craft in shallow angle. That way you spend most time in its vicinity, giving you more time to orient yourself and equalize speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lizarddan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lizarddan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eand timelapse until one catches up with the other?

Except for the \u0022approximate\u0022 part: when you set other ship as target in map view, you will see interception marks with precise position of both crafts. You can use this to plan very precise maneuvers (my best catch is \u0026lt;30 m from target craft). For your first try, and without RCS, anything less then 20km is \u0022doable\u0022 and less then 5km is great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW get rid of \u0022breaking\u0022 meme, it just clouds your mind. You are making basic Hohmann transfer - you are waiting on faster/slower orbit to get your target where you want him to be, then you do one burn to get to the tranfer orbit from \u0022yours\u0022 to \u0022his\u0022 orbit. When you meet him you are at same point in space, but still on different (transfer) orbit which would carry you away. You need to perform second correction to get on same orbit as your target. Since you are close to tour target at this point, you already equalized most of your orbital parameters, you just have to equalize you _relative_ speed. Same place \u002B same velocity = same orbit. BUT, if you flip your navball between target and orbital mode, you will see prograde/retrograde markers are different. Decreasing speed relative to target may actually increase orbital speed (relative to Kerbin). So do yourself a service and just forget about \u0022breaking\u0022 and \u0022accelerating. You are matching your _relative_ velocities and that\u0027s it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lizarddan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lizarddan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAgain, I\u0027m sorry for all confusion.
