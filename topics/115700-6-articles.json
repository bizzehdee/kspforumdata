It just writes the node coords to a file... You then have to copy/pasta those either from that file, or directly get them from the Ui you changed them in, copy/pasta to the actual part.cfg...  \n\nThe changes arent permanent when you edit them ingame.  \n\nYou have to make the changes to the part.cfg, then you have to reload the part database, either by using the Alt-12 menu (I prefer not to do this, cuz I have found changes quite often do not take effect, for what ever reason), \\*or\\* you have to exit the game completely and restart... This is what I do. Exit the game, delete the Partdatabase.cfg file, as well as the four temporary \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E cache files, then restart the game... You changes should take effect then...  \n\nYes, its still somewhat tedious, but using NodeHelper to visually do the edits, and get good coords usually the first time, and just having to restart the game once, is still better and less tedious, than guessing at changes, and having to exit/restart the game multiple times.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-18T00:47:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2019 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue**"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-18T00:56:28Z","Content":"press \u003Calt\u003E\u003Cf11\u003E in the space center - select \u0027quick database reload\u0027 (if you have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E 4\u002B installed)\n\u003C/f11\u003E\u003C/alt\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-03T01:29:40Z","Content":"I\u0027ve adopted this mod, new thread is here:\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7346712243\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/190144-18x-nodehelper-tool-used-to-edit-node-positions/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
