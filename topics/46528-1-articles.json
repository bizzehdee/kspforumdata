Now, i reasonably like physics, mostly orbital physics, but i tend to be more involved with the complex ones, and studying basic statics and mechanics gets me bored reasonably quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this exam, i was faced with a horrible problem: I had forgotten the formula for angular accelleration. Yes, the very important one, the one to calculate the accelleration acting on a body rotating at a specific angular/normal velocity. I had a few vague ideas, but nothing concrete enough to solve the exercise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought i couldn\u0027t solve the exercise, but then, i remembered something. I play this very fun game called KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wrote down all my potential formulas. Then i thought. I knew the radius of Kerbin. I knew that i\u0027d need my velocity somwhere around 2200 m/s to orbit in a 100 by 100 altitude orbit. I knew the approximate acceleration due to gravity on Kerbin. I came out with v^2/r .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got 10/20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP likely saved my exam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, Squad\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Ivo Robotnik","CreatedById":83357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T19:15:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh my god something like taht happened to me when i was playing spore xD.
