(IE, resets date to when you downloaded). So having a version number in module manager solves all that.

If we are talking about a average user, I don\u0027t see how checking .dll files in all folders will make things easier for them. That combined with potentially outdated versions of MM running all the cfgs in the KSP directories, that alone would probably would lead to some very obscure issues when described in laymen terms. And then trouble shooting will become more of a hassle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there is a limit as to how low of a bar you want to set for the usability of something. I disagree that something needs to be set at the level of a nigh-clueless PC user, because they need to step up their game, not make things easier for them. I mean, we are talking about version control on the mods they download... not editing files or creating parts here! If somebody can\u0027t keep track of their files, as I stated previously, there is a bigger problem in the mix that has nothing to do with KSP or MM.

Before that, I want to remind everyone that sarbian is coping with a genuinely difficult design challenge. He doesn\u0027t deserve harsh treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, on to the reason for a change. ModuleManager\u0027s license allows it to be customized for specific applications, which is something I\u0027ve been wanting to do for a few different projects. The problem is that MM\u0027s current design doesn\u0027t support customization in the larger sense because every loaded MM plugin will execute on all MM configs and modify all config nodes everywhere. So, my desire was to allow custom ModuleManager instances a chance to be the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E instance acting on a particular set of MM configs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gets complicated because MM is used for a variety of purposes.

Someone earlier in the thread mentioned that Kethane uses a MM config to add ModularFuelTanks support.

As evidenced by this thread, you can\u0027t just restrict the root GameData/ folder because that makes #1 (and #2 to an extent) more difficult on users. You can\u0027t just allow a mod to \u0022hide\u0022 MM config nodes in its own directory, because then things like ModularFuelTanks can\u0027t see their own nodes. To satisfy #4 (and maybe #3), you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E roll a custom MM plugin which doesn\u0027t read configs outside its own directory, but the problem here is that the stock MM plugin in the root directory will also apply its rules. There needs to be \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E mechanism for blocking some MMs from applying a config while allowing others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this doesn\u0027t mean blocking \u003Cem\u003Etarget\u003C/em\u003E config nodes.
