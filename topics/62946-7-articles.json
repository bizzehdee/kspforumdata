I don\u0027t know why, and I don\u0027t really care why, but initial testing of simply disabling them during timewarps has resulted in 0 explosions over hundreds of warps at high levels. It looks very promising, but like a lot of things that I\u0027m currently working on, it has some bugs that need to be sorted out before I can release.
