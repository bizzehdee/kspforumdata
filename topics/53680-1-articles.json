Upon further exploration, you uncover wall writings (in caves, or out of them, no matter) in a language that would require decrypting. Upon decrypting, it would give you clues as to where the next not so obvious site would be, whether it be on the same planet (If the puzzle is for that planet only), or maybe some completely different planet in the system, ending up on a final planet, even a planet that would otherwise not even be visible on your map until you uncovered all the data about its location, with big remains of an alien civilization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reward for completing such a puzzle could be, other than bigger than usual amount of science points, a secret branch in the tech tree otherwise not unlock-able by any means (such as often mentioning light speed engines for possible future multiple star systems)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is brainstorming of course, it would require a lot of planning, but it would take the term exploration to whole new levels.
