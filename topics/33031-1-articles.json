That hole thing have to be done mirrored. When one pair of tanks is empty decouple them with the engines attached to them. Asparagus staging results in a much higher delta-v than that design you use currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: The upper stage you use for OMS-actions should be an centered tank (with maybe two small additional tanks adjectant to it) and two attached small engines to the side. Because a centered engine have to carry all the load and breaks up mostly under the stress from the load and the wobbeling. That is caused by KSP; it stacks every thing in the middle, in that case the engine and not the hull/airframe: The casing around the engine from an decoupler is purely cosmetic!
