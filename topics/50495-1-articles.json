Build a tiny rocket, then build a slightly larger stage under it, and then a larger stage under that. Three stages, if they\u0027re proportioned properly, can get you just about anywhere, as long as you\u0027re not planning on a return.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T11:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis, in career mode or sandbox, will easily make Mun orbit and return. It takes careful management of the internal battery to complete the mission. It can be done with ease once you have learned hos to do the orbital turn and planning efficient maneuvering burns in map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zUCLXGU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zUCLXGU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cfd0Euk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cfd0Euk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oLlN5JH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oLlN5JH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
