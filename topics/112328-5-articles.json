As per previous posts by **Olympic1.** This is a known issue and will be fixed in next version, which is coming soon.\n\nThe Next Version will include new single Kerbal 1.25M freezer (a.k.a. the CRY-0300)\n\nSneak-peek (textures and internals are not finalized), and Yes that is a transparent part with external doors that open and close and is fully active (not a dummy) so you can see the internal from the outside.\n\n![SnGzsjl.png](http://i.imgur.com/SnGzsjl.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T23:52:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T23:58:45Z","Content":"oh wow, gonna try this one out!

Useful for also freezing Kerbals and thawing them in the future when their needed."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T10:18:19Z","Content":"Just an update for everyone on current work I am doing on this mod. \n\nSo the 1 Kerbal freezer (to be known as the CRY-0300) is almost complete. MerlinsMaster is just putting the finishing touches on the textures and model. Had a few issues with the code that have been sorted out. The CRY-0300 functions with external doors that open/shut and you can see the real Internals. Another feature it will have is any Kerbal inside will put on or remove their helmet depending on whether the external door is open or closed and if you are in a breathable atmosphere or not. This only works if you also have Raster Prop Monitor (RPM) Mod installed.\n\nIf you do not have RPM installed the external doors will be welded shut and the part will function like the other freezer parts, with fully working internal/pod, you just won\u0027t be able to open the doors and see inside from the outside.\n\nSo RPM will be an optional dependency.\n\nAlso I have been working on adding functionality that will integrate DeepFreeze Continued... with Kerbal Alarm Clock (KAC). \n\nSo you will be able to modify any existing KAC alarm for any vessel that has a freezer attached to automatically freeze or thaw selected kerbals based on the alarm. IE: A SOI alarm, or a Transfer window alarm. Or any alarm that you can create in KAC can have freeze/thaw events attached to it.\n\nThe way this will work is you will have to:-\n\na) create the alarm itself in KAC first (but this provides much richer features than if I built just basic alarms myself)\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) You can only modify alarms for the active vessel, but can see all alarms (through DeepFreeze menu or KAC menu).\n\nc) The Thaw/Freeze will only work if you switch to the vessel in question when the alarm triggers. \n\nSo KAC will also be an optional dependency. If you don\u0027t have KAC installed, this feature will be disabled.\n\nIt\u0027s not quite there yet, but hope to have this done fairly soon. Depending on the timing with the CRY-0300 they will either come out together in the next version or the CRY-0300 may come out in the next version and the Alarm Clock integration in the following version.\n\nStay Tuned and stay Frosty!! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T11:54:46Z","Content":"Hi All,\n\nJust an update, work is about 95% complete on Kerbal Alarm Clock (KAC) integration and the new CRY-0300 is almost complete as well.\n\nJust a few more bugs and a bit more work to do on the KAC code.
