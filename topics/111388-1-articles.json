I\u0027m currently running an Athlon 64 X2 6000\u002B (3.1GHz dual-core), which is almost the fastest CPU supported by my socket type - as you know, this is when an upgrade gets expensive - I\u0027ve just installed a new GPU, and found I need a new PSU, and I\u0027ve only got 3GB ram so I\u0027ll need more of that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus the budget for the CPU itself is about \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A3100 ($150 US Dollars).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\u0027m asking for advice is that I don\u0027t know much about multi-cores and KSP. A lot of the CPUs in my price range have much better multi-threaded performance but only marginally better single-thread performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think KSP is multi-threaded, but the physics are single-threaded? It\u0027s the physics that are slowing it down, so do I need better single-thread performance? If so I don\u0027t think my budget will produce the results I want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T16:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Matt77\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Matt77\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think KSP is multi-threaded, but the physics are single-threaded?

The problem is AMD processors have a lot less performance per core then Intel, which is fine if you have more cores and multi-thread support, but Unity 4x does not do multiple threading in API, in even Unity 5 will probably be limited in its multiple threading support. As for my graphics problems that may be because I\u0027m running linux and AMD Catalyst drivers for linux are sub-par, heck it still thinks I have a Radeon HD 7900 in there!~\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T17:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn i3 would also be much faster and good enough if you want to play only KSP in the future. An i5 isnt that much more expensive (you need a new mainboard/ram combo anyway) but it would enable you to play anything from the current console generation (so propably for about 6 years). If you are sure you dont want to play recent games in the next year the i3 would be a good choice...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI run a i5-4670K 3.40 Ghz and she cranks through KSP and most other games without a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:41:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Voidryder\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Voidryder\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI run a i5-4670K 3.40 Ghz and she cranks through KSP and most other games without a problem.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty much the fastest you can go, so that is pretty obvious \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"icecreamberni","CreatedById":130223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T05:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn i5 4460 would be nice.
