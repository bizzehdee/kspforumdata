For example I built one of my most successful Mun launchers with clustered engines. At the time it was out of necessity - I needed about 900-1000 kN of thrust for that stage, so a Skipper would have been too weak in terms of thrust, while a Mainsail would have been overkill. I ended up going with quad LV-T45\u0027s. Could have used LV-T30\u0027s for better TWR, but I needed the gimbal action for steering during launch. The result was something that was slightly underpowered and thus lost a bit more dV to gravity drag than strictly necessary, but still made orbit with more fuel left than a Mainsail variant simply by virtue of the higher Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T08:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TeeGee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TeeGee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am very intrigued by all of this and was wondering what the OPTIMAL rocket configuration is for each rocket engine and their lifting capability. \u003Cp\u003EUltimately, I want to create a chart that shows me what engines in what configuration are best to lift mass X or Y.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to check out my engine cluster calculator (see signature.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
