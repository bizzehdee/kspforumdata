Also, I noticed that in \u0022windowed\u0022 mode it doesn\u0027t have the top bar with the minimize, maximize, and close buttons. Another weird thing is that I can use my USB joystick just fine to fly the ships.\u00A0It is a clean install from this morning, but it isn\u0027t working. I run KSP off of Steam, and before this happened, I had some mods installed, such as MechJeb, Restock, Realplume, TweakScale, and a few others. I noticed that it started acting up when I installed BetterTimeWarp, when it had problems launching. I\u0027ve done multiple clean installs and none of them worked. I am running on MacOS 10.12.6 on a 2010 Mac Mini with an 8GB RAM upgrade and 256MB of VRAM. I usually play with an Apple Magic keyboard and mouse, but i have a traditional wired keyboard that I have been testing with.\u00A0I am hoping that someone finds a solution because I have nothing to do during quarantine without it and my worn-out RC planes won\u0027t fly. I will provide screenshots if required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbump\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-13T02:02:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2020 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by NanoJedi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
