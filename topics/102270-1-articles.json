And it is surprisingly quite efficient.\n\nI don\u0027t have picture of the three firsts flights (silly me) but here is a picture of the fourth one.\n\nAs you can see, this one was about solar panel and science lab.\n\n![8B22E3E5793F28D0F5AE7FBDDEDD58B181C2C607](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534013815613174175/8B22E3E5793F28D0F5AE7FBDDEDD58B181C2C607/)\n\nIn four trips, the station was complete.\n\n(For those who now how to count, yes, there is two modules missing ... I did miscalculate the rendez-vous trajectory for a couple of rockomax module. They ended burning in the upper atmosphere before reaching rendez-vous point. I\u0027ll never learn ...)\n\nThere is :\n\n- two (of four) fuel tanks.\n\n- two science modules (science lab).\n\n- two power stations.\n\n- two hubs.\n\n- tow tucker to move the parts around.\n\n![5268AE3C7BDE11B33FE4A8D0E6A82EA74ED5687E](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/534013815613164519/5268AE3C7BDE11B33FE4A8D0E6A82EA74ED5687E/)\n\nIn action the station is quite wobbly. In fact, it is rated M or PEGI-18 (or whatever is \u0027mature\u0027 content in your area) when attempting to turn it.\n\nThe last stage of the launcher is also able to come back to kerbin and land with a suicide burn (at least, someone more skilled than me can do it).\n\nOr to deploy the same station around mun or minmus (but not come back after)\n\nTo populate this station, I also created a bus version.\n\nI have to admit that this one is over-over-over-sized. 12 passengers modules is 11 too much (12\\* 16 seats is maybe exaggerated)\n\n![0BA8BC145998481CA7E1E403EF7970BA89345AFA](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/535140167158562428/0BA8BC145998481CA7E1E403EF7970BA89345AFA/)\n\n[link to the four crafts](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ts6xzwv3w5q1ev1/heavy%20lifter.zip?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T14:03:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 02:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Minarkhaios**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T20:04:28Z","Content":"Nice, can it land on those landing legs?"},{"CreatedByName":"Minarkhaios","CreatedById":58867,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T20:18:40Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know yet, previous version of this crafts doesn\u0027t have them.

The cargo will then slowly drift apart.\n\nThe rockomax module and the tucker module have full RCS control and can get out on their own.\n\nAnd the tucker (the yellow and green module) is used to move parts around an place them at the correct place (slowly)."},{"CreatedByName":"Minarkhaios","CreatedById":58867,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T08:39:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nice, can it land on those landing legs?\n\nAnd the answer is : yes, but the reactor didn\u0027t make it.\n\nThis is the second attempt. During the first one, the parachutes did break this marvellous ship into smaller parts. And the parts evolved into pretty ball of exploding gas and burned kerbals.\n\n![B19E6C61E232705FA8D534EC968ED9A2A09C9001](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/535140167160727047/B19E6C61E232705FA8D534EC968ED9A2A09C9001/)"},{"CreatedByName":"riordajo","CreatedById":139813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T12:50:43Z","Content":"Download link?"},{"CreatedByName":"Minarkhaios","CreatedById":58867,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T14:07:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Download link?\n\nadded in the first post.\n\nBeware, the creator does not take responsibility for dead kerbal and exploded rocket.\n\n(And anyone can re-use this as they want.
