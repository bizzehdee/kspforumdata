While KSP recognizes the scale sizes just fine, one of the problems I had when uploading a ship to Sketchfab was that it didn\u0027t recognize the scale settings. Now if you\u0027re creating parts just for yourself, that\u0027s no issue. If you plan to release parts and it becomes popular, at some point someone is probably going to try to upload to Sketchfab and the parts that aren\u0027t scale=1 will be the wrong size.

Generally there\u0027s no harm in having transforms in different scaling, but it took me a while to figure out that distorted unwraps were being caused by some scaling in Object mode that I had done. It\u0027s easier to just work in 1,1,1 scale transforms.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
