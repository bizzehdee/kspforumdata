This reduces the electricity generating efficiency of the plant. Since electricity is a more lucrative commodity than heat this hits their bottom line. To counter that the government would have to intervene in the market and make sure they were getting an inflated price for the heat they provide.

For a start nobody has anywhere near the level of installed PV where that could become a problem. Second of all grids can manage variability of supply just as easily as they can manage variability of demand. If was a large amount of solar power other large generators could be taken offline. If it was due to embedded generation that the grid couldn\u0027t control then the individual inverters would simply drop offline once the frequency went out of range.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also depend a lot of the other energy sources, hydro can be throttled fast, gas turbines pretty fast, coal and nuclear is slow to ramp up and down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar has a bonus in hot areas, lots of the peak use is air condition who depend on temperature so solar input follows the peaks well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T01:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enuclear is slow to ramp up and down.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUhhhh...nuclear power might be slow to get up to full power, but reactors are designed to be shut-down \u003Cstrong\u003Efast\u003C/strong\u003E.
