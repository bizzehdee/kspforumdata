I am wondering if there is anyone who would take on the project in my stead... or if there is a similar mod out there...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea goes as follows... forgive my rambling post, I\u0027ve had the idea for quite some time, but no time to flesh it out (or even write it down)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\na single persistent file would be generated to start, and a number of teams would be determined by the players.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEach player\u0027s objects would be hidden using the \u0022discovery\u0022 state of the object. If something is close enough to detect its presence then it shows up as an unknown object until the player gets a visual ID, as with asteroids.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOnce an item is no longer in view (and performs a maneuver), it returns to its undiscovered state (unlike current asteroid implementation), and this is tracked on a per player basis, perhaps in a separate section of the persistent file. it may be necessary to create phantom objects to be displayed, perhaps in that same separate section... last known position trackers for each non-allied ship? at least until a sensor is in range of the marker...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthe thermal telescope should also be able to find distant \u0022enemy\u0022 craft where there is a line of sight and no warmer celestial body in range to blot it out. you don\u0027t need radar or anything of the sort to detect a ship in a realistic space setting, the thermal signature of a ship is going to make it stand out even if it\u0027s not using its engines...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ndetection of thruster firing would be much easier and should be processed against all other players sensor \u0022networks\u0022 as they happen. ending orbital position of a thrusting ship will be easy to determine, especially if more than one sensor detected it, but a reasonably accurate estimate\u00A0could be inferred from even a single telescope. the vector engine, modeled after the space shuttle\u0027s, would be detectable from the orbit of Pluto, so ranges in KSP should have no effect on detection...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nplayers can only access their own craft\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nshould be a mechanism by which to transfer control to another player (or to take it away by force?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nturn constraints?\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nshould be methods for the players to issue turn constraints, be they by timers, action counters, or otherwise, the players should be able to pick the type of constraint among those that could be programmed in, or free to turn constraints off if they choose\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Ea separate battle turn timer/sequencer?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nif turned on, a 30-second (or other arbitrary or selectable length)\u00A0turn timer and macro recorder could be started...\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nan \u0022initiative\u0022 score (or player agreed sequence)\u00A0determines play order, and those who lose in the initiative go first\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\neach ship\u00A0plays for their length of time and their orders and maneuvers are recorded against the battle timeline\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nmacro recorder would record game events for the ship in use against the battle timeline, each participating ship would have its own timeline\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nplayers with better initiative scores then play and are able to react to the other players actions... they may be able to get into a better position as\u00A0the enemy can\u0027t react to \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0actions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthis may lead to the players/ships with lower initiative always firing first and early in their turns, though, to prevent their opponent from getting the drop on them and reducing their reaction times, but...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthe longer the battle turn, the larger the potential advantage to those with higher initiative, and the less likely the lower initiative players are to see the outcome they had seen during play of their turn\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nthe fully assembled battle sequences would be the final say of the turn, and could be saved and played almost like a movie?
