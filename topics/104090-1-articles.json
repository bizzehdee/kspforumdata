RCS Build Aid, among other things, shows you how far and in what direction your mass will shift as you drain fuel. It also shows you if your engine placement relative to your CoM is going to generate any torque and how much it will add, which becomes important as you get higher up in the atmosphere and your control surfaces start to lose their effectiveness - I\u0027ve had a couple of spaceplanes fail because of that particular phenomenon. Intake Build Aid corrects for a known issue regarding how Intake Air resources are allocated to the jets, which you can correct manually by placing each intake and jet on your plane individually - that mod lets you build as you will and then fix everything with the push of a single button - your Turbojets and RAPIERs can be operated at full power higher into the atmosphere as a result.
