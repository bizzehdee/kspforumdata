I\u0027ve heard of Claude Shannon before.\n\nI\u0027m afraid that it seems to me that solving this requires a lot of specialized background knowledge and techniques. As I said, I thought I was being silly when I originally posted the binary. I spent almost all the time looking at the hex representation. I tried compressing all the pairs into singles and then seeing if it made any sense in ASCII. I tried leaving out all pairs and looking at what was left.\n\nWhen you mentioned the clue about 5\u0027s and A\u0027s I googled cryptography A 5 and didn\u0027t get any useful hits.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 5s and As are often used as test patterns, filler, etc.\n\nBut I had already tried leaving out the 5\u0027s and A\u0027s and compressing the pairs without success, so I didn\u0027t know how to use this info.\n\nI was surprised that you posted the binary representation, but I took a look it again. I didn\u0027t see anything that was obvious enough to jump out at me after looking for a bit.\n\nI thought to myself, if he wants us to look at the binary, there must be something obvious there. I couldn\u0027t see it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Look at the occurrence of double zeroes in the string and how they relate to single zeroes.\n\nWait, what?? How would I guess to do that? That\u0027s some awfully low-level pattern recognition.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The pairs occur every 5th single digit zero, which is way to regular to be coincidence.\n\u003E Also note that because of this there are always 5 ones (or pairs of ones) between zero pairs.\n\nThis seems very unobvious to me. I can\u0027t imagine how long one would have to look at that string of ones and zeros to tease this info out of it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The zero pairs are perfectly regular compared to single zeroes. Therefore there is no intelligence there; it must be framing.\n\u003E  The single zeroes are the same; framing.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The fact that there are exactly 5 ones (or pairs of ones) per segment means that there is no intelligence to be found there either. Also framing.\n\nThis idea of \u0027framing\u0027 must be a common concept in cryptography, perhaps related to the \u0027salt the message\u0027 idea that Kuzzter referred to early on.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ignoring the framing stuff, it looks like this: 11112/21111/11112/22221/11111/21111/11112/11111\n\nI have to say that it seems to me that only a person who is experienced with cryptograms could get that out of the original message.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So we are at the point where our code is whether out high bits are one bit long or 2.\n\nAt this point, I was looking at Kuzzter\u0027s 1\u0027s and 0\u0027s block rather than the block of 1\u0027s and 2\u0027s.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What kind of code would be based on that where you wouldn\u0027t have to guess at my alphabet? Morse code.\n\nWow! That seems like serious lateral thinking to start from 1\u0027s and 2\u0027s combined with alphabet and get to Morse code.\n\nI was not able to successfully complete even one of the steps required to solve this puzzle. The real irony here is that I successfully cracked an encryption scheme for an employer of mine several years ago.\n\nThanks anyway Slashy, I had fun trying.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T15:34:02Z","Content":"I\u0027ll take a wild stab at it based on strictly the info presented.\n\n0x348 implies hex (with \u0022x\u0022 being \u0022don\u0027t care\u0022).\n\nWriting out these values as binary shows one bit high in each column, which is non-random.\n\nthe x implies that the solution doesn\u0027t care whether these bits are high, so...\n\nall of these are added \u0022or\u0022ed, and the result will be \u0022F\u0022 regardless of what \u0022X\u0022 is.
