Are you saying your batteries don\u0027t recharge with the modded solar panels on them? If so, The first thing to try is reinstalling the mod, or asking for help from the mod\u0027s author. Be prepared to supply logs and maybe screen shots of your station well-lit by the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf all else fails, I\u0027d rebuild my space station without those solar panels, and then use the cheat menu to teleport that new station from the launch pad (use lots of launch clamps to hold it still if it\u0027s not built for gravity) to \u0022rendezvous\u0022 with the old station, then use the tracking station in the space center to delete the old station. Then just don\u0027t use those modded solar panels anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor42","CreatedById":179819,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-20T22:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would strongly recommend to keep modded versions somewhere else than your steam save is, so that in case of these big problems have at least one folder of the freshest vanilla KSP as possible. If you have problems with mods try manually uninstalling them one by one until the game starts working properly again (yes this can be very long process).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-20T22:17:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2019 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Raptor42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
