In reality the earth is far more massive than we give it credit for, problems like famine and overpriced materials arise from geopolitical and economic issues, not supply and demand. For example, the earths combined food production is somewhere around 5 times the consumption of the people eating it(the rest goes to livestock to guess what...make more food), the reason 3rd world countries are starving is because most of it\u0027s grown in 1st world countries and the rest is hoarded by corrupt local governments. Another example is oil, oil is not rare, it may not be produced quickly, but there is a ton of it. While it is difficult to estimate exact numbers, we have enough fossil fuels for anywhere from 500, to 2000 years, not that we should use it for that long. Gold is also not a rare metal, and our iron supplies are unlimited compared to the demand. People are focusing on the wrong problems, the problem is not how much we have, but what we are doing with it and how it is being distributed. The earth could support many more people than we have now just fine, not to mention once a country stabilizes and becomes wealthy it\u0027s birth to death ratio becomes 1/1.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou completely missed the point.
