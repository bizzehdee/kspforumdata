An array of jammers can produce false sources preventing this from happening without the enemy sub getting close enough to be immediately detected and engaged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf torpedo aimed at a source of interference passes close enough to actual jammer ship \u003Cu\u003Eby chance\u003C/u\u003E, yes, it will be able to hit it. If it doesn\u0027t, it will try to chase the false signal and most likely not hit anything. Alternatively, you can engage active sonar on torpedo early, and hope to pass close enough to something for jamming to not matter. Then you\u0027ll hit a random ship, but you give advanced warning to the fleet to use countermeasures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo summarize, without jammers, sub can target specific ship,\u00A0such as the carrier proper, on passives, and have torpedo engage active sonar when it\u0027s too late for target to engage countermeasures. With uncoordinated jammers, each jammer makes an excellent target and can be picked out one by one.\u00A0With networked jammers, you lob a torpedo, and hope that it passes close enough to something to target it, which will be a random ship in the fleet.\u00A0Does it provide perfect protection? No. It\u0027s a carrier group, and some of the ships are basically there to take hits, because a target that big and that important is not going to be hidden in the modern world. You job is to make hunter sub\u0027s job as tough as possible, to give your hunters an advantage, or to force enemy sub to reveal itself early. Networked jamming can potentially achieve all three, while not tying your hands on employing pretty much every other method as well, including decoys. It is a pure advantage over not doing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-07T22:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223463442\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221538864151\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257091\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerekL1963\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/7/2018 at 12:15 AM, DerekL1963 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUm, no.\u00A0 Phased arrays create a beam through changing the phase of the emitted wave to create\u00A0constructive/destructive interference - that\u0027s going to be practically impossible with emitters on seperate ships.\u00A0 The distance are too great and the waveforms will have spread too widely.\u00A0 Not to mention it requires foreknowledge of the bearing of the submarine so you can point the \u0027beam\u0027 in it\u0027s direction...\u00A0 And unless the submarine is head on to the apparent direction of the beam, the towed array will clue the operator that the body arrays are being jammed or vice versa.\u00A0 Plus modern sub sonars are really\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0good at looking down precise bearings - if the sub isn\u0027t looking down the bearing of your beam it\u0027ll likely not even notice it\u0027s there.\u00A0 (Not to mention sonar analysis is just a bit more sophisticated than \u0022hey, there\u0027s a noise over there\u0022.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven if this worked, it only does so if the submarine is far enough away that standard beamforming can\u0027t resolve individual ships...\u00A0 Which means you\u0027re replacing the undifferentiated noise of the fleet with the undifferentiated noise of your jammer.\u00A0 Still good enough to get a missile to the point where it\u0027s radar can take over.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s why pretty much everyone has concentrated on decoys and passive masking systems (like pillenwefer), jammers don\u0027t actually work that well.\u00A0 (Jamming works on radar (and is much more complicated than \u0022make a lot of noise\u0022), but passive sonar operates on different principles.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJamming works pretty well against active detection like radar and sonar who rely on an return signal. canceling out the signal would be very hard its easier just to distort it so it give false positives and distort your actual location.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes you can turn off the radar and simply aim for the jamming that until its turned off to.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgainst passive detection its rarely work well it tend to make you more visible.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne exception is against ambient, some use of bioluminence is for sea creatures to be brighter from below this makes them harder to spot as they block sunlight from below.

Alternatively, if there were at least a few subs that shared their raw acoustics data in real time, you could probably resolve true sources.

We\u0027re talking about two completely different scenarios here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I want to mask the fleet, hiding it entirely. I employ noise-canceling with an active array. You want to cut through it. You\u0027re looking for very specific, repetitive sound of an engine, impeller, or any other periodic noise, really, that you can lock onto. Given a slow scan of the beam, you\u0027ll eventually succeed, no matter how good my noise-canceling is. This is what I mean when you\u0027re looking for specific target in otherwise quiet background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) I want to mask locations of individual ships within a group, without giving you anything concrete to lock onto, under assumptions that you already know where the group is overall. I deploy jammers instead of noise-canceling, and network them to produce patches of high intensity in areas where no ship is located. You do \u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0have a pattern to lock onto, because noise is inherently non-periodic. Any known sources of sounds coming from ships are greatly overwhelmed by omnidirectional background of noise. And yes, even if you have a beam, you will pick up a lot of noise from all directions when jammers are used. I hope you at least know that much.\u00A0The reason you can still normally lock onto a jammer is because the beam will generally cut back some of the noise from directions other than directly from jammer. So while being jammed, what a sonar sees is noise and patches of more noise.\u00A0Hence use of an array of jammers to create false sources of high intensity. So as you scan your beam, you\u0027ll see noise everywhere, with patches of it, that you believe to be jammers, at some locations within the group. These, however, do not correspond to any physical target. At this point you\u0027ve already exhausted ability to steer the beam and to filter the signal, and they produce absolutely nothing. Short of employing active sonar, you\u0027re not going to get anything useful in this scenario.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, DerekL1963 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to learn what I don\u0027t know, but you\u0027ve already dismissed the things you don\u0027t know as irrelevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t understand the things you are claiming are relevant.

Because a modern sonar is a phased array attached to a dome and any number of additional resonators with lots of additional processing on top.\u00A0I don\u0027t know the specs of the dome. I don\u0027t know the arrangement of pickups or their relevant resonances. I don\u0027t know the software suit that goes on top of it. But none of that changes how it works. Only the quality of the signal you get and how narrow a beam you could make. And I\u0027m telling you that an ideal device, with perfect reception, and beam as tight as physical dimensions of the dome can possibly allow, is insufficient to cut through this.

Something like a flywheel qualifies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside the scope of the question are: Actual retrieval/regeneration of the energy; what will be done with the energy; acquisition of the energy in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst idea was water yes you need an good fall height but if you have an good height difference I would go for that hard to get all the energy out at once unless you have some serious engineering.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCompressed air should work well, bonus in energy release, you could make an compressed air cannon who would work as well as an black-powder one so both power density and high peak power is satisfied.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBuildable with 19th century tech, you could both power an turbine or use it for pneumatic.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy do you want an very high energy release? Ask because various systems has strengths and weaknesses.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
