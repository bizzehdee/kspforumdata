In OBS I have Game Capture set up for KSP, and when I start the preview and tab back to Kerbal it instantly crashes. However, if I dont tab into KSP the preview on OBS works.\u00A0When I analyze the OBS log it says it has a hook conflict and I should try disabling overlays and such. I disabled Steam\u0027s overlay, and I\u0027m not sure what else there is. Googling doesnt really come up with anything useful so I\u0027m stuck.
