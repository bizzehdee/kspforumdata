I have yet to see a really in-depth tutorial on how to setup and animate solar panels in Unity. I\u0027m really pretty new to modding. I\u0027ve been messing around with it for days, and I can\u0027t find any resources that can help me out.\n\nMy setup:\n\nWings3D for modeling\n\nPhotoshop for texturing\n\nUnity for animation and everything else. \n\nMy first set of solar panels are ESA ATV replica panels. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Cr8vpGE.png](http://i.imgur.com/Cr8vpGE.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![DP7vQic.png](http://i.imgur.com/DP7vQic.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![FLDieCg.png](http://i.imgur.com/FLDieCg.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![8Epof30.png](http://i.imgur.com/8Epof30.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![eCXm3uL.png](http://i.imgur.com/eCXm3uL.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![DdG0dUz.png](http://i.imgur.com/DdG0dUz.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nI just want to be able to set up sun tracking, tell Unity which part of the model is the photovoltaic surface, and setup complex animations in Unity. Rather than animating each and every component, is there a way I can set up joints that are somewhat intuitive?\n\nThanks in advance. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T01:21:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by curtquarquesso**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ven","CreatedById":109931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T03:01:18Z","Content":"I\u0027m not quite sure what you mean by the complex animations bit but here\u0027s what I\u0027ve gathered about solar panels:\n\n![wplpgLt.png](http://i.imgur.com/wplpgLt.png)\n\nThe parts rotator and those parented to it are just the panels themselves and don\u0027t do anything for the panels sun tracking abilities.\n\nIf you want to see multiple working solar panels in action (also: nearly every part in the game) , download my VSR master folder [here](http://www./download/my57w7lkxoqwsvy/VSR-MASTER.zip).\n\nThough it is 1.2Gb so... fair warning! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nHopefully this helps in some way!"},{"CreatedByName":"curtquarquesso","CreatedById":42872,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T01:17:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not quite sure what you mean by the complex animations bit but here\u0027s what I\u0027ve gathered about solar panels:\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/wplpgLt.png](http://i.imgur.com/wplpgLt.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E The parts rotator and those parented to it are just the panels themselves and don\u0027t do anything for the panels sun tracking abilities.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you want to see multiple working solar panels in action (also: nearly every part in the game) , download my VSR master folder [here](http://www./download/my57w7lkxoqwsvy/VSR-MASTER.zip).\n\u003E \n\u003E Though it is 1.2Gb so... fair warning! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E Hopefully this helps in some way!\n\nWow. Very helpful for the Unity setup. Looking through all of it now. For the deploy animation, are you able to link the panels with joints/hinges somehow, or are you animating them all completely manually?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ven","CreatedById":109931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T19:33:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wow.
