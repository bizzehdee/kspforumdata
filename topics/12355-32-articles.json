It mostly happens when the angle of attack is too steep. I have used it successfully to land on duna a few times by taking a more parabolic trajectory, or taking control about 5-10k up and slowing it down a bunch manually, then letting it take control again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main issue I have with mechjeb is its use of RCS. I need it to use RCS on larger ships so it is at the desired angle when it needs to start the burn. But when I use it, it fires the RCS until right before it reaches the angle it needs to be, then my ship wildly over shoots the angle, by up to 90 degrees, then fires the RCS continuously until it is almost at the desired angle and over shoots again, over and over again. When it fires the RCS it needs to fire it again the same amount of time in the opposite direction to come to a stop at the desired angle. It can be a bit tricky to implement in the code, but not too hard. Just note the starting angle and the desired angle, fire the thrusters towards the desired angle until half way, then reverse the thrust for the second half. That should bring it to a nice stop at the desired angle, while reaching the desired angle quickly, and save a ton of RCS fuel. This may be an over simplification because you are orbiting and the angles change as you move, but the concept is there. I would love to see this implemented in mechjeb. I may take a look at the code, I do not know C\u002B\u002B, but I do know some java and I learn rather quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-26T23:52:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2012 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by NolanSyKinsley\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waymer","CreatedById":49933,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T01:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome mod, quite useful, but I run into a problem with some ships at 20,000m or so.
