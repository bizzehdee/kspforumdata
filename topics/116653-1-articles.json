This happens in about half of my launches on certain vehicles I build, and despite the number of mods I have currently installed I can confirm this did happen to me long before I started using anything, and I am certain this is not a mod related issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve said, I haven\u0027t really been having a problem with it, but I supposed it was a bug nonetheless. However recently I\u0027ve been launching directly upwards (to set up my orbital network for RemoteTech2), and I figure this change in my ascent trajectory has caused this bug with the Launch Clamps to really start to interfere with my game, as when they appear near my vessel they will crash into parts of the ship, forcing me to revert to launch and try again, hoping it doesn\u0027t happen again.

However I\u0027ve had past experiences with both of them either destroying the launch pad as soon as the physics loads or having multiple engines break off their fuel tanks.
