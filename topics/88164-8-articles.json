The only caveat I would like to see is that sandbox kerbals all have the same stats, and only career/science kerbals level up. That would make sandbox craft interchangeable between saves and between players, while they wouldn\u0027t be otherwise (if you build a ship and a kerbal gave you extra delta-v or something else so that it barely makes it into space, you might not be able to fly that craft into space without the same kind of kerbal on board). It also makes sandbox act the same as a \u0022completed\u0022 career, which has been the philosophy so far.
