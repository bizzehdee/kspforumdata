Rescued by a low caste, childless family and raised as their own. The baby grows up to be a skilled charioteer and to the anger of the high warrior caste, more skilled than them in archery despite being only 12-13 years old. Since lower caste is not allowed to bear weapons, he is accused of \u0027stealing\u0027\u00A0 knowledge. He was ridiculed and bullied all his childhood and finally had enough. He left the country and through several hardships, earned the knowledge he so desperately sought.

But since he was raised as a higher caste warrior, he got the favor of everyone around him. He got the best education and the favor of his teacher who taught him archery, among other weapons. He was taught by Gods just so he could be the greatest archer in the world. He did not earn any of it, he was just pushed because he was born to a higher caste and had a moderate amount of talent.
