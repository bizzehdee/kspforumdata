At the moment I\u0027m at the point whereby I performed experiments, to get science point, just so I could researched the lab. I then put it in orbit, along with some experiments, only to find out I already maxed out those experiments. All I can do with the Lab is improve value of the experiment by \u002B0.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave I been using it wrong, or was it inserted into this update to get ready for a bigger purpose, i.e. fulfilling contracts with pharmaceutical companies for developing new medicines or engineering firm for researching new consumer materials? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you would see bigger returns in late games where you use it as a landing craft on other planets, but I thought it was intended to be a skylab type module initially.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T07:56:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got the lab module and took it to Minmus, where I then proceeded to run around on EVA scooping up soil samples and processing them in the lab for points. I\u0027m unlocking enough science that I shouldn\u0027t have to bring any of it home. Not a big deal considering how easy it is to recover from Minmus, but it serves as an excellent proof of concept for my future M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T08:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very useful on interplanetary trips as you can store experiment results and then reset the experiments.
