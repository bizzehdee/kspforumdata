If I mess up on my controls by over rotating or something and get told that I need to start over, whenever I try reverting the flight back to the start, all my control keys go unresponsive. I can still rotate the viewer, use Esc. and what have you, but throttling and anything of the sort stops working. I have to end the scenario completely and then re-enter whatever training I\u0027m in to be able to do anything. Not a huge issue obviously, just something a bit annoying, as the revert feature appears to be pretty useless entirely for me at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas wondering if I missed a setting somewhere, or if there is some interaction with my lap top (Dell Latitude E6430, Windows 10) that I\u0027m unaware of that is causing this to bug out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is appreciated.
