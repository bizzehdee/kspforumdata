Stock requires very specific parameters for planes to fly and so does FAR too \u003Cstrong\u003EBUT\u003C/strong\u003E stock doesn\u0027t take things like wings into consideration so every time you fly, you are pretty much trying to push a cylinder against the air and get some lift out of it (protip: you won\u0027t unless you go really fast, even in real life). FAR on the other hand correctly computes wings and the lift they should provide. The easiest way to notice this is that in FAR you can actually fly forward without going up or down whilst pointing your plane at nearly 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, this is impossible in stock, you need your nose to aim a bit up for it to work unless you give your wings some pretty obvious incidence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, add the following factors against stock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If it doesn\u0027t have canards (or other dirty tricks like hiding control surfaces in the fuselage), you are in for eating up all the runway and a very difficult landing because you won\u0027t have enough pitch authority\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Infiniglide: Even if it has been somewhat reduced, it\u0027s still noticeable on slow flying craft and can definitely screw up an approach by giving you more speed and making you unable to land unless you wait it out without touching anything and watch the runway\u0027s end getting closer and closer in the meantime. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-No benefit from fairings, nosecones and cargo bays: Parts inside other parts still produce drag and can throw your craft off-balance or simply kill its efectiveness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Unintuitiveness: This is pretty much the consequence of what I have mentioned until now. Stuff just doesn\u0027t behave as one would expect it to until you get used to the fact \u003Cstrong\u003Ethat stock doesn\u0027t actually reflect how things behave when flying\u003C/strong\u003E. Most people see the SPH and try to create a simple plane and it -won\u0027t- work for a reason or another (messed up CoM, too little control, won\u0027t take off, etc) and it stays like that until they throw away all they know about how stuff flies and relearn it again. You know, most non-airplane-savvy people probably would try something they saw on the internet, a picture of a fighter or a small cessna or something like that, and those won\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RHDUd1H.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RHDUd1H.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ea RATO \u0022paperplane\u0022 flying with FAR\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Now I need to add winglets to my rockets\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really.
