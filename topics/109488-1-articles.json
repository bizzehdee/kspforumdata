Sometimes this is a problem for things that have a much lower heat tolerance of 1200 degrees. On those occasions I\u0027ve attached a small girder as the first item to then mount everything else to. But usually it is not a problem. Especially since heat transfer happens much more slowly and spreads out among connected parts, so it\u0027s unlikely that any single internal part will accumulate enough heat to be a risk.\n\nA very sharp fairing reduces drag alot more than a blunt fairing, and I suspect this is related to how much heat is produced. So make your fairings sharp like this to reduce drag and hopefully also reduce heat generation: \n\n[http://i.imgur.com/vouXq09.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vouXq09.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Baythan","CreatedById":18815,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T11:53:25Z","Content":"The biggest issue I have seen with using fairing and aerobraking is that they have so little drag that you might not slow down appreciably.

Thus, fairings both keep the parts inside from producing drag (assuming that now works as intended) and protect them from reentry heat. As AaronLS says, however, the fairing itself will heat up to some extent. This usually isn\u0027t a problem, though, because they were designed for this.\n\nThe thing about aerocapture/aerobraking, though, is that you don\u0027t have to do it all at once. All you need to do on the 1st pass is just capture into a closed orbit, which can be highly elliptical. You can then bring your Ap down more to where you want it on subsequent passes. If you do it this way, then you don\u0027t have to dig as deeply into the atmosphere on any given pass, so you spend less time in the air and the air you\u0027re in is thinner. Thus, no worries about heat.\n\nAs Baythan says, though, ALWAYS quicksave prior to making any aerobraking pass. If you don\u0027t like the results, quickload, tweak your Pe up or down a little as needed, and try again. And I, also, can\u0027t wait for an updated Trajectories mod to save a lot of this hassle ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:16:05Z","Content":"I can confirm that fairings do work very well to keep heat off the payload. I\u0027ve just done a launch of a tiny-size probe on a small size launcher which got a bit too fast and horizontal too soon, to the point where the fairing popped up an overheat bar that filled past 50% by orbit, and the fairing itself started glowing red (the object itself, not the hover temperature gauge). On arriving in orbit, I turned on the temp overlay, and the fairing and lower stage were bright yellow. On jettisoning the fairing, the probe inside it was deep red (the coldest visual from that overlay), only the decoupler attached to the fairing base, and the probe\u0027s engine had started to get hot (via conduction), and they were colder than the lower stage, fairing base, and fairing.\n\nConduction was getting the heat in, but very slowly, despite the shell glowing red without any debug overlays enabled. Fairing was char grilled and extra crispy, lower stage was toasty but not well done as it was partially shielded by the fairing (it was slightly wider diameter, to accommodate radial parts on the probe). Payload was fairly cool other than decoupler and engine.\n\nI don\u0027t have exact speeds to offer, but probably 2000m/s-ish @ 30,000m on Kerbin ascent which was mostly horizontal from about 20,000m, so a long sustained period of heating. I strongly suspect that the fairing and other bits would probably melt if you tried 3000m/s deep into a thick atmosphere. They are not a substitute for a proper ablative heat shield if you\u0027re going to go for a crazy ultra-fast aerobraking entry, but they will give a lot of protection to more vulnerable components inside them.\n\nThey work very well, pretty much as they should work, but they have their limits."},{"CreatedByName":"archnem","CreatedById":135259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:50:32Z","Content":"Awesome.
