Recently it\u0027s the aerodynamics and re-entry heating that have been massive changes that alter how we fly our missions. For me, though, what has been the biggest improvement in terms of how I build and fly my rockets in 1.0, though, is the service bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many situations where I want to have small size or surface-attach components in the middle of a 2.5 m size rocket. Perhaps it\u0027s science kit, perhaps it\u0027s a probe core for an unmanned launch vehicle to add a new module to a space station or construct-in-orbit long range mission, or maybe a bit of extra RCS fuel. It\u0027s so good to have a structurally rigid container that I can fill with all that sort of junk ... er I mean essential equipment. My rockets now don\u0027t look like they have had a warehouse full of junk stapled to the sides of them, and I can do heavy duty unmanned launch vehicles with mid tech tree kit that don\u0027t end up like limp spaghetti.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest issue I have with the service bays is that they make struts and fuel lines a ......

Service bays nicely solve a problem that\u0027s been annoying me in KSP since forever: the lack of a 1.25m probe core until you\u0027re waaay up the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much every vessel I have needs to have a probe core, whether it\u0027s crewed or not, since I don\u0027t want to be at the mercy of pilot availability. However, being limited to 0.625m probe cores means that I have to play games with adapters/struts/etc. to build these ugly in-line contraptions (e.g. adapter from 1.25m down to .625, then probe core, then adapter back up to 1.25, then add struts to make it sturdy). With a service bay, I can just drop a probe core into the bay. Done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe service bays are also nicely sturdy (14 m/s impact tolerance), which make them handy for interplanetary lander probes early in career, where mass is at a premium and not having to have engines on the lander comes in really handy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T03:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^ This.
