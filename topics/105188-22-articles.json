If you find Normal mode too grindy, go into Easy mode. There is NO shame in it.\n\nThink of your favorite game other than KSP. Let\u0027s say Mass Effect for instance. Imagine if Normal and Hard modes were the same in that game, only in Hard mode you got half the XP for everything and had to do each mission (with no changes) twice.\n\nAnd Insane mode you\u0027d have to do them 10 times for 1/10th the XP.

I\u0027m now basically in the same point as I was with hard mode, but I got most of the money to upgrade the VAB basically by doing a 4 passenger sub-orbital ferry (3 missions in one, thanks to the upgraded mission control that I didn\u0027t had on hard and thus could only carry 3 passengers) and an orbital mission, testing some parts on the way. However, I\u0027m going to upgrade the tracking center first for a moon flyby that I hope I can do with 30 parts including plenty of science instruments.\n\nThe penny counting on hard mode had it\u0027s charm, but being virtually locked on lv1 buildings was becoming too limiting. I will enjoy the game on normal mode now, thanks.

Well, it isn\u0027t that small, but it\u0027s an indie game, and it\u0027s small compared to other games.\n\nCompare it to Rust. KSP is small, Rust is big. KSP costs $39.99, while Rust costs $14.99. Why?\n\nIf Squad wants KSP to be a huge success (more than it is actually), they need to lower the price. I understand that the game is fully released now, but the price should go down.

I bought it for 28, but I could have bought it for as low as 16 if I had waited for a sale. This game should be the standard $60 for a game.
