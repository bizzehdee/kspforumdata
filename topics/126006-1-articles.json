I\u0026#39;m a freshman in Physics and I\u0026#39;d like to design an experiment to measure a sphere\u0026#39;s moment of inertia except, well, I\u0026#39;m not very familiar with the concept beyond the formulas it comes with as it was not covered in class yes and in typical student fashion I didn\u0026#39;t look into it earlier. :huh:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan anyone give some ideas on how I could go about it?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeice","CreatedById":153280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T21:02:01Z","Content":"\nDo you have to *do* the experiment, or just design it? In theory it\u0026#39;s pretty simple but it might rely on some quick stopwatch-fu.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe most basic way is to measure its time taken to roll down a ramp. In general, objects with a higher moment of inertia relative to their mass (eg. hollow tubes) will accelerate more slowly down the ramp than objects with a low one (eg. spheres). This is because it takes more torque to make them spin, and the speed of their spin is directly related to the speed they roll down the ramp.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt a first look, I = (m*r^2*t^2/2d)*(g*sin (p)-2*d/t^2) \u003Cbr\u003E\nwhere r is the radius of the object, \u003Cbr\u003E\np is the angle of the ramp,\u003Cbr\u003E\nt is the time taken to roll a distance d along the ramp.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou should be able to check this for yourself with a force balance on a ball on a ramp, taking into account a force from the ramp on the sphere pointing up the ramp which induces the angular acceleration. DISCLAIMER I haven\u0026#39;t checked this so thoroughly - the principle is right but no guarantees on the math.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT with better maths.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther experiments to measure this will generally involve the same principle - applying a force which causes the object to both spin and accelerate in a direction, then measuring its linear acceleration and using it to calculate the angular.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T22:35:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jeice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T21:43:21Z","Content":"\nI have to perform it as well so stopwatch-fu here I come.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI used the conservation of energy actually, and used the formula mgh = (1/2)(Iw^2 \u002B mv^2) where h is the highest point of the incline and v is the velocity at the bottom.
