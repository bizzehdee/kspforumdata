Not only is this a game I have dreamed about for quite a long time, but the community in general is far and above the nicest I have had the pleasure of becoming part of in a very long time.\n\nI am a 46yo computer engineer who does sound editing for a hobby. In addition I worked for Bioware for 2 years as an \u0027unpaid\u0027 core tester for SWTOR. That was a fun, yet frustrating experience. One I have to say I don\\\u0027t have any desire to repeat...at least not with a major publisher.\n\nI have been an avid gamer since the C64 days, and my favorite games were \u0027Project Space Station\u0027 \u0026 \u0027Buzz Aldrin\\\u0027s Race into Space\u0027. You can imagine how excited I am for this project then!\n\nWell, I wont bore you anymore other than to say you guys are great (both the dev\\\u0027s and the community) and I look forward to getting to know you all better!"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkthespy","CreatedById":7644,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-10T23:25:33Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Exploding!\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Monkatraz\n\nAvid RP Forum Poster\n\nHad to do it Slunky...:U"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T03:35:53Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Forums!\n\nHappy Launching!\n\nArrr!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T03:59:56Z","Content":"Make yourself at home ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
