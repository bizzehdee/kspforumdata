Apparently to move the ship the current vessel position is taken and then krakensbane is moved to a new position based on old vessel position and and a jump distance based on the warpdrive operation. If this is working in a kerbol relative coordinate system wouldn\u0027t it be enough to just add the speed (multiplied by physics step) of the object I currently orbit to the ps vector in line 314? I guess if I am within the SOI of a moon this would actually be needed to be applied recursive to apply the speed of the planet too.\u003Cp\u003EThe thing I actually really like about this warp drive is the ability to make small precise course correction and directly see the new orbit (compared to the one from KSPI (last used version: KSPInterstellar-v0.11)), so enforcing a minimal throttle setting really does not sound appealing for me. Unfortunate without further guidance hints its very hard once the relative speed is low and the dirty old tricks like gravity adjusting extremely close to the sun and via extreme but precise (mechjeb landing guidline information) aerobrake maneuvers do no longer work because in both cases the ship is converted into a fiery ball of molten plasma :-), so precise control is more important than ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo really understand it you need to know the history behind krakensbane and why we have it. When other planetary bodies were added to the game and you tried to travel large distances, the velocity vector of each individual rigidbody (part) in your ship were subject to floating point errors. The further away you got from the origin of the scene the more pronounced the errors. This caused the pieces of your ship to be headed in slightly different directions at slightly different speeds due to these errors piling up - the original kraken slap. Which is what put me onto using Krakensbane to move our ship rather than setposition. As what the old kraken did sounded a lot like what was happening to our warp vessels. So Krakensbane, once your velocity goes over 750 m/s your ship becomes the center of the scene and the world moves around you. Everything moves in relation to your ship. You can see krakensbane being used as designed by the game when you change SOI (that\u0027s the G spike on scene changes). When the warp drive offsets the krakensbane frame we\u0027re offsetting the rest of the game space around the local physics frame and we do this repeatedly in real-time... this is obviously not how krakensbane was intended to be used. As a result we get some strange stuff like warping backwards at low throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESerino and I originally started with what you were thinking... it didn\u0027t work. KSP does some goofy stuff behind the scenes to create the illusion that you\u0027re moving through space in an intuitive way. You \u0022are\u0022 but the way the game is doing it is certainly not that simple unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do want to look into it. I\u0027m hitting my busy season at work though so no promises. Right now my thought is set the minimum speed for the warp drive to say, 25,000 km/s. As soon as it turns on you go at least that fast. That should solve a lot of the backwards warping problems. When I have a bit I\u0027ll sit down and find the number where the backwards warping stops and set it just a bit higher than that. Then push it along if the tests go well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use this warp drive similarly to how you do, but I use the Angular Momentum mode and did a lot of the tests in that mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T03:46:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by helaeon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Storywalker4","CreatedById":92821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T05:11:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIDEA (although other mods do this, they aren\u0027t balanced against your mod, and are kinda cheaty because of it) : Jumpdrive.
