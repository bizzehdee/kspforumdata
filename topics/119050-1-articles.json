Go into IVA. Attempt to use the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpected behaviour: POV zooms in and out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActual behaviour: POV does not zoom in and out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorkarounds: Use the mouse wheel, duh. But this is not a good workaround, since only people who actually want to bind zoom to something other than a mouse (ie, those using a HOTAS) will have this problem in the first place, so this workaround does not actually help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile on the topic of input, missing input binds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Focus IVA window (would be nice to be able to hit a key/button to auto-focus on the IVA window currently in the middle of the view)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Trim adjustment. Still. LOL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
