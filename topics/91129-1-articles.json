Once I picked up and started using RCS Build Aid, I realised my instinctive placement was always very close to good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut lately I started using the RCS Build Aid to try and make my station components, and started making them as close to torque-less as I possible could.

If you have enough reaction wheels, getting the RCS accuracy perfect is not essential. But if you don\u0027t need to add reaction wheels, you can save on the stations part count- RCS ports are physicsless, and don\u0027t add to lag, I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T10:12:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat depends entirely on your usage scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using RCS for attitude control (turning), then whether or not your thrusters are closely balanced is largely irrelevant. However, if you\u0027re using RCS for translation (lateral shifting) without turning the craft, such as is required for docking, then unbalanced thrusters will induce a rotation when you don\u0027t want to rotate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you\u0027re building space station sections, I\u0027m going to assume that you want to launch them part-by-part and dock them together afterwards. Therefore I\u0027d say yes, having a torque level as small as possible is good for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somtaaw","CreatedById":109192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T10:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is an older set of images of my station, but shows the general idea I had, which is correct street. It\u0027s entirely modular, flown up in sections of approximately 30-50t pieces that total under 50 parts, and then docked together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8UPp2Dg.png\u0022 alt=\u00228UPp2Dg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lEew8gm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lEew8gm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of these were done both pre-MechJeb, and pre-RCS build aid, so things like RCS were eye placed. Now I\u0027m starting to redesign, both to reduce part count, and increased effiency. If you look closely on the first station shot, each of my designated \u0022fuel hubs\u0022 is actually 2 subcomponents, each subcomponent having 2 ASAS modules and 2 RCS thruster rings on either end near the docking clamps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally designed when I wanted as little color as possible on my station, but I realised the price I pay in performance, so I\u0027m redesigning to second generation fuel rings with 1 Rockomax orange tank, which coupled with the need for reduced clamps and RCS, have reduced the fuel hub part count by almost 50%. I\u0027m grabbing the new fuel hub picture off the laptop I use to actually play KSP while I\u0027m nominally supposed to be doing work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somtaaw","CreatedById":109192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T10:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond generation fuelhub, will be built using EPL, directly at the station.
