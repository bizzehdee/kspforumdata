(Admittedly, I haven\u0027t designed many planes, but I\u0027ve done a couple so far.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, though, I end up with a rocket that\u0027s just too darn stable \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC too much drag at the back, I guess \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC and it\u0027s incredibly difficult or impossible to achieve a decent ascent profile. It just keeps going straight, even if I start trying to push it down to the desired pitch (e.g. 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA) right from the launchpad (since SAS is nerfed and all I have is thrust vectoring).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried adding control surfaces like the AV-R8 pivoting winglet, but almost universally, what I end up with is not control, but a rocket that\u0027s oscallating wildly instead whenever I try to use SAS or MechJeb SmartASS. I\u0027ve tried various arrangements \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC near the CoM (laterally and/or longitudinally), or far from it; I\u0027ve tried horizontal with only pitch enabled plus vertical with only yaw enabled; etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost inevitably, I end up giving up and going back to just thrust vectoring and/or just settling for a sub-optimal ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m wondering, is there a general rule of thumb for how to place these (or what settings to use, or how to use them in flight) in a way that won\u0027t cause a rocket to freak out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T20:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe place them high up at the top?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr-Drunk","CreatedById":132802,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T20:14:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat oscallation you\u0027re noticing tends to happen when the rocket is simply traveling too fast trough the lower atmosphere.

If you can keep your speed around 140m/s bellow 10km you should be just fine on that regard. As for where to put control surfaces... Well in making sure your ascent speed is optimal I find that control fins on the bottom of the rocket work just fine.

In my previous game, I recall I would often launch straight up until about 300 m/s (to have enough velocity to hold my vector), then pitch them to about 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, sometimes even 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (depending on their flight characteristics), and then just let go of all controls. They would slowly, slowly tip closer to the horizon (as their prograde vector changes and pulls their nose onto the new heading) and I got true gravity turns (as far as I know). But I guess the difference is, I was using a much higher TWR, so I needed a much lower starting pitch in order to properly gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E Ah, no, I checked my notes. Turns out I would go straight up only to clear the tower (if any), then pitch over to ~70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA using SmartASS, maintain that until 350 m/s, then set SmartASS to \u0022SVEL\u002B\u0022 or just turn it off and the nose would follow my velocity vector. My actual vector would drop below 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA because I was too slow for the atmosphere to hold me on a steady path over my (top-heavy) rocket wanting to pitch over, but that\u0027s fine, since I was really aiming for a 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA or lower pitch anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I think I answered my own question: Enabling FAR DCA assist will kill the oscillations because it dampens control input at high velocity, which is where the oscillations occur.
