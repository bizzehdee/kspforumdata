Having extra fuel on them to help with making a return rondaview would go a very long way to convince me that you haven\u0027t just chucked it into space and forgotten about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) No pilot purchase. When your dead your dead. We should be able to rescue a few pilots hear and there but i doubt we shall ever produce a colony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) No contract skipping. Canceling a contract is different and allowed as it has a financial penalty and sometimes you might just take a contract to unlock a part you need for another mission but clicking the X on a mission you dont like the look of is just cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) only one launch per turn. Some missions may need multiple launches that require the next player to continue where you left off. An exception to this is placing a target on the pad as to help guide you back home. This can be done when your over the 30K mark and helps hugely with guiding you back home. Using and empty decopler on the pad results in an explosion but yes you can place a target on the pad at launch time too, It just needs to be 2 parts and have some mass to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) No double seating. After you have flown a mission You must wait for another player to fly before taking the seat again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm more of a stock player myself but see no reason why you cant use a mod just as long as the save can still run in a stock version afterwards.

Im not sure what will be good enough for a 10 at this stage or even how I might judge it without a video. My thoughts are to test the craft made and compare it to what you have done. Some craft are just impossible to fly so may score high for just not killing everyone. Recovering from an accident would be a great way to score points hear but then your likely to lose some in other areas for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBonuses\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 SemiBull = Landing just off the center of the landing pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 BullsEye = Landing exactly in the center of the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 Deadeye = Landing in the center of the pad from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 Cleaner = Returning a craft/part left by someone else but only after your primary mission is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 VomitComet = Making a flight with no chance of using SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-2 Junker = Some part of your craft was not recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-10 Destroyer = Crashing a perfectly good craft or trying to land on a building and breaking it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-15 Killer = You ended a pilots life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm sure there shall be more so if you can think of a reason your flight deserves extra points then you should state it in your report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELeaderboard\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) 14 - MPink - Mission 001\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBare with me as i do the 1st mission to demonstrate. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E humm so you cant make double posts and self bump your own thread now then.
