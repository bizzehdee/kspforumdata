You could also turn on unlock parts in the difficulty settings so you have to research tech nodes with science and then buy individual parts before you can put them on a craft (I think this is to simulate tooling the manufacturing processes, buying blueprints etc.) which adds to the cost of progressing through the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
