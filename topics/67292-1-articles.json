The only point I can think of are so that you can say you have a 64-bit computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, smashing some strangers computer counts as vandalism\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T16:51:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nemrav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nemrav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell, I only bought my laptop (and one of the latest models) less than half a year ago, and it only has 4gb ddr3, so 64bit is pretty useless to me. \u003Cp\u003ENOT EVERYONE OWNS A GAMING DESKTOP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand since most developers thankfully have that in mind they don\u0027t make 64bit a requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eotherwise yes, it improves performance but can be a little hastle for one of the smaller benefitial optimisations....\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be frankly shocked if your laptop is not 64-bit, both in processor and operating system.
