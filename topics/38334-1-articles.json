You know that the thrust is given by F = PA. But you can also derive thrust from exhaust velocity. F = vm\u0027, where m\u0027 is the mass flow rate equal to Av\u00C3\u00C2. In other words, PA = F = \u00C3\u00C2Av\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. For an ideal gas, you can also express density in terms of pressure. \u00C3\u00C2 = PM/(RT), where M is molar mass of the gas, 0.044kg/mol for CO2. So we have PA = PAMv\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/(RT). Or v\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 = RT/M. Of course, you should keep in mind that temperature is going to drop as pressure does, with PV\u003Csup\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B3\u003C/sup\u003E remaining constant if the contents are just gas.
