I really can\u0027t for the life of me figure out what\u0027s going on the item was centered in blender and unity it is only once it came into KSP it decided suddenly it\u0027s not, its getting mildly infuriating. the item has an animation, not sure if that\u0027ll have anythign to do with it, and I have tried moving it around in unity, i have also tried completely recreating the unity file, re importing it from blender, pretty much everything i can think of and it just always does this no matter what.\n\nany one have any idea or has seen this before? I\u0027m headed to sleep now but if anyone has a clue please reply I am in desperate need! thank you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T03:42:23Z","Content":"KSP uses 0, 0, 0 as the center of a given part, and it looks like you made your part far away from Blender\u0027s origin."},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T04:35:05Z","Content":"maybe related to this...\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114059](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114059)\n\nbe sure to check the transforms of the part heirarchy before export.\n\nroot object with PartTools script should be 0,0,0 Position and Rotation, 1,1,1 Scale; this is relative to World coordinates. children objects\u0027 transform are relative to their parent coordinate, not the World coordinate.

I was only checking the location of the part itself, not the location of the part tools game object, that was what was causing it, I will remember that for future reference, it had confused me because after a problem like this but less severe with a previous part which was actually caused by what Sumghai suggested I had been extra careful to create my part at 0,0,0 of blender.\n\nall solved now just need to get the connection nodes back to the right place ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n![tumblr_nm0rcvd07l1r0o48lo1_540.png](https://41.media.tumblr.com/18445e6bf0d3f445503aa270cc137d45/tumblr_nm0rcvd07l1r0o48lo1_540.png)\n\nreally chuffed with that seriously thank you, now i just need to work on the texture a bit more and make a stock-a-like one too ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) thanks again!"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T15:05:55Z","Content":"![tumblr_nm15tgu5Kk1r0o48lo1_540.png](https://40.media.tumblr.com/3834f77d8ce55276f895d596a0205aeb/tumblr_nm15tgu5Kk1r0o48lo1_540.png)\n\ndone the textures as much as I can be bothered to for now, pretty happy with it considering its my 3rd 3d model that I have ever made and also the 3rd part for KSP ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) thanks again, it all works perfectly now, apart from one encounter with the kraken when i loaded a quicksave where the doors were clipping through some rocket nosecones from side mounted rockets :\\"}]}
