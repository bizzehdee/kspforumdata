Just a quick question. Ive just deorbited to return to kerbin yet I didnt slow down? As I came thru the atmosphere I had the flames appear as usual with my parachute ready to deploy except all the way to ground impact the flames remained burning and I just got faster? By the time my parachute deployed it was just to late. Anyone else have this issue before?"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T14:57:39Z","Content":"Sounds like you were grossly too steep."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:05:38Z","Content":"You were entering too steeply. Also, when you enter the atmosphere with a command pod, tilt it about 15 degrees upwards. This will create lift and you will lose more of your velocity in the upper atmosphere.\n\nEdit: like this: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry#/media/File:Apollo_cm.jpg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry#/media/File:Apollo_cm.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"tranenturm","CreatedById":143304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:16:55Z","Content":"The latest update thinned out the air, so you don\u0027t have enough drag to slow your ship down before \u0022landing\u0022. To reentry successfully you need to come in shallow to burn as much speed off as possible. When I come in I usually set my periapsis for about 25,000 m. This is high enough to hit plenty of atmosphere so that I don\u0027t go explody, but low enough that I capture. This value has plenty of play in it and is also dependent upon mass of your reentry vehicle.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAlso. If you\u0027re doing early career, a mistake I first made was going straight up on an early launch. If the launch goes high enough, more explody on the return. So just angle those early launches."},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:30:14Z","Content":"\u003E Also.

Ive had this once before in 32bit (I use windows 64bit and thought that may be why) however I have re entered perfectly before in 64bit. I will send a test craft up later today to try re entry again and report my findings.\n\nThankyou all again ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T17:02:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...all the way to ground impact the flames remained burning and I just got faster?\n\nCertainly, entering too steep can cause reentry problems post-1.0, but this sounds wrong. The typical symptom of entering too steep is that you overheat and explode long before you get to the ground, in my experience. Certainly you shouldn\u0027t be *accelerating* as you get down to ground level.\n\nBy any chance are you running any mods that tinker with aero, such as FAR? Over the past month or two, I seem to recall occasionally seeing people post questions here with symptoms such as you describe, and IIRC it often turned out that they were running some sort of mod that didn\u0027t play nice with the new aero.\n\nJust a thought.

I deleted that file but alas nothing changed. I uninstalled FAR and hey presto it works again (I am using 64bit windows 1.0.4) but now ive lost the atmosphere graphical flame effect?
