Just a quick question. Ive just deorbited to return to kerbin yet I didnt slow down? As I came thru the atmosphere I had the flames appear as usual with my parachute ready to deploy except all the way to ground impact the flames remained burning and I just got faster? By the time my parachute deployed it was just to late. Anyone else have this issue before?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T14:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you were grossly too steep.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou were entering too steeply.

To reentry successfully you need to come in shallow to burn as much speed off as possible. When I come in I usually set my periapsis for about 25,000 m. This is high enough to hit plenty of atmosphere so that I don\u0027t go explody, but low enough that I capture. This value has plenty of play in it and is also dependent upon mass of your reentry vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso.
