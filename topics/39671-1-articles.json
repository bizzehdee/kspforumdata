When throusters are on the on the bottom it\u0060s easier to control your vessel. I dont find any reality in this move but it works fine for all my skycranes. You can build longer arms and add some radial engines but its important to attach them below center of mass or on the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T17:07:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, Ahmed has the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, the game does not take in consideration the CoT\u0027s position relatively to the CoM for gimbals calculation, so if your CoT is above, like it is here, is above your CoM, the gimbals will all be inverted. The only way to fix it is to lock the gimbals on all your engines or to drop the CoT below the CoM and make sure it stays there over time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"calkurne","CreatedById":42098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T18:01:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edon\u0027t bother with angled engines, they don\u0027t help with stability and instead just reduce your \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV. try adding a RCS system to the craft (depending on where you\u0027re trying to land) or ad wiglets to the sky-crane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kidneythump","CreatedById":62038,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T20:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help everyone! when the COT went under my COM everything worked fine, didnt even need RCS for stability, my Duna Base says Thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/maFYs70.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022maFYs70.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
