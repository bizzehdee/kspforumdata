It cannot reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI knew what I was up against. I had been losing for two days straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFact: Computer had better moves than me. I\u00A0could not even win after reversing my moves and replaying them!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Reasoning: If I cannot outsmart it, I will overwhelm it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Strategy: I used a knight to kill two pawns before it was killed, without taking more losses. After that I outnumbered the computer even though it still had high value pieces. I simply started attacking every high value piece I saw, since attrition only worked in my favor as I had numbers. In the end I had to reverse a bad move twice but I actually won for a change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApplication To AI versus Human space combat:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf forces are roughly equal, humans should win most all the time. Since humans can think beyond what they already know...and AI most certainly cannot. It lacks common sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example....if I were to link ten chessboards together, with ten white chess piece armies ran by humans VERSUS ten black chess armies ran by supercomputers and the chess pieces can move freely between boards....I would bet the humans would win provided they were reasonably good though not expert chess players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince a computer cannot see past good moves and will avoid bad ones, which can be self defeating if it begins suffering from attrition and gpod opponent offense and overwhelming numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real issue with AI versus human space combat is that the forces will NEVER be equal unless you make it so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike I know one scifi author who does not use AI combat because:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: Story could not happen otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: Higher races somewhat involved\u00A0with the war like to hack and block signals to drone or AI spacecraft a lot. So that both lower races duking it out are paranoid over using drones lest they lose control over them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Inertial dampeners means manned vessels can keep up with drone craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly I do not like any of the reasons except number 1. Since there\u00A0are various good work arounds regarding reasons 2-3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my conclusion is this, realistically the best chance any human space force has against an AI space force is if they have:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Overwhelming numbers so they can use attrition to beat the so smart it cannot make bad moves AI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Throw unfamiliar situations at the AI that it has no answer for other than doing what it was programmed to do, which will lead to it\u0027s defeat and mislead it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf humans cannot do either one they will lose....because while it is possible to out think a computer,I dare say it\u0027s easier to just overwhelm it and force it to attempt what it cannot do....reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-01T23:05:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2021 11:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-02T00:28:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder what scenario is this space war taking place?

Because of this it can be incredible precise beyond any would be chess grandmaster. This is purely due to the nature of the problem and the speed of a computer. For comparison the best chess players\u00A0in the world hover around 2800 elo, or the \u0022super GM tier\u0022. If your anything above 2500 you\u0027d probably be on of the 2k grandmasters \u003Cstrong\u003Ein chess\u00A0history\u003C/strong\u003E.

You\u0027d hope for a glorious draw, nevermind actually winning the game that just isn\u0027t possible even if you get every chess grandmaster in the history of the game helping you at the same time. The AI has\u00A0no blind spots, the game has no luck, it see\u0027s too far in the future and calculates to many positions\u00A0 too fast. Another statistic is even the best grandmasters can compute one or 2 positions a second, your\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ephone can calculate several thousand per second.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ESure the GM will only focus on sensible positions, but the best trained AI will brute force its way to victory almost every single time. Your only hope for a draw is to trick the computer\u0027s algorithm enough it accepts a draw as the best possible outcome. The only issue with this is the best chess engines are designed around accepting draws if required, as if they beat you 1 time, a draw is technically a \u0022win\u0022 in most circumstances. If its a \u0022deathmatch\u0022 and a draw would result in \u0022a loss,\u0022 it wouldn\u0027t accept and play to win, or at least play until you give up.
