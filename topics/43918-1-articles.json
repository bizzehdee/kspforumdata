RD for Reduced Diameter. I was trying to reduce the footprint from what the BLB series has using big engines. RD-BLB can barely make a 70KM orbit, but can do it without tapping the tank for the nuclear engine, which is a first time use for AARP. (Alan Aerospace, Recycling \u0026amp; Packaging)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one named Jebs Dream really should be Jeb\u0027s Nightmare Fuel. I think it began as one of the Snafu series and things kept getting added to the bottom, somewhat at random. It actually does pretty well. The MJ version was the first rocket I flew with MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Snafu 1b-crossfuel trio were tests to see which way of running fuel among the tanks would reach the highest altitude going straight up, no MechJeb. Surprisingly, it\u0027s the one with the makeshift central engine dropper. Note the use of a Small hardpoint and two pipes to get fuel past the stack separator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbaLifter puts the stock orbiter/lander that comes with KSP into orbit, with a swap out for more powerful engines on the lander so it can land on Kerbin. Many *many* fails during that design. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAARP-stock-lander-1 is AARP\u0027s \u0027parachutes are for wimps\u0027 landing vehicle. It can land from at least a 200KM Kerbin orbit and still have about half a tank of fuel left. It was developed as part of the BLB series in AARP\u0027s Munshot program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecord to date, one Mun impact and one near hit that somehow ended up in solar orbit after failing to transition to Munar orbit or getting on a path back to Kerbin. But that was with the BLB-3b! Once a more powerful lower section is built for RD-BLB (with Mainsails) to make it the RD-BLB-DR (for Done Right) a Mun landing and return should be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T10:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArchive updated with new ships. Some need the ReStock addon. I just could not get the RD-BLB upper stages to quit doing the hula so a complete redesign produced the RD-BLB-DR buuuut nothing about it is \u0022reduced diameter\u0022 now. It still hulas a bit and needs RCS on from launch because sometimes it wants to get a bit tippy. 16 big SRBs get it up to a bit over 2000 meters before the big engines kick in. It could lift without those using careful manual flying. It does have the nuke engine so it *could* take that long cruise to the Mun and other places but getting back...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERD-BLB-70K is simply the AARP lander atop a giant ReStock booster. It\u0027ll get up to a 70KM orbit and that\u0027s about it. Might be able to go some higher but not too high unless you have a way to refuel in orbit. Should work for visiting space stations for crew exchange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERD-BLB-FAIL is, as the name implies, a big, fat, FAIL of a rocket, at least when trying to fly it with MechJeb. I have no idea how the thing stays together as MJ slams the throttle up and down rapidly so hard I can see space between all the parts. How are the struts holding up to that abuse when I\u0027ve had them snap many times on other rockets just getting off the pad?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mainsail is just one #%@#% difficult engine to use, especially with MechJeb.
