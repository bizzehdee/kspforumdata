I may talk with someone to make a resized version trough...\n\nBTW, resources are finished, a guy is working on EVE configs, I\u0027ve finished the biomes for the Sarvin system and KillAshley has just polished them.

You are right, but if we would have crafted all the textures of absolutely all bodies, the mod would have been released in 10 months!

The deadly ocean moon actualy works realy well, too bad I am not allowed to post configs ... It also rotates around Keelon, because I think that Keelon should be a hardcore players.
