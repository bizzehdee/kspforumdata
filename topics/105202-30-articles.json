Especially in space.\n\nEverything has an MTBF and an appropriate duty cycle. At some point stuff breaks. Catalyst materials run out, and filters wear out. Parts are cannibalized. Duct tape is wielded with reckless abandon. This is simulated by a flat curve where, after the rated lifespan of the gear, it will begin to degrade.\n\nSo yeah... dropping a bit of complex life support gear on Eeloo that was built for a trip to the mun and expecting it to work at 100% efficiency 100 years later is a bit of a stretch.\n\nAnd yes... if you plan your trip and go to Eeloo for a 50 year trip and expect your life support gear meant for a 5 year duty cycle, you should not be surprised if things go pear shaped. Yet this would be completely self inflicted.\n\nFinal note - the third tier will be the heavy-but-effectively-infinite-lifespan version (infinite because there\u0027s a max duration on a KSP save)."},{"CreatedByName":"ModZero","CreatedById":89470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T16:45:09Z","Content":"Sheesh, after some time most materials start getting all weird, especially all your fancy plastic stuff.

One would be the idea of a time-based mechanic - basically, the inherent recyclers (the things that provide heat, cooling, scrub CO2, etc.) would have a service life.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. In addition to resources and the mechanic above, where failure is life or death, add a \u0027happiness\u0027 factor, where the Kerbals need more space and more advanced facilities to keep them healthy and happy based on ship duration. The \u0027fail\u0027 penalty for this would be separately configurable - so a Kerbal squished into a lander can for ten years may not die, but they\u0027d be really grouchy. This would be a case where the lander can is good for, say, 30 days. But then you need simple habs to extend into the several months, and for super long term stuff, you will need centrifuges (for orbital stations) as well as medical bays, etc. to keep the Kerbals kicking.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Automatic supply scavenging. If a Kerbal runs out of supplies, they can look not only in their current ship (and it\u0027s locked containers) but also other ships within a certain radius. This way, just by air dropping a bunch of supplies, Kerbals will happily EVA to pick them up. UKS already does this, but I\u0027d like it as something built into the core life support mod.\n\n#1 interesting stuff, since it involves more planning how much spare parts to bring with.\n\n#2 This would encourage long-term-trip-ships to become more massive because of additional needed parts. My first thought is that there are probably better ways to encourage this kind of playstyle. I am rather inclined against this.\n\n#3 Sounds fine, but please use as a radius one of the ranges already available in UKS since there are already a lot of different ranges for different purposes - and adding an additional different range would complicate your mods at a point where in my opinion no one would benefit from. (perhaps even put the ranges-definitions into USITools)"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T22:37:58Z","Content":"Well for clarity, there are no spare parts.
