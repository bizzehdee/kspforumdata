This basically takes a bunch of electricity (depending on the data size of the experiment\u0027s results) to add the science to the lab, after which the experiment window for the part re-opens, and you get the option to reset/keep/send the experiment data as usual. (subject to change, I bet, but currently, there\u0027s no cost other than electricity for adding the data to the lab, it\u0027s basically just your lab getting a copy of the data)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on the amount of scientists you have on your lab, and the amount of data stored in the lab, it starts to generate science points. Very little at first, like 0.03 to 0.1, but I figure a full data storage could generate somewhere between 3 and 10 science points a day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science points are stored in the lab, so once every few days, you\u0027ll want the lab to send the data back to Kerbal, where they get added to your usable pool of science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also uses up stored data while generating science points, so a full storage of data won\u0027t last indefinitely. But it will take a while to drain a lab with full data storage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting your lab full of data takes a LOT of experiments though. More experiments than a satelite in orbit would generate by itself from just orbitting, so I figure the trick is to have a lab in orbit, and have other ships/satelites collect experiment data but not transmit any of it, then dock them to the lab, and THEN process the experiment data. After that, they can send/retrieve/whatever the experiment data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcessing an experiment to add it to the lab can take a LOT of electricity as well. A small experiment will hardly make an impact on your batteries, but a 200 data experiment can easily drain the smaller and medium batteries while processing. Processing fails when this happens, and you can retry again some other time (for example, when your batteries are full, or when you have more solar panels aimed directly at the sun)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ape_Descendant","CreatedById":141181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T13:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Juicy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Juicy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EProcessing an experiment to add it to the lab can take a LOT of electricity as well. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOMG this!
