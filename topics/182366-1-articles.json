I vote we should have the option to use this equipment to build an additional planetary overlay that displays suitable sites for planetary base construction.

Such \u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003Eparts would likely be procedural in nature, and there\u0027s no escaping the need for modders to be present, if only to provide \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E-looking\u003C/em\u003E sub parts and more families of sub-parts, and more things like materials and propellants to contribute to the industrial phases of gameplay. A game is great and has long life if it is moddable, and modders make the \u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003Egame much better by not having the corporate burdens and restrictions that the game dev has as a company, by having the ideas, capacity and freedom to make something personal to themselves a reality \u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003Ein the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHoping for modders to cease is hoping for KSP to die. The limited package (parts and features) that the game dev supplies you will only remain fresh for so long if the game doesn\u0027t allow you to expand upon it. Some people can play the same game in the same state for 5...10... years, but a lot of people also rather parts, environments and timeframes that can be related to but aren\u0027t locked to what the game dev will put out, that they exist and can be picked out from somewhere and installed when ready, and not be forced to improvise with stock parts and fill in the rest with just imagination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea of hoping to lessen Squad\u0027s workload is an illusion, sadly, and should be cast away. Instead, hope for Squad to have the privilege to do their job better and to deliver the things that matter to the customer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not disagree Modder\u0027s are integral to ksp. I said loosen their work load not lessen. But that I mean SQUAD can focus on making the game better and adding more things like planets and making the surfaces more interesting instead of always having to add MOAR parts. The part editor would have procedural parts but also allow for further customization using tools to create your own part completely from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-23T01:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using this mod to level up my Kerbalnaut corps.

Resetting the tech tree everywhere you land just adds several redundant heaps of grind.
