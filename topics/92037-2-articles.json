When Kennedy announced the Apollo programme, Alan Shepard had recently completed his 15 minute sub-orbital flight aboard Freedom 7. By the end of that decade, NASA had completed Project Mercury and Project Gemini and developed the full bag of tricks needed to perform manned Moon landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want an example of an expensive long term international space project, then the International Space Station is a good example. Using a similar approach, NASA could offer seats on their Mars missions to other space agencies in exchange for a contribution to the programme. For example, the Orion spacecraft currently uses a service module provided by ESA. Another obvious option would be to use the commercial model NASA have used to develop cargo and crew transportation to the ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thinking is that once the ISS programme has run it\u0027s course, it should be replaced by a international humans to Mars programme. I would timetable one decade from programme inception to send the first crew to Mars, followed by a further decade of exploration where successive crews explore the surface and establish the best location for a permanent base. At this point, all further crews and freight would land at the base, which would perform a similar function to McMurdo base in Antarctica, allowing expeditions to be sent out to explore the entire planet. The base would then be expanded to become the first settlement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T15:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you look at delta-V maps, Mars (with aerobraking) isn\u0027t really that much further away than the moon.
