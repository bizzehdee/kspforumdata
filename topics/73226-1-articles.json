Multiply it with the albedo (reflectiveness) of MSL.

That\u0027s how many watts you\u0027ll receive from it. If you want to know whether (or when) a photon will really arrives at you, use Planck relation E = h.f = h.(c/\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BB) , assume the wavelength is on human eye peak visible spectrum (540 nm according to UBV system).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a really rough calculation.
