Taking off again is a bit easier because it\u0027s airless so you can go horizontal as soon as you leave the ground, provided no mountains are downrange. If you\u0027re on high ground at or near the equator, you can get back to a very low orbit (10-15km) with about 2800m/s, so have 3000 or more just to be safe, more if you\u0027re not on the equator, not on high ground, or want a higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR is very interesting. You\u0027ll have to burn pretty hard nearly all the way down. This means your ship loses a large fraction of its mass during descent, so your TWR will increase fairly significantly the lower you go. It\u0027s therefore possible to start with a 1.0 TWR and still land safely, relying on the TWR increasing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, the single most critical thing about Tylo is the flight profile. Because Tylo landers need so much fuel, they usually don\u0027t have a TWR in the 1.5 range or so. This is NOT anywhere near enough for a stop-and-drop landing starting from a low orbit. The gravity will pull you into the ground LONG before you kill off your ~3000m/s horizontal speed. Thus, you need to start from high altitude and expect to burn almost all the way down, so you can keep your vertical velocity under control while you kill off your horizontal velocity. But this also allows time for your TWR to increase. Thus, I\u0027ve found that if your original TWR is in the 1.0 to 1.5 range, you need to start landing from 175-200km altitude. But when taking off again, you only need 20-50km to allow some leeway above the mountains during the ensuing rendezvous to pick up the crew or refuel what\u0027s left of the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on Laythe is like landing on Kerbin--get in the atmosphere, slow down that way, and pop chutes. 50m/s and sufficient chutes is all you need. The only real trick there is that the only places to land are tiny islands so you have to be fairly good at landing within 1-2km at most of where you target.

Thanks for the info. Still, \u0022a few units of fuel\u0022, while technically more efficient, doesn\u0027t seem like a significant difference given the huge amount you need at Tylo anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigning Tylo landers is sort of a hobby of mine. I keep making new ones, HyperEditing them out there, and seeing how they work. With each new design, the testing process is to start from an orbit just above the mountains and see what happens. If it goes splat, I raise the orbit a bit and try again, repeat, until I can get it down safely. I have yet to succeed in landing from any starting altitude less than 175km and 200km seems to be the \u0022sweet spot\u0022 for most designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this has always been from a circular orbit. I\u0027ve never considered starting from the Pe of an eccentric orbit but now that I am, it seems to me this would require very careful planning to get any benefit. The greater your eccentricity, the faster you\u0027re going at Pe compared to a circular orbit at that altitude, so the more horizontal speed you have to kill off and the more fuel that requires. Thus, any benefit over a circular orbit must come in the vertical direction which would seem to be a function of eccentricity because that determines your trajectory\u0027s upwards angle after Pe. So it seems to me you\u0027d have to calculate the ideal eccentricity and the orbit\u0027s Ap and Pe for the given planet and the thrust/fuel characteristics of the specific ship you\u0027re flying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T15:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis kind of landing is possible even if you start with TWR less than 1.
