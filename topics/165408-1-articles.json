I have completed the Mun and Minmus explore contracts and have gone on to duna but I now have to rendezvous 2 vessels in orbit of Duna. I now have no less than 10 vehicles either landed on or orbiting Duna and Ike but no sign of an eve contract, is this usual? If so is there a mod that allows me to get around this and visit some other planets?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-12T00:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the system only generates one Explore contract at a time. It is technically possible to \u0022save scum\u0022 the Explore contracts, if you really want a contract. By the time you get to Duna (especially with 10 vehicles!), you should probably be rolling in funds, though -- you probably shouldn\u0027t\u00A0need contracts to go wandering off to new locations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maninthemunn","CreatedById":181313,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-12T09:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u0027t really a need for cash but more to have a purpose for going there, I also don\u0027t quite have the funds you might expect as quite a large amount has been wasted getting 100% coverage in the Kerbin and Duna systems along with some larger relays orbiting the sun between Duna and Dres.
