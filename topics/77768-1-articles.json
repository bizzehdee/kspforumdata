I imagine of the two largest complexes, one closest to the VAB may be the engineering labs, and the other, sample analysis labs. It could be that facilities differ on different floors though. Those two could also be divided into wings. Perhaps part of the building near the VAB is holds physics labs. Some floors could be dedicated to computer systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it does look like an observatory, it\u0027s not well placed. It would be more practical to have it on the mountains, above the atmosphere, and away from rocket debris dust. Though, if it wasn\u0027t for the tubey thing, I\u0027d speculate on that being the astronomy departments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last building, I\u0027m not sure about.
