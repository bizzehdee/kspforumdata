It\u0027s just meant to give a first person view of the flight. Even in the modules with controls, all you can do is push the throttle up and down. So, how do you make the inside of a craft more interactive to the player? You have them build it themselves!!!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECustom editing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you add a crew module to a ship you\u0027re building, the part\u0027s GUI has an option to go to the IVA editor. When you open the editor, it brings up a model of the part, and any modules directly attached to it (docking ports, antennae, etc.). In the parts tab, there are props that you can put onto (or build into) the inner walls of the module. Aside from an aesthetic look on the inside, the parts can be interacted with by the player in some way. For instance, you can add Velcro foot stations to hold a player in place like a seat; or wall handles that a kerbal can use to move around. If you don\u0027t really care about the inside (or you still like the old look), they take on the original IVA look if you don\u0027t edit the inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat you can do with it\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you\u0027ve edited your ship, the parts help you out in-flight. Kerbals aren\u0027t bolted to the walls anymore, and you can move from place to place in IVA mode with the arrow keys. When a docking port is added onto the ship, it adds a tunnel/hatch in the wall that you can use to move between parts. Also, different experiments in a science module now have the option to be done by hand (although doing it from external view is still an option). If you guys do decide to put oxygen, food, and water in as resources in the game, it gives the player the opportunity to interact with props that can produce it (a garden, air scrubbers, water purifier, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me what you guys think.

KSP is still in its infancy, I have a feeling complete IVA space journeys will be possible later. It\u0027s just that the game program architecture isn\u0027t complete enough yet to support all parts with IVAs, and interconnectedness. Making a reasonably sized space station would be awesome, if you can explore space from a vessel in space in a universe in a game in a computer in a room on a planet in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet squad finish the major stuff, like career mode, and game memory management; before adding something as cool, and as moderately useful, as IVA interconnectedness.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
