But this is a game, so we want to make cool stuff that would never work in real life--that\u0027s why it\u0027s so fun. Unrealistic aerodynamics, magic torque, and over-aggressive controllers make this easier. I think you\u0027ll find that every time Squad takes a step toward a more realistic simulation, some of the \u0022fun\u0022 designs will become more difficult to pull off, and whether that makes it more or less enjoyable will vary from person to person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as a proud Mechjeb user, I am amused by the number of people who say (or imply) \u0022Mechjeb is cheating\u0022 and then complain when their automatic heading controller breaks. If it\u0027s so important that your rocket automatically hold its heading during a 10-minute burn, why not let it automatically calculate and execute the timing of the burn, too? The simple truth is that flying rockets without autopilots is as unrealistic (and fun) as anything else in the game.

This leads to a sluggish response and cases where the SAS simply doesn\u0027t fight hard enough to compensate for drift caused by slight instabilities in design, even if they\u0027re so minor that old ASAS handled them perfectly - or, indeed, manual flight without an excessive amount of input.

It was high time we got our usual kick in the pants for being so complacent in a game that has been known to be rather punishing. Whatever comes to any further tweaks to the system, for now I don\u0027t see any reason to not continue our respective space programs. We may just have to forget a lot that we learned before and begin anew with how we treat SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcelsior!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell C7 has said that they\u0027re looking into the cause of the problems a few pages back, so I\u0027m pretty sure the added-difficulty isn\u0027t intentional. and the current behavior isn\u0027t what was seen in previews either, they were showing an attitude hold closer to Mechjeb\u0027s Killrot than the old ASAS, only with vastly improved use of thrust and much more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Quantum Jim","CreatedById":73360,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T18:55:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens if you just add more ASAS (or more SAS) modules to a craft?

I did a few simple rotation type tests in a 100k orbit around Kerbin and it does slow rotation and wotnot just like in C7\u0027s test video a few weeks back with his space station (though I was using a rocket), but it\u0027s just a bit too sedate as it\u0027s not using enough of the torque / RCS thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen done manually I can rotate, turn and cancel out the movement pretty quickly but when left to SAS alone it seems almost to use only as little force as necessary to try to stabilize the craft, in a way I might liken it to an old /soft joystick that doesn\u0027t return to center as quickly as a brand new stiffer / tighter one does. Perhaps all that\u0027s needed (at least for rockets) is a simple increase in the initial amount of available thrust / torque / control force that SAS uses to stabilize the craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Sinn Sinny","CreatedById":75969,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T19:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just download the update from steam - played for maybe an hour, and registered on here just to say this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now can\u0027t get any ships into orbit.
