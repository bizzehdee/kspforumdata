It has 2 turbojets in the back for it\u0027s main engines, but also a single RAPIER to kick it into high gear. Unfortunately, this does not mean this is an SSTO. But thanks to it, this baby can go past the sound barrier at sea level, and get to mach 3 before reaching 10 km. It\u0027s weaponry include 6 light missiles and 2 heavy missiles, although feel free to replace it with your own weaponry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey bindings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Start turbojets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Start RAPIER\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Switch RAPIER mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Close Intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Fire 2 heavy missiles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6-8: Fire lighter missiles (Must fire in exact order)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file coming soon...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T20:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice!
