If your orbits are closely matched (nearly identical), burn prograde a little, to make your orbit slightly larger than your target\u0027s. Key word is slightly. Be patient while the target catches up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get within about 2km, you can set the ship as a target even if you haven\u0027t upgraded your TS (tracking station). You can do that by double-clicking the vessel once it\u0027s within visual range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can switch to the other ship when you are within 2.5km, by using the [ or ] keys. However, I really recommend getting within 100m, and zeroing your relative velocity before switching to the stranded kerbal, especially if you are new to EVA, and working with the jet pack. Because that\u0027s next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Reddeyfish mentioned, you will need to EVA the stranded kerbal, and maneuver him/her with the jet pack to the rescue ship. EVA controls can be tricky if you haven\u0027t done it before.

When I did my first rendezvous there were no contracts, so it was with the purpose of docking. I remember taking about two hours to even get close. And I was like yay, almost done. Three hours later I was finally docked xD \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the others have said is completely correct. By going higher you will increase your orbital period (the time you need for one full orbit) and hence your target will start catching up. If you need to catch up to your target you need to shorten your orbital period by making your orbit smaller. For a full rendezvous and docking tutorial take a look here, it is by scott manley who is something of a KSP-guru for me ^^ I have learnt a lot from watching all his videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/St515zjUZHY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:36:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that means: Burn away from the target ship, to make your orbital period longer. after one complete orbit, the target will have caught up with you a little. on the last orbit before your target overtakes you, you have to do another burn to put you exactly ontop of your target after completing one more orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it\u0027s just a matter of arresting all relative velocity when you meet the other craft.
