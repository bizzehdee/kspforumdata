Below are 3 images. Stock KSP1, modded KSP1 and Stock KSP2. If you look at how much of the display is taken up by information the KSP2 is simply wasting it. The whole point of a UI is to give you as much information as possible, as clearly as possible and not take up the entire hud.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MpFXulv.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022502\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MpFXulv.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn first glance it seems like KSP2 is showing us way more information. In reality the only thing its showing me that KSP1 stock UI doesn\u0027t is my AP and PE. Why the hell is 30% of the screen taken up? and I cannot even see how much hydrogen is in the tank anyway. There is no other reason to click on a tank other to know how much is in it. There is no reason for it to be in the parts manger. Sorry this is simply bad UI design and other than looking fancy it doesn\u0027t actually tell me anything more. The Irony is that you give us the weight of fuel in the current stage. That is not even relevant. Useless information. Not always but thats why you should toggle information like that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNavbal doesnt work for me if its not in the center. The navbal is all I look at launching. Look at how massive it is, yet its useless. The Trust bar doesn\u0027t need to be that size. The Vertical speed indicator is massive yet you still don\u0027t know the exact speed. It is better than KSP1s because in KSP1 it was useless. The atmosphere bar is simply useless. Was in KSP1 to be fair aswell. It would be way better if we simply had a pressure number. As if an unexpirenced player knew what the hell that bar is showing and what that actually means. Whats the 3 different colors of blue tell me anyway? The light one is 1atm the black one is 0 atm but whats that mean on eve or duna? Nothing......\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbital speed and altitude can be numbers. There is no reason to have the big fat bar along with them. Its a waste of space and looks crap. That navbal needs a redesign. Ideally just delete it and paste in KSP1 for now. Smaller and tells me what I need. The Little ship in the middle to show me where my ship is pointing is a total waste of space and doesn\u0027t help anyone. Again its useless because new players do not actually know what those vectors mean. They know what they mean when they use that maneuver tool so having a toy ship is unnecessary.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00222sNCX5P.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2sNCX5P.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIll admit that I forgot to add an engine so staging is not in this image but I think you get the point.

You build your rocket, go to fly it and find you need to substantially alter your payload. How many clicks, how many steps to get clam shell deploy, reshape and resize your fairing? How easy? The \u201Cfairings\u201D from stock are clunky and too finicky (from my ksp1 experience, but watching Lowne it looks way way worse in ksp2). With procedural fairings again imho the absolute gold standard fairing in ksp, its 1 click. Grab the fairing and drop it on the node and it auto shapes to your payload finding a size suitable to fit but not too large. 1 click. Easy. Instant. No fuss, no muss no needing tons of clicks or multiple segments. Also Matt Lowne was using them correctly as he is as close to expert as it gets yet the ksp2 junk (my honest opinion of both ksp1\u0026amp;2 stock fairings now knowing ksp2 failed to improve and looking like it went backwards) \u201Cfairings\u201D look even more unbearable.

The UI is scaled nicely and big enough to be usable, even with a 32/9 screen ( 2 normal 16/9 wide screens side by side). Below a comparison between 16/9 and 21/9 (3360x1440) and you can really see that the game opens up by giving you a much better view on the main subject, while leaving planty of space for part action windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n21/9\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223ccf88c3-6541-440a-a1a4-7bde9c365e51.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022514\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://thumbs-eu-west-1.myalbum.io/photo/1k0/3ccf88c3-6541-440a-a1a4-7bde9c365e51.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16/9\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002262170674-3fef-4ea6-abd7-b0bdefc3305d.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://thumbs-eu-west-1.myalbum.io/photo/1k0/62170674-3fef-4ea6-abd7-b0bdefc3305d.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with 4K monitors is it just makes the pictures sharper, and therefore the UI needs to be bigger which leaves you again with a cramped space. For at least KSP i\u0027d really sugest, \u0027go wide\u0027 instead of more pixels. You don\u0027t need the sharpness, you\u0027re much better off with width.
