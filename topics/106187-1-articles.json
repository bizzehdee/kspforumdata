However, the atmosphere of Kerbin is weird. It is similar to Earth up to 15.000 or so, and then it falls off much quicker. However, the gravity is the same, but the diameter is WAAAY less. There are many comparisons to be found in the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere was up to scale, you would run out of air with the basic Jet engine at 1500 metres. However, the Kerbin atmosphere is about 1/2 that of earth, which means your Jet engine should run out of power at about 7000 metres (which it doesn\u0027t). This means: The atmosphere scaling compared to earth is not linear, but it resembles earth\u0027s atmosphere up to about 20.000 metres, and then it starts to fall off dramatically. A real Blackbird SR 71 (with the Kerbal turbo RAMjet equivalent) or the Mig-25 would fly Mach 3.2 at 20.000 to 25.000 metres on earth and would be able to make a ballistic zoom flight to about 35 km. That\u0027s pretty much what we get in KSP. But everything beyond 25.000km on Kerbin is scaled down to make things easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s different: The thrust at sea level is dramatically higher from what i feel. I have no numbers to prove it, though. But being able to zoom up from liftoff, reaching Mach 1.0 in a 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 steep climb and reaching almost Mach 3 before the engine runs out of air feels not right to me.
