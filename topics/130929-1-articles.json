Since it doesn\u0027t write the Flight Log to the Career Log it\u0027s not permanent. The only time the Career Log gets written is on recovery, doing it more frequently has a non-zero chance of messing things up (minimally it might screw with the flight history in your save, which might just do \u0022visual\u0022 damage rather than actually break anything, but why risk it?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nField Experience doesn\u0027t write anything permanent to the save or the Kerbals, that\u0027s why you have to keep it installed to keep the levels. It\u0027s that way so that it can\u0027t accidentally mess anything up. It\u0027s like 10 lines of code and all it does is calculate the current XP value of the Flight Log \u002B Career Log and recompute the level based on the new XP. When you recover the Kerbals their Flight Log is written to the Career Log, whether you have Field Experience installed or not. Removing it is safe because it doesn\u0027t change anything, you just lose the levels because the Stock system doesn\u0027t include the Flight Log in the calculations, just the Career Log.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock: Compute level from Career Log\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nField Experience: Compute level from Career Log \u002B Flight Log.
