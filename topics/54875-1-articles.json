I am, in fact, involved in a competition where the main goal is to launch a large rocket to 10,000 feet with a scientific payload (an anti-matter detector, in my team\u0027s case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do wonder, though, what kind of simulation and analysis they did before launch. On my team, we need to perform CFD analysis, thermal analysis, vibration analysis, structural FEA and at least 3-DOF trajectory analysis before we can start manufacturing. Also, why didn\u0027t they use all composite design? It would have been far more efficient in terms of weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
