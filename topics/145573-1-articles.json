I tried pulling it back in using a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E winch, but the winch keeps getting ripped off its attachment point. I tried to make it more sturdy - 6 struts around the winch to the wall - and the effect was the same. Brakes released, the rover is really minimal, a kerbal can push the rover around, there are no obstacles (runway), everything seems to be just right to let the winch pull the tiny thing. I press \u0027Retract\u0022 and the next thing I see is the winch lying on the bottom of the cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy? How can I fix it?
