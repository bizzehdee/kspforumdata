It can happen when the ships is active ore when not. \n\nSometimes I do stuff somewhere else and when I click on the map, the other ship which was orbiting just is not there any more.\n\nIn the savegame there is no sign of the vessel any more and the kerbals are marked dead. But there was no reason the ship was orbiting for example ike.\n\nAnd sometimes when I switch back to a ship I have this kraken. There is just nothing the camera points around in space and the altitude-meter shows 00000 ![lnSkMAB.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/lnSkMAB.png?1)\n\nI have TACLS, RemoteTech, KAS, KIS, Outer Planets(but never been there yet), the near future parts, Persistend rotation, scanSat, (\u003C-?) (a bunch of ui extensions like kerbal engineer)\n\nany idea why this is happening or which mod might cause it? How about persistent rotation? When I tried that one time ago it seemed to be buggy.\n\nbest regards\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T08:14:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nablabla**"}]}
