It can happen when the ships is active ore when not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes I do stuff somewhere else and when I click on the map, the other ship which was orbiting just is not there any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the savegame there is no sign of the vessel any more and the kerbals are marked dead. But there was no reason the ship was orbiting for example ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd sometimes when I switch back to a ship I have this kraken.
