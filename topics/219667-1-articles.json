It\u0027s a really wonderful video and I\u0027m just realizing now it\u0027s actually a game! I can\u0027t wait to dig into the original creation but I highly recommend at least checking out this playthrough! It\u0027s kind of a thought experiment on alien oceans and panspermia if your interested in that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EA WARNING THOUGH:\u003C/strong\u003E The playthrough and probably also the game seems to contain a scene or two that might affect people with epilepsy.
