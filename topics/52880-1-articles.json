As was pointed out above, LEO orbital period is about three times as long as LKO, and the transfer time of a Hohmann transfer orbit to the Mun is probably going to be at least three times faster than a Hohmann transfer to the Mun. That\u0027s not too bad, timewarp fixes that, but then there\u0027s the fact that there\u0027s time you can\u0027t timewarp through that gets magnified if you don\u0027t downscale the universe.
