I want to be able to build larger rockets without dreading the launch (whereas most of my smaller rockets are more\u00A0stable). Teach me the way of the stable rocket, as I have tried many things, fins (and trying to disable certain control surfaces), tinkering with thrust vectoring, simply adding more reaction control wheals, etc. all with limited success. Some just replace one problem with another, for example I\u0027ve found that adding fins simply replaces flipping with heavy oscillation. How can I make flying a rocket a joy a again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T19:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am assuming you\u0027ve already checked the forum for threads that give basic rocket design 101 tips, mentioning things like checking that center of mass stays above/ahead center of lift/drag even when stages emtpy or decouple, etc (if not, hint hint).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe you are trying too hard? I know, sounds silly, but stick with me. A basic rocket should need very little help to follow a natural east-prograde trajectory. So try to build it with as few fins/reaction wheels/gimbal as you can get away with first, and only add to it if it\u0027s clear that what is there is too weak to do what it must.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it sounds like you have already tried all the tools... so, have you considered your launch profile? Perhaps your chosen trajectory (or the way you control the rocket) is causing more of an issue than the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to keep the rocket as much as possible on the prograde vector, with as little manual control input as possible, for a very smooth gravity turn and minimal fighting with the atmosphere. Many of the problems you mention are only really a problem when you start pointing outside the circle of the navball prograde marker (causing very harsh and hard to fight drag vectors), or because too much manual input oversteers and then needs correcting, causing more and more oscillation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find that a well built rocket is capable of doing a near to perfect and very repeatable gravity turn almost entirely by itself, at most needing a tiny nudge a bit after lift-off to start the prograde slide (a few test launches can quickly show at what speed and how much inclination that one nudge needs to be, but usually at between 50-100m/s nudge to about 80-85 degrees east), and maybe a bit of throttling to keep apoapsis not too far ahead to minimize the need of circularizing (depends a bit on the rocket and staging, but 40-60 seconds ahead of your craft until you reach target tends to produce very nice results). Again, depends on your rocket and staging design, but aim to be at 45 degrees inclination somewhere around 10-15km altitude, 20 degree at around 30-35km, and level with the horizon around 50-55km. There\u0027s still a lot of wiggle room with that to account for various rocket designs and sizes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd watch what happens when the speed indicator switches from surface to orbit: if there is a clearly visible jolt in the prograde marker, it means your gravity turn can be improved - a good gravity turn will hardly twitch the marker at that moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T19:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many causes of unstable rockets, but the keys are proper design and piloting.
