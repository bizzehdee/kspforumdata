Realistically speaking your launch window won\u0027t be perfect, so you should add in another couple of km/s for all of the maneuvering you\u0027ll wind up doing in order to hit your mark. The good thing about all of this is that Moho\u0027s surface gravity is low and the bulk of the delta-v is spent in space, so you can get away with LV-N\u0027s for everything except your launch to LKO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vehicle in the image below has more than enough delta-v and a good enough TWR to land on Moho, once it has gotten to LKO.

To land, its around 1000 delta V (not 100% sure, would need a double check). Then you add the Launcher to LKO, which is roughly 4500m/s of Delta V. And if you want to get back from Moho, an additional 2500/3000m/s would be necessary.

Then the capture burn is expansive because it\u0027s gravity is so weak the escape velocity is pretty low and you gain so much speed from the Sun\u0027s gravity you have to cancel it out once you enter Moho\u0027s SOI. It\u0027s really expansive. At least you can aerobreak on your way back. It\u0027s really easy to undershoot your delta V for Moho.
