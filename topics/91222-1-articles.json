A probe core that has a front-facing camera, and a manned pod with a front-facing windshield. When you \u0022control from here\u0022 for these parts, you can toggle the navball between topward facing, and frontward facing, to better view your current heading. Currently the only options to get a frontward facing navball are to rotate the core/pod (awkward for some designs, and loses topward facing for lifting off), or to stick a control point, like a docking port, to the front (unbalances the CoM slightly, is in a distant node on the tech tree, and ugly [though I pretend it\u0027s a camera])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Clawed walker legs as an alternative to wheels. For balance, these shouldn\u0027t be as fast as wheels on flat terrain, but claws with grip force will come in really handy for exploring mountainous terrain, or low-gravity/traction environments like Minmus or Gilly. Also unlike wheels, they work when attached radially.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-25T22:21:43Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2014 10:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Spheniscine\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T12:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy don\u0027t you use a hopper for minmus or gilly?

Another option I\u0027ve used is to use RCS thrusters to provide artificial gravity (downward translation, assign a convenient secondary key to it) when accelerating or braking. Walkers would be a nice additional option though, especially since it would also be good for mountainous terrain.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThe klaw doesn\u0027t work on terrain I think... besides, it doesn\u0027t move, unlike a walker.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-25T13:11:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2014 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Spheniscine\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sasami_TN","CreatedById":130310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T16:05:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not a few more science-y instruments.
