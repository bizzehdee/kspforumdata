The reason I made them so dark is because if you make them too bright, they are essentially turned white from the specular of the sun. And I\u0027m not sure what you mean by \u0022cartoonish style,\u0022 I simply drew dark gray lines, and applied a bevel to them. They would probably look a lot better if they had normal maps on them, however when I import the normals that I made for them, they are too strong, and Unity doesn\u0027t have a way to tone them down, and it looks really bad in game. As for shininess, I really have little control over that. Metal textures are tricky to replicate in a game with such restrictions. Metal, when light touches it, generally only has a shine on those particular parts where the light touches, unless the photons are bouncing off of other objects as well. That\u0027s why the reflections look the way they do. So, as far as the shininess goes, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t do much with them, if anything at all. That is as close to metal as the game allows me to get. I do agree with you on the SM, and after looking at pictures of it, I have already changed it to more closely match the specular of the CM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T14:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EApollo RCS(including LM RCS) ~ These are underlined because they just need textures. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe model is really well done\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I agree with the LM\u0027s RCS, The CSM RCS is by no means accurate.
