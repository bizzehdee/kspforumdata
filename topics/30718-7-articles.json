The ceremonial sprinkling of water bestowed at its planting was nowhere near enough but the rainfall two days later soaked through the ground, bathing the seed and swelling the fibrous matting that encased it. In response, the fibres unwound, sliding past each other as they snaked through the soil and transforming the seed from a fibre wrapped gourd into the nucleus of an expanding cloud of wispy hairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the hairs were the beginnings of roots. They wove around pebble and grit, delving through the coarse soil in search of water. Water was not hard to come by with the nearby spring leaping down from the hills and the roots swiftly found it and channeled it back to the seed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther hairs were sense organs. They crept more slowly through the soil, dividing and sub-dividing, searching and tasting. Here they found pockets of mineral salts dissolved in the soil. Here they found the tell tale pheromone trails of insects. Elsewhere they found the distinctive traces of other roots. Of other plants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill others lay dormant. These were the effectors and their time had not yet come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly the seed swelled. The hard casing dissolved, releasing the embryonic Kerm within. A shoot formed, pushing upwards through the ground in search of light and air. The roots thickened where they joined it, anchoring the shoot within the soil. At the junction between them, more fibres spun out, interwoven and tangled, touching at a myriad of invisibly thin tips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMessages began to flow back along the sense fibres. Of all the many many compounds they had evolved to detect, one group was conspicuously lacking. The soil was rich in minerals, clays and water but held the barest minimum of old vegetation, the remains of past generations locked underground and providing sustenance to their descendants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThis would have to change.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstinct took over. As the shoot broached the surface and tasted the air, subtle signals rippled upwards. Leaves sprouted and unfurled. Other signals spread through the new leaves, setting off delicate biochemical cascades. Pigment cells within the leaves responded to the cascades as they always had. As dawn broke over the hill, a tiny shoot stood proudly next to the crude wooden post that marked its planting site, its blue dappled leaves turned gladly towards the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle screwed her eyes shut as the early morning sun found its way through a gap in the curtains. Joenie was already awake and chirruped happily as she saw her mother stir. Resignedly Gerselle pushed the covers to one side and swung her feet onto the floor. Yawning, she retrieved Joenie from her sleep pen and dropped her into her pouch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COoof - you\u0027re getting too heavy for this my little one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pulled on a poncho, deftly working Joenie\u0027s head through the slit in the front and ignoring the kerblet\u0027s indignant squeaking as the fabric pulled over her ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, yes, I know. Clothes are all just a terrible imposition. Shhh, now, it\u0027s all finished.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatting Joenie\u0027s head soothingly, Gerselle made her way out of her hut and crossed the green to the communal sweetmoss pool. Pulling the door shut behind her, she flipped over the privacy sign to \u0027Occupied\u0027 and reluctantly stepped into the chilly pool. Without solar heating for the water, bathing was definitely a task to be endured rather than a pleasure to be lingered over but the cold water did at least wake her up. Joenie dipped one foot into the water and squeaked at the cold. She gave Gerselle a baleful look before crawling as far away from the pool as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter bathing, it was time for the next task of the day. Gerselle retrieved her daughter and walked back to the centre of the green to check the Planting site. Other early risers - mainly those with young children of their own - were just starting to emerge from their huts and they waved to their Keeper as she walked past. Snug in her pouch, Joemie chirped a welcome to the other kerblets. For her part, Gerselle was lost in thought. She wasn\u0027t sure how long Kerm seeds took to sprout and made a mental note to visit the Archives later that day to go and find out. So far though, there had been nothing to see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen all thoughts of going to the Archives vanished as she saw the new seedling by the marker post, it\u0027s leaves already unfurled and facing the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle knelt down and hesitantly brushed her fingertips over the leaves. According to Jonton, the young Kerm would make contact through its leaves but she couldn\u0027t feel, or sense anything out of the ordinary. Perhaps, she thought, it\u0027s just too young - it\u0027s barely more than a sprout after all. The blue spots on the leaves were curious though - she couldn\u0027t recall seeing any blue marks on any type of plant before. The leaves looked healthy too, so hopefully the spots weren\u0027t a sign of some exotic parasite or fungus that fed on Kerm trees. But now that the seed had sprouted, there was something that she needed to do urgently. Gerselle hurried back to her hut and hunted through the bits and pieces on her shelves. Where was the wretched thing? \u003Cem\u003EOh right - hiding behind this other pile of odds and ends.\u003C/em\u003E She scowled. Now that the Archives were finished, it was high time for the woodcrafters to put some proper furniture together so that the villagers could \u003Cem\u003Eorganise\u003C/em\u003E things properly. \u003Cem\u003ENever mind that for now\u003C/em\u003E she told herself - \u003Cem\u003Ejust get back to the seedling\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle unfolded the wickerwork screen and carefully pegged it out around the seedling Not that anyone in the village would deliberately harm it, but it \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E rather small and easily overlooked. She brushed her fingers over the leaves again, curiously tracing out the blue marks, which had the same soft, slightly furry texture of the rest of the leaf. She frowned. The marks were clearly a part of the leaf but what were they? She shook her head. \u003Cem\u003ENever mind all this wondering Gerselle\u003C/em\u003E, she thought to herself, \u003Cem\u003Ejust go and look the wretched things up in the Archives.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Archivist smiled. \u201CCertainly Keeper.\u0022\u00A0Gently he took Joenie and snuggled her into his shoulder. \u201CYou just stay here with me, little lady, while your mum goes to read the big boring books.\u0022\u00A0Joenie squirmed, trying her best to climb over his shoulder and chirping frantically as Gerselle walked over to the shelves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, little wriggly - you don\u0027t want to do that. Tell you what.\u0022\u00A0The archivist picked up a booklet of index cards and riffled through them. Joemie stopped squirming and cocked her head towards the strange sound. The frantic chirping was replaced by an inquisitive squeaking as she grabbed the booklet and promptly started chewing on one corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, Jerselle was staring at her own book with incredulous delight. Jonton was right after a fashion - the Kerm \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E speaking to her through it\u0027s leaves, although not in the way that he had always talked about. She had found several pages of carefully coloured diagrams, all showing Kerm leaves with different patterns of coloured spots. As she read the annotations alongside each diagram, Jerselle realised that each pattern was a sign evolved to alert the kermol that something was missing. Some of them were obvious - it would have to be a very young or foolish Kermol indeed who failed to recognise a plant in need of water. Others were more obscure. She puzzled over the notes beside the picture of the blue spotted leaf for several long minutes before understanding dawned. \u003Cem\u003EOf course! Not as quick as adding compost but much more efficient and better in the long run\u003C/em\u003E. She would have to send a carrier back to the Grove to fetch the necessary seeds though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the thin stubble of saplings covering the hilltop was intermingled with a green carpet of hundreds and hundreds of low growing flat leaved clover. The roots and shoots of the little plants were studded with tiny intricately folded nodules, giving them a rather misshapen lumpy appearance. As they grew, gases in the surrounding air diffused into the nodules where they were transformed into nutrients and a myriad of other compounds by the specialised cells just under the surface. Most of the nutrients were absorbed by the growing plants but some were allowed to escape out through the roots into the soil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the nutrients spread out through the soil, new messages fired along the growing network of fibres around the Kerm seedling. Dormant effectors came to life, growing rapidly and extending far beyond the reach of the sensory fibres that controlled them. As they raced outwards, they released a cascade of complicated chemical signals into the earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe signals spread out from the hilltop, drawing all manner of other creatures to it. Worms wriggled through the dark, blindly following the chemical trails and slowly churning up the soil as they went. Beetles and other insects crawled up the hillside, finding new homes and plentiful food amongst the low growing clover plants covering the hilltop. Other soil dwelling insects burrowed amongst the roots of those same plants. With the insects came a host of bacteria and other single celled organisms that rapidly colonised the surrounding soil, feeding on the nutrients around the plant roots and being fed on in turn by other creatures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kermol villagers watched in horror as their green and verdant hillside wilted and began to die under the ecological onslaught. The more observant amongst them noted that all the saplings remained unaffected and told the others not to intefere but to trust in the Kerm and the wisdom of the Keeper. Others noticed that the dying plants released clouds of tiny wispy seeds which dispersed on the wind and settled far and wide over the hillside. And even as the plants died, their substance became bound up in the soil, whether by decomposition or through the bodies - dead or alive - of the creatures that had fed on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the Archives, Gerselle knew that the Kerm could push the already rapidly growing clover to flower and die many times over a season. Each cycle of greening and dieback would lock more precious nutrients into the soil but even so it would be at least a year before it had improved enough to be suitable for planting anything other than clover and probably longer still before it would support any useful crop plants. Nevertheless, this was a start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, out of sight beneath the surface, the Kerm fibres continued to spread. Here they slipped in between the clover roots, sensing the nutrients flowing out around them. There they sniffed out the criss-crossing trails of a vital species of beetle. In still other places they sped through patches of worm cast, quivering under a trickle of displaced soil particles as the worms tunneled blindly past. And now, in their ceaseless wandering, they began to detect \u003Cem\u003Eself\u003C/em\u003E as they encountered the other fibres spinning out from beneath the stems of the nearby Kerm cuttings. Flurries of signals raced up and down the hairlike threads as they met and touched, causing other fibres to grow along the trails marked out by the pioneers. The fibres twisted together forming more robust, almost root like structures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly but surely, the food webs being spun through the soil by the effectors were matched by a physical web of sensory fibres strung from the seedling to all the thirty six cuttings, then from each cutting to its nearest neighbours and finally from each cutting to every other cutting planted on the hilltop. Gradually the delicate networks at the base of each became more and more interconnected; knitting\u00A0together into the grand symbiosis of a new Kerm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=620415\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 14\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=635374\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 16\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-12T20:20:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2019 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T10:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFascinating.

He waited until everyone had poured themselves a drink and taken their places around the table. Then he began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CG-good afternoon everybody. As you all know, we\u0027ve called this meeting today to discuss the um announcement by the Probodyne Foundation and um what we, I mean we the company should do about.. what our response should be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal, the chief of propulsion, had deliberately chosen the seat nearest the front. He flashed a quick supportive smile at Danfen and made a surreptitious \u0027calm down\u0027 gesture at him from under the table. Danfen dipped his head by a fraction of a centimetre and picked up the remote control to buy a moment to breathe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe don\u0027t know who the Probodyne Foundation are but if their, their announcement is anything to go by then they have an interest in Munar exploration.\u0022\u00A0He clicked the remote and brought up his first slide. \u201CThis is obvious from their um \u003Cem\u003Esecond\u003C/em\u003E challenge where they are offering a substantial prize for the first person, or more likely, team to fly a spacecraft to the Mun and photograph its far side.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EClick.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI believe that their um \u003Cem\u003Efirst\u003C/em\u003E challenge confirms this. Again, they are offering a substantial sum of money for the first team to put four kerbals into orbit, in a single contiguous vessel and keep them there for four weeks.\u0022\u00A0He paused. \u201CThis would be an excellent um proof of ability to put enough crew and materiel into space for a flight to the M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen glanced across the table. \u201CWhich leads us to some obvious questions,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CDo we compete for these prizes? And if so, uh which?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone tapped her pen on the table in front of her. \u201CHow much are Probodyne offering?\u0022\u00A0she asked. Danfen brought up the next slide and gestured at the numbers on the screen. Ademone looked thoughtful. \u201CClever. Not enough that we\u0027re going to make any profit from them. In fact, we could make a substantial loss, depending on how many launches we need. But enough to cover some of the costs and a nice incentive to at least give those missions a try.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen nodded in agreement. \u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cso I decided to draw up a rough flight profile for each challenge, based on existing Rockomax hardware. The umm Kerbin orbital flight is conceptually simpler so I started there.\u0022\u00A0He clicked the remote.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe R2 orbital craft is based on our sub-orbital R1 capsule but obviously includes enhanced life support systems and thermal protection for re-entry. Like the R1 it holds two pilots. It\u0027s designed to fly with a separate, with a separate service module for power and on orbit maneuvering, although this is jettisoned before re-entry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen\u0027s voice began to grow more confident as the presentation became more technical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe also have our current launch vehicle based on a BA-C solid booster with a smaller B1 solid second stage. Finally we have our liquid fueled orbital insertion stage based on our single chamber 48-7D engine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal shuffled uncomfortably in his seat. Danfen nodded at him. \u201CI suspect Hanbal - and um probably everyone else - has identified the problem here. The R2 is considerably heavier than our K1 satellite and the BA-C/B1 stack will not be enough to lift it to orbit. I\u0027ll come to that in a minute.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn the meantime, on my next slide, I have an overview flight profile for a Munar mission.There are three parts to the flight; achieving low Kerbin orbit, the transfer orbit to the Mun and the braking burn into Munar orbit.\u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe mission will use our existing K1 satellite, which happily has the necessary cameras and communication equipment. We also have the 48-7D insertion stage, which should be sufficient for the final braking burn. Finally, we already know that the BA-C / B1 stack is sufficient to lift both into low Kerbin orbit. However, what we don\u0027t have, is a boost stage for putting the K1 into a Munar transfer orbit. That\u0027s probably the most serious problem we would need to overcome, since we would need to design and build the boost stage and also modify the launch vehicle to lift the extra weight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen took a gulp of water. \u201CTo summarise, we do not have the hardware to accomplish either of the Probodyne challenges at present. So the next question is - what \u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E hardware would we need for either mission?\u0022\u00A0He nodded towards Hanbal. \u201CAs everyone will be aware, the propulsion team is developing our first substantial liquid fueled engine. I believe that the current prototype, the SK1-F is currently being tested, although there is some way to go before the SK1 series will be flight ready.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next slide clicked into place, showing an outline design for a spacecraft and its booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy team have put together some outline designs for a launch vehicle based on the new engines. The main stage - here - is powered by a single SK1 engine, with multiple BA-C solid boosters on lateral mounts to provide additional thrust for liftoff. The upper stage is smaller but again, powered by an SK1 engine. From the preliminary test fire data, I believe this configuration will be powerful enough to launch quite um, quite a \u003Cem\u003Esubstantial\u003C/em\u003E payload to low Kerbin orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen tapped the projector screen. \u201COne possibility would be to launch an R2 orbital capsule, together with an expanded service module. As well as providing power and maneuver capabilities it would also provide crew quarters and life support for up to four kerbals. Crucially, the module would also include a docking port at either end.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton snorted. \u201CDocking port? I rather think that we\u0027re attempting to fly before we can jump here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen inclined his head politely. \u201CThe R2 capsule would launch in a nose forward configuration Once on orbit, it would be released from the service module, rotate and dock. The two vessels will never be more than a few tens of metres apart, so this should not present a significant challenge. Docking a second, separately launched R2 onto the other end of the module, will of course be a different matter. Once both capsules are attached, we will be in a position to complete the first Probodyne Prize challenge.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen took another drink of water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe have also given some thought to the second challenge. This would also require a new launch vehicle but one that I believe that we already have the capacity to build without too much extra effort. Conceptually, the new vehicle would be similar to the SK1 design from my previous slide. The BA-C /B1 booster would be augmented with additional, laterally mounted B1 boosters, allowing it to lift a larger payload to orbit. That payload would consist of the K1, the 48-7D stage and a Kerbin departure stage built around a cluster of four 48-7D engines. As you\u0027ll understand from the name, the Kerbin departure stage is the missing part from my previous slide which will boost the K1 into its transfer orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen took a deep breath. \u201CIn short, I believe that we can realistically challenge for both of the Probodyne prizes given time. Both are within the capability of our existing hardware or current hardware development plans. The question of which we prioritise, I throw open to the meeting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a polite patter of applause as Danfen stepped down from the podium and joined the rest of the management team around the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton was the first to speak.\u00A0\u201CIt seems quite obvious to me. M\u00FCn first, with existing hardware then we focus our attention on the Kerbin orbital mission. We need a new booster for the R2 in any case, so we may as well get someone to pay some of the development costs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoebal tapped the table. \u201CWith respect, I disagree. We may have the engines to possibly get to the M\u00FCn but I can tell you for a fact that we don\u0027t have the rest of the systems in place. No - I say we leave the M\u00FCn for now and focus on Kerbin orbit operations. If we aim at both prizes together we risk walking away with neither.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd I say that if we focus on an overly complicated Kerbin orbit mission, then we also run the risk of walking away with nothing. Nelton rolled her eyes. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EDocking\u003C/em\u003E looks lovely on a presentation slide but have you any idea how difficult it will be practice? My mission control team are only just getting to grips with the details of orbital flight with a single capsule.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone cut across the rapidly developing argument. \u201CDanfen, Hanbal. What are your opinions of the current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E systems?\u0022\u00A0Nelton and Joebal fell silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal cleared his throat. \u201CMore suited for the M\u00FCn challenge than the Kerbin orbit challenge Ademone. We already know that their booster can put a capsule into orbit and like us, they already have a suitable satellite. They also have the advantage of excellent guidance systems and a better selection of engines for the different phases of the flight. I would say that they already have all the elements of a Munar mission in place.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen nodded. \u201CI agree. On the other hand, their current systems aren\u0027t remotely powerful enough to lift anything much heavier than their single kerbal capsule into orbit. They would be extremely hard pressed to complete the Kerbin orbit challenge with their Moho hardware, not least because it would involve docking four capsules to a common vehicle.\u0022\u00A0Beside him he could hear Nelton snort in agreement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you,\u0022\u00A0said Ademone quietly, \u201CDo we have any indications of their likely future plans?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u0022\u00A0said Danfen frankly, \u201Calthough we can make some guesses from that KBS documentary. From what I could see of their assembly facilities, they appeared to be building two more of their capsules. That suggests they plan to run at least two more single pilot flights, which I suspect will tie up their available resources for quite a while. Even if they decide to focus on a Munar flight afterwards, we may have still have enough time to put our own mission together.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you. Joebal - do you agree with Hanbal\u0027s assessment of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E guidance systems?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnfortunately I do Ademone,\u0022\u00A0said Joebal reluctantly. \u201CWe know from the KBS documentary that their thrust vector control is based on gimballed engines. We don\u0027t have any details of their actual guidance systems of course but we\u0027ve analysed all their launch footage as best we can and that, coupled with our tracking data, tells us that they\u0027re impressively accurate. We also have no idea how they\u0027re managing their roll control but it certainly seems to work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone drummed her fingers on the table. \u201CWhat about our guidance systems. They may not be as good as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E versions but would they get us to the M\u00FCn?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoebal grimaced. \u201CPossibly. As you know, our current guidance control relies on vernier engines in the 48-7D module and liquid injection for vectoring the thrust from the solid boosters. Liquid injection is not an ideal system - which is why we try to aim our boosters off the pad as far as possible. We could probably add verniers to Danfen\u0027s clustered 48-7D stage too but I wouldn\u0027t want to make any promises about attitude control for the whole transfer orbit burn. Monitoring and compensating for off axis or uneven thrust over the whole duration would be a cast iron... umm it would be challenging.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoebal rubbed his eyes. \u201CPlus, the guidance control unit is quite large. Fitting it to the 48-7D cluster would be interesting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have a question,\u0022\u00A0said Nelton, \u201CWhy not just go with a single 48-7D? Wouldn\u0027t that get rid of the uneven thrust.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CProbably,\u0022\u00A0Joebal acknowledged, \u201Cbut then we\u0027d need a much longer burn to compensate for the reduced thrust, which just moves the problem around.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmmm,\u0022\u00A0said Ademone, \u201CI presume that it would take too long to develop a gimballed 48-7D ourselves?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0said Hanbal, \u201Cit would. Or at least it would be one more thing for us to do and one more thing that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cem\u003E don\u0027t \u003C/em\u003E have to do. Not to mention the fact that Joebal\u0027s team would need to completely re-work the control logic. We tried gimbals on the B1 boosters - they\u0027re not easy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone nodded to herself. \u201CThank you everyone. In which case we will continue our piloted program as planned and devote most of our efforts to completing the SK1 and developing a launch vehicle for the R2. We will then consider how best to use the R2 to win the first Probodyne prize.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone smiled faintly, \u201CHowever, I\u0027m still enough of a M\u00FCn watcher, that I don\u0027t want to abandon the second Probodyne prize altogether. And in the long term our satellite business will benefit from a cheap, mostly solid fueled booster capable of lifting payloads beyond low Kerbin orbit. Therefore I will release funding for two of Danfen\u0027s modified BA-C / B1 boosters. Please make them count.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree, two, one and shutdown!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside, the roar of the engine died away and was replaced by blessed silence. The last wisps of fire chased themselves around the edges of the flame pit and were quickly extinguished by the torrents of water still spraying out of the sound suppression system. Then the spray jets switched off as well and all that could be heard around test stand 1a was the faint gurgle of water swirling away down the drains and the plinking of cooling metal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the control room, Hanbal turned to the propulsion team. \u201CNice work people. I think we can call that a success.\u0022\u00A0He made a note in the test log; SK1-G - full duration test completed. \u201CNext up - is everything ready on stand two?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the engineers stepped forward. \u201CAll set up and good to go Hanbal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery kerbal in the room gathered round the control console for test stand two. On the monitor they could see the BA-C booster securely suspended above the flame pit. Stray drops of water splattered across the camera lens as the sound suppression system started up.The counter ticked down to zero and light flared across the monitor as the BA-C ignited. The noise was still fairly impressive despite the sound suppression system and the thick control room walls and even at this distance everyone could feel the vibration. There was a clattering in the background as an empty paper coffee cup fell off the edge of a table and rolled across the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal braced himself. Any second now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe muted roar increased to a full throated bellow. Flames licked over the top of the pit and twin clouds of smoke billowed out on either side of the test stand. In the control room the windows started to rattle and for a moment Hanbal feared that the booster was burning out of control. Much to his relief, the vibrations didn\u0027t get any worse although he kept a wary eye on the console telltales. For several long minutes the propulsion team watched the monitor tensely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight on cue, the twenty\u00A0second light on the console glowed orange. There was no real reason for a countdown, as every kerbal in the room was perfectly capable of keeping time themselves but some things were just traditional. Hanbal forced a note of nonchalance into his voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBurnout in three, two, one... and shutdown.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything went quiet. The smoke from the booster gradually dissipated in the breeze. The sound suppression system switched off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal leaned forward to inspect the chart paper. Slowly he turned the dial on the console, scrolling the chart back to the start point. After his initial panic, the readouts during the test seemed to have been fine, but the chart was better than he had dared to hope. Steady thrust at 25% rated power, a smooth ramp-up and then a good controlled burn at 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, seems that the new propellant configuration is a keeper. Looks like Danfen\u0027s crazy lateral boosters might work after all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis casual tone did nothing to fool the rest of the team and the control room rapidly filled with exuberant chatter. Hanbal stood back and let everyone celebrate. \u003Cem\u003EA small triumph but a very welcome one\u003C/em\u003E, he thought to himself, \u003Cem\u003Eparticularly after the news of Camrie Kerman\u0027s successful flight aboard the Moho 2. A few more milestones like this and maybe, just maybe, Rockomax would be first to the M\u00FCn.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=627145https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=627145\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 15\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=645138\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 17\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-12T20:22:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2019 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T15:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery cool!
