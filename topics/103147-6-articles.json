I glanced at the configs between the main rotors, and it looks like many of the KAX audio cues and other features are added in. I was interested in seeing if whatever hooks TCA uses to define \u0022what\u0022 the engine is (main, balanced, maneuver, etc.) could be enabled in some way.\n\nAnother amazing tool for balancing is the RCS build aid.

It was designed before the Third Kerbal War by RSS prodigy genius Satoshi Imahara. Satoshi, who is renowned as \u0027The Starchild of the Rising Sun\u0027, caught the attention of Yuko who invited him to design a superfighter. He was drawn and inspired by the legendary Striker Series and its successes, which led him to work with Striker designer and engineer Ruvo Kerman. The rest of the Striker team was in the meantime working on Vulta.  \n\nTogether with Ruvo, the duo pulled core design elements of the Striker-B and produced the remarkably advance Striker-C. In addition to being substantially larger than its predecessors, it features an experimental advance dual cockpit by Baha Dynamics and a new VTOL system designed by Satoshi and delivered by QuizTech.  \n\nA major obstacle was the low speed of the aircraft due to its weight. Satoshi and Ruvo designed an entire new engine, which was later produced by Red Solar. This highly experimental advance afterburner engine launched Striker-C to supersonic speeds with incredible efficiency.  \n\nStriker-C\u0027s additions and weaponry include; Inline Radar, two Specialized ECM Jammers, Dual 20mm Inline Vulcans, Weapon Bay capacity of 9 LRAA, Aerial Docking Node and two Auxiliary Thrust Engines. All these together make Striker-C one of the most formidable early sixth generation fighter. Its demonstration garnered acclaimed, exceeding Yuko\u0027s expectations. Like Zolts, Striker-C was too expensive to produce and became highly exclusive to ace pilots.\n\n![K8vywjF.png](http://i.imgur.com/K8vywjF.png)![cAj8eea.png](http://i.imgur.com/cAj8eea.png)![bJhOw6m.png](http://i.imgur.com/bJhOw6m.png)![Nd0b2nS.png](http://i.imgur.com/Nd0b2nS.png)\n\n![xbCZjqW.png](http://i.imgur.com/xbCZjqW.png)\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/9Ayg5/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**DISCLAIMER: 1# I USE INFINITE FUEL AND RCS TO MAKE SURE THE MASS DOESN\u0027T MOVE**  \n                              **(THE THRUST AND LIFT IS CLOSE PERFECT BALANCE)                           2# I\u0027M NOT A SUPER DESIGNER IN AIRCRAFTS                           3# I DON\u0027T CLAIM TO BE THE BEST WRITER, IF THERE\u0027S ANY LANGUAGE MISTAKE PLEASE NOTIFY ME**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-19T00:38:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2016 12:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by victor tan**"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T04:33:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, victor tan said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hide contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **YKF-18b \u0027Mikya\u0027**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hide contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![jASmu8T.png](http://i.imgur.com/jASmu8T.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **YKF-18b/c \u0027Mikya\u0027**  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E YKF-18b/c \u0027Mikya\u0027 is a fifth generation multirole fighter developed by Yukobania Ind.

This causes a performance drop as well as adverse effects when using **Scatterer**. To correct this issue I run KSP in **DirectX9** by adding \u0022 -dx9\u0022 to the end of my shortcut target field. This is not the best memory friendly option. But if you are running x64 and you have the available memory, this will run the game the smoothest.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E KSP doesn\u0027t like fast switching (**Alt-Tab**). To make it fast switch smoothly as well as gain a minor FPS boost. \u0022 -popupwindow\u0022 allows you to run in borderless windowed mode. You\u0027ll need to turn off \u0022full Screen Mode\u0022 in game. Also be sure to set your screen resolution to your monitor / TV\u0027s native resolution, or the window won\u0027t fit. This may not be the best solution for everyone as the native resolution may be higher then you can run KSP at smoothly. To run in Borderless windowed mode add \u0022 -popupwindow\u0022 to the end of your shortcut target field.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A trick that often helps computers with good dedicated graphics cards (sometimes onboard graphics) but not so great processors, is OpenGL. **This does present issues with some visual mods if you want to run Scatterer, Do not run OpenGL.** OpenGL allows you to transfer more of the work load from your processor to the video card. Be aware that this is affected by the amount of dedicated memory and the speed of your graphics card. Mods will affect this limit. To run in OpenGL mode add \u0022 -forceopengl\u0022 to the end of the shortcut target field. You can edit your KSP shortcut target field by right clicking the KSP shortcut and you will see \u0022Target Field\u0022 listed on the top of the open window.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Now Popupwindow, OpenGL or forcing a specific version of DirectX can run together. You just can\u0027t run OpenGL alongside DirectX. It\u0027s one or the other. Just don\u0027t forget the spaces, your target field should look like this (KSP.exe -popupwindow -forceopengl)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Lastly I do not use it but many people have had good luck forcing **DirectX11**, to bring down there memory footprint. KSP Natively runs using DirectX 9 which is more universally accepted by everyone\u0027s hardware.

The do however use quite a bit of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to stabilize. That was such a long process to get them balanced just right.\n\u003E \n\nI worked out very quickly that the better balance a plane design has, the less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E needed to begin with. Now taking that into mind, making a high altitude plane stable when using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, that can get off the runway easy is a whole new ball game. I made huge strides in this area. Say for eg this design:  \n  \n![4130013D724F8398791585BC3A312E46FF8A5CD8](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/501399955323612229/4130013D724F8398791585BC3A312E46FF8A5CD8/)\n\nIf I were to go into the amount of time simply put into this one design, I could write a 3000 word essay. Even with this design there are still room for improvements...\n\nWith that build, I was getting into space very fast. Pretty much would be able to carry one of those huge orange fuel tanks as a pay load. And dump it into space if need be. My biggest issue was heat from simply going so damn fast during re-entry. Flying too well it seems, has it\u0027s drawbacks. My solution was to practice slower re-entries to wash off speed. Else I would burn up. As you could imagine, that also meant that I could miss my target landing pad by whole entire continents. By this point though, I had so much reserve fuel with this design, that I could almost do a 2nd power burn back up into space with the 30% remaining fuel.\n\nAs you would also know, less weight means that on re-entry, the flight dynamics would change dramatically. Wash off speed early would leave you stranded a continent away from your destination. Or not washing off speed early enough and you end up  on the other side of the planet.... The reason being is that there is a conundrum where a sudden loss of weight (eg payload) and also a loss of fuel, means that it feels like you are now flying a glider instead of a hyper-craft! This makes it incredibly hard to wash off speed and means you literally need air brakes to slow you down on re-entry. Then there is the issue that high dynamic pressure with a light aircraft causes extreme amounts of G on slight adjustments at low altitude. So you effectively need to feather it all the way back. Else it rips itself apart due to the extreme stresses placed on the craft at those speeds. Oh the fun...\n\nIt\u0027s a shame KSP doesn\u0027t have a meta realism mod. eg: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E / Body and wing materials / Fuel types / Engine types / inbuilt procedural wings etc... Realism to me is what made this game so great. Mods like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E are what made me play KSP so much.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-11T00:16:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2016 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by B15HOP\\_xmen**"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-21T20:35:11Z","Content":"Hey Jester\n\nHow do you deal with turning big parts as you do on your OPT protolift??\n\nI am trying to make 20T engines turning 90\u00B0 to land on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E on my OPT \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E but any of the robotic parts from Magicsmoke industries (Extendatron, pivotron, rotatron or hinge or whatever can\u0027t bear such a weight ? and what about strut and auto strut?\n\nAny tricks?"}]}
