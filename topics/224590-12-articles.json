If you extend the analogy of the game as a building, the current IG team has plumbers, electricians,\u00A0 HVAC techs, drywallers,\u00A0 and floor layers all trying to do their bit on top of a foundation and framing that are fundamentally not fit for purpose and will never work the way they are now. What are you going to do if you are in charge of that whole job?\u00A0 Yes, you may want to just walk away and take your losses, but even if you mean to soldier on, there is no point in continuing to pay all those people who are finishing interiors that will likely have to be ripped out to fix all\u00A0 the serious issues with the foundation. Instead, you will take what you have now and put it in the hands of a small group of people who specialize in fixing those foundation problems, and wait until they have done their job before bringing any of the other contractors back on board.\u00A0 That way you can keep your burn rate to a minimum while you fix the problems that moot all the other work anybody else might do.
