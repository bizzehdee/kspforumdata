It likely isnt too long until it comes out. When it is released, the HSC will have the IVA option, meaning that EVA as also done the same way as kerbals in a normal command pod. It sould be released in less that a month. Until then, i suggest playing around. Why not go to Jool? There be lots of cool stuff there! - Pug\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T18:17:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ammonia_ocean\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ammonia_ocean\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m fairly new to KSP, and recently docked a Hitchhiker Storage Container to my space station.
