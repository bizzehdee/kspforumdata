Single engine, fuel cells (thanks for the hint, whoever it was, better than gigantors!) and a small xenon container. My first burn to get to 17 Mkm needed around 800 m/s dV and the burn time was calculated to 8:40. So I started my burn at -4:20 and, since nobody wants to wait 8 mins to complete a burn, except real space craft pilots, I used physics warp. After 4 minutes at two times normal speed there were almost 4 minutes still left to burn. So I ended up accelerating for almost 12 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next time I did my circularization burn I watched the estimate burn time and the node time very closely. At 1x warp they were going down in sync. But when I enabled physics warp they didn\u0027t anymore. Did someone experience similiar behavior?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And before you answer, go watch the SpaceX launch!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T13:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan your computer handle physics time warp smoothly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the mission time turn yellow/red during the warp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SoWeMeetAgain","CreatedById":145256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T14:05:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mat2ch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mat2ch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E17 Mkm\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E17 million(=mega) kilometers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mat2ch","CreatedById":139755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T15:01:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shpaget\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shpaget\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan your computer handle physics time warp smoothly?\u003Cp\u003EDoes the mission time turn yellow/red during the warp?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith mission time you\u0027re talking about the time displayed in the upper left?
