Single engine, fuel cells (thanks for the hint, whoever it was, better than gigantors!) and a small xenon container. My first burn to get to 17 Mkm needed around 800 m/s dV and the burn time was calculated to 8:40. So I started my burn at -4:20 and, since nobody wants to wait 8 mins to complete a burn, except real space craft pilots, I used physics warp. After 4 minutes at two times normal speed there were almost 4 minutes still left to burn. So I ended up accelerating for almost 12 minutes.\n\nThe next time I did my circularization burn I watched the estimate burn time and the node time very closely. At 1x warp they were going down in sync. But when I enabled physics warp they didn\u0027t anymore. Did someone experience similiar behavior?\n\n(And before you answer, go watch the SpaceX launch!)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T13:42:25Z","Content":"Can your computer handle physics time warp smoothly?\n\nDoes the mission time turn yellow/red during the warp?"},{"CreatedByName":"SoWeMeetAgain","CreatedById":145256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T14:05:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 17 Mkm\n\n17 million(=mega) kilometers\n\n?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mat2ch","CreatedById":139755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T15:01:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can your computer handle physics time warp smoothly?\n\u003E Does the mission time turn yellow/red during the warp?\n\nWith mission time you\u0027re talking about the time displayed in the upper left?
