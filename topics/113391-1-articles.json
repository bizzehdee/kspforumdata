So now with KSP 1.02 are multiple docking port configurations better / easier to (successfully) make? And if so whats the best way to set one up?

Then you have a stress concentration with a big moment of inertial on each side of it. So if you limit the size of your modules, you\u0027ll usually be OK. However, a cross-shaped station is always going to wobble because the arms are heavy and way wider than any port.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T19:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy main motivation for this is connecting a lander to a main engine block on an interplanetary ship. While the main engine block is about the size of the docking port (a little wider since i use a Mk3 fuel tank), the lander is considerably wider (it has to be wide to be stable when landing). Initially struts keep it stable during launch, but after the first disconnect those struts are gone for good (at least on stock KSP they are).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T20:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy standard example for a three-port connection: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.schnobs.de/stuff/screenshot155.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis vessel\u003C/a\u003E is just as rigid as if it was built in one piece.

I wholeheartedly recommend Mechjeb\u0027s \u003Cem\u003ESmart A.S.S.\u003C/em\u003E for the purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have to use several senior ports as I did in that picture. However, the amount of thrust a port can take is limited; if you want to put more than a Skipper behind it, there should be a senior port in the center. The surrounding ports may be small or even tiny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor stability purposes, it\u0027s not important to have many ports. Besides, you have to unbotton all ports when you detach the vessels. What\u0027s more important is the distance between them: the further apart the better. That comes easily if your craft happens to have outriggers anyway -- if it doesn\u0027t, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s really worthwhile to add them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso keep in mind that only one of the docking port connections will allow fuel flow, and there\u0027s no telling which one it will be.

The issue comes when you have forces that result in torque at the more elastic connection docking ports give.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf possible, tug your lander while it has a lower fuel load. Also, unless your drive vessel lacks sufficient reaction wheel torque, disable reaction wheels on the payload. Having two reaction wheels on opposite sides of a flexible connection leads to positive feedback control loop if they are sufficiently more powerful than the connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI once had a LKO pod retrial mission.

Forgot to answer OP question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply make a sub-assembly with some form of symmetry for the multi ports. Then just use said sub-assembly for both craft. Any ports not placed at the same point (center vs others) will need distance adjusted, but alignment will always be correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelated: how do standard docking ports handle shear forces. I have this crazy idea to make a Mk2 tug design that can radially dock with sister/cousin ships for increased payload capabilities. Such a system would dock with a pair of inline Mk2 docking ports separated by a fuel tank. Would that idea be practical in game? I\u0027m worried about the shear forces either breaking the connection or allowing engine play and steering losses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T22:39:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 10:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
