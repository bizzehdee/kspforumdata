I\u0027ve also been a regular guest visitor to the forums for some time, mainly to read about and download many of the exciting mods that have been produced by the community.\n\nMore than any other aspect of the game, I enjoy building things - coming up with really trick craft - and the journey is often times greater than the destination. I\u0027ve decided to start posting some albums of my creations, in the hope that others might enjoy as I have enjoyed others postings.\n\n- akardam"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T06:34:03Z","Content":"I look forward to seeing them and welcome ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T12:45:09Z","Content":"Welcome akardam!
