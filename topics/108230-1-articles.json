View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my two stage to orbit air launch system. This is a small plane that is based on the Pegasus air launch system and is capable of sending small probes and even manned missions to orbit (easily 800dv once in orbit) Without the payload the plane flies very well and is exceptionally manoeuvrable despite the offset thrust. The plane seems to be able to get anything with a decent thrust to weight ratio into orbit and I have never failed to get a payload into orbit. The craft comes with a sample payload which is a small scanning probe with 1200dv once into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssent profile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake off at around 50m/s and pitch up to 45 degrees at half throttle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 14,000n pitch down to 20 degrees and gain speed, at around 25,000 you can release the payload\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you switch to the payload gain altitude then flatten out when you have an apoapse of 60,000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressing one will activate the ladder and pressing the breaks deploys flaps which are useful to help you slow down\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do want to use my craft and change the payload you will have to reset the route part as the cockpit then change the payload and change the route part to the payload probe. One the payload you will need to mount small fins on the back an two sepratron in front of the centre of mass with 0.8 units of fuel. You have to do this so you don\u0027t drain the payload fuel. Sadly due to physics range issues unless you have some kind of mod the plane is destroyed when flying .the payload\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/sa59qjgbrxkxs9r/Planck%20class%20air%20launch%20system.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/sa59qjgbrxkxs9r/Planck%20class%20air%20launch%20system.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for looking\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T16:13:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrmcp1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankbuster32","CreatedById":59371,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:20:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a really cool craft!
