This appears in all space scenes and also in the main menu screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been posts on this topic already which I have read, unfortunately the proposed solutions didn\u0027t work for me. Therefore the full story:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP version 1.0.2, Win 7, 64bit, intel i5-3570K, 8GB RAM, AMD 5770 Graphics card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring months the above combination worked fine, i.e. the behaviour mentioned did not appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I tried out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Clean install of KSP. Issue persists (Yes, I\u0027m normally using KAC, MJ and KER, but it obviously doesn\u0027t relate to these mods, therefore I\u0027m posting into this forum)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Setting Texture quality in AMD Catalyst Suite to different values, including \u0022Quality\u0022. Issue persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Installing newest AMD Driver. Issue persists\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Complete uninstall and reinstall of AMD Driver. Issue persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Loading an old persistent.sfs. Issue persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Playing around with graphics settings, restarting KSP several times. Issue persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added Astronomers Visual Pack into a clean install. Issue persists. Clouds, but blurry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat surprised me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Starting the instance of KSP from another Windows account. Issue is gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Starting the instance of KSP from another Windows installation (Win 8.1). Issue is gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And of course, on other PC\u0027s the effect is also not there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, I have to assume that the \u0022normal\u0022 windows account that I\u0027m normally using suddenly has something (process or setting or Kraken) that is telling KSP to reduce the GPU resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have an idea where to get any further hints? Any logfiles or somewhere to look at with process explorer? I\u0027m living with the Win 8.1 workaround but as an engineer I\u0027d like to understand the cause of the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T15:00:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Maestro22, please upload your KSP_Data\\output_log.txt and dxdiag log from the affected account and from an unaffected account to dropbox.com or a similar fileshare site, differences that might explain this might be written to those logs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maestro22","CreatedById":147697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T20:11:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello sal_vager,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat sounds like a good plan.
