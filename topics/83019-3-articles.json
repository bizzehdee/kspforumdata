I know some people would make the code only add LS to command modules and crew, but I kind of don\u0027t like that idea. I like having it GeoPhizzix code, this is because say a player puts up a science module or station part, even though it might have 6 days of LS or 2.5 days of LS (thats if number if brought down), that amount of LS is for like setting up that station part in space. If we use our imaginations, it would be the time to set up the interior and get things working properly. Once set up the LS station module will be launched up and attached, which will supply a lot longer LS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe default numbers of capsule LS shouldn\u0027t play a big factor with science capsules and station parts, because no one sets them up for 6 days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think in real life they send up module parts with some sort of basic LS so that things can get into operation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s how I can justify not having the code to add to command module crew capacity, but having it just be crew capacity based.
