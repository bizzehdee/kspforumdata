I sent a hauler out with a 2 star engineer to pick up the ore, and all was still well, transferring the mined ore into the hauler. I needed a little more ore to complete a mission so I left them docked and drilling for a moment, and performed a quick EVA to plant a flag in celebration of everything being awesome.\n\nHowever, as soon as I boarded my hauler again, the drill reported being at 100% overheating and was no longer functioning. I turned it off to wait for it to cool down again, and unfortunately nothing I can do will get it to cool down. I have tried fully retracting the drill and returning to the control center. Time warped several days. Still the drill is at 100% overheating ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nThe only mod I have installed is mechjeb, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s related to the issue at hand. I am to the point where editing the save file is an option to work around this bug but I\u0027m not sure what values to edit. I found the part, but changing its temp value from 266.667234985767 to 0 does not seem to have any effect. \n\nSomeone please help! Let me know if you need additional info. Thanks in advance."},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:43:05Z","Content":"This is a known bug, and is being addressed. \n\nIf you are feeling bold enough to alter your persistent.sfs file, and just can\u0027t wait for the update, here\u0027s how to temporarily fix it-\n\nLocate the ISRU or drill unit on the ship in question in the persistent.sfs file. Change the following values to 1:\n\nHeatThrottle = 1\n\navgHeatThrottle = 1\n\nNote this will only temporarily return the drill or ISRU to functioning again. If you overheat it again, it will be stuck again. Again, this issue is known and is being addressed."},{"CreatedByName":"wpatter6","CreatedById":140000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:56:39Z","Content":"Great, thanks for the info, it worked, and I\u0027ll look forward to the bug fix! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
