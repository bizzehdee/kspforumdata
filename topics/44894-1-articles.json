Perhaps to make a wall panel or something along those lines that couldn\u0027t be done with the structural panels (due to size, perhaps)? I don\u0027t know how difficult or easy this\u0027d be from a coding perspective, but it\u0027d certainly allow for some nice aesthetics, and more authenticity on early probe replicas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if this is already in game, could a mod lock this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spectrhz","CreatedById":69106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T04:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely, especially with the gigantor.
