Same concept to control them so they can board a craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHad a craft on the runway that I built with no command module, just an external seat, tried the craft switch and couldn\u0027t even go to my rover (using that term very loosely) by using the key binding to switch vehicles, even with it being parked just on the grassy slope on the side of the runway as close as possible. So, space center and selected from there. Just trying to find out if it works with kerbals as well, to make it easier and a lot more efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if there is a way to do that, then maybe I can test/have fun with an unstable contraption I made. Right now, it self destructs if I approach from too far after it loads in. I\u0027ll eventually fix it, but just want to do preliminary testing before I change it, if at all possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T17:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0you can also go to the map screen, and try zooming in to your max to select it. but if your still to close, and can only seem to click on your own ship, \u00A0 this can be made even easier if you rename your ship, and change its type to something different then your target.\u00A0 so when your in map screen, at the top you can make some types not appear on the map.\u00A0 this will remove your ship making it easier to click on your target\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
