Just started playing this game properly, and have been having some trouble building rockets. The rocket builder sometimes doesn\\\u0027t let me place struts between parts (multiple attempts are required). Parts bunch up in stages (see below), and after a failed launch, some struts disappear or \\\u0027break\\\u0027 in the vehicle building area, meaning I have to place tham again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so just now I placed a set of six struts after placing 2 sets of 3 struts. They\\\u0027ve all bunched up into one stage, and I can only move all 12 between different stages. When I delete any of the sets of struts to place them again, the new struts automatically drop into the stage that the other struts are in. How do I move each individual strut or set of struts between stages? For the rocket I\\\u0027m making, I can\\\u0027t have all the struts break at any one stage. I\\\u0027m on the lastest version (v0.13.01 I think) and using stock parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m also having the same problem with fuel tanks. Not sure if it\\\u0027s a bug or not...

Because of this, I can\\\u0027t think of a reason why the stage your struts are in should make a difference in function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the strut placement issue, it\\\u0027s a side effect of the way struts function, which is to fix the second anchor at the first intersection between the given start end points. I don\\\u0027t know the specific mechanics of it, but I think there\\\u0027s some opportunity for adjustment and optimization there on the developers\\\u0027 end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hypocee","CreatedById":8609,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-19T21:03:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStruts (and fuel lines) in symmetrical arrangements are pretty broken in .13.*thanks to a bug introduced to their raycasting. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=5854.msg76299#msg76299\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIt\\\u0027s reported\u003C/a\u003E fixed for future releases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-19T22:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general, it doesn\\\u0027t matter what stage the struts are in (hmm... it might maybe be an idea to make them hideable so they don\\\u0027t clutter the staging list... maybe a suggestion to make...), they are \u0027always on\u0027, just like fins or fuel lines, and they will detach automatically when the couplers that hold the stage they secure blow. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
