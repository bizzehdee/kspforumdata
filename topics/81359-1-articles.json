It launched on October 3, 1942 and hilariously enough, it actually was a failed test. It only went as high as it did because it flew more steeply than intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut while Wernher von Braun\u0027s achievement is commendable on that front, and he performed it with the full intent of eventually developing spaceflight (he stated as early as 1930 that he would definitely go to the Moon someday), you need more than quickly peeking into space and then falling back down to really claim to be performing spaceflight. Sputnik-1 showed for the first time not only how to get up there but actually \u003Cem\u003Estay up there\u003C/em\u003E. It is also directly responsible for triggering the Space Race and all of its remarkable achievements, because the USA were deeply shocked at being beaten to the punch by the Russians. That is why 1957 is regarded as the dawn of spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agamemnon","CreatedById":10912,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T12:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eand actually... the harder part of an orbital spaceflight is not to get high enough, but to be fast enough\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T13:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1957 is generally considered the start because Sputnik was able to achieve actual Earth orbit, something no other craft had done before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch and orbit of Sputnik was the tipping point that began the USA/USSR Space Race, as the American government was not too happy about a communist government beating the US into a stable orbit and receiving data back from a satellite.
