Don\u0027t add engines with symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from ^THIS^ issue, adding engines and intakes like this is pretty much guaranteed to cause uneven flame-out due to intake starvation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd the fuselage sections first, then add the engines and intakes in an alternating sequence to that each engine is added after the intakes that you intend should supply that engine with air, then move on to the next intake and it\u0027s engines etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for intake to engine ratios that are 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 etc, add them in this order: intakes - engine - intakes - engine etc (remember, NO symmetry for this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere you have more than 1 intake per engine but less than 2 intakes per engine (say, 2 nacelles with intakes and engines, and one radial intake on the centre line) add the odd intakes after the engines, so in the order: intake - engine - intake - engine - remaining intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s causing this issue is probably a bug from 0.9 and nothing you\u0027ve done or are doing.

However I found this kind of symmetry issue dating back at least to 0.23.5 when you merge mirror and radial symmetry. I used to do that with subassemblies before 0.90 and the issue was present even if slightly different.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T14:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027ve also experienced that in previous versions. My guess is it was less obvious then because it could only happen if you transferred subassemblies between the VAB and SPH, so probably hasn\u0027t become a priority bugfix. Now the SPH and VAB have both symmetries AND you can load crafts from either into either, so an old minor bug has become more prevalent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine Squad will get round to it sooner now that it\u0027s more likely to crop up with people taking advantage of the simpler transfer system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, try to avoid letting the symmetry become confused. If it does, you may have no option but to start over.
