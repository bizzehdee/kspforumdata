If it\u0027s not clear by the image I am using quite a few mods. Basically my issue is that my robotic arm is flopping all over the place and I am looking for a way to secure it for launch, then be able to move it around in space, then secure it back for reentry. My main issue is that it moves out of the cargo bay when launching causing stability issues due to Ferram Aerospace, same deal on returning but it\u0027s much worse and a challenge keeping it on the right track so I don\u0027t end up in a fatal stall. My only solution right now is securing it with struts attached to a decoupler for liftoff and have another decoupler for returning and I just jettison it when I am returning to Kerben. I would prefer not to do that because it ruins my reusablility aspect (although tehnically not there in the first place). Any suggestions on any ingenious way of using parts like they shouldn\u0027t be used or any mods to help remedy this would be greatly appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have taken an image of the return but I needed to keep the thing stable as I recovered from a stall which led me to only recover a few km above kerben.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://photos-5.dropbox.com/t/0/AADJ2FhGe6ijiZK3Xh114qbUuYSAfc-GFCRbwlWJavgDLQ/12/45861203/png/1024x768/2/_/0/2/screenshot168.png/IiMjWyrk11Ju2F0Od3tjbbUy7Xnrub6hc5Eh1VWJG8U\u0022 alt=\u0022IiMjWyrk11Ju2F0Od3tjbbUy7Xnrub6hc5Eh1VWJG8U\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally these pictures aren\u0027t necessary but I like to show off my creation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://photos-5.dropbox.com/t/0/AACJb9uESOAChwiQZfbgjRe3KwYLOMgaFk3SSmexrnesqQ/12/45861203/png/1024x768/2/_/0/2/screenshot174.png/rr58K6NKvx4YC5-9XjN2SifLRLWjrVil0N-hLV8Z2Oo\u0022 alt=\u0022rr58K6NKvx4YC5-9XjN2SifLRLWjrVil0N-hLV8Z2Oo\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://photos-5.dropbox.com/t/0/AACkwIia5gZQRgEGAuGqg5pmsa3BXAzg7WLj1G6559v9Nw/12/45861203/png/1024x768/2/_/0/2/screenshot177.png/lWTHhpqNVTWL0SD1jmtoPgIbkkU6WjG9uwGlQDeSsAg\u0022 alt=\u0022lWTHhpqNVTWL0SD1jmtoPgIbkkU6WjG9uwGlQDeSsAg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-27T22:20:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2014 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mojobojo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayfare","CreatedById":52072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T22:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you considered docking ports instead of decouplers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mojobojo","CreatedById":68725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T22:19:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wayfare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wayfare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave you considered docking ports instead of decouplers?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the arm is considered part of the ship the docking ports don\u0027t collide with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayfare","CreatedById":52072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T22:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mojobojo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mojobojo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause the arm is considered part of the ship the docking ports don\u0027t collide with each other.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so you should still be able to dock them up - it\u0027s the same principle as people who use multiple docking ports as structural connectors in the VAB (they dock when physics load) or even in docking operations (they never dock at exactly the same time, so at some brief point there is one ship docking several ports together on itself).
