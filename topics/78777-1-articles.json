In short the engine does not activate by staging in orbit, it does on pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T08:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried right clicking the part and choosing \u0022run test\u0022 from the popup menu?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T11:08:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t have \u0022run test\u0022 on it, has on most other engines except SRB, that was why I treated it as an SRB, launched upside down on another launcher, then activate with space then in correct orbit, I now managed to get the engine to activate but it did not help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes this is test three, two with the upside down launch, this used a mainsail rater than another 1x2 as lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
