But once they have seen everything they want to see they disappear along with all the experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion is to remember the tourists after completing the missions and that the same tourists will spawn new missions. If you accept the mission, you will get the tourist back at the experience level he was at before. That would give you a reason to keep picking tourist missions. You could progressively\u00A0\u0022train\u0022 your tourists by picking their missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make this feature not completely pointless, it would be cool if they received abilities and bonuses like the other kerbonaut classes. An example would be getting additional reputation when visiting new sites, also those that are originally not part of the mission. Higher level tourists receive higher rewards. Higher level tourists will also demand more difficult destinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis adds to the stakes of tourist missions. Not only are you risking failing the mission, you might also lose Tourfred Kerman, the level 4\u00A0tourist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlkBltChemie","CreatedById":135033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T20:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a really cool idea!\u00A0 I especially like the suggested bonuses for making it more worthwhile, in particular the additional reputation for visiting sites not in the original itinerary (which would be very useful for the multi-tourist missions where each one wants to go somewhere else).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royying","CreatedById":20591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T21:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh level tourist should able to EVA on surface, reward a lot of rep and money\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skalou","CreatedById":133496,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T21:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222309825\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127024\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449351608\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002220591\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022royying\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, royying said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh level tourist should able to EVA on surface, reward a lot of rep and money\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeeah !! and take pictures of anomaly too!
