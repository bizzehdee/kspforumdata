No waste is built up, no food is consumed, nothing. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s even reading correctly, as it shows my food and water as 1.0 instead of other values like 86 and what not. It\u0027s definitely not working because I\u0027ve done a month long expedition to Minmas with no resources and my Kerbal survived just fine.
