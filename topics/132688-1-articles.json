\u00A0Tactics and Maneuvering,\u003C/em\u003E which is THE BIBLE of air combat amongst real-life fighter pilots. \u00A0Shaw was a Top Gun instructor. \u00A0I\u0027m lucky enough to have an autographed

\u00A0Anyway....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll planes lose speed in turns. \u00A0it\u0027s unavoidable, because the turning process necessary increases drag while it\u0027s happening due to increasing AoA, yaw, and control surface deflection, all of which increase the plane\u0027s effective frontal area. \u00A0And the change in AoA and/or yaw also points the engine off the direction of travel so you have less thrust than before going to maintaining your previous speed. \u00A0Thus, you\u0027re going to lose speed during a turn and all you can do is try to minimize this. \u00A0To minimize the speed loss during turns, you need to fly the thing so as to minimize the AoA and/or yaw relative to your current direction of travel, which essentially means not turning so hard. \u00A0But the faster you\u0027re going, the wider the turn radius, and the less hard you turn, the larget the turn radius, which goes against maneuverability. \u00A0So what do you do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT (added):\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EFirst off, you need to define maneuverability. \u00A0There are 2 things about turning that are important: \u00A0turn RADIUS (how tight the turn is) and turn RATE (how fast the turn is in degrees/second). \u00A0Turn RADIUS is pretty much entirely a function of speed. \u00A0The faster you\u0027re going, the wider you turn due basically to the vector addition nature of the process. \u00A0Turn RATE, OTOH, varies. \u00A0It is highest\u00A0at \u0022corner velocity\u0022, which is a function of the plane\u0027s design, and is usually not much above the plane\u0027s accelerated stall speed (like in a hard turn), which is considerably higher than the plane\u0027s normal, level, low-speed stall speed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003ETurn RATE is generally more important for the opening\u00A0and mid-game stages of the fight because it\u0027s what lets you change directions quickly to gain the advantage. \u00A0Turn RADIUS, OTOH, is usually only important in the final stages of the fight when you\u0027re going for or trying to avoid the kill shot. \u00A0By this point, at least one of the planes will have bled energy through repeated maneuvering to be below its corner speed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EAnyway, to get good turn rates and radii,\u00A0there are\u00A02 pretty much mutually exclusive approaches.\u003C/span\u003E \u00A0One is to make the plane a \u0022turn-fighter\u0022, the other is to make it an \u0022energy-fighter\u0022 (or E-fighter). \u00A0The difference between them is plane in which they turn. \u00A0Turn-fighters work mostly in the horizontal\u00A0plane, E-fighters turn in the vertical plane. \u00A0Thus, they need rather different design characteristics. \u00A0I\u0027ll discuss turn-fighters first because they\u0027re more intuitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen doing ANY turn (horizontal or vertical),, the main turning force comes not from the control surfaces (or engine gimbal) but the lift vector of the wing. \u00A0You roll the plane to point the lift vector in the direction you want to turn, then use the elevator to increase the AoA of the wing so that it makes more lift, which pulls the plane around in the desired direction. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u00A0And for the best sustained turn, you want to be doing this while maintaining a specific speed called \u0022corner velocity\u0022, which is the speed at which the plane has the highest turn rate and a reasonably small turn radius. \u00A0At higher speeds, you have a bigger turn radius due to momentum and reaching G limits, and a lower turn rate due to not being able to pull so hard around. \u00A0At lower speeds, you have to ease off on the turning to prevent stalling but have a smaller turn radius due to lower speed. \u00A0\u003C/span\u003ETo maintain corner velocity through a series of turns, such as doing a horizontal scissors with the enemy, you have to be in a slight dive, so that the speed gained from falling counters the speed lost by turning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for a turn-fighter, wing area is more important than thrust. \u00A0The more wing area for the plane\u0027s weight (IOW, the lower its wing loading), the lower its corner velocity. \u00A0The lower its corner velocity, the tighter its best turn radius will be, and the less altitude it has to lose to maintain speed through the turn. \u00A0In WW2, the early Zeros, Spitfires, and Bf-109s were like this. \u00A0Problem is, more wing area means more drag which means lower top speed. \u00A0And the lower the corner velocity, the lower top speed you want so you\u0027re always close to your corner velocity when you need it. \u00A0All of this limits the plane\u0027s performance in the vertical. \u00A0To try to work around\u00A0this, you can use flaps very sparingly. \u00A0The purpose of these flaps is to increase wing area slightly without adding much drag, so you can have a higher top speed between turns. \u00A0The WW2 P-51, P-38, and N1K1 (among others) had such flaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there\u0027s the E-fighter. \u00A0This plane\u0027s turns are done in the vertical plane so it needs high TWR and high speed, which means less wing area and higher wing loading. \u00A0The F-104 is the quintessential E-fighter. \u00A0Such planes can\u0027t turn very well at all in the horizontal plane but can zoom vertically quite well. \u00A0As they go up, they slow down. \u00A0At the top of their zooms, they\u0027re going slow enough that they can flip over like in a tight loop and start back down. \u00A0As they dive back down, they regain most of the speed they lost during the zoom. \u00A0They also roll while pointing vertically downward to align their lift vectors with the target\u0027s future position, then pull out to intercept it. \u00A0The whole vertical maneuver has a very large turn radius in the vertical plane, but the projection of the maneuver into the horizontal plane has a very tight turn radius. \u00A0It\u0027s therefore possible for an E-fighter to have an effectively tighter or at least equal turn radius in the horizontal plane than a turn-fighter. \u00A0However, the E-fighter is still losing speed each turn so can only do this a few times before losing so much speed that it can no longer zoom effectively. \u00A0And when that happens, the turn-fighter will be all over it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally prefer E-fighters because they\u0027re inherently faster and fly higher than turn-fighters. \u00A0This enables them to dictate the terms of the fight or whether it happens at all. \u00A0Then, if they don\u0027t win after a few passes, they\u0027re still moving faster than the turn-fighter so can disengage at will, go off somewhere safe, regain their energy, and come back for a rematch \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022

you don\u0027t really mention much there, which is relatively new, is thrust vectoring and post stall manouvering.\u00A0 Not sure if any KSP mods give you full 2D thrust vectoring but it potentially allows an aircraft to temporarily face in a drastically different direction to it\u0027s velocity vector in order to lock weapons to a target, but at the cost of a lot of momentum.\u00A0 With modern targeting systems and all aspect missiles I\u0027m not entirely convinced how useful that is, but it looks good and in KSP where you don\u0027t have fancy radars and capable missiles it could be of

lot of speed)\u00A0in \u0022Sharkey\u0022 Wards book on the Falklands, despite it often being mentioned as a capability of the Harrier, so I wonder if that was another manoeuvre which sounded good on paper but never really had any use in combat.\u00A0 Mind you it was a long time ago I read it.\u00A0 I\u0027d not heard of using a small amount of vectoring to tighten the turn though, that makes a

Brit fleet was right at the extreme range of the Argentine attack planes so the latter didn\u0027t have enough few to divert much from the straight run there and back. \u00A0But I do recall it being mentioned a lot at the time (i was in the process of deploying to the war so was paying lots of attention to events \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022

factor, was that this was the 1st major use of all-aspect IR missiles, and defensive tactics hadn\u0027t caught up with that

He could dive upon his opponent, gaining a sizable speed advantage for a hit and run attack. Or, if the enemy had too many advantages- numbers for instance- a pilot could fly away with a good head start.
