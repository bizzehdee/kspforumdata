I mean in Sandbox, every single ship I sent up had at least one of the huge Orange Fuel Tanks, most had 3 to 5 of em, and that was for everything from putting something in LKO, to a Mun landing, to Interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in career mode, I was amazed at how I could get into orbit with nothing but the starter solid boosters, and the 200 power engine. I\u0027m amazed I was able to get to the Mun\u0027s orbit with nothing but the boosters and the same engine. In Sandbox that would have taken me some massive 6 stage ship loaded with fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m just a noob who over did my rockets, but I find this fun seeing what I can do with these limited parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jduchock","CreatedById":82906,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T18:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etotally agree... career mode forced me to rethink my efficiencies on on dV, TWR, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatfluffycat","CreatedById":73913,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T18:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enoob, overkill much?
