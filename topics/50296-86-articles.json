We\u0027ll get it sorted soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether or not the settings for 5.2 and earlier had a need to be custom tuned for stock KSP is debatable. Historically the DRE thread is LITTERED with complaints that stock KSP reentry is not deadly enough. The reason why is because in stock KSP you never have orbital velocities that are fast enough to be very hazardous. (lower velocities means less heating) Couple that with the fact that the time spent in reentry to stock Kerbin (or most KSP planets) is shorter and reentry isn\u0027t that hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen transitioning to RSS, settings don\u0027t have to be tuned at all. Greater reentry velocity, thicker atmospheres and longer reentry times will handle that. It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eheat shields\u003C/em\u003E that required tuning for RSS. (to make them more durable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as tuning, it was done during testing with a stock Kerbin but also taking into account that people seem to want more danger so one of the things I bumped up was the shockwaveExponent.
