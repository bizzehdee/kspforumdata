I really enjoy traveling through time to distant planets and the Mun with the Kerbals! They are very entertaining creatures to me, and extremely brave I might add. I picked up a copy of KSP a few months ago, but have really just began my journey out into space in the past recent weeks. I have yet to land any where other than the Mun, and both runways on Kerbin as well, but I continue to try. My last Mission attempt was to see how close I could get to the sun and live to tell about it, but some years into running only on solar power, I moved to 20.2, so I will take that mission with a much upgraded design!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy newest attempts have been weapons!! I was never really into weapon designs in KSP but today I decided to give it a go.. well, something like that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a look, what is this? well, this is... Charlie! Yea, that is what we will call it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3XNdQto.png\u0022 alt=\u00223XNdQto.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECharlie is an extremely simple design, basically in his infant state currently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few...

Next area of focus is of coarse, the aim! It is slightly off you could say!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6GPmVIk.png\u0022 alt=\u00226GPmVIk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enone the less, I really enjoy this game! It is nice to have a break from the shoot it up bang bang live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse style game play! And really get out there and explore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T07:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello!
