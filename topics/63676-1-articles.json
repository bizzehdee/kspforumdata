To this end it\u0027s equipped with much more fuel allowing for return trips from many bodies, landing lights and legs, much less savage TWR, a high gain antenna such that it can relay scientific readings from the rover and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eact as a target for bouncing laser beams off\u003C/a\u003E (I know - not really relevant in KSP, but, well, imagination). The rover was also improved, maintaining 6-wheel drive \u0026amp; low centre of mass whilst adding RCS powered roll-recovery, RTG power in addition to solar, and a command chair for rescue missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Incredible Adventures of Fido the Rescue Rover!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vxdjR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Initially Fido is configured with front wheel steering and six wheel drive. Remember steering and motor power can be individually toggled for each wheel to suit conditions and battery power. As with all rovers, one may find control is more stable when using the docking mode controls (lower left).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFido is equipped with RCS thrusters to enable self-righting after a roll and to allow for a \u0022hop\u0022 up to the base station docking port when parking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFido makes just one use of part-clipping. Part clipping is something I\u0027m rather down upon in Xeldrak\u0027s BSC challenges as I feel it hinders a new player\u0027s ability to decipher the inner workings of a stock craft. In this instance however I feel justified in using it - the RTG generator is clipped inside the octagonal scaffold at Fido\u0027s hindquarters. Here I feel clipping makes sense from an engineering perspective (that really is just scaffold around an empty space - may as well fill that void with something useful), and from a new player perspective in that the result is clearly visible externally without disassembly; plus the clipping is detailed in the in-game description along with instructions on how to do it (ie. Alt-F12).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzCQMKilmnyaZW1CUjFvVHFPOWM/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ECraft file is here\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HazelPine","CreatedById":164526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T15:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!
