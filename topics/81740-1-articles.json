Now I\u0027ve embarked on a few missions and been reading how to get into orbit properly and such. I have done so and everything has been going rather well. Now I came to load up the game today and I noticed it said 2 flights in progress, that was odd I thought I\u0027d recovered all my vehicles, there may be (and was) a ship on the launch pad but what about the other flight? I don\u0027t remember launching anything and not bringing it back so off to the tracking station I went thinking I probably just EVA\u0027d and needed to recover a vehicle and then I saw it....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi62.tinypic.com/2i87v35.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222i87v35.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat in the perfectly circular orbit?

Who the hell is Hadming Kerman? All of my flights have been by the ever present Jeremiah. So what are we dealing with here? I notice that it is 2 days after the new year, did we all get so drunk at the New Years party we fired Hadming into orbit? Did he come here from across the oceans of stars to see us and how on Kerbin did he do that? One thing is for sure, we have to find out who Hadming Kerman is and how the bloody hell he got up there! We only have 1 man command pods right now, we don\u0027t quite have the technology, or the skill to get to this man back without him hanging on to the rails of our pod, will he survive reentry to the planet on the ladders of the command module? Who knows. It\u0027s worth a shot. This mission is off the books, no one on planet Kerbin can know about this, a potential alien...or even worse a damn terrible use of funds! We need answers!

Since you appear to not mind using guides, there are plenty of tutorials on how to do an orbital rendezvous, making two ships meet in orbit. I would suggest you not do the mission immediately, as it isn\u0027t usually worth much money/rep, and a surprisingly advanced mission.
