I do feel like it\u0027ll end up being a similar situation with KSP and KSP2 as there was with TESV LE vs TESV SSE; it took several months before Bethesda even got the Creation Kit (Modding Tools) redone for SSE. And then there were a couple key dependencies for mods that took much longer to rebuild, and as a result SSE lagged far behind modded LE for some time (Even now there\u0027s some mods that aren\u0027t ported over).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut after that several year spool time? The performance improvements of SSE on more modern hardware, the ability to use \u0026gt; 2.8GB of RAM and the improved stability absolutely CRUSHED LE for me.

They have GTA Online and numerous other franchises to \u0022Drive recurrent user spending\u0022 as a corporate windbag would put it.

I think after a certain point; some just get fed up with it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do see SQUAD making an effort, i have seen the numerous improvements between 1.6.1 and 1.8.1 and praised them. But i still have to use KSPWheel and a set of cobbled-together and unsupported patches to make the stock landing gear and legs behave reasonably, i still have to watch part count even on stupid powerful systems, i still have to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E to get somewhat realistic aero modeling, i still have to wait several minutes for a decently modded install to load...etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there\u0027s so many features that i consider \u0022Basically Stock\u0022 that i get from mods, and the wonderful people who make and maintain them can decide whenever they want to pull chocks and stop. That\u0027s always a lingering source of worry for me personally, and one of another reasons i hope KSP2 doesn\u0027t turn into a flop or a cash grab. So much of my time with KSP has been dependent on thousands of combined man-hours of time that these people decided to volunteer without ever being asked or requesting anything in return for their efforts, and it could all be gone with a single request on their end when i woke up some day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking things like multiple planetary systems, near future tech and colonization stock will reduce that drastically, along with opening new avenues for future modders to explore and pursue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah; i\u0027ll give SQUAD plenty of credit. But I\u0027m also extremely worried that KSP is held together by a pretty tangled series of mods with various difficulties in recreating them if something were to happen, not to mention that those mods actually often depend on OTHER mods to allow them to function by working around SQUAD\u0027s implementation of some things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2; if it delivers would fix that or at least reduce it heavily. I don\u0027t think blind optimism is warranted, and there\u0027s plenty of reasons to be skeptical of the entire project. But there\u0027s a very good reason i want them to succeed, and why iv\u0027e criticized both KSP and the development of KSP2 so heavily where it needed to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T06:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223814606\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593840233\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022harrisjosh2711\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, harrisjosh2711 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince performance is not an issue for me.

And there\u0027s quite a variety of \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022Modern\u0022 games that you can run at 60\u002B FPS on an IGPU; though the bulk of them are Esports titles and would have to be ran at Low or Medium settings. Though the primary reason why KSP specifically can run on such limited hardware is because the majority of the load is on the physics calculations; which are done via the CPU.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThey actually have quite a bit of headroom to pump graphics without actually raising the ceiling for system requirements too much if they want as a result. They\u0027ll likely go beyond that even, and those with more limited hardware can just turn down the respective settings. The biggest shift is KSP2 is being developed on DX11 natively, so they\u0027ll have modern graphics features on tap from day one. Even if they\u0027re not utilized, modders would still be able to call their functions via unity that were exposed via API\u0027s and implement their own solutions. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EKSP moved to DX11 recently (Same time they added reflections if i recall), so there hasn\u0027t been anywhere near the time or drive among SQUAD or the modding community to use DX11\u0027s features. Though there\u0027s some really cool stuff already out there using it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T09:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223814484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593823215\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022harrisjosh2711\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, harrisjosh2711 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na mid range system\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223814484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593823215\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022harrisjosh2711\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, harrisjosh2711 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$1300\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223814606\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593840233\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177745\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022harrisjosh2711\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, harrisjosh2711 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0liquid cooled desktop.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you overestimate what a mid range system is for most people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Incarnation of Chaos","CreatedById":197414,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T09:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223814696\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593853749\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you overestimate what a mid range system is for most people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A01300 USD is still considered \u0022Mid-Range\u0022, but it\u0027s definitely in the upper category.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut even a 600 USD dollar desktop could tear into KSP2, you can get quite a bit of performance these days for not too much money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T11:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223813791\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593742827\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022205942\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSPMan123211\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/3/2020 at 3:20 AM, KSPMan123211 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeriously, i can\u0027t get a newer computer just to play KSP, And it\u0027s one of my favorite games, and I really want to be able to play KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately these things happen.
