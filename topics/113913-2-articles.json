You\u0027re dreaming. The debate is over we have already had it. Should a big disclaimer be enough, yes it should. Is it enough, no. You are overestimating the collective intelligence of the Internet. All we can do now is wait for a universally stable Win64 release. Like you said you are fresh. But that means that you didn\u0027t see the flames that arose from people re-releasing mods without the consent of the author recompiled for Win64. I don\u0027t usually like to be this harsh but that\u0027s what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T01:53:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince you\u0027re asking to understand, I think I\u0027ll fill you in on a brief history of win64 KSP builds and how this has all gone. It helps explain a lot of how this worked out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt starts back in 0.23.5. Up until this point, while Squad has toyed with win64 KSP builds privately, none of them were deemed stable enough to be released. Someone (whose name escapes me currently) in gets into modding by coming up with the method to hack a win64 build of KSP together; the same exact method that is used for the current hack. It gathers a small following, despite the random crashes, and some work starts to try and determine what mods are compatible with win64 KSP. The thread fills with contradictions and misinformation, with mods listed in the OP as \u0022incompatible\u0022 being reported working fine later on, and lots of bad solutions throughout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, because of user interest, Squad releases a win64 build of KSP for version 0.24. It is more stable than 0.23.5\u0027s hack (in that a rather critical, reproducible bug was fixed by upgrading Unity versions), but it still crashes rather frequently and without warning; despite this, no warning of its instability is mentioned anywhere in the store or on Steam. The end result is that a large number of people who had previously not used win64 jumped on to it and suffered a ton of issues once they installed mods and increased the memory usage, leading to them (wrongly) blaming the mods, rather than the broken engine/game. This is compounded with a new PartModule saving bug, that could cause issues like multiple instances of engine modules to show up on re-loaded vehicles. Simply due to the mechanisms of the bug, lots of mods got hit with the stock behavior from two sides, turning support for 0.24.0 into a living nightmare; the PartModule bug was fixed for 0.24.1 and 0.24.2, but the win64 crashes weren\u0027t, and in a bid to reduce the workload, lots of modders declared \u0022NO SUPPORT FOR WIN64 KSP BUILDS.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, this didn\u0027t work. No one bothered to read OPs, people continued to blame mods for crashes due to the stock game, and a large number of users simply refused to believe that win64 KSP was unstable; if it was, why would Squad have released it, especially without a warning? In the lead up to 0.25, a few modders (including myself) asked for Squad to pull win64 builds. They were unstable, modders didn\u0027t support them, and the crashes were most often caused by high memory usage (read: above 3 Gb); if the win64 build became unstable when memory usage was still below the 4 Gb limit, why bother with it? It\u0027s useless for mods. Further, word was that 0.25 would have Porkjet\u0027s SpacePlane Plus mod integrated, increasing stock memory usage, possibly making the stock game less stable, and certainly making modding it less stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey didn\u0027t pull it. Instead, they only added a label of it being \u0022unstable,\u0022 but by this point, users didn\u0027t care that it was labelled unstable; they were certain it was the mod\u0027s fault, it couldn\u0027t possibly be KSP itself, and the modder not providing support was a jackass. Best solution was to keep demanding support, keep telling people bad ideas to \u0022fix\u0022 mods that were fine (that would cause support issues later), and generally just make support work for modders. So a bunch of us made the decision to lock out mods from functioning on win64 builds of KSP using the CompatibilityChecker utility that many mods include. (Side note: locking out mods on incompatible versions of KSP was the original concept of CC; it was downgraded to warnings for the first usage after some debate, but it\u0027s funny that users pushed it back towards its original plan). If users wouldn\u0027t read the OP and understand \u0022not supported,\u0022 maybe they\u0027d understand when they couldn\u0027t run it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything. Went. To. Hell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently one KSP version with win64 was sufficient to make users expect it forevermore. Flamewars erupted, people filled mod threads with hell over this, and even threw enough flak at Squad over this that they needed to make an official statement saying, in essence, \u0022No, modders don\u0027t owe you anything, they can choose not to support or even allow their mods to work on win64 if they so choose.\u0022 Which is kind of amazing that such a post was needed, but I digress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leads to a few adventures in other technically proficient non-modders taking steps to try and undermine this. One of these was Cerebrate, who initially tried to release a fork of stupid_chris\u0027 RealChutes with the win64 locking removed, which was removed due to not including he proper license; this led to stupid_chris re-licensing RealChutes with a more restrictive license to try and avoid this (with a few bugfixes as well), while Cerebrate created the first of the win64 UnFixer utilities to hack the dlls as a way around this. The end result is that stupid_chris took a rather long hiatus after that and nearly quit modding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother adventure was that of Senshi trying to maintain win64 forks of FAR and a few other mods (I forget which), on the basis that he would handle all the bug reports and nonsense from that. Despite this, people still tried to get support from the original modders and bring win64 issues to our threads; I only found out because Senshi\u0027s fork of FAR was off of a dev version that included a rather predictable bug that occurred in a few support requests in my thread. Eventually he gave up because of win64\u0027s instability combined with the users that he had and the mess involved there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings stayed relatively calm throughout 0.90, with the occasional thread on this subject, some like yours, others insisting that all the modders must irrationally hate win64 because it stole their firstborn or something, few of them wanting to accept the answer of, \u0022leaving all of this open makes modding enough work that it makes us consider quitting. Please stop making this difficult for us, or you\u0027ll eventually lose us.\u0022 I guess the idea that you could be causing problems for people is best answered by being a jerk and causing problems to prove they\u0027re right? I dunno, few of the response really made sense to me with those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, the leadup to 1.0 comes around, and Maxmaps floats a trial balloon about pulling win64 on a Squadcast, and pretty much all the modders involved in this have a combination of, \u0022finally!\u0022 and \u0022what took you so long?\u0022 as their reaction. 1.0 comes out, win64 is pulled, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Esadly, Linux 64 was as well, despite its stability (seriously, never had any issues with Linux 64 and mods, no idea why they pulled that).\u003C/span\u003E edit: nope, they didn\u0027t; misunderstanding on my part. Things look like they might be stable again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the win64 hack comes back, and the thread starts up, with people trying to figure out which mods are compatible and which aren\u0027t, filled with contradictions and misinformation...
