You can hoard something if there is only few sources of it, and you control enough of them to control the price. If you get a platinum rich asteroid into Earth\u0027s orbit and prove exploiting it is profitable, several other companies will start their own endeavor to squeeze money from the space.

The problem is, the nuclear reaction produces immense waste heat and neutrons. There\u0027s supposed to be this swirling layer of water to protect the inside of the engine bell. Except, that water will vaporize, and be lost, reducing your ISP. That 479000 number sounds impossible as a result of this - the water you\u0027d lose would ruin your ISP. The 6.7k is marginal - NERVA engines could do 1k, and you have 36 times the power output by reacting the fuel directly without a heat exchanger. That sounds possible with a lot of engineering work. There would be a set of complex systems to cool the engine, probably using droplet radiators because they are immensely lighter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue is powered landings. Assuming you\u0027re trying to land on a vacuum moon, what do you do when you get near the surface of the Moon? Won\u0027t the exhaust reflected off the ground fry your engine and spacecraft? Maybe you could inject a lot of water into the exhaust right before touchdown, slashing your ISP but making the landing survivable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat neutron flux is really annoying. There\u0027s no stopping the neutrons from the fission reaction from impinging on your engine and dumping waste heat into all the components. This is why I\u0027ve been recently thinking that anuetronic fusion, if it can ever actually work, is a winner. Basic concept of the engine : the fuel is injected as plasma and the fusion happens in a continuous flow reaction, where the fuel stream passes through some honking big magnets and charged metal grids and is crushed with enough pressure to fuse. The exploding plasma then travels into the engine bell, which is immense, and is made of a latticework of magnet cables and empty spaces between them. The light from the reaction and many of the neutrons usually will pass through the gaps in the engine bell out to space. You also keep the neutron production down by this single-pass \u0022flow\u0022 of fuel, where the reacting fuel only gets a chance to fuse once, so there are less side reactions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exploding plasma is allowed to expand in the middle of the engine bell, but the alpha particles and electron products are redirected with a variety of magnetic and electric fields away from the engine components and out the back instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, almost none of the immense energy of the reaction actually heats up your engine, since none of the electrons or helium nuclei hit it, and you have all the components coated with a 99% reflective mirror material to reflect away light, and there are gaps in your engine bell that permit more than 50% of the light and neutrons to fly away into space instead of impinging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, this would let you jack the power output way, way up, possibly to sci-fi levels of thrust. (continuous burns of a decent fraction of a G - you would need terawatts of engine power to do this) Whether this is possible or not depends on things like how good you can really make your superconductors, whether we can get this fusion thing to actually work without needing a fission bomb to create the needed conditions, and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T12:59:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shynung\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shynung\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure a metal wool ball can reach the surface from past orbital velocity without disintegrating on the way down.
