You launch a robotic mission to the asteroid with some kind of ultra high ISP engine, like that ion engine that has an exhaust velocity of 210 kilometers/second (dual stage 4 grid). It lands, docks by connecting itself to solid rock with a drill (which is harder than it sounds as the ESA found out recently), and then over a period of years performs the burns to redirect the asteroid. \n\nBringing the fuel along might be impractical, it would be nice if the asteroid itself had a few tons of ice you could harvest. You\u0027d electrolyze the ice, and have an array of several VASIMR thrusters, some using pure oxygen and some using pure hydrogen as propellant. (or you would alternate)\n\nAnyways, so here it is headed towards Earth. Launch spacecraft to dock with it, collect the platinum and send it down? Nope. Spend fuel braking the asteroid? Nope. You\u0027d do just 2 things :\n\n1. Detach the nuclear reactor that powered the engine and send it on a course that will flyby Earth\n\n2. Send the thing to crash on land into the desert of kazakhstan at several kilometers/second. \n\nLithobraking will hopefully embed the platinum into a crater that is close enough to the surface so you can go scoop it up."},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T15:03:28Z","Content":"Four words.

Think steel wool, only made out of platinum. The drag on these things would be so high compared to their tiny weight that you could literally just toss them at the atmosphere and wait. With the right angle, they will slow down gradually without even warming up much.

That, and it leaves glowing-blue craters whenever it lifts off from unprotected ground.\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t be that simple an engine. The problem is, the nuclear reaction produces immense waste heat and neutrons. There\u0027s supposed to be this swirling layer of water to protect the inside of the engine bell. Except, that water will vaporize, and be lost, reducing your ISP. That 479000 number sounds impossible as a result of this - the water you\u0027d lose would ruin your ISP. The 6.7k is marginal - NERVA engines could do 1k, and you have 36 times the power output by reacting the fuel directly without a heat exchanger. That sounds possible with a lot of engineering work. There would be a set of complex systems to cool the engine, probably using droplet radiators because they are immensely lighter. \n\nAnother issue is powered landings. Assuming you\u0027re trying to land on a vacuum moon, what do you do when you get near the surface of the Moon? Won\u0027t the exhaust reflected off the ground fry your engine and spacecraft? Maybe you could inject a lot of water into the exhaust right before touchdown, slashing your ISP but making the landing survivable. \n\nThat neutron flux is really annoying. There\u0027s no stopping the neutrons from the fission reaction from impinging on your engine and dumping waste heat into all the components. This is why I\u0027ve been recently thinking that anuetronic fusion, if it can ever actually work, is a winner. Basic concept of the engine : the fuel is injected as plasma and the fusion happens in a continuous flow reaction, where the fuel stream passes through some honking big magnets and charged metal grids and is crushed with enough pressure to fuse. The exploding plasma then travels into the engine bell, which is immense, and is made of a latticework of magnet cables and empty spaces between them. The light from the reaction and many of the neutrons usually will pass through the gaps in the engine bell out to space. You also keep the neutron production down by this single-pass \u0022flow\u0022 of fuel, where the reacting fuel only gets a chance to fuse once, so there are less side reactions. \n\nThe exploding plasma is allowed to expand in the middle of the engine bell, but the alpha particles and electron products are redirected with a variety of magnetic and electric fields away from the engine components and out the back instead.\n\nIn theory, almost none of the immense energy of the reaction actually heats up your engine, since none of the electrons or helium nuclei hit it, and you have all the components coated with a 99% reflective mirror material to reflect away light, and there are gaps in your engine bell that permit more than 50% of the light and neutrons to fly away into space instead of impinging.\n\nIn theory, this would let you jack the power output way, way up, possibly to sci-fi levels of thrust. (continuous burns of a decent fraction of a G - you would need terawatts of engine power to do this) Whether this is possible or not depends on things like how good you can really make your superconductors, whether we can get this fusion thing to actually work without needing a fission bomb to create the needed conditions, and so forth."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T12:59:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure a metal wool ball can reach the surface from past orbital velocity without disintegrating on the way down.
