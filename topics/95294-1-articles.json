The game has crashed a few times but worked fine when I restarted it. However, this time, without a crash, I couldn\u0027t click on anything from the space center - right or left click, it just wouldn\u0027t do anything. Finally I got into R\u0026amp;D, and now I can\u0027t get out. I clicked the back button and it just displayed the space center\u0027s bars without actually going back. I can still manipulate the R\u0026amp;D screen, but neither back button works. I\u0027ve tried restarting, and it doesn\u0027t help. What can I do? Is this save permanently corrupted?\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZTFsF0m.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022ZTFsF0m.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggerAu","CreatedById":57838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T21:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGive this one a read ErasmoGnome - sounds familiar and Claw has done some work on figuring out how to fix/prevent it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105651-FIX-KSC-Buildings-Lock-Up-Can-t-Click-on-Anything-Firing-Kerbal-Crashes-Game\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105651-FIX-KSC-Buildings-Lock-Up-Can-t-Click-on-Anything-Firing-Kerbal-Crashes-Game\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T21:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrigger\u0027s right, that looks exactly like the same problem.
