As it stands right now, we manage time stamps in the space center scene. Every time you enter the space center, the script will check time stamps of any craft with a biogen module, and will attempt to update its resources based on the difference in time, rate and if the module is enabled or not. BUT, lets say for example you are focused on one craft and use Timewarp, then jump directly to another ship, there will be a discrepancy here. I need to go back in and add some points where it checks and/or updates time stamps for more than just entering the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
