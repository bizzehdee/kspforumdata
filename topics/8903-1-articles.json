There are two important things to know before getting started: orbital plane change maneuver and circularizing orbit. I won\u0027t be covering how to do these two tasks, so you will have to look those up on your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s pretend we have a space station sitting in a circular orbit of 100km. Our plan is, of course, to rendezvous with it. All of the tutorials I have seen on rendezvous involve a lot of guessing. This is because we have very basic instruments to guide us. But, there is one piece of information that we have that can tell us almost exactly when to initiate our intercept burn: distance to target. You can get this distance by hovering your mouse over the target diamond in your main view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the purposes of this tutorial, launch will be timed to insert into a parking orbit of 80km, ending up a little behind the station. After achieving a circular 80km, we wait to catch up to the point of intercept burn initialization. The question is: how do we know when to do our intercept burn?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe math is not hard to understand. We start out with both craft at the same point, and work backwards to the intercept burn point. We know how much time it takes to go from the burn point to intercept, and can determine the position of the target at that time. We can then solve for the relative distance between the two objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttached is a table I made with the distance to target you have to wait for (any distance above 100km, and you won\u0027t see it due to the visibility limit). In the case of this tutorial, the distance we need it 50.4km (680km row, 700km column. Kerbin\u0027s radius is 600km). When we come within 100km range, the target diamond will appear and we watch the range until 50.4km is achieved. Then we burn prograde, raising our apoapsis to 100km to match our target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou then just need to wait half an orbit. We watch as the space station passes overhead and then approaches from behind. Burn at apoapsis to complete the rendezvous maneuver. That wasn\u0027t so bad, was it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe table is also the same for Mun orbits from 480km to 600km (Mun\u0027s radius is 200km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETable:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/6108/rendezvousj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rendezvousj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload rendezvous table spreadsheet \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/i0pkuvc58jqhman/Rendezvous.xlsx?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehere\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*New*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have decided to attach the spreadsheet I used for the rendezvous table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Even newer*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a video tutorial:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QG_b1VK82Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-10T00:53:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2014 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kosmo-not\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-30T16:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh this is a gold nugget.
