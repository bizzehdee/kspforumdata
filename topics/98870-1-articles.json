This was no big deal when I used to just parachute in anywhere and recover, but now that I\u0027ve been doing much more aerocapturing and reusing equipment it\u0027s started to seem like a huge waste to make a big inclination burn to get back into an equatorial orbit so that I can rendezvous with my station and refuel.

At the apoapsis of a very eccentric Kerbin orbit, however, I\u0027ve done a 180 degree turn for 30m/s. But that was extreme, with the apoapsis at the very edge of the SOI. If memory serves, twenty degrees at a Mun-like apoapsis should be on the order of 100m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to make the apoapsis line up with an ascending or descending node, at least approximately.
