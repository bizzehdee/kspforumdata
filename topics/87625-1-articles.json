Digging the new spaceplane parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any of you who saw my .24 craft probably already know what\u0027s coming; you know that I like building large-ish SSTOs, and I have, ahem, a certain aesthetic sense. Which is to say, not much of one. I was more than happy to ram-spam the heck out of my previous attempts in the name of getting them into space without needing a complex or painfully slow ascent. Besides, I *like* seeing all that exposed machinery doing its work. But, by the time I managed to get an SSTO with two Jumbo-64s into LKO with a reasonable portion of their fuel left with .24, .25 was on its way. I tabled further efforts until release, expecting better things out of .25\u0027s intakes, particularly the shock cones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, they didn\u0027t seem to deliver so much on that front. Or maybe I\u0027m a worse pilot than I thought, that\u0027s entirely possible.. I had a very difficult time building a craft that could pick up enough speed before flaming out without bursting into uncomfortably bright flame along the way, so I ended up mounting shock cones where they made sense and spamming structural intakes, since that\u0027s at least marginally less ugly than quad-couplers full of intakes mounted all over the wings. I also went a little nuts with struts and canards to stiffen her up and still allow her to lift off the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, Rudolph Kurlitzer Pipe Organs and Spaceplanes is proud to present to you: the Mighty Kurlitzer! Oh yeah, she\u0027s got one hell of a set of pipes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0oJZWe6pqs8/VECwpSHCTuI/AAAAAAAADro/kORkNH7INYI/s640/220200_2014-10-16_00003.png\u0022 alt=\u0022220200_2014-10-16_00003.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my bad piloting, she\u0027ll deliver ~4100 fuel, ~4400 ox, 1500 monoprop, and 4 kerbals into 100km LKO, with the Long Adapter\u0027s worth of fuel for deorbiting and ~600 fuel for flying home. As always, better results can be had by better pilots. 329 parts, and as a bonus, marginally cheaper in-game than my previous offerings of this size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download\u0026amp;id=0B6h_jC64zB8dbjRaWnNyeFkzZUU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent: Before takeoff, activate SAS and resource display, throttle up to max, close two intake groups with action groups 1 (shock cones) and 2 (rear rank of structural intakes). Spacebar to get the party started. Only hit it once, or you\u0027ll punch off your nose gear! She isn\u0027t safe to take off or land without it. Rotate at the last set of marks adjacent to the VAB. Careful--it takes a short bit to get her nose up, but once it is, it\u0027s easy to over-rotate and start tumbling. After liftoff, gear up and 50 degrees AOA. It\u0027s a slow ascent, so YMMV, but 2x time compression is safe as far as I can tell. Open intake group 1 at 10km, and group 2 at 17km. Stop using time compression here, if applicable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart pitching forward at 18km so you hit zero AOA at 19km. The ship will continue to rise while you accelerate. As your rate of climb approaches zero, pitch up to 10 degrees to maintain altitude until she starts to flame a little bit, then pitch up to 13 degrees to start a slightly faster climb. You\u0027re shooting for 1800\u002B m/s at 28km, before the RAPIER engines switch modes automatically, so adjust your rate of climb as necessary as you approach these figures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen one of the center turbojets flames out, shut them both down with group 3. Following that, when your yaw starts to get dangerous due to further flameouts, activate RCS; the Vernor thrusters should add enough yaw control authority to prevent spins at full throttle. If you hold your altitude at about 28km, you might be able to eke out a bit more speed, but 1800 m/s is enough for orbit with a reasonable amount of fuel left for delivery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the RAPIER engines will switch modes, and some of the turbojets will spring back to life. Pitch up to 45 degrees to get your apoapsis rising. SAS and RCS should still keep you stable, though you might have a persistent yaw to one side. Once you\u0027ve reached the desired apoapsis (with a small cushion to account for remaining atmospheric drag), kill your thrust. Group 4 will shut down all jets and toggle all intakes closed. Disable RCS. Above 72k would be a good time to deploy the Gigantors with group 0. Finally, circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescent: If you consider the Jumbo-64s your payload and empty them entirely, transfer the fuel from the Mk1 fuselages into the Mk2 fuselages, filling them relatively evenly, and time your deorbit so you return to powered flight nearish KSP, you should have enough fuel in the nose cone (don\u0027t forget to enable its fuel and ox flow) to deorbit from 100km, and fly home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse your deorbit burn to lower your periapsis to about 40km. (I try to place the periapsis over the nearest part of the desert to KSP.) Once you\u0027ve done that, hit 4 again to reopen all intakes, then 5 to shut down the RAPIER engines and reactivate the turbojets. You may also want to close the shock cones again with group 1; during a test reentry with them open, she flipped and tried to fly backwards. Don\u0027t forget to close the docking port and solar panels above 35km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet your speed bleed off to the point you\u0027re comfortable flying, apply thrust, and bring it home. Use groups 1 and 2 to toggle your intakes, using them as airbrakes as necessary. Use group 6 to reactivate the RAPIER engines and toggle them back to air-breathing if you want more thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really was a lot tougher to make this one work. I was hoping to *not* have to airhog the crap out of larger spaceplanes with .25. Structural intakes just don\u0027t provide a lot of air; their only saving grace is being able to pack \u0027em in. Having done so, I think perhaps the best part of this craft is her name.
