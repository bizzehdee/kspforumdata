After rebooting, the computer was running very slowly and the mouse was doing crazy things (like scrolling three pages instead of three lines) and KSP was so slow it was unplayable, so the software was uninstalled. All is now good again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what the issue is but since the mouse is working fine - and was before - it lends credence to the adage \u0027If it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it!\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T10:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas the update something to do with mouse polling frequency?
