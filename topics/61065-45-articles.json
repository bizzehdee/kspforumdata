It is necessary to approach the design from a technical point of view. Thus, the Ribbons must be redrawn (or converted) to a resolution of 128x32 pixels. Should be stored in files with a resolution (maximum) 2048x2048 pixels (like textures size). And when displayed on the screen, you need to pull out of the image 128x32 (by accessing it with x,y coords and width,height parameters). You can leave the original size of the ribbons, but centered in the area with a resolution of 128x32.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage is to minimize read/write operations between memories (HDD/RAM/VRAM) and may reduce the errors and crashes.
