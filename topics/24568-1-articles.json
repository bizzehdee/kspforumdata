The worlds of the Kerbol system are not identical to ours, but neither are they to each other. Kerbin has a very dense atmosphere, Duna has a sparse one, and most other bodies have none at all. Propellers, wings, and even jet propulsion would function differently on each of them and a flying craft would have to be designed accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-29T00:24:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2013 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ultrasquid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded illustration\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T21:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/firespitter-propeller-plane-parts/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFirespitter\u003C/a\u003E is your answer.
