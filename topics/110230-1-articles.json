Sorry if I offended anyone.\n\nI\u0027ll be honest: my curiosity was piked after reading this morbidly wonderful arstechnica article. Just don\u0027t read it if you\u0027re eating something.\n\n[http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/05/this-is-what-happens-after-you-die/](http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/05/this-is-what-happens-after-you-die/)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Self-digestion\n\u003E \u003E Far from being \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153dead,\u0027 a rotting corpse is teeming with life. A growing number of scientists view a rotting corpse as the cornerstone of a vast and complex ecosystem, which emerges soon after death and flourishes and evolves as decomposition proceeds.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Decomposition begins several minutes after death with a process called autolysis, or self-digestion. Soon after the heart stops beating, cells become deprived of oxygen, and their acidity increases as the toxic by-products of chemical reactions begin to accumulate inside them. Enzymes start to digest cell membranes and then leak out as the cells break down. This usually begins in the liver, which is rich in enzymes, and in the brain, which has a high water content. Eventually, though, all other tissues and organs begin to break down in this way. Damaged blood cells begin to spill out of broken vessels and, aided by gravity, settle in the capillaries and small veins, discoloring the skin.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Body temperature also begins to drop, until it has acclimatized to its surroundings. Then, rigor mortis\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthe stiffness of death\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACsets in, starting in the eyelids, jaw, and neck muscles, before working its way into the trunk and then the limbs. In life, muscle cells contract and relax due to the actions of two filamentous proteins (actin and myosin), which slide along each other. After death, the cells are depleted of their energy source and the protein filaments become locked in place. This causes the muscles to become rigid and locks the joints.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E During these early stages, the cadaveric ecosystem consists mostly of the bacteria that live in and on the living human body. Our bodies host huge numbers of bacteria; every one of the body\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surfaces and corners provides a habitat for a specialized microbial community. By far the largest of these communities resides in the gut, which is home to trillions of bacteria of hundreds or perhaps thousands of different species.\n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Exoscientist","CreatedById":27117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T13:12:33Z","Content":"Here is a rather unpleasant new proposal, not yet approved for humans:\n\nNew in mortuary science: Dissolving bodies with lye\n\nCONCORD, N.H.\n\nBy Norma Love, Associated Press\n\n[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4828249\u0026page=1](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4828249\u0026page=1)\n\n Bob Clark"},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T13:15:05Z","Content":"In a hole, in the ground, in the family cemetery, on the family farm, next to my wife."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:31:01Z","Content":"Two options, not sure which I want yet.
