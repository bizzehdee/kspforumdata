But as soon as I go to fly, the screen will flicker grey and the game freezes. After a couple seconds of that, the game will come back for a little bit (about 3 seconds) then flicker again. It will continue to do so unless I press a button while flickering in which case the game crashes all together. When it does that, firefox is also crashes and I must use task manager to solve the issue. For some reason it will do it on other steam games like dayz. It will not do it however to any other games, only ones downloaded through steam. I can even launch ksp without steam running and the same thing happens. The only thing I can come up with is a missing library but I am not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOS:WIN7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECPU:AMD FX 8150 @4.4GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOBO: ASROCK 990FX extreme9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM:16GB Corsair xms3 1600MHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGPU: EVGA GTX 780TI\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T04:56:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s odd.

I reinstalled my driver and it seems to have fixed it for now.
