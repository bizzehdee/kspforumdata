As there was a 0.14 Easter Eggs patch I thought I may as well whip one up for the new patch to see what people find.\n\nAs it stands I know there is one large new, unique easter egg on the Mun, and a returning egg to be found on Minmus.\n\nPlease post pics in spoiler tags of any Easter eggs you find.\n\nDO NOT post the locations of any of these, perhaps give hints if people really want them.\n\nHappy exploration!"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T18:27:51Z","Content":"Bumped to top because this is a good idea."},{"CreatedByName":"boyercam","CreatedById":21178,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T19:15:09Z","Content":"I\\\u0027m going to go round kerbin a few times with may moun detector."}]}
