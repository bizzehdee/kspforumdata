They are going to require an enormous amount of material to construct, and for what? We assume we need artificial gravity, but I believe we can do without it. You go through all this work to get into space, to escape gravity, just to subject yourself to gravity? There are plenty of options to avoid the health ramifications, and the health and psychological benefits are huge. I say leave gravity for the land lubbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) There have been plenty of studies to show that the artificial gravity generated by rotating structures is NOT as great as previously expected. Between the disorienting effects of the Coriolis forces and gravity gradients, you must have very low rotational period and very long diameters, which drastically increase the design requirements of the habitat.
