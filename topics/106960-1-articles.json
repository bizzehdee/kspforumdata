Came into 1.0 with a lot of re-learning and un-learning to do. Just as i was getting into it, the 1.0.1/2 patches came out and shocked me again. I hated it at first, and still find the aero model artificial and magickal, but i can\u0027t go back to 1.0 anymore. They are vastly different but both are imperfect. 1.0.2 currently only annoys me because basic jets are slow and unfun compared to 1.0 and because heat shielding is buggy.
