I tweaked it a little from the first version in the \u0027Part Modeling\u0027 forum.\n\nI do wonder where Jeb managed to acquire the nuclear material needed for the engine...\n\nPros:\n\nIt has a higher thrust then the liquid engine\n\nIt has a higher temperature tolerance\n\nIt needs lesser fuel\n\nCons:\n\nIts a princess and likes to messily explode\n\nIts runs rather hot and overheats easily\n\nIt weight twice as much as the normal liquid engine\n\nIt can\u0027t be turned off completely. Due to engine design there has to be fuel flowing through it to cool it down.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nPlease note the new release of BOTH Nuclear Engines that I designed.\n\n[http://www./?42v880etni8cqtv](http://www./?42v880etni8cqtv)"},{"CreatedByName":"cd7890","CreatedById":13,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-12T21:30:14Z","Content":"nice,though unreliable at high gross weight"},{"CreatedByName":"Warringer","CreatedById":328,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-12T21:44:19Z","Content":"There has to be a downside other then the easy exploding due to shock or overheating. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nIts just that I increased the weight before I actually looked at the weight of everything else. :-[\n\nMaybe the weight could be reduced to 50 percent more then the liquid engine."},{"CreatedByName":"Williamca","CreatedById":599,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-13T01:49:26Z","Content":"These \u0027appear\u0027 to have broken with the update.

That would mean that you would need boosters to lift off, but you would gain the high fuel efficiency for your core stage.\n\nTrue. I changed the engine design accordingly, but also just slightly reduced the weight.
