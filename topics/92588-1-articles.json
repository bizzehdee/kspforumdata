If you eliminate the gradient on the dark blue background it will look even more like a real flag.

Mission patches tend to be more complex than flags but are still usually solid colours because they are embroidered, not printed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space.exe","CreatedById":132688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T18:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVersion 1 definitely.
