While some people might be confortable in a spinning habitat, others might get dizzy or nauseous. The same is true for microgravity itself. So whether microgravity or centrifuge-induced is preferable might depend on the individual. Some people might prefer one or the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This depends on the structure, obviously. If you design the structure to be able to bear the load that it is designed to bear, then it should be able to bear that load, shouldn\u0027t it? One thing is for sure, you wouldn\u0027t want one of those silly rotation joints that you see in science fiction movings. It simply adds a whole lot of complexity and possibility for failure. You would rather rotate the entire ship, like in Interstellar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We don\u0027t know. Artificial gravity might even be detrimental compared to microgravity. You might suffer from equilibrium and internal ear problems, causing motion sickness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The sizes and RPM depend on how much artificial gravity you would need, if you need it. The smaller the vehicle, the faster it has to spin, obviously, and the more negative effects you get due to the Coriolis effect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe truth is, we don\u0027t really know the answers to any of these questions, because there has been no proper experimentation in artificial gravity. We can only extrapolate based on what we do know from operating centrifuges in Earth gravity.

We also know that astronauts have been able to live and work in microgravity for extended periods.
