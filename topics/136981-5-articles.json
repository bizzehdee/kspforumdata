Now start blowing up the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe critical flaw in the argument here is that there are million of asteroids, but not millions of mining companies. At present there are 0 space mining companies, and each company could have an asteroid that provides more than enough raw materials for its space ventures. And if you a mining operation on one roid, the miner simply can move operations elsewhere, and he could, being a miner just sabotage your operation by redirecting a much smaller asteroid. (for all intents and purposes invisible to you).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second major flaw is that any really successful space miner is going to need a source of volatiles, these are all located in the outer solar system and need to be strategically stabilize. There is an endless supply of these each one with more volatiles than would ever be needed, some companies are likely to cooperate with governments to draft these into a useful orbit, and it might be a good idea to merge these with the orbits of asteroids so that resources can be paired. Again warring on a frozen loosely packed dusty snow ball is not a way to conserve a resource that would have to be drafted from deep space. So once again, warring about resources does not make sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final aspect of space is territory. Territory in space cannot be defined, for example the comoving reference frame are orbits of a certain radii from the star, roughly non positional. Territory in space would not be defined by objects such as asteroids, those would be claims, but by man-made constructs (i.e. mining stations, space stations, habitats, etc) that presumably would be crafted. The definition of a territory would be somewhat limited to a space a human could claim in their birthday suit and live persistently there (such as Babylon 5 - sped way up in terms of rotation) and procreate. Man-made places that are only transiently habitable (even the ISS) would be considered equipment (such as property). This seems like a strange definition, but what is the difference between a car and the ISS. Both travel, both are only occupied for short parts of ones life, children are not born (typically) and procreation is neither expected or desired. A permanent habitat would be\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhigh enough in orbit not to degrade within a reasonable lifetime.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShort of food, and oxygen provide for all the expected needs (gravity, privacy)[Although with engineering this provisions would eventually be obsolete]\u003Cbr\u003E\nProcreation would be expected.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEducational system would be expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile we could see an eventual conflict for space housing such territories, in circumsolar orbit there is no limitation on space. So that territorial conflicts are more about the periphery, things like claims.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what about pirates. This can be a problem. You spend a couple of decades getting resources to a place where you can build a permanents space colony. What is to stop pirates from jumping your claim and steering it into pirate space. Since piracy can be defined by the acts of less stately individuals, their actions cannot be as well controlled. Piracy though is not wise either. In this scenario why should the pirates mine, they can simply steal processed materials. For this we assume that colonies are floating around the moon, earth, the sun and mars. Each specializes in building certain resources and trade with each other for stuff they do not make. So pirates would go after the trade. The would not blow up ships, but disable them and transport them to a something, maybe a hollowed out asteroid, where they could steal goods. The problem is that in space, you can\u0027t hide, so eventually there might be a long-distance attempts to destroy the pirates. Each pirate MS has limited ability to defend its self against long distance attacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"W.
