public interest and any attempt to get public notice of the working conditions in the gaming industry (or other industries where it\u0027s worse) is damn hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComplaining about the lost of our beloved KSP forums: Disaster to us.\u00A0 To the public, it\u0027s another Tuesday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo TTI, it\u0027s just business.\u00A0 They have a lot of concerns.\u00A0 Only the lowest levels of PR will ever notice anything about any pushback or protest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the same as it was for NCsoft for City of Heroes.\u00A0 Still don\u0027t have a thorough story of why Shutdown happened, even nearly 12 years later.\u00A0 Fully expect it to never come out.\u00A0 Doesn\u0027t matter anyway.\u00A0 The whys often mean little to those being crushed by the whats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
