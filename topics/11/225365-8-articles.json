Ever since the KSP 1 devs and KSP modders joined the KSP 2 dev team, I feared that if KSP 2 were to fail, then it would also condemn KSP 1 to death, with no more developers for new updates, and the most significant modders no longer releasing new content, then the community would slowly fizzle out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Intercept games being shut down and its employees laid off, as well as the possibility of the forums being shut down, maybe without warning.
