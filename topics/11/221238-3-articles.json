After a big meal, all the leftovers are ground up and mashed together to form a kind of solid fuel. This is then put into a small rocket which is, the following evening, launched up through their houses\u0027 chimneys to send a flare into the sky, signalling to Santa Jeb where to deploy his gifts. Often, additional chemicals are added to the leftover-fuel to give the rocket\u0027s exhaust additional brightness or unique colours. In houses without chimneys they are often launched out of a window, a dangerous tradition but nevertheless one that persists.
