Even with multithreading we should expect higher loads for physics calculations. Is it possible that CPU requirements will increase as EA advanced?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy? KSP2 does continuous collisions, but other than that, the physics load is about the same. Think about KSP requirements to run a \u0022reasonably sized\u0022 rocket. We know that Unity\u0027s PhysX did receive a few optimizations in the past few years, so we expect it to run a little better out of the box, and if Intercept switched to Havok it\u0027s an even better improvement on top of that. In addition, a lot of the KSP\u0027s performance problems with larger ships had nothing to do with physics. If these things were fixed, we expect CPU requirements to be fairly manageable. In its current state, I expect KSP2 to run better than KSP for the same size rocket on the same CPU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still have concerns about the CPU, but they have mostly to do with all the things that aren\u0027t the core physics simulation. Things like running 1M time warp with your engines firing for an interstellar transfer, while there are dozens of other ships and satellites buzzing about, and several colonies doing their thing. None of this is in yet. The core physics was always supposed to be just a little heavier than the originals, but with some optimizations to compensate for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHopefully\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the above is something that Intercept can make use of the threading for. In that case, the AMD min spec can remain pretty much the same, and Intel\u0027s go up only a little bit for the full release. Maybe there are even optimizations to still have, and the CPU requirements can stay as is. But again, none of that has to do with physics. It has to do with absolutely everything else the game has to do, which is still a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224235483\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676899020\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180102\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mcwaffles2003\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, mcwaffles2003 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWere it to be done, what extra potential do you think is there in such a kind of implementation over running on a CPU?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I wanted the context of the above for the reply here. For a ship with a hundred parts or so, I don\u0027t think it matters. There are things you can do with aerodynamics occlusion, for example, that would be way more efficient on the GPU, but there hasn\u0027t been an indication of it being considered. You\u0027re really only getting benefits of physics on the GPU when you do\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea lot of it\u003C/em\u003E. Which KSP and KSP2 do a lot more than most games, sure, but for comparison, on the last AAA game I\u0027ve worked on, we had a cap of about 2,000 collision particles for the FX system. Each one could make multiple contact points with the ground or other objects in the scene, and participated in the collision solver in much the same way as a part would in KSP, resulting in thousands of constraints that had to be solved for. And while this was a high-end CPU feature, it was something we were doing in a game that already had a lot going on with AI, networking, animation systems, and scripting system going on on the CPU. So I don\u0027t think we had any significant advantage over KSP, other than running a better physics engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want a 10,000 part ship flying through the atmosphere at a 10x time warp, yeah, the CPU is going to start having problems with it. That\u0027s not a common scenario, though. It\u0027d be interesting to see how far the game can be pushed with a simulation like this, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s strictly necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if we do want to speculate, one interesting avenue is deformable terrain. You\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0do it with CPU, of course. So many games have, but there are limitations. It\u0027s a lot easier to do this if you have a unified system handling terrain collisions and the rendering. You can then have something as small as a kerbal\u0027s footprint making an impact on a tiny rover, or as large as a new crater forming from a comet impact. All procedural and without significant impact on performance via the magic of virtual textures and your collision system doing tests against that same virtual texture. There are some clever optimizations you have to do to account for scaling, but so long as you are dealing with a height map (read, the crater is significantly smaller than the body it\u0027s in) there are clever ways to handle that within the constraints of virtual texturing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that would be my callouts for what you could do with GPU physics that would be very difficult with CPU - absurdly large part counts and high fidelity procedural craters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave1904","CreatedById":153882,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-21T07:05:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224236021\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676938326\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTalk about the framerate if you like, I personally love the fact that the launch loading times don\u0027t leave room to make several cups of tea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd besides, there\u0027s not an apparent physics delta, so at least 20fps doesn\u0027t mean waiting 3 times longer to get to orbit \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a delta i believe.
