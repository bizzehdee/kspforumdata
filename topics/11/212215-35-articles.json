On the one hand, KSP has a wonderful modding community that can take every aspect of the game and ramp it up to 20/10, and I\u0027m looking forward to where they take the science, graphics, and building capabilities of this new chapter in KSP history. On another hand, KSP2 will bring built-in interstellar travel, alongside so many of the fantastic quirks of IRL space systems (before even factoring in the Kerbals\u0027 own quirks when visiting those space systems), so I\u0027m excited to learn new things about how KSP2 models, reflects, and builds upon IRL science. I guess if I were to name a specific most-anticipated piece of KSP2, it\u0027d be all the ways the devs and community can come together to craft whole new lessons on space and space travel. This also brings in one of, IMO, the biggest missed opportunities of KSP1, which would\u0027ve been sprinkling more explicit learning into players\u0027 gameplay successes and failures. Maybe in achieving new in-game heights the game system can drop lessons about IRL phenomena or achievements instead of simply handing the player a steam trophy. This is the sort of game that could truly benefit from such a feature, especially with how much real science is going into it that the casual player would never otherwise know is based on fact or near-future speculation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chezburgar7300","CreatedById":114873,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T21:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m excited for the sweet, sweet terrain changes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaRi","CreatedById":85778,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T21:44:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncolonies and interestelar for me..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LukeSky1112","CreatedById":197738,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T21:52:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcited for the new textures!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DfA-DoM","CreatedById":160709,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-23T21:54:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat a great idea to have a contest like this.
