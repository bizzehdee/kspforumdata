Previously, we looked at the Mun, built, crashed, built again and achieved \u0022a small step for Kerbal...\u0022. Now, I hope, we will look with the same zeal at new horizons, new systems for colonization...

I can\u0027t wait to play with my friends and tech them the basics of ksp. Also I am very happy about the tutorials and I hope, that with them you will be able to play the game and understand the basics without needing an external tutorial on youtube. So, to put it in a nutshell I hope that with Kerbal Space Program 2 we will have a just as great game as the first part or even better. I\u0027m looking forward to pkay the game!
