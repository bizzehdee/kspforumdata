We\u2019ve got a lot of love for this game \u2014 we think we\u0027ve prepared it for every eventuality, but we also know that it has more growing to do. We\u2019re about to take the first steps on a journey that will eventually carry KSP2 through colonies, interstellar travel, and multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the real learning begins!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWhat To Expect\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn day 1 of Early Access, players will be able to create and fly vehicles in Sandbox Mode and visit any location in the Kerbolar System. They\u2019ll also have access to our first four interactive tutorials, accessible via the all-new Training Center. These teach basic rocketry concepts to give new players a head-start on their space programs. You\u2019ll encounter new parts, including new procedural wings, new wheels, new command pods, new cargo parts, and new engines (and the first of the new fuels \u2013 liquid hydrogen). To pave the way for the upcoming interstellar-class parts, we\u2019ve also added a new, larger core size. As we progress through Early Access, we\u2019ll continue to expand on all of these features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can\u2019t wait to finally see what creative feats the community can achieve with the new procedural and color-customizable parts. Our environment team is eager to watch players explore the revamped terrains of the Kerbolar System (and are curious if they\u0027ll discover anything unexpected). The UX/UI team is keen to learn how the updated user experience feels - they\u0027ve put a lot of effort into wrangling a very complex set of requirements into a new, more streamlined presentation. This is it \u2014 the moment has arrived when all our plans come into contact with reality!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many new features, big and small, for you to explore on day 1.

This feedback will be invaluable to us as we continue to improve the game\u0027s stability, performance, and playability.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWhat Comes Next\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMany new features will arrive as we continue development, including Science Mode, Colonies, Interstellar exploration, and Multiplayer.

It\u0027s been quite the journey for the players, and even more so for the development team, I\u0027m sure. It\u0027s funny, the dev team almost feels like friends to me after all the feature videos, dev diaries, and forum posts that we\u0027ve seen from you, Shana, and others. We\u0027ve gotten some insight on your personalities and interests and it\u0027s been fun to pick up on them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I could say I speak on behalf of all players, in hopes that they share the same thoughts and sentiments that I do. Unfortunately, there will always be those who are both vocal and negative. While it can be constructive to have that feedback, I worry it can also slowly eat away at your sense of accomplishment and your pride. So I\u0027m typing this out to you in hopes it\u0027s something that you and the team can hang your hat on as the first early access version becomes available to the world.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you and the team are attempting to accomplish is nothing short of impressive. Just ponder it... multiple solar systems at interstellar-scale distances right here in my office. Incredible. I\u0027ve looked forward to this game ever since the announcement just those short years ago. The delays were a bummer, certainly. But as a true fan in your own right, I\u0027m sure it was even harder on you. I honestly can\u0027t imagine the feeling of guilt and disappointment you\u0027ve felt as the face of the team, knowing you had to tell us we had to wait longer. I like to think I\u0027m someone who tries his darndest to understand others\u0027 perspectives, and so I apologize for any comments, etc. that the team has seen from the community that may have been taken personal or harder than any commenter might have realized.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a more positive note, let me just say that I am so pumped for the 24th. This is it. THE game. Kerbal Space Program 2. The sequel to my most favorite game ever made. I\u0027m so excited for you and the team that you can finally share this with the world. I\u0027m excited for Rafael\u0027s tutorials to be seen, that new players can pick up on some orbital mechanics without being intimidated. I\u0027m excited for the parts! They look so good. Plus, the nostalgia will be prevalent getting to see some old parts now revamped. I\u0027m most excited for the sense of exploration and discovery. The frontier spirit within me can\u0027t get enough of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn in-person meeting seems unlikely, so this forum post is likely the closest I\u0027ll get to interacting with the team face-to-face. With that in mind, personally, this post seems underwhelming in conveying my understanding and my gratitude of the team. For that I apologize. There\u0027s so much more to say that likely will never be said.

It\u0027s been quite the journey for the players, and even more so for the development team, I\u0027m sure. It\u0027s funny, the dev team almost feels like friends to me after all the feature videos, dev diaries, and forum posts that we\u0027ve seen from you, Shana, and others. We\u0027ve gotten some insight on your personalities and interests and it\u0027s been fun to pick up on them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I could say I speak on behalf of all players, in hopes that they share the same thoughts and sentiments that I do. Unfortunately, there will always be those who are both vocal and negative. While it can be constructive to have that feedback, I worry it can also slowly eat away at your sense of accomplishment and your pride. So I\u0027m typing this out to you in hopes it\u0027s something that you and the team can hang your hat on as the first early access version becomes available to the world.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you and the team are attempting to accomplish is nothing short of impressive. Just ponder it... multiple solar systems at interstellar-scale distances right here in my office. Incredible. I\u0027ve looked forward to this game ever since the announcement just those short years ago. The delays were a bummer, certainly. But as a true fan in your own right, I\u0027m sure it was even harder on you. I honestly can\u0027t imagine the feeling of guilt and disappointment you\u0027ve felt as the face of the team, knowing you had to tell us we had to wait longer. I like to think I\u0027m someone who tries his darndest to understand others\u0027 perspectives, and so I apologize for any comments, etc. that the team has seen from the community that may have been taken personal or harder than any commenter might have realized.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a more positive note, let me just say that I am so pumped for the 24th. This is it. THE game. Kerbal Space Program 2. The sequel to my most favorite game ever made. I\u0027m so excited for you and the team that you can finally share this with the world. I\u0027m excited for Rafael\u0027s tutorials to be seen, that new players can pick up on some orbital mechanics without being intimidated. I\u0027m excited for the parts! They look so good. Plus, the nostalgia will be prevalent getting to see some old parts now revamped. I\u0027m most excited for the sense of exploration and discovery. The frontier spirit within me can\u0027t get enough of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn in-person meeting seems unlikely, so this forum post is likely the closest I\u0027ll get to interacting with the team face-to-face. With that in mind, personally, this post seems underwhelming in conveying my understanding and my gratitude of the team. For that I apologize. There\u0027s so much more to say that likely will never be said.
