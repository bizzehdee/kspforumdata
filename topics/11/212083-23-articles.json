And god forbid I hover a complex assembly over something that was made radial, and the game decides to give me 2fps for 30 seconds until it registers my mouse is no longer there and it should stop making 6 clones of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll gladly take the graphics upgrades and mechanics upgrades we\u0027ve been given to not have the game freak out every time I open the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I\u0027ll happily deal with a few framerate hiccups in an early access product to not fight bugs from mods battling the inherent limits of KSP1. I basically rage quit for a day from losing a days worth of gameplay because \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E life support bugged out and forgot it had any hab time left, which turned my colonists who were in training into tourists, and then broke and didn\u0027t turn them back when they were recovered, leaving me stuck with 8 tourists I couldn\u0027t do anything with and none of my needed people for colonization. That very nearly made me abandon the save, with the salt I had, and was only saved by a well timed manual quicksave 100 game days earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP1 mods are pretty amazing, but they are janky as Kraken soup, and I really think we have to step back and recognize that the game is built for its fans, but us heavily modded people still playing the game hard to this day are the upper percent of the 1% of the audience - Our expectations are far from representative of the experience and actions of the average player. Your average player isn\u0027t dealing with compatibility between graphics mods, or putting up with scatterer making landings harder for them. They were never running Near Future Propulsion, or running 800 part grand tour ships. Us wildcards are basically the living walking examples of the worst things KSP2 will be subjected to, and the designers can only do so much to accommodate our insanity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027ve already given us a promise of stabling integrating the largest, most impactful mods both mechanically and visually. We have vastly improved scatter - Not full Scatterer, but its still vastly improved. We have vastly improved planets - Its not Parallax, but its still vastly better. We have a vastly extended parts tree - Its actually already confirmed to be at least as deep as Near Future, and probably Far Future, so full points there. We have vastly expanded colonization - Sorry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E/WOLF, but you never stood a chance in KSP1. We have vastly expanded travel targets - Kopernicus gave us new worlds, and now we\u0027re getting them base.\u00A0 We have vastly expanded multiplayer capability - Mods did exist for these, but I suspect they were not very good just by virtue of the limits of KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s all without bringing in KSP2 modding. Its impressive enough that KSP2 is not just a pure knockout defeat out against KSP1 Modded in comparison. I guarantee you that as modding opens up, the teams responsible for those leading edges in KSP1 will either create or inspire successor mods that continue to push that edge. But the fact they can do that doesn\u0027t take away from the impressiveness or the achievement of the KSP2 team in making this version of the game, as it stands today. The fact you can get beautiful individual results atop a janky core for lower specs does not invalidate this more stable core or its demands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Multivac","CreatedById":201225,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-21T03:07:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEh.

At least the minor jolts Lowne experienced were fixed with reloads, and weren\u0027t baked into the save like with many of KSP 1\u0027s bugs (no doubt an indicator of KSP 2\u0027s backend improvements). Like, I\u0027m struggling to understand what\u0027s so weird about looking forward to the changes to the interface, navigation, backend, etc. that Intercept\u0027s made. Half my KSP 1 projects end up shelved because, for example, NERV and Ion engines don\u0027t work in timewarp without using mods that just exponentially increase my chance of running into bugs that bring my missions to a complete halt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224236089\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212083\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676949867\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201225\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Multivac\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, Multivac said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe core gameplay will be the same\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the surface level, it looks that way.
