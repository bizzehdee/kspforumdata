This thread gave me a great idea. 2 parts, a launcher and an exit tube. You place them on the surface any distance apart (and assume the actual tube runs underground) and you can then eject things from the exit tube at a velocity determined by the direction and distance between the launcher and the tube, and how much mass you\u0027re throwing and how much power you devote to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally in map mode you\u0027d get a trajectory line for the resultant ejection so you could time it so an orbiting refinery or transport could pick up the cargo (which would be on a suborbital trajectory unless you threw it so hard it ejected entirely from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) using the stock encounter markers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could refactor the asteroid model to be an \u0022ore chunk\u0022 that you could grab with a Klaw and then transfer into tanks.
