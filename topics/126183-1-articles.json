However, I did not find any review on it, so I rely on you, fellow Kerbalnauts, to know if it\u0026#39;s a go or no-go. I also have a few, more-or-less important, questions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst of all, its ram is 8.0GB PC3L-12800 DDR3L 1600 MHz (SODIMM). Is it upgradable, and is it 1 or 2 ram slots?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs the keyboard backlit?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat is the screen type (TN or IPS) and how the colors are displayed (crisp images or dull one)?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI thank you in advance for the answers :)\n"}]}
