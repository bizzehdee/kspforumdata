will fire when you\u0027re going mostly sideways, i.e. they don\u0027t have to fight gravity so much, so you want them to have lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 You want this both because it means carrying less engine weight (which saves \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E), and also because the really high-Isp engines (which are the best way to get lots of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E) generally have low thrust, so being able to get away with low

double the fuel tank size and move up one notch in engine thrust.\u00A0 So we\u0027ll add a 16-ton tank and a Skipper.\u00A0\u00A0 Let\u0027s add a reaction wheel too, for convenience (not strictly necessary).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Uydq8Hs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Uydq8Hs.png\u0022 width=\u0022174\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now our total mass is 39.485 tons.\u00A0 This stage has 1630 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 for a total of 3660 m/s.\u00A0 That\u0027s easily enough to get this to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E all by itself at this point, with a couple hundred m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left over.\u00A0 But since we\u0027re working this as an example, let\u0027s keep going, shall we?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, let\u0027s double again.\u00A0 Last stage was 16 tons of fuel, so let\u0027s make this one 32, and we\u0027ll take the engine up one more notch, to a Mainsail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eC5Hlqg.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/eC5Hlqg.png\u0022 width=\u0022127\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n82 tons altogether.\u00A0 This stage has 1380 to 1500 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, depending on which Isp value you use (vacuum or atmo).\u00A0 In reality, it\u0027ll be somewhere between those two.\u00A0 Let\u0027s say 1400 to be conservative.\u00A0 It has a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E sitting on the pad of 1.7, which is reasonable.\u00A0 (Can go lower, can go higher, it\u0027s a matter of taste and on what sort of ascent trajectory you like.)\u00A0 So, with this in place, we now have a total of 5060 m/s, or about 1600 above what we need to get to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 That\u0027s enough for a one-way trip to Duna orbit, or a one-way landing on the Mun, or a round-trip to Mun orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say we want to keep going.\u00A0 Well, we double again, that\u0027s 64 tons.\u00A0 Probably don\u0027t want to be too much taller at this point or it\u0027ll start getting all floppy-noodly on us, so perhaps it\u0027s the time to start expanding radially.\u00A0 So, for example, we could stick a couple of side boosters on, like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022i1tnhFQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/i1tnhFQ.png\u0022 width=\u0022191\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that I only put Skippers on them, not a Mainsail.\u00A0 That\u0027s because we don\u0027t really need a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at this point-- 1.7 was already pretty aggressive.\u00A0 If we had put a Mainsail on each of those boosters, the booster would have an inherent \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of over 3, which would raise our overall \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E even higher than the 1.7 it\u0027s already at.\u00A0 Whereas with a Skipper, each of the radial boosters has an inherent \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of just under 1.5, pretty close to what we have already (which was somewhat more than we need), so that\u0027s plenty for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that I\u0027m assuming that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall three\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E engines are firing off the pad.\u00A0 I\u0027ve set up asparagus staging, here.\u00A0 I simply toggle the radial decouplers\u0027 \u0022enable fuel crossfeed\u0022 option on.\u00A0 This means that as the ship lifts off the pad, the three engines (including the Mainsail in the middle) will completely drain the radial tanks before touching the center tank\u0027s supply at all.\u00A0 This is nicely efficient.\u00A0 It just means that I simply watch the radial fuel tanks\u0027 content as it climbs, and stage the boosters away as soon as those tanks run dry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, adding those boosters raises the overall mass of the ship to 161 tons, with a launchpad \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of just under 1.6.\u00A0 The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for the radial boosters is roughly 1500 m/s.\u00A0 This also means that the stage just above-- i.e. the lone Mainsail, after jettisoning the boosters-- will get close to its maximum 1500 m/s, since that stage won\u0027t start until the ship is already well over 10 km high, so at that point the Mainsail will be getting close to its vacuum Isp.\u00A0 So, this raises the overall \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of the ship up to somewhere north of 6600 m/s, or about 3200 m/s above what\u0027s needed to get to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 With that sort of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E budget, it could do a Mun landing and return with fuel to spare, or get to orbit of pretty much any planet in the solar system except Moho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust now did a quick test launch of the ship, and it made it to 100 km circular orbit with the Skipper\u0027s tank nearly full.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I\u0027ve said, this doesn\u0027t even try to be an \u0022optimal\u0022 design.\u00A0 For example, as currently designed, it gets nearly to orbit before activating the Skipper, and at that point the Skipper is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eway\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E overpowered for any further burns. Heck, even that top-most stage is overpowered-- the Poodle gives the final stage a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E higher than 1 even with full tanks, which is way more than it needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it works well enough, it\u0027s easy to build, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereasonably\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E efficient, and it\u0027s a reasonable illustration of the general principles of how building a multi-stage ship works, even if the details will vary from case to case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
