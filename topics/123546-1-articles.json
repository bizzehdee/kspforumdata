The Portal game is probably right when GlaDOS said, \u0022Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.\u0022 Otherwise it probably shatters conventional physics. This would also make it impossible to use as a \u0022space elevator.\u0022 A ship in orbit passing through a wormhole to Earth\u0027s surface would be doing something like 18k mph. So the ship either needs to be able to deal with the friction of being at near surface level at that speed, or it\u0027s going to get ripped apart. The current world record for airspeed is about 5k mph. So the airstrip at the exit point needs to be contained in a near-vacuum, AND be long enough to give the ship enough room to decelerate. Same holds true for the opposite. The ship would need to reach a proper orbital velocity BEFORE entering the wormhole, otherwise it will just start falling back to Earth the moment it comes out the other end.
