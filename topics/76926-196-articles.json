That\u0027s gonna be slow to render it on the GPU and then bring all that data over to the CPU for what you wanna do) as well, but I suspect new UI things might be slowing things down (Unity 4 UI is horribly slow, ask Sarbian about MJ) and depending on how often they have to run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to check is to look at anything that checks null for a Unity object; strangely, casting PartModules to (object) is faster than a check without that, because the standard null check involves checking to see if that underlying UnityEngine.Object and its stuff on the native side exists. This is slow; if you\u0027ve got no risk that an already-existing one could be destroyed for some reason (checking a PartModule on a different Part, for example), casting to object can speed that up a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to do is a sweep of all your math functions. If you\u0027ve got trig functions, find a way to replace them with vector math if you can; trig functions are slow. Little things like that. Also, make sure that you know what your math is doing. As an example: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BahamutoD/BDArmory/blob/master/BahaTurret/BDModulePilotAI.cs#L534\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis line seems innocent\u003C/a\u003E, but it\u0027s a lot slower than it needs to be; calculating the angle involves normalizing the vectors, then calculating their dot product and then passing that into a Mathf.Acos and then convert it from radians to degrees, and the inverse trig functions are much more expensive to calculate; it could be replaced with \u0022Vector3.Dot(targetDirection, forwardDirection) \u0026lt; 0\u0022 which is equivalent but will get rid of the inv trig function, two sqrts, two divs, and a multiplication.
