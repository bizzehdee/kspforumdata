You can program different functions to all these things, even the normal stick axes, and there\u0027s a 3-position mode switch. That means each button/hat/whatever can have 3 different commands assigned to it, 1 in each mode. So literally, you can program several hundred commands into it. It\u0027s intended for modern jet flightsims with realistic cockpits with functioning MFDs and all that (hence the mouse) plus scads of other functions, so is of course overkill for KSP. But it\u0027s a good set-up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 1 major gripe with the X52 is that it has that never-to-be-sufficiently-damned twisty-stick for rudder control. That is absolutely the worst idea ever for rudder control. The previous Saitek X36 system had the best idea, a rocker bar on the bottom of the throttle handle. So with the X52, you either have to deal with the never-to-be-sufficiently-damned twisty-stick, OR spend another chunk of change on a separate set of rudder pedals (and lock the stick in place).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voculus","CreatedById":85437,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T21:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022m4rt14n\u0022 data-cite=\u0022m4rt14n\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo is the x52 a good or not joystick if i\u0027m just using it for this game?\u003Cp\u003EThat warthog looks nice but wayyy above my price range...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhats wrong with using keyboard while using a joystick?
