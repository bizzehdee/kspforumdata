Seeing that gas giants are widely known to have metallic cores due to pressure, it seems non-consistent with the fact that Jool doesn\u0027t have a \u0022rocky\u0022 core to explore. Furthermore these \u0022rocky\u0022 cores are preceded my thousands of kilometers of pressurised liquids. So yes, Jool can be landed on through glitches, and you could lessen the gravity of the planet to make it more easily escapable; but those feel more like aversions to a problem rather than realistic gameplay decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy counterproposal would be, to reiterate some ideas above: the Uranus analogue would be on nearly a 90 degree axial tilt, but remain a gas giant akin to Jool which is already in the game. Also the moons of this analogue would revolve nearly perpendicular to the solar plane. Also if rings are ever feasible then some of those would be necessary per the real life Uranus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore seeing as SQUAD has stated that Jool will have the largest moons in the game, and there is a distinct lacking of an object with a radius of 400km, I\u0027d say have large one moon orbiting at that size (in addition to other interesting, smaller moons). This moon as a Titan/Oberon analogue would have a thick atmosphere with high mountains and perhaps small lakes. (Not a beach like Laythe, but cold, dreary and devoid of life) This atmosphere would thick but escapable, its gravity \u0022just-a-bit-more-than-Duna\u0027s.\u0022 It could be in perpetual storms and haze reducing visibility range. So the high incline orbit, thick atmosphere, rings, and distance from the sun and inability to see where you are landing would make this moon extremely difficult to land on. Seeing as this would be the last of the promised 3 gas giants, it would represent the endgame of exploration and should be difficult in every aspect, but keep in line with what currently exists in game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR no rocky-core, just convert those existing ideas to a moon of said giant for the sake of consistency and gameplay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my 2 cents \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfx","CreatedById":37282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T16:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rkman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rkman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETurns out it\u0027s actually 11% lower.

Many long time players already know the challenge of getting around and off of Eve. Now imagine Eve infinitely worse though, a trap where nothing you land there will be able to get only a few meters off the ground at best, G\u0027s would be so extreme that it would kill Kerbals if you did manage to make a craft that could potentially escape (when G effects are added anyways).
