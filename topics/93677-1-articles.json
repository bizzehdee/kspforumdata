We are gonna need fairings. And believe it or not fairings are a gameplay mechanic. They limit the SIZE of the payload, and plus it makes our rockets prettier ( no weird ugly probe on top).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources.... Yeah, that\u0027ll help out and stuff. It will make asteroid bases useful, and even a few other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease oh please oh please if resources are added, add them in such a way that asteroids can also be used for getting resources for whatever, not just planet side bases. Of course you\u0027ll maybe have to figure out how many resources an asteroid has or what not, but I\u0027d think that would be perfectly doable. Latch on fuel extractor, begin extraction at set rate that is not acceleratable (well, maybe physics acceleration works). Once tanks are full, transfer fuel to whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do hope they keep it rather simple in terms of mechanics and parts. Maybe just 1-3 parts. Super simple, just a fuel extractor that needs electricity and the fuel resources from a dirt side or asteroid resource source and it pumps out refined fuel to whatever fuel tanks are attached to the \u0022ship\u0022. Moderately complex, but maybe not too bad, resource extractor that needs the above, but it pumps raw fuel in to regular fuel tanks...which then has to be refined in to oxidizer and liquid fuel using refiner part and electricity. Next most complex would require seperate tanks (maybe inflatable????) that store raw fuel before it is refined (IE can\u0027t use regular fuel tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost complex would have seperate liquid fuel and seperate oxidizer fuel resources and possibly refining parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy hope is the least complex, or maybe one step up where you have to extract and then refine, but regular tanks can store it. I do hope it is \u0022time limited\u0022 like resetting/cleaning science experiments are now. I also hope it takes a resonably impressive amount of electricity to do the job (not ridiculous amounts, but there should be a fun and good reason why you need a base with 8 giant solar panels on it).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T16:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t understand why people find all that difficult.
