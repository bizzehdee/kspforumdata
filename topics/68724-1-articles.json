I put an end to the previous attempt because of several issues. One was the Tech tree. It made no sense, parts were unlocked too quickly and I really felt it didnt look entertaining.

All of them make the game more interesting and diverse, and allows for a great number of things to be built. The goals for this playthrough is pretty simple. Put kerbals on every single celestial object other than Kerbol and Jool, and possibly Eve (Dunno, we\u0027ll see), and at the very least, stations in orbit of every single one. The is also the need for an IR telescope that is operational for a minimum of 3 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules are pretty simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
