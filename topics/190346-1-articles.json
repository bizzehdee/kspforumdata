How come, you ask? No? I\u0027ll tell you anyway!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir skin is green. What causes green skin? Possibly copper-based blood, but the inside of their mouths are flesh-colored, so: Chlorophyll! Perhaps in the distant past, Kerbal ancestors had to adjust to scarce nutrients and evolved to use their skin for photosynthesis, just as humans (and other mammals) incorporated many helpful bacteria into their digestive system over the course of their evolution.\u00A0 This would also explain why they can survive/breathe on Laythe, where the atmosphere (according to science data) is not entirely like that of Kerbin. Their lungs aren\u0027t the only thing they use to \u0022breathe\u0022, they use photosynthesis as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir heads are so large because that way, a lot of skin is exposed to sunlight - similar to how humans evolved to stand on all fours so they could see over the tall grass in the plains of Africa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTotal \u003Cem\u003E[snip]\u003C/em\u003E... of course, but it\u0027s a fun thing to think about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-13T16:55:16Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2019 04:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERedacted by moderator\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
