I have been playing without quick saves. All was going well, I had landed on Duna, taken a surface sample, planted a flag etc. and returned to my ship. I then noticed that I hadn\u0027t repacked my parachutes, so I got back out my craft and repacked all of them bar two, which I seemingly couldn\u0027t reach from the ladder. I then pressed the spacebar to drop down so that I could walk round and pack the remaining parachutes, when the screen went black, I heard an explosion and a message came up on the screen saying that my ship was destroyed along with my Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeeling cheated, I attempted to reload the persistent file, because I thought that might take me back to before the crash, however as the screen was still black (even back at the space centre, although with the mission icons/cash/rep bars still were displayed) I couldn\u0027t tell whether I had loaded from before or after the crash. I then reloaded my most recent save (as I can still save the game from the space centre screen) which was from ages before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as I loaded the game, I saw the auto-save message, and realised that my persistent file was now the one from much earlier, meaning that I had lost hours of progress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrustratingly I still have craft files from my most recent missions, but can\u0027t use them because I haven\u0027t researched the required parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way of overcoming this and getting my progress back, or will I have to grind all that science back?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease excuse any misuse of terminology, or any incoherence that may have crept in to my description.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T09:49:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no way to get your old save back without quicksaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you can manually fix the state, with a little cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen the persistance file with notepad (KSP-\u0026gt;saves-\u0026gt;\u0022name of your save\u0022-\u0026gt;persistent.sfs).
