Once you know where fuel\u0027s being drained from and which tanks will empty first, you can compensate for fuel loss using the initial CG marker as an accurate guide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taverius","CreatedById":11815,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T13:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAttach the engines so they draw from the middle tank, and the fuel will get drawn from the outer tanks in, maximizing balance throughout the fuel load envelope.
