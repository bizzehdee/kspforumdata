Only one recently. But the bottom of that one giant canyon seems to be flat. And some of the ice caps, although I would not advise landing at the poles, because it is harder to get back to orbit from there, and more importantly it hurts your eyes really really really bad. I only went there once, a quick hop with a plane to \u0022rescue\u0022 a Kerbal for one of my mission reports, but that was more than enough. That hurt my eyes!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, there is actually some extremely flat terrain right next to Duna\u0027s north pole. But it is only one terrain square - and it is literally smack dab in the center of the most nonflat area on Duna. Seriously. You though the Moholes were crazy? Duna\u0027s north pole has it beat easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, that one square of land is literally touching the exact north pole and two of its sides sort of end in ship deleting void... well, it\u0027s an interesting scientific target!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-23T10:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than what Steve says, it doesn\u0027t.
