Landers are nice but only for Kerbals and not mobile. And to land on the same point twice without strafing is really difficult. But my plan was to build a Station and today I like to play with Kethane. And maybe we can collect some artefacts in the furture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy answer for this goal is the Lunor-Series. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eavailable on Kerbal Spaceport:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/its_lunor_series/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/its_lunor_series/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this STOCK?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only use the \u0022Spacejunk Cargobay\u0022 and the Stock-equivalent fueltanks from \u0022KW Rocketry\u0022. The TAC Fuelbalancer is a must have to balance the Lunor. But this is no cheat, fuelbalancing is a standardprocedure in every aircraft with more than 1 tank. All other are stock in the download-version. Feel free to equip this vessel unique for your Mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I become here more feedback for future versions of the Lunor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lunor_info-514x881.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Lunor_info-514x881.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
