Unfortunately, the inputs from the joystick side are *really* lagged. Oddly though, the inputs from the throttle unit seem to be fine and appear in the game immediately. I\u0027ve tried all manner of things to get this to work, but I\u0027ve had no luck whatsoever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the most recent driver and profile software from Saitek. I have the most recent version of KSP. I have no mods installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemoving the profile software and leaving just the basic driver for the joystick installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlugging the joystick and throttle units into different USB ports on my PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearing all of the settings in KSP and starting from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow here\u0027s the really bizarre thing....I eventually found a forum post from an X52 joystick user, who said a mod called AdvancedFlyByWire fixed his lag issues, so I put that on to see if it would help. When I finally got it working, I can see the inputs from the joystick *instantly* in the configuration windows for the mod. Absolutely no lag, whatsoever. But, when I close the mod windows and go back to trying to fly something, it\u0027s just as lagged as before. So, obviously there\u0027s nothing wrong with the joystick itself, but rather how those inputs are being translated into and manifested in the game control surfaces. What I *really* don\u0027t understand is why the inputs from the throttle side are fine though?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, any hints or tips for how to get this working, or is this something that is going to need a patch at some point to rectify?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-13T17:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174800-mrbonk/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022174800\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174800-mrbonk/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@MrBonk\u003C/a\u003E, I\u0027m sorry to hear you\u0027re having trouble, I\u0027m not sure I can help though, I don\u0027t have one of these sticks to test with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a bit of a delay iirc when deflecting control surfaces, which doesn\u0027t apply to the throttle, this is to help stop fluttering when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is steadying the craft, maybe this is what you\u0027re seeing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s major lag there has to be a problem, can you make a vid of how slow it is for you so we can see?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately KSP\u0027s joystick code is pretty poor, and built on top of even poorer Unity engine joystick code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrBonk","CreatedById":174800,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-22T02:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222954028\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156247\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221487006933\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002216426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/14/2017 at 3:28 AM, sal_vager said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174800-mrbonk/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022174800\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174800-mrbonk/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@MrBonk\u003C/a\u003E, I\u0027m sorry to hear you\u0027re having trouble, I\u0027m not sure I can help though, I don\u0027t have one of these sticks to test with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a bit of a delay iirc when deflecting control surfaces, which doesn\u0027t apply to the throttle, this is to help stop fluttering when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is steadying the craft, maybe this is what you\u0027re seeing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s major lag there has to be a problem, can you make a vid of how slow it is for you so we can see?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately KSP\u0027s joystick code is pretty poor, and built on top of even poorer Unity engine joystick code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m so sorry, I only just realised this response was here....I need to check my notification settings in here\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say it\u0027s definitely an issue with\u00A0the input processing code, which appears to apply to *any* second controller that I plug in. As a process of elimination, I connected several other controllers and attempted to use those, and they all exhibit the same symptom. Whichever controller is the first one detected works perfectly, even if I swap them around so the stick is detected first instead of the throttle etc. Regardless of which one ends up as the second one listed, it lags a great deal. IIRC, the *only* thing that doesn\u0027t seem to suffer from this is the keyboard. That appeared\u00A0to work lag-free no matter what else I had\u00A0connected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI eventually found a mod called Advanced Fly By Wire, which replaces the joystick controller input code apparently. Once I managed to get this actually working (it wasn\u0027t updated for 1.2.2), the inputs are processed perfectly from any controller, no matter how many are connected to the computer. I initially thought it hadn\u0027t fixed the issue, but that\u0027s because I hadn\u0027t removed the bindings in the standard KSP input settings. Once I removed those and only used the bindings in the mod, it\u0027s perfect. Unfortunately, the mod still isn\u0027t up to date for 1.2.2 and exhibits other issues that are undesirable (randomly losing bindings if other controllers are connected/removed while the game is running, being the biggest one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m apprehensive to go back and render the game unplayable for the purposes of making a video (now that I\u0027ve finally got it working and got all my deadzones and presets sorted, I\u0027d rather not have to go thru all that again)....but if I absolutely have to, I will. I know I\u0027m not the only one with HOTAS issues (I\u0027ve found other forum posts about this issue), so I imagine it\u0027s pretty easy to replicate the issue though. Just plug in a second controller and try to use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-22T10:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad you found a workaround MrBonk, I can\u0027t reproduce the joystick issue on Linux though, maybe because of different drivers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222993291\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156247\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490149850\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022174800\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrBonk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, MrBonk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(randomly losing bindings if other controllers are connected/removed while the game is running, being the biggest one)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP relies on the list Unity makes when\u00A0detecting controllers at startup, so adding controllers after this messes up which controller the bindings are assigned to, so please make sure all controllers you want to use are plugged in before KSP is started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrBonk","CreatedById":174800,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-22T12:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222993518\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156247\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490178805\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002216426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, sal_vager said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad you found a workaround MrBonk, I can\u0027t reproduce the joystick issue on Linux though, maybe because of different drivers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP relies on the list Unity makes when\u00A0detecting controllers at startup, so adding controllers after this messes up which controller the bindings are assigned to, so please make sure all controllers you want to use ate plugged in before KSP is started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I got the same issues with the stock setup, so I figured it was probably a Unity thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting that you don\u0027t get the same issues on Linux.
