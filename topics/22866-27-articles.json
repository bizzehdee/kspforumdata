In real life ECM wouldn\u0027t likely work well against CIWS systems as they use short range detectors that have redundant layers and are hard to fool. They are designed to detect and take out low flying, high speed sea-skimming missiles... mostly under 1km but can be effective at nearly 3km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal is not to make it 100% deadly... it\u0027s about 95% deadly now under 1km. I\u0027ll likely tune it down to about 70% effective vs. aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis stuff never ceases to amaze me.
