The new texturing looks totally awesome\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. If you could make a few new textures, (red and black cargo ship, gray navy ship) that can be swapped out for the default using the firespitter texture switch, just in your spare time or down the road, that would be super awesome. \n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Tweakscale. Tweakscale support is something that I think really should be added.\n\u003E \n\u003E Just my opinion.\n\n1. Thanks, it\u0027s taking me ages to get them done tho.\n\n2. Down the road... mebbe. After doing these, I don\u0027t wanna see a serious texture in a while.\n\n3. Yep, gonna look into it when the textures are done.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So in my testing with Tweakscale, mind you I have better buoyancy installed, I found that\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Awesome but eats RAM (Not the mods fault, fully KSP)\n\u003E 2. Needs a bigger hangar...had to install a mod to increase the size\n\u003E 3. I suppose that 5m was a bit big but it loads (and it was epic)\n\u003E 4. Bounce...it bounces when loaded. Must use blisters.\n\u003E 5. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Keep in mind, I went way too big. \n\u003E \n\u003E I used a simple method for Tweakscale.

KSP will ping it for a duplicate, pretty sure that only one is required, but I never did remove the second. \n\u003E \n\u003E Only thing I would like would be higher heat resistance. I created a crazy contraption that works but it is a bit nutty. Perhaps an electric placeable propeller? I tried the FS electric prop, no go. Without the requirement of intake air it could be usable over in Laythe \u0026 Eve. \n\u003E \n\u003E I saw the pic of the IVA so that is coming. \n\u003E \n\u003E I tried to make a sub on Laythe but the compressed water didn\u0027t fill. Are they viable for other planet usage?\n\nThanks, soon as I get time (when I\u0027m not doing textures) I\u0027ll try out this cfg and see what happens.\n\nGonna work on a non-air breathing propulsion too.\n\nAnd bitts/compressed water work anywhere. I\u0027ve dove to the bottom of laythe with the bathysphere.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I wish you alot of patience and keep up the enthusiasm!\n\nThanks, I\u0027ll need both.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Same here Fengist, pass on my thanks to him.\n\nI\u0027ve sent a number off to his tutorial. Soon as I get some more pixels under my belt, I\u0027ll start attempting some as well.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well I downloaded this pack as a goof when I found it trying to figure out a buoyancy problem with an Eve lander. So I built an aircraft carrier and a boat and messed around for a bit, then I decided to go back to my \u0022Serious\u0022 save and figure out my lander. Only then did I find the part \u0022Inflatable Dinghy\u0022... A few clicks later an my problems were solved...\n\u003E I present to you: The Eveboat! Soon will be making another run!\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/kyixzDO.png](http://i.imgur.com/kyixzDO.png)\n\nNow THAT.... is definitely an unintended usage of the parts. \\*boggle\\*\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Your mod, is awesome! I wish I was as good at modding as you...\n\u003E You should consider making hollow boat parts of some sort, it would be fun! Also an extra wide rocket launching platform would be cool, then you could finally launch your rockets from the water! (Of course it should have a very high heat resistance, otherwise it would explode when you launch the rocket.)\n\u003E \n\u003E P.S\n\u003E \n\u003E Did I already say that I really love your mod?\n\u003E \n\u003E If not so, I really love your mod!\n\nLOL, Hah... dood. I\u0027m a newb.\n\nAnd I already have a hollow boat hull. It was one of the very first test hulls I built. You know what happens when you take a hollow boat hull and put it in the water with \u0027Better\u0027 buoyancy? Makes one really nice rock.\n\nThanks ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is a good idea. Some ship parts with deep cargo capability, make it precisely like 8x4 meters or something so by using 1x1 or 2x2 structural pieces it could be roofed\n\nLet\u0027s see, I dunno how wide these parts are precisely (without measuring them in the modeller) but the hull parts are preeee cisely 5 meters in lenght.

They burn ore and do so very efficiently. They\u0027ll also require a small amount of compressed water. Once powered up, they generate steam. The paddlewheel at the rear holds the boiler and uses the steam for it\u0027s propellant.\n\nRather than electric engines, which are essentially an unlimited fuel supply, I\u0027m trying to keep it so that you have to do something other than just power up the engines and go. The stacks/paddlewheel theory will have several positives. First, super efficiency. Second, a readily available supply of fuel, should you wish to dig for it. And finally, an engine you can use on bodies other than on Kerbin. It\u0027ll use most any atmospheric gas to burn the coal (assume methane, butane, etc.) \n\nThe downsides, it\u0027ll be less powerful that LF. You still should hit 50\u002B m/s with a light ship though. The other downside is heat, enough to even explode the stacks. It will generate a fair amount but it will generate it rather slowly. There were numerous incidents of old riverboats losing their boilers and, as a result, passengers. The good news, the new heat radiators dissipate it quickly. The bad news, you have to be pretty much stopped to deploy them (they snap off easy).\n\nThe other \u0027cool\u0027 factor to this method is that as long as you have a head of steam, you can shut the stacks off and conserve ore. It also means that you can shut down the paddlewheel, throttle up the stacks and build up a head of steam before you take off. If you wish to be super efficient, you can run on one stack but, it doesn\u0027t quite keep up with the demands of the paddle. Another trade-off, speed for fuel efficiency. Or, you can always put them on an action group and turn them on and off in order to keep your steam pressure up.\n\nSo, this sound like a fair trade for electrics?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T04:47:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 04:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T04:28:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Still haven\u0027t looked at tweakscale yet.
