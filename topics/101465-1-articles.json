If I click Windows asks me if I want to close KSP because its not responding. At first I thought it was a memory issue but I\u0027m not going over I don\u0027t think. I\u0027m using opengl and I\u0027ve pruned out most of the tanks. \n\n**Log:**\n\n [http://1drv.ms/1Bi4YKW](http://1drv.ms/1Bi4YKW)"}]}
