You\u0027ll find every old version of KSP listed there to pick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother comment about Steam: I don\u0027t like playing directly from Steam\u0027s KSP folder because Steam likes to do auto-updates that can break saved games especially if you use mods. After you reinstall 1.11.2, navigate to your KSP folder and copy everything to a new folder outside Steam\u0027s control, then run KSP from that new folder. You can have multiple independent versions of KSP installed at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"C128user","CreatedById":175843,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-12T00:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got the PC version.\u00A0 Don\u0027t have Steam...yet (will be getting very soon to redeem a reward for supporting a game on a crowdfunding site)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-12T00:12:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2021 12:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by C128user\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-12T12:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is an option in the store to download previous versions. But remember you might want to do a clean install, and not install versions overtop of each other. Sometimes it works, sometimesn get odd one-off behaviours doing that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
