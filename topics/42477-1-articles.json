Would it be possible to represent this in the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking it could be done quite nicely by adding another thermometer-style indicator to the right click menu like the fuel tanks and boosters, or by progressively shading the parts on the left-side staging indicators. Or, perhaps both!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea came to me after dragging Gratuitous Space Battles out for another ..well, gratuitous display of destruction. If you have a copy, you\u0027ll probably know what I mean by the latter example of part icons getting progressively shaded. It might also go very well with the semi-implemented ability to repair things, as you could wander around with the mouse doing a damage check, before EVAing kerbals (or whatever repair drone some twisted mod author makes up) to the most damaged parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
