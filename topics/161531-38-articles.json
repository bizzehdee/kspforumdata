What I want to do is to add a fuel mode which allows you to use a mixture of Uranium/Thorium with Anticides which would produce less energy, but allow you to last much longer with the same amount of nuclear fuel. I need some good numbers on exact mixture and expected reduction in power. Does anyone have some ideas how such a mixture would look like?\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the Salt Core reactor only convert Uranium/Thorium into Actinides . I think what is missing is that is should also creates a small amount of Depleted Fuel.
