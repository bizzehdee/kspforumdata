In the real space program, astronauts are trained by simulator before even touching a rocket. To simulate (pun not intended) this in Kerbal Space Program, it should be possible to use a simulator to train kerbals up to a level 1 lower than the level of your best-trained kerbal (level 5 kerbals will still require lots of interplanetary voyages).
