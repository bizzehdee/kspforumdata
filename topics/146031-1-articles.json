All tested and tried on the launchpad as well as on Minmus. They drive pretty well. Stable up to 25 m/s (*). I landed the mining rig first, got it to a rich ore location, then landed the tanker and drove that to dock with the (now full) mining rig. All worked splendidly. And after I undocked the rovers again, the wheels of the 2nd one (left on the picture) did not want to move forward and backwards again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realize that the picture is rather misleading... but I managed to wiggle the rover a little sideways by just turning the wheels left and right. It never moved forward or backward since undocking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are no brakes on. I checked all wheels, and none are blocked.\u00A0Wheels still turn left/right. There is enough battery power. When I press the W or S to get going, the game shows that the motor is running (like in the pic), but no movement happens, and the wheels do not rotate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe major changes between the moment it still worked and now are: (1) the rover is now packed with fuel, and (2) it was docked and undocked. Note:\u00A0The rover can drive with completely full tanks on the launchpad, so I doubt weight is the issue, especially with Minmus\u0027 low gravity. Also, after lift-off (yes, it flies, note the 4 thuds)\u00A0the wheels still do not rotate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the game just confused after undocking? I tried to search for this, but found no useful information (may have been my searching... but a lot of info about rovers online seems rather outdated, and a lot of posts are regarding problems with docking, which is not my problem).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022c1J0zk8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c1J0zk8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(*) although they need 2 minutes to slow down from 25 m/s on Minmus\u0027 flats.
