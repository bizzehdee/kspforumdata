You really needed to get that deep into Duna\u0027s atmosphere before you would start to see any appreciable braking. Even at 1500 m/s I rarely saw reentry heating effects at this altitude and with Deadly Reentry installed I never needed heat shields to survive aerocapture. Vessel size and shape also didn\u0027t really make a difference with the old aero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was at the point in my new 1.0 career today where I wanted to land a large science base on Duna\u0027s poles. Instead of a conventional insertion, I opted for aerocapture to reduce the size of my interplanetary stage. I encased the base and rover in a fairing as a heatshield, since I was unsure how much reentry heating would be present in Duna\u0027s new atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Kerbin\u0027s new atmosphere is much less soupy, I assumed the same would be true on Duna, and decided to try a rather low 5km periapsis for my first attempt. This resulted in me smashing straight into the ice caps at about 800 m/s, with all my parachutes failing due to aerodynamic stress. I F9ed and tried again with a higher periapsis of 15km. This appeared to be just below what is needed for a Low Duna Orbit aerocapture. There were significant reentry effects and the front of my fairing just bairly started to overheat. My apoapsis was dragged all the way down to \u003Cem\u003Ealmost\u003C/em\u003E above the atmosphere, at about 49km (the Duna atmosphere starts at 50km now). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFalling from that altitude, the atmosphere quickly slowed me from 800 m/s to 250 m/s about 5km up. I deployed my chutes, and only 8 of the mk2 radials slowed my base down to about 10 m/s, and I landed barely using the retrorockets. The little rover dropped separately with 6 mk2 chutes and landed at 6 m/s with no retrorockets. Here\u0027s a few shots from the atmospheric insertion and landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/2eHiv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

And it seems parachutes are definitely still a viable option for Duna landings. Does anyone else have observations on Duna aerobraking in 1.2? What periapsis did you use? Did you need heatshields? How much does vessel size and shape effect aerobraking?

Any lower and you usually end up lithobraking. Any higher and you usually don\u0027t capture. And you always get some flaming even at these altitudes, although usually not enough to even need a heatshield for. On landing, you still don\u0027t get any flaming so need a heat shield even less than for aerocapture. Furthermore, you no longer need to make the long, flat descent profile or retroburn through it with streaming chutes. You slow down naturally a lot faster and chutes work more better. You can do a conventional, Kerbin-type landing profile, saving the chutes until the ground is starting to look threatening. You still need WAY more chutes than at Kerbin of course, but they work more like you\u0027re on Kerbin than on Duna as we used to know it. I managed to land a 15-ton base module on just chutes yesterday, hitting the ground at 2450m at 5m/s when I\u0027d specified at max altitude of 1000m in the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EBottom Line:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all, aerocapture at Duna is somewhat trickier than it used to be because the difference between lithobraking and not capturing is much tighter than before. Used to be, you had a lot more leeway there. Put your Pe at 12km and you\u0027d be sure to capture, so the main point of F5-F9 repeats at Duna was tweaking the Pe up or down a few hundred meteres to get exactly the Ap you wanted afterwards. Nowadays, F5-F9 is a matter of life and death and you have rather less control of your resulting Ap. (can\u0027t WAIT for the Trajectories mod to get updated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).
