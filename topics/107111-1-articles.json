You really needed to get that deep into Duna\u0027s atmosphere before you would start to see any appreciable braking. Even at 1500 m/s I rarely saw reentry heating effects at this altitude and with Deadly Reentry installed I never needed heat shields to survive aerocapture. Vessel size and shape also didn\u0027t really make a difference with the old aero.\n\nI was at the point in my new 1.0 career today where I wanted to land a large science base on Duna\u0027s poles. Instead of a conventional insertion, I opted for aerocapture to reduce the size of my interplanetary stage. I encased the base and rover in a fairing as a heatshield, since I was unsure how much reentry heating would be present in Duna\u0027s new atmosphere.\n\nSince Kerbin\u0027s new atmosphere is much less soupy, I assumed the same would be true on Duna, and decided to try a rather low 5km periapsis for my first attempt. This resulted in me smashing straight into the ice caps at about 800 m/s, with all my parachutes failing due to aerodynamic stress. I F9ed and tried again with a higher periapsis of 15km. This appeared to be just below what is needed for a Low Duna Orbit aerocapture. There were significant reentry effects and the front of my fairing just bairly started to overheat. My apoapsis was dragged all the way down to *almost* above the atmosphere, at about 49km (the Duna atmosphere starts at 50km now). \n\nFalling from that altitude, the atmosphere quickly slowed me from 800 m/s to 250 m/s about 5km up. I deployed my chutes, and only 8 of the mk2 radials slowed my base down to about 10 m/s, and I landed barely using the retrorockets. The little rover dropped separately with 6 mk2 chutes and landed at 6 m/s with no retrorockets. Here\u0027s a few shots from the atmospheric insertion and landing:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/2eHiv)\n\nSo somewhat counter-intuitively, it seems like Duna\u0027s atmosphere is soupier than ever before - for my next aerocapture attempt I try a periapsis around 18km. And it seems parachutes are definitely still a viable option for Duna landings. Does anyone else have observations on Duna aerobraking in 1.2? What periapsis did you use? Did you need heatshields? How much does vessel size and shape effect aerobraking? I\u0027m eager to hear other people\u0027s results in the new atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T08:19:10Z","Content":"Its due to ongoing kerbal efforts to terraform Duna.

That slowed me down to about 30m/s, then when I got down to about 80m I fired my engine to kill my velocity until I was going around 4m/s.

Even that low, you usually didn\u0027t see any reentry flames at all. And parachutes didn\u0027t do a whole lot for you unless you A) had lots of them and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) started your descent from just above the top of the atmosphere aiming to land about 1/4 of the circumference ahead, popping the chutes at like 15km and streaming them the rest of the way while retroburning full power for like the last horizontal 100km of your approach. During the descent, you got zero flames.\n\nPost 1.0:\n\nThe sweet spot for aerocapture is usually (depending on the angle at which you intercept Duna and thus your speed when you get there) between 17-22km. Any lower and you usually end up lithobraking. Any higher and you usually don\u0027t capture. And you always get some flaming even at these altitudes, although usually not enough to even need a heatshield for. On landing, you still don\u0027t get any flaming so need a heat shield even less than for aerocapture. Furthermore, you no longer need to make the long, flat descent profile or retroburn through it with streaming chutes. You slow down naturally a lot faster and chutes work more better. You can do a conventional, Kerbin-type landing profile, saving the chutes until the ground is starting to look threatening. You still need WAY more chutes than at Kerbin of course, but they work more like you\u0027re on Kerbin than on Duna as we used to know it. I managed to land a 15-ton base module on just chutes yesterday, hitting the ground at 2450m at 5m/s when I\u0027d specified at max altitude of 1000m in the design.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nSo all in all, aerocapture at Duna is somewhat trickier than it used to be because the difference between lithobraking and not capturing is much tighter than before. Used to be, you had a lot more leeway there. Put your Pe at 12km and you\u0027d be sure to capture, so the main point of F5-F9 repeats at Duna was tweaking the Pe up or down a few hundred meteres to get exactly the Ap you wanted afterwards. Nowadays, F5-F9 is a matter of life and death and you have rather less control of your resulting Ap. (can\u0027t WAIT for the Trajectories mod to get updated ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)). OTOH, landings are a lot easier now because the atmosphere is now thick enough actually to be of significant help in slowing you down, while still being thin enough not to burn you up."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T05:18:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I previously landed a probe here with chutes too and didn\u0027t have all these problems.\n\u003E I\u0027m coming in from about 120k, with a periapsis of 32k.\n\u003E \n\u003E I did finally make it down, but only by burning until I was down to about 100 m/s so after the chutes opened, I was not going too fast and had time to do something.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, on Kerbin, the \u0022altitude\u0022 that the chutes open is above the ground.

They open when ASL altitude hits 5000.\n\nYou need some engines for the final descent, just a short burn before takedown. I think duna was always like this, as long as you didn\u0027t spam chutes in 0.9? I like it, just landing by chutes is a bit simple and using a short burn remindes me of real Mars missions.\n\nAlso far superior to the older version since your chutes aren\u0027t just gone as soon as you hit 0.1 airspeed... That one did cost me some nerves.^^\u0027\n\nOn the bad site, no point in ever using drogues.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T05:23:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 05:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T05:19:35Z","Content":"\u003E did anyone try something similar with eve? with that surface gravity, I\u0027d expect eves atmosphere height to be lower than on kerbin.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what the proper height for aerocapture at Eve was pre-1.0.x, but in 1.0.1 I sent a probe there, intending for aerocapture.
