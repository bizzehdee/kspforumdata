I thought it was quite good - I was half expecting a lens-flare riddled explosion-fest like Discovery, but they seem to have mostly avoided that, perhaps because Patrick Stewart is on the team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to hear the first impressions of everyone else.

It\u0027s of course full of the poorly thought out plots and bad pseudoscience that Discovery was notorious for. Like... pretty much everything involving AI is amateurish. And the explanations about what the girl is and how she was created was eye roll. And the fight scene where she was destroyed was also facepalm level dumb writing.\u00A0They were rapidfire beaming down troops to kill the girl and beaming them up to save them in the case of the guy that got knocked off the side of the steps... but no one thought to beam her up into a holding cell?
