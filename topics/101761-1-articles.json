Rocket launches are so loud they have to have sound suppression systems to keep the sound from reflecting off the pad and damaging the rocket.

The steam from vapor would have disappeared once it reached the surface (on a real humid day it would linger for a time), but the organic material would have produced particulates that would have lingered.\n\nNeedless to say a horizontal SFRB testing is not the most environmentally friendly thing that you can do in a desert.
