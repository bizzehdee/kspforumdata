There\u0027s this guy who suggests the flight manager mod as a stock feature:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154927-flight-manager/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I think this would be useful for Falcon 9-like recoveries only. I think the manouver burns should simply become automated as long as there\u0027s connection with the probe/a pilot is on-board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there are two scenarios I see this being useful in:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. This one is mentioned before: Falcon 9 recoveries. You let the 2nd stage fly up and perform the circularization burn and land the 1st stage booster yourself in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Interplanetary probes with mid-course correction burns: You set up a manouver and as long as the vessel has\u00A0commnet connection/pilot on-board it does the manouver itself in the background (taking the fuel loss into account, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are the two cases I would see this being useful in. Maybe the probes shouldn\u0027t be allowed to perform the manouvers below some altitude to prevent landing/mountain encounter mishaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T11:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought this was going to be a suggestion to automate keeping satellites in constellations (like, each 90 degrees apart orbiting all at the same altitude) in sync with each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever see ships doing anything that modifies their orbits while on rails in the stock game, and I\u0027m not 100% sure if I\u0027m for or against it. I\u0027m generally for anything that removes drudgery but I\u0027m not convinced that nailing a perfect mid-course correction counts as drudgery. Getting into orbit after a good gravity turn though is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
