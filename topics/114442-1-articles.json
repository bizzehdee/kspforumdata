But if they are all the same, then I can safely just keep canceling these contracts to go places I cant even launch to for many many months and not worry about it.\n\nAt first these contracts made me keep looking at my xfer windows 3 or 4 seperate times to be sure I had done it right. Cause I could not figure out why it kept giving them to me. (So far I have only done a unmanned flyby and orbit of the mun.)\n\nThanks\n\nBlackHat\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T13:41:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BlackHat**"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T10:23:55Z","Content":"It is always the same. There are also websites that tell you at which times your transfer windows are and they wouldn\u0027t work if it was different every time.\n\nThe game also doesn\u0027t care much about feasibility when handing out contracts (you can cycle through them by declining them). Or you could just fast-forward a few months. I don\u0027t know how the transfer windows are calculated by alarm clock (I use Mechjeb for that) but launch windows aren\u0027t static, it\u0027ll just require more fuel or take more time.\n\nFor example look at [http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) (same visual representation as in Mechjeb) and let it plot a Duna transfer window. The optimal transfer window will be around day 232 but if you go 60 days earlier it\u0027ll cost you just 200 dV more. \n\nAfterwards you\u0027ll be stuck on Duna for 2 years either way... or you go straight down from the optimal transfer window for a faster transfer. Getting a quicker transfer window will cost just 600 dV more but you\u0027ll arrive at Duna just in time so you can stick around a few days, then take a very good return window back to Kerbin. It even looks like the return window is a lot more restrictive in timing and dV cost than the transfer window from Kerbin.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T10:31:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 10:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackHat","CreatedById":138278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T13:40:28Z","Content":"Thanks for the info and the link. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T15:28:15Z","Content":"orbital mechanics were invented by a very sadistic person."}]}
