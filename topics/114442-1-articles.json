There are also websites that tell you at which times your transfer windows are and they wouldn\u0027t work if it was different every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game also doesn\u0027t care much about feasibility when handing out contracts (you can cycle through them by declining them). Or you could just fast-forward a few months. I don\u0027t know how the transfer windows are calculated by alarm clock (I use Mechjeb for that) but launch windows aren\u0027t static, it\u0027ll just require more fuel or take more time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example look at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E (same visual representation as in Mechjeb) and let it plot a Duna transfer window. The optimal transfer window will be around day 232 but if you go 60 days earlier it\u0027ll cost you just 200 dV more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterwards you\u0027ll be stuck on Duna for 2 years either way... or you go straight down from the optimal transfer window for a faster transfer. Getting a quicker transfer window will cost just 600 dV more but you\u0027ll arrive at Duna just in time so you can stick around a few days, then take a very good return window back to Kerbin. It even looks like the return window is a lot more restrictive in timing and dV cost than the transfer window from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T10:31:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 10:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackHat","CreatedById":138278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T13:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info and the link. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T15:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eorbital mechanics were invented by a very sadistic person.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
