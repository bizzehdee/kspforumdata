I started trying to replicate the payload that Scott Manley uses in [https://youtu.be/LzQ4t7gjKcs?t=5m28s](https://youtu.be/LzQ4t7gjKcs?t=5m28s). After the actual rocket needed some modifications, I tried reverting to the VAB, but it crashes no matter the other parts I change. It seems to crash right before the staging is reloaded (icons haven\u0027t shuffled into position yet).\n\nI tried stripping parts and it seems that once I remove the RoveMax Model S2 wheels, the crash no longer happens. It doesn\u0027t seem like there are any weird clipping problems in the editor, and it loads the craft correctly with all parts, before launching and reverting causes the crash.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/6aieqrtsqdt0pts/Player.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6aieqrtsqdt0pts/Player.log?dl=0) (Player.log)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ofn98bccjqyfmy1/Richar.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ofn98bccjqyfmy1/Richar.craft?dl=0) (.craft)\n\nVersion: 1.0.4\n\nLaunched via: Steam or CKAN\n\nGraphics Settings (At least that I thought could have mattered):\n\n- Terrain Detail: Low\n- Render Quality Level: Simple\n- Texture Quality: Quarter Res\n\nInstalled Mods (All up to date by CKAN):\n\n- Asteroid Day (1.0 cached)\n- Chatterer (0.9.5)\n- KerbalEngineerRedux (1.0.17.0)\n- KSPInterstellarExtended (1.2.4)\n- FilterExtensions (2.3.0)\n- Community Resource Pack (0.4.2)\n- Toolbar (1.7.9)\n- Interstellar Fuel Switch (1.14)\n- Interstellar Fuel Switch Core (1.14)\n- Module Manager (2.6.6)\n- TweakScale (v2.2.1)\n\nSystem Specs:\n\n- Ubuntu 15.04, 64-bit\n- Intel i7-2620M CPU\n- Intel HD Graphics 3000\n- 4GB RAM\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n- Load craft\n- Launch\n- Revert to VAB (Esc-\u003ERevert to VAB)\n\nAny ideas would greatly be appreciated."}]}
