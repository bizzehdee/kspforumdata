I have been messing around with MM a lot, but this is above my understanding as i dont have any clue of how a dll is built. \n\nSo, there is probably a bunch of equations in the dll that determine the weight of the wing depending on its general shape and size, is it possible to add a line there and output maybe two new arbitrary variable, like fuel volume and radiator capacity, that could be used by a tank or radiator module if it needs to? \n\nI\u0027m quite unsure if it\u0027s possible thought, MM is patching everything at loading, and it seems like Pwing dll is outputing the weight value in the VAB. So it means that the dll would need to output a radiator capacity value in the VAB as well, could it be as simple as copying the line, multiplying by a ratio, and giving the value a name. Or do we have to code a whole bunch of stuff to make sure the value get outputed in the right field ? \n\nAnyways, It would be great to have such an option, as much as a compatibility with interstellar fuel switch (wich would probably require the same kind of work )"},{"CreatedByName":"Kebab Kerman","CreatedById":156358,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T17:47:06Z","Content":"What about 1.0.5 compatibility?
