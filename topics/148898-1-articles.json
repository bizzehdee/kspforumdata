Running KSP v1.1.3 \u00A0Have downloaded Mechjeb2-2.5.8.0 via Curse. I have done some reading and searching and am aware I should be posting logs and pics etc. This is a clean game with mechjeb being my first mod and I don\u0027t have a bug as such.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my first admission. I somehow unzipped KSP into the zipped KSP folder.

Of course now that game has none of my saved ships and career science achievements which are pretty dismal at the moment admittedly. If I do as I believe I should with this version and drag the unzipped mechjeb folder into the gamedata folder (as well as not inside the Squad folder) I get an error on start up that says: \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb2 has been installed incorrectly and will not function properly.
