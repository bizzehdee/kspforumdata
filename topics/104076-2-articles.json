I expect them to lose a significant number of engines, not that I don\u0027t wish them good luck with this approach. It just appears to be rly ambitious to catch an object of that size and weight mid air. And I doubt that this thing will return unguided without and extra avionics package and at least sone form of grid fins or rcs\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, it\u0027s gonna be hanging from a parachute. Grid fins or RCS won\u0027t make much of a difference there. It\u0027ll have a small RCS system for re-entry orientation (unless they use the spent stage to properly orient the engine block pre-ejection), but other than that it\u0027ll be a ballistic object going down its flight path passively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mid-air retrieval isn\u0027t as difficult as you think; the concept\u0027s quite old, in fact. They don\u0027t even have to snag the engine, they just have to snag the parachute. Which is a really big, easy to hit target. The thing that makes it difficult is that the engine block will be so heavy that it\u0027ll require a fairly special helicopter to be able to carry it. And helicopter range is limited, so it will absolutely need a support ship on site that the helicopter launches from and lands back on with its captured payload. Maintaining that support ship and helicopter is going to cost non-trivial money. Still, ULA thinks they can pull it off and be cost competitive, and they\u0027re usually very conservative, so... *shrug*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELargely I\u0027m disappointed that the whole shebang is still so many years away. They\u0027ll only start on reusability after the Vulcan successfully flies. So that means it\u0027ll be the 2020\u0027s before we get to see any actual, hot helicopter-on-engine action, and get more details on how ULA is planning to conquer the challenges involved. Until then, we can but speculate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
