There\u0027s no real way to do combat (yes, people will try, but don\u0027t talk to me about Macey Dean - actual real-time space combat in multiplayer, even without the inevitable lag, would be boring, chaotic, and frustrating), not much to gain from collaboration, and no real opportunities for fun competition (races to the Mun will just end up being a game of whose computer can handle more ridiculous giant rockets).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDark Multiplayer is a cool experiment, but it\u0027s mostly used by people who understand its limitations and don\u0027t expect a lot from it other than what it says on the tin. If multiplayer functionality were integrated into the stock game, even with perfect solutions to the timewarp/quicksave and lag problems, there would still be the the expectation for Squad to provide something to \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E in multiplayer.

The technical details of multiplayer games are already quite a bear to deal with, and KSP just doesn\u0027t seem like a game that stands to gain as much from turning online as games of other genres might.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T15:39:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really don\u0027t care about multiplayer... if anything, I prefer it to never be multiplayer.
