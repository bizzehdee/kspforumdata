If you \u0022decline\u0022 a contract with X button it is instantly replaced with a new contract. You can do this to cycle through and find the contracts that are easiest for you to do. I assume you are very early in the game as some of the easier contracts have not shown. I\u0027ll break down some of the easier contracts that I \u0022grind\u0022 to get money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Test part while Landed. These are free-be contracts. Just put the part on the launch pad and active it in stage mode to complete contract. After that just retrieve the ship for full money back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Kerbin rescue. These have fairly high payout and cost little to do if done right. I built an unmanned ship with 4 Mk 1 Command modules, each with a tiny fuel tank and small cheap engine. When I need to rescue a kerbal I just have the ship rendezvous with him, he boards and then decouples one of the pods and uses it to return to the surface. I can complete four rescue contracts with one ship. You have to do it this way because you won\u0027t get another rescue contract until the first one is completed with the kerbal returning to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Mun/Minmus Flag \u0026amp; Science Missions. I often get return science from mun and plant flag on mun, but less frequent for minmus, and one ship\u0027s round trip easily solves these contracts. I\u0027ve never left a Kerbal on Mun but I suspect an easy exploit might be to leave one there and just plant new flags each time the contract is offered. Never tried it as I\u0027m unsure if like the rescue mission there are some hidden restrictions, such as you won\u0027t get offered flag while Kerbal is on Mun, but that\u0027s just a theory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Test Part in Orbit often have big paydays. Even so I often try to get 2 or more of these active before doing them. Just get the parts into orbit on a single craft and then activate them as need be when they reach their appropriate altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are the four main groups of missions that I grab a lot and I manage to get up to 6M funds in my game. That was back in before the .25 patch though and it seemed as soon as I returned a kerbal I\u0027d get another rescue mission practically straight away, got a bit bored with it after a while though but was good cash. In .25 I started a new campaign with several mods, included the additional contracts one listed above, though I have the settings set to 50% income on funds/science/Rep and you have to pay to unlock parts once you do the R\u0026amp;D. Funds are a bit tighter than before but still not that short on cash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some general tips though for maximizing income. First off try to have each launch setup to complete at least 2 or more contracts if at all possible. Next try to recover as much of the ship as possible as it helps reduce cost. Also Pick contracts with big payouts and little hassle, for example sometimes you\u0027ll often see part tests of flying at curtain altitudes and speed but the payout will be very small which often means it\u0027s not worth the effort or cost of rocket. And lastly build your rockets on cheap, as in don\u0027t use more than you need and try to use cost effective parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to building cheap rockets, solid fuel is the way to go. Under the new system asparagus designs are not very economical. The liquid fuel and engines cost a LOT more than solid fuel rockets. I\u0027ve managed to cut the cost of getting a ship in orbit by half with more focus on solid fuel rockets. That is say the ship cost 30K but launch rockets cost 100K as liquid fuel rockets but say solid fuel rocket version only cost 50K, which makes the difference between a ship that cost 130K and one that cost only 80K. Plus if I recover most of the main ship I will get 15-30K back depending on distance from KSP Center. So the overall cost of the mission was about 60K and checking real quick my old save the flag Mun mission is 13K Adv / 70K Reward plus Science from Mun surface mission is 12K Adv / 82K Reward, so total income from those two contracts is 177K. That\u0027s 117K profit per mission to Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe later design I use for the Mun runs was a bit bigger and cost more, but it had lots of science modules on it and was going more for the science than the cash, even so it was still a net profit as that one cost about 150K but used a single stage liquid fuel rocket platform that cost about 110K but it has a probe and parachutes. So once the ship is out of the atmosphere and separates the main lander fires it\u0027s rockets and goes into stable orbit. The I switch back to the launcher before it enters the atmosphere and the game deletes it so that I can control it and have it land safely. I then recover the launcher for about 60K return. When combined with recovery for the lander upon it\u0027s return from Mun the cost of the mission was fairly low even if the ship\u0027s launch cost is 150K. Ultimately it did end up costing close to the solid fuel rocket setup but it\u0027s easier to handle and less bluky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of the reason I started a new campaign with .25 though is I finally decided to get FAR and Deadly Re-entry a try along with a bunch of other mods and that ship, plus most of my others, just don\u0027t handle well in them so it\u0027s back to the drawing board on nearly all my designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyre2000","CreatedById":102919,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T23:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SRV Ron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SRV Ron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

There are also SSTO designs (particularly spaceplanes) where you can trigger orbital contracts for pennies\u0027 worth of fuel, and skilled players can get to ridiculous places and back on a single stage.

I accept and complete every contract. This is my advice (which would change if you\u0027re going much below 60%):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Try to do multiple contracts in each launch, but don\u0027t try to do too many \u0022flying over Kerbin\u0022 contracts at once. Two or three is probably the most you should do at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use SRBs as much as possible, but don\u0027t overdo it. You need a bit of experience to know just what value to set the thrust limiter on an RT-10 such that you\u0027re going between 80 and 120 m/s at 4500 meters for a rocket of a given mass, and it won\u0027t save you any money if you have to launch four times to get it right. If you have a multi-stage rocket use SRBs for the bottom stage, since you\u0027re not going to be able to recover them. One strategy is to put SRBs on radial decouplers around a T-45. Adjust the thrust limiter on the SRBs such that you\u0027ll be operating the T-45 at 25% or so. This way you can still steer your rocket but you get the benefit of cheap dV from the SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Remember for \u0022flying over Kerbin\u0022 contracts if you don\u0027t satisfy the contract on the way up because conditions weren\u0027t right, you may be able to get a second bite at the apple on the way back down, particularly if you still have fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You can do pretty much any number of \u0022in orbit\u0022 contracts in one launch. Just put yourself in a nice elliptical orbit that covers all the necessary altitudes and complete them one at a time. I usually wait until I have four or five of these before I complete them all in one shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. You can use the device under test before you test it - engines that get started by a control group or right click menu don\u0027t count as being staged. Also, if you stage an engine you can add empty stages beneath it and re-stage it (even if it\u0027s running at the time) to complete the contract. So if you get a test contract for something heavy like a KR-2L, build your rocket around that engine instead of treating it as cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. An engine doesn\u0027t have to work for you to test it. You can take all the fuel out of an SRB and still complete the contract. You can stage a liquid or ion engine with no fuel of the correct type to complete a contract. You can stage a jet with no air intake and no liquid fuel to complete a contract. So, for example, if you get two \u0022landed at Kerbin\u0022 contracts, one for an RT-10 and one for a basic jet engine, make a \u0022rocket\u0022 consisting of a capsule with the RT-10 on the bottom and and upside-down jet engine on the top. Take all the fuel out of the RT-10. Take them out to the pad and stage them both - contracts complete. Your rocket won\u0027t budge and you\u0027ll get full salvage value for all three parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Speaking of \u0022landed at Kerbin\u0022 contracts, don\u0027t bother adding them to rockets that will actually fly. It just adds extra weight, and if you aren\u0027t landed at the pad or runway at the end of the flight you won\u0027t get full salvage value. Do all \u0022landed at Kerbin\u0022 contracts on stationary \u0022rockets\u0022. These contracts are \u003Cem\u003Efree money\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Stack decouplers only decouple the side the arrow is pointing to. Let\u0027s say you have a test contract for a rockomax decoupler. If you put it on top of a capsule with the arrow pointing up (which is the default) it will stay attached when you stage it, so you\u0027ll get to salvage it if you recover your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. The contracts most likely to lose money are the ones that require you to exceed terminal velocity lower in the atmosphere, e.g. testing something at 4500 meters going at least 400 m/sec. They don\u0027t pay well, usually require more than one engine, burn lots of extra fuel, don\u0027t have much margin for error, and conditions are such that you\u0027ll be unlikely to satisfy other contracts on the same launch. If you\u0027re going to decline contracts, decline these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour very first launch should complete all four of the initial contracts. Just make a basic rocket with an engine, twelve fuel tanks, a capsule, and a parachute. That\u0027s enough to get you into orbit and back. You should have enough fuel to assist your parachute in a soft ocean landing, and if you \u0022recover\u0022 the craft before it tips over you\u0027ll be able to salvage all the parts. I think that leaves you with something like 120k at the 60% setting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T11:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is possible to have the very first launch do all four base contracts, I recommend against it.
