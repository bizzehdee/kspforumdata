I\u0027ve been playing it for about a month now. I am trying to create a space station, but I cannot seem to figure out how to dock my second part. It is my first time docking, and it is so hard. I keep coming in straight at the docking port at 0.2m/s or less (usually 0.1m/s) but it just doesn\u0027t want to dock. I tried turning off SAS, but still cannot seem to dock. Any help? Do I have to open a port to dock or something? The Extension of my space station uses a Clamp-o-tron and the main part of my space station I am trying to attach to has a Rockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connector.
