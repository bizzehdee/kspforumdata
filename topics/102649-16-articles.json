As [@K^2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57710-k2/) has helpfully derived, it is not enough for the belt to reach a high speed; the belt must continually accelerate in order to exert constant force on the plane. Since all known formulations of the problem talk about the speed of the belt, not some constant acceleration, this interpretation is...unlikely.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, DAL59 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The treadmill isn\u0027t an ideal treadmill, nor does it match the speed of the wheels.\n\u003E \n\n\u0022match the speed of the wheels\u0022 is an idea you still have yet to define.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E While in contact with the treadmill, the wheels will by default be matching the speed of the treadmill.\n\u003E \n\nDepends on how you define it. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E 17 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E You\u0027re conflating static friction and kinetic friction. A wheel which is slipping while rolling has less purchase than a wheel which is not slipping while rolling.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Landing gear is going to remain firmly in the static friction regime. It\u0027s what it\u0027s designed to do. A slipping wheel cannot provide lateral forces allowing any sort of control. And while rudder does assist at all in early stages of landing or late stages of takeoff, you rely on wheels for much of steering during runup. If wheels began to even just noticeably slip during takeoff before you are ready to rotate, you would not be able to keep the plane on the runway. This I can tell you from first-hand experience.\n\u003E \n\nWell, yes, a slipping wheel is useless for steering, but what does that have to do with this experiment?\n\nThe sorts of friction that increase as a function of RPMs will reduce traction as the wheel-belt interface skips between static friction and kinetic friction. This means the belt must work harder and harder to add momentum to the wheel.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E We have race cars that operate at higher speeds than landing gear failure point. Other than additional reinforcement, their physical properties are not that different. If what you were suggesting was remotely true, these cars would not be able to keep themselves on the race track.\n\u003E \n\nAll I\u0027m suggesting is that a continuously-accelerating belt arrangement will rapidly reach RPMs at which slippage will become non-negligible. I didn\u0027t say this was necessarily below the failure point for real airplane wheels. *You\u0027re* the one who posited the continuously-accelerating belt that was never part of the original formulation of the problem.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Real landing gear will fail way earlier, and one that\u0027s specifically designed to last as long as possible, made from same materials, merely slightly earlier. In both cases, in matter of seconds or less, I might add.\n\u003E \n\nYes, if the failure speed of the belt is greater than the failure speed of the wheels, for any reason, then trivially the wheels will fail first.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-24T13:44:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2018 01:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce**"},{"CreatedByName":"mrfox","CreatedById":69277,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-24T13:44:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 minutes ago, p1t1o said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What on Earth does one use a 200kt belt for?!\n\u003E \n\nThese would be belts used for power transmission/timing/sync applications - similar to the belts you find in a car engine.\n\nFastest conveyer belt is apparently \u0027only\u0027 15m/s (30 knots) at a german mine"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-24T14:02:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 minutes ago, mrfox said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E These would be belts used for power transmission/timing/sync applications - similar to the belts you find in a car engine.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Fastest conveyer belt is apparently \u0027only\u0027 15m/s (30 knots) at a german mine\n\u003E \n\nlol well that certainly makes more sense!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis question about conveyors is exactly analogous to taking off with a tailwind - which is done, in practice, every. single. day.
