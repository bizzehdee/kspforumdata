There\u0027s usually one on the tip of the vertical tail or the top of the fuselage (next to the top anticollision strobe) and another on the center of the belly. They predate the adoption of strobes, and they emulate the old \u0022rotating beacon\u0022 technology you might be old enough to remember on emergency vehicles, with a continuously-lit lamp and a rotating reflector that sweeps the reflected beam of light around a circle. (The old ones really DID use that technology; the new ones are flashers, but emulate the slow flash rate they had.) They\u0027re not really considered that important in flight these days, though they\u0027re generally left on; however, they\u0027re extremely useful in ground operations at night, since, unlike the strobes, they *aren\u0027t* blindingly bright. (Strobes, like the landing lights, are not turned on until you\u0027re on the runway, ready to take off, to avoid blinding ground crew and the pilots of other airplanes on the ground.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
