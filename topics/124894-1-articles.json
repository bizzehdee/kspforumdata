Sorry if it\u0027s the wrong subforum **\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to make this thread to give some ideas about how to make KSP more enjoyable over a longer period of time, and why I lost interest in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, the reason I have pretty much entirely lost interest in KSP is because missions are pretty much all the same. You launch, go to your destination which is usually a place you\u0027ve been to a million times, you go to it, you do whatever you went there to do, and then in most cases it\u0027s over. It\u0027s fun for the first few times, but you are only really doing the same thing over again with sometimes slight changes depending on where you are going or what you are doing. You are given a little bit more freedom in sandbox mode, but in career mode, the first few hours are basically launching rockets around Kerbin and watching them fall to the ground again for contracts or for science. Mods don\u0027t really help, since most only add new parts, and planet packs are fine but I never end up actually ever going to the planets cause I\u0027m still stuck at the beginning of career mode because I\u0027m too burnt out to go any further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome ideas to improve career mode would be to add some factors which are always changing that would affect a mission. I know there\u0027s a mod for this, but random failures would be nice to see in the stock game, and another idea would be solar activity. Solar activity would harm a ship in different ways depending on the strength. An A-Class solar flare, for example, may burn out the solar panels on a ship, an X class solar flare would cause the ship to stop functioning at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to make the game more fun is to make planets more dynamic. Some ideas for this would include winds on Kerbin that can tip over delicately balanced ships, dust storms on Duna that could be strong enough to blow away a small ship, or geysers on Europa that would be relatively harmless unless ones appears close to you. All they would do is damage unshielded electronics at close range and other than that not to any harm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to improve KSP (I know there\u0027s a mod for this too but it would be really nice to see in stock KSP) would be a way to build ships in space, cause it would be really nice to just get passed the atmosphere entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, mods are good, but they are usually more buggy and don\u0027t fit in as well as when something is made by squad, since most mods are only made by 1 or 2 people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, these are just some of my ideas to make KSP more enjoyable over a longer period of time. Please reply with what you think about what I talked about here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T07:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou spend \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ehours\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E launching craft around Kerbin? Maybe that is why you are bored. Geez, you can go to the Mun too you know, takes me 20 minutes from beginning of a career to get to a tech level capable of doing a fly by mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandom failures will never ever happen, it\u0027s on the What Not To Suggest List, Squad has said many times they think it is a bad idea, let it go. Weather effects (other than visual) might as well be a random failures mod, so that\u0027s a no go either. Visual effects have been mentioned by Squad but they aren\u0027t coming till after 1.1 if and when they do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a way to build ships in space, it\u0027s called a docking port. This isn\u0027t Star Trek.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you even tried the new contract system that came out today?

Fast, click to collect science, the insta scan, etc... It also makes you go through the things to do fairly quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it had been my call, I would have made the game something you play slower. Taking time, testing, building up to that launch date. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, add a bunch of basically optional but beneficial ground and space exploration features, like geophysics sensors, radar, laser, drill and camera type tools. Stuff you can use repeatedly and gain different result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d have the way the game detemines science results be continuous, rather than discrete, (with pop up graphs and dials and things that provide a constant stream of feedback) so you can move about and get different results. I\u0027d have some things change over time, to make old sites more worth revisiting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd make the game\u0027s some measures of success that were tied more to some sort of rate of achievement, rather than just giving you a bunch of things to tick off. This would help make the game more about sustaining and refining your space program, rather than about all this unlocking and collecting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manaiaK","CreatedById":129599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T22:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad are planning to make the game multi-player.
