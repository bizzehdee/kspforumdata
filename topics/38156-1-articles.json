Build simple single stage sub orbiters and learn how they perform. Then, go two stage with the goal of achieving an orbit with fuel left to return. Expand to modified two stage using a probe stage and head for Mun or Minmus. With the right probe stage, you should be able to land it on either of the two moons of Kerbal. My simple probe included a set of thrusters along with a mono propellant fuel tank. I have landed it on Mum successfully on the second attempt. Next step, add to that rocket with booster stages so the range can be extended to reach the moons of Jool and land on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Vanguard design now reaches Kerbal escape velocity with the second stage, and orbits the Jool system with the third. From there, I was able to plan slingshot maneuvers to save fuel to reach the inner moons for a landing on the innermost one. I also have a probe on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get good at efficient intercepts of each of the planets and their moons, you are ready to add Kerbals to the missions with the goal of bringing them back alive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T06:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
