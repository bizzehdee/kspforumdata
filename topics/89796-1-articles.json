A much longer service module, possibly more life support?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Living module slightly elongated, more living space?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Lots of things pointing out of the structure, mainly in the service module. These include what look like cameras, etc, but on the service module what look like RCT\u0027s, these were inside the structure on T-1 but have been moved outside to possibly make room. For what I am not sure, more life support, more plumbing for fuel refills, 2nd docking port and tunnel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Diameter for the living module remains the same from the looks of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Service module diameter increased, possibly more stuff inside, 2nd DP and tunnel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall here is my personal theory, T-2 is a structure test bed for the science lab modules on the mir class station and hardware/software test bed for all components.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T00:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a test for resupply and multiple docking ports, we\u0027ve known that for years.
