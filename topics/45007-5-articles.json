Work happened, that\u0027s what. For the past two months, I had barely any free weekends and I\u0027ve been coming home late and if I felt like gaming, I wanted to play, not work on something. Lousy excuse, I know, but there you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince 3d modeling is only a hobby, I now sort of have to relearn some of this stuff and figure out what I\u0027ve been doing in Unity. When I stopped working on the module, this is what I had:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nttmDbo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nttmDbo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s still the same model with reworked textures, now I simply have to do the same for the parachute part (and not mess it up again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do need your help though, those of you who downloaded and tested it, have you noticed anything that should be fixed? IVA obviously, but I\u0027m not even considering tackling that just yet, unless someone else wants to take over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat to here you are back \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E And no it is not a lousy excuse, I can fully understand you but a little note that you make a break right at the beginning would have been good \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E But now you are back so it isn\u0027t important anymore.
