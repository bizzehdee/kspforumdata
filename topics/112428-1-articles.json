I\u0027d hope that this disposition of the handling and treatment of self aware machines would not be the majority consensus. I\u0027d hope we\u0027d be more civilized than that. Although, as I type this, I have to admit that, given our history with other races, tribes and cultures, we may continue the same non accepting and brutal behavior of beings that are \u0022not like us\u0022. This idea reminds me of Star Trek, TNG to be specific where Captain Picard was always firm on his principle to treat any newly emerging self aware species, no matter the type, with the same respect as any other. I mean, for crying out loud, the Enterprise itself began to act in ways that showed that it was beginning to think and act for itself. He still wanted to treat it with respect. These are fictional stories of course but, they are examples of how I wish we handled similar situations. How ironic or let\u0027s say, karmic in nature ( if you believe in such things ) would it be if Robots themselves began to eradicate us, citing that we were \u0022not like them\u0022 or \u0022as good as them\u0022 and therefore had no place in \u0022their\u0022 world.
