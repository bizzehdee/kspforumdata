No, really. Even for huge heavy vessels (talking hundreds to thousands of tons here, I do not kid around), you need only a relatively small number of well-chosen autostruts to immensely rigidify the craft. But just slightly beyond the optimum, and I mean sometimes literally just one more autostrut, and the whole thing will explodify right at loading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) In stock, no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) If you accept mods: with the Module Manager mod, you can write a quick tiny cfg that sets the line \u0027autostruts = Heaviest\u0027 for every single part in your install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-08T12:22:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm...

Two things I\u0027ve learned to bank on in every design: Autostrutting my center engine to the root part avoids a lot of wiggle-wiggly on taller stacks without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E issues.
