So I modified the plane design with a few lander legs an extra crew compartment and forward canards. I refueled it in orbit and went to rescue the stranded kerbals. Everything went very well. I landed on the Mun again and got the marooned kerbals inside. I took off again and returned to a 75 x 75 km orbit around Kerbin. At this point I switched to the space center briefly then back to the orbiting spaceplane. After completing my deorbit burn I survived re-entry and was now on the glideslope 16km from the runway. However, before I reached the runway a small explosion startled me. Looking over my craft, I noticed the right forward canard was missing! It had blown off somehow. The flight characteristics of the plane remained unchanged so I continued on to the runway. Bang! A piece of my left wing blows off and my plane begins listing badly. While I am looking at the new hole in my wing, another bang . The remaining canard was now gone. My plane is now very difficult to control. I decide to abandon landing at the runway and immediately try for a grass landing. It was too badly damaged. It tumbled and exploded upon touching dirt. The only surviving piece was the crew compartment with the two kerbals inside I had rescued from the Mun. I\u0027ve never seen parts break like that before. I reposted this from the steam forums.
