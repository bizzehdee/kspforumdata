In terms of usability DS is far better since it gives you precise control over where the struts are formed. Unfortunately from my testing the connection appeared extremely weak. I\u0027m not sure if this is by design or because it has not been updated to 0.23.5\u0027s new joint code. It also has the limitation that it doesn\u0027t create a bi-directional connection between parts, allowing one DS to receive a strut, but also emit one to another attachment point \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E.

I have an idea of what I want to model, but don\u0027t have the time to adapt the existing mod to my needs. Specifically I would like to have the target functionality be separate from the strut module, and have it use the newer joint code so it can have similar strength to the standard struts.
