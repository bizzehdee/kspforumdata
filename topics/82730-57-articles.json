I must say I really love the ducted fan engines in this mod. However I am experiencing several issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) A relatively minor and previously mentioned issue about the ducted fan VTOL engine only having 15 KN of thrust. But that is easily fixed by editing the config file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) A minor annoyance, but not too bad: It appears the ducted fans\u0027 thrust is reversed. I have to put them upside down (the \u0027danger\u0027 warning triangle texture upside down) for them to produce lift instead of downforce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) This is an absolute show stopper for me: The engines hardly draw any electric power at all. I can fly without a reactor or any form of power generation at full throttle, and in a minute I may have used up 1 or 2 EC. So using the engines this way feels way too much like cheating. Now I have played with the config file, but it turns out that I have to set the draw ratio to something obscene like 1500 for the power draw to become noticable. This does not feel right and I also am unsure what value to set, nor am I an expert on editing config files and what each value actually does. I suspect there is some underlying issue at work here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I have tried several versions of FTT over the course of the last updates, from KSP 1.05 till 1.1.2 and have removed and\u00A0re-installed FTT each time, and these issues unfortunately persist. I have even tried to install FTT without any other mods to rule out conflicts. I also do not have similar issues with the electric propeller from KAX for example. That one does use power as expected.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is some other place where I should file an official bug report, please let me know. Of course if this is low on the priority list I understand and that is no problem. I just wanted to mention especially the power draw issue since it was not mentioned before as far as I am aware.
