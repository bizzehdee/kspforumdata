Ok, SCANsat already has a method for background scanning built in, but still, it took me literally five minutes to come up with a workable solution. The trick is that SCANsat doesn\u0027t actually scan anything in the background, it just records what sensors have flown over what area of the planet. The elevation and biome scanning is all done when the map is drawn. The same thing is possible with Kethane, you just check which areas of the planet have been scanned and which cell those areas correspond to.\u003Cp\u003EThe active vessel, with the blue orbit, does not have a Kethane scanner and is orbiting at ~750km. The inactive vessel, in grey, has a small Kethane scanner with a SCANsat module attached to it and is orbiting at ~250km. It took about 15 sec at max time warp to go from the map shown in my last post to this map. The Kethane grid doesn\u0027t seem to accept my additions to its database until I reload, but the SCANsat map (note the \u0022Rebuild Kethane\u0022 button) works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a Kethane sensorType to SCANsat (using sensorType = 4, the old slope scanner number), set the fov = 1 and the best alt = 250000. The rebuild button checks which cells have been scanned and adds them to the Kethane database. I\u0027m guessing you need an active Kethane sensor or part on the vessel for the grid to update without reloading. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the reason for not having background scanning really is technical and not philosophical then I don\u0027t see any reason why this can\u0027t be added to SCANsat.

These options work (turning off the overlay all together, selecting which resource to display), but there are multiple problems. One is that they don\u0027t take effect until the map is rebuilt. I think there will also be problems if people have too many Kethane resources; it probably needs some better way of handling the options, preferably a pop-up menu of some sort. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is currently only one SCANsat sensor type that works for Kethane. The way it\u0027s coded right now that sensor will reveal every resource that uses the Kethane system, which obviously isn\u0027t good. It\u0027s possible to add different SCANsat sensor types for each different resource, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s really feasible to continue adding more scanner types. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also fixed the empty cell color. I realize that the Kethane grid varies the color based on the amount of resources in the deposit, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea here, it would probably make it much harder to see when layered on top of the regular map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: It should also be noted that this has all of the same dependency problems that everything else does. Making Kethane a required dependency is obviously not an option. Kethane is relatively stable though, so maybe it\u0027s a good idea to make a separate .dll specifically for handling Kethane interactions. Adding a MechJeb target overlay would also be great (it would finally make the slope map really useful), but probably will have the same problem the RPM does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the settings menu options here on the left and the fixed empty cell colors.
