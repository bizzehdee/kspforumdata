I think there should be a thread where we do just that. So here. Let\u0027s talk about all the things we want to do/have done in attempts to formalize our missions. I\u0027m not saying anyone is actually going to stick to what they post here, but I think it\u0027ll be interesting to see how people want to progress through the game. Maybe you have more scattered missions in these alpha versions, and want a more structured mission plan when 1.0 hits, I don\u0027t know, but I think it would be fun to design a basic outline for what you hope to accomplish, in an ideal world.

Organizing those missions into graphical hierarchies (I don\u0027t read big walls of text unless I\u0027m *really* bored) and adding difficulty rankings would be awesome.

You can make one of these from any starting point. Given the delta-V requirements of each transfer and circularization, this could be the basis of a system for allocating money to missions. The bodies are listed in green; on each of these, many further objectives could be chosen (e.g. circularize, land, map); each of these is also a starting point of another such map, should one mission go multiple places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3r8lyyY.png\u0022 alt=\u00223r8lyyY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a chart of every objective I could think of for each body in the game (including some which aren\u0027t yet implemented).
