Today I fired up the game and launched a small rocket with a probe attached. As usual I used Mechjeb to get it into a standard orbit and it worked fine. However, as soon as Mechjeb was done circularising and deactivated, the craft started spinning and yawing... pitch was fine. Despite the fact that I could easily counteract the spinning/yawing with manual control, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E wasn\u0027t able to stabilise the craft or align with any direction or waypoint. The ship just keeps spinning faster and faster. I tried relaunching and even restarting the game, also confirming that the rocket is completely symmetrical and that none of it\u0027s very few parts are overlapping.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EOne thing I did notice is that the roll/yaw indicators appeared to be about half a click to the left of centre. I tried ALT\u002BX to reset them, but nothing happened. I tried deliberately trimming to crazy angles and then resetting, but the reset put them back to the slightly off-centre position. Lastly, I tried loading a tried and true ship which I\u0027ve used numerous times before without issue. I let Mechjeb put it into orbit and... had the exact same issue as soon as it was finished. The ship started spinning.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EI do use mods, but have not added, removed, or tweaked any of them recently. The only update to the game during this career was v1.12.5, but I have played many hours since then without issue. Just yesterday I was launching ships with Mechjeb and everything was fine. This issue has literally just started today, despite nothing whatsoever changing overnight.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EDoes anyone have any idea what could be causing this problem, and more importantly, a way to fix it?\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy apologies, please disregard this thread. The issue was caused by a control pad connected to my PC being placed at an angle. Gravity was pulling the thumbsticks left by an imperceptible amount, but enough to register as an input.
