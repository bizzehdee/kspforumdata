Seriously guys, this is not cool. At all. It would make Squad look bad, and discourage new users from the community. It\u0027s not April 1st yet, is it? No, it\u0027s not. Was this announcement posted 10 days too early? \n\u003E You know why online forums haven\u0027t changed since the 1990s? Because they work. Any time you have an intelligent device helping you, it\u0027s shortcomings are frustrating because they\u0027re not your own fault. And 140 character-only posts? That\u0027s not a forum at all, that\u0027s just a messaging system.\n\u003E \n\u003E At the very least, if you\u0027re going to have a paid forum, don\u0027t have the paid features be features that you would expect as normal and free on any other forum.
