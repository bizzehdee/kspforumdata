IE, Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is no longer a thick chunky gravy but more of a nice clear glass of water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe likely reason your rockets are spinning out of control is because you either A, have too heavy a hand at the controls, or B, have way too much TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the former, turning on caps lock helps. But in general, you\u0027ll just have to get used to the fact that you can\u0027t just pitch over to horizontal from vertical and have the rocket stay stable. If you go too far past your prograde vector (IE, have a high angle of attack) you\u0027ll lose control of the rocket as it stalls. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the latter, you have to look at what your TWR is. If its above 2.0 you\u0027re going to have a bad time, as you\u0027ll hit high dynamic pressure (which basically means any major movement in your rocket will likely tear it apart or send it spiraling out of the sky) before you\u0027re even past the 10km mark. Sitting on the pad, you want it to be around 1.3-1.4. Idealing speaking, you\u0027d want to keep it around that point for the entire flight, but once your past ~25km up you can go 100% throttle without it affecting your rocket much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as you\u0027re trying for missiles, you\u0027ll have to take both issues into account. It\u0027ll take some good piloting to make it work (as well as a well designed missile for that matter) and careful control of your TWR and speed, as losing control of either before reaching your target will spell disaster. Unless you use mostly reaction wheels in your design, you\u0027ll definitely need some sort of fins for maneuverability (you can get Procedural Wings for \u0026lt;1.25m designs). Using an engine that can gimbal will also help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd naturally, you\u0027ll also want to cut down on any junk along the missile itself. Anything sticking out that isn\u0027t fins will induce more drag which will make your missile less aerodynamic, and thus, harder to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T16:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry the 0.625m fuel tanks from RLA Stockalike.
