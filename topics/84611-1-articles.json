I actually had a craft that was rather small(ish) and used 500\u002B parts and mostly structural walls and the settling of the craft crashed the game while in 64 bit. I dropped down to 32 Bit and used Active Texture Manager and lessened my crashes even over 1k parts. It still crashes, but not as much. I would lean to the number of parts. There was a welding mod, but I have not tried it yet. Supposedly makes the game treat parts as one. Less parts to process. I dunno...I like that challenge to manage. If you have a second screen, open up Task Manager and take a peek at your RAM usage for KSP when it occurs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes it occur with crafts with less parts or does it not seem to matter?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
