They often lie within the transcription reading frame. The news is not new. Its been known for a long time. In addition there are siRNA found in these genes that either regulate themselves or other genes. So double coding is also known and characterized. There are site in the human genome that are over 500,000 nucleotides were a 350 bp site regulates three genes all from an extended distance.Mutations around this site are known to be associated with QTL variation at the site. Other QTL mutations occur in \u003Cem\u003Egene deserts\u003C/em\u003E. And last but not least, there are certain sites in the human genome that have a rather disturbed evolution. 6p21 is one of these sites, in Europeans 2 haplotypes are known to have the longest identifyable runs of homozygosity in the human genome, linkage disequilibrium to one of these sites and haplogroup mutations suggest it is 20,000 years old with a rate of recombination 10 fold less or more than the other haplotypes or other parts of the genome. This is particularly odd since the most conserved part of the haplotype represents some of the fastest evolving sites in the human gemome, with 5 genetic loci being the fastest evolving coding sequence loci in the human genome. There is a lot of stuff coded into the DNA that we know is controlling both expression and evolution of the genome itself, and we have known this since the early 70s. The IL2/IL21 locus is another site that has disturbingly slow recombination, and a site on chromosome 5 in Native Americans has also been identified that is half the length of the 6p site that also does not undergo recombination at a normal rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe wary what you read in Science, it does not have a stellar scientific reputation with regard to opinions or retractions, It is better to get information from field specific journals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to vaccines. Many AD mutations are increases and some are decreased. A fair number of Non-6p21 mutations are in apoptotic machinery, which goes to ways.
