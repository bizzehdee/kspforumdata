A I currently understand, they are adding a contract option in the mission control. What I think would be interesting is a weather prediction for a successful launch. For example, if there is a 40% chance of a successful launch due to weather, add a higher change the ship would fail then say a 90% chance of a successful launch. The visual cues could be turned off for less powerful machines and only display the percentage. What gave me the idea was watching the SpaceX attempt which is now delayed until Friday or Saturday.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TarkinLarson","CreatedById":106615,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T15:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just trying to embellish your idea here, or provoke extra thought.
