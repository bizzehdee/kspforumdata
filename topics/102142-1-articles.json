I purchased the game using paypal I received conformation from both paypal and KSP that the payment was made and received. I went to the KSP site and started to download, but there were issues, this was Sunday night, I went to re-download it from my profile, but when I got to KSP and signed in my game was not in the purchased items area to download it. I messaged them Sunday, four times yesterday and I filed a claim with paypal. I just want a refund now. Online or not, they failed to keep their end of the contract and their customer service sucks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Samssonart","CreatedById":57129,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T17:29:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry rhidle, we haven\u0027t received any email messages in \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2f0a186d405f5b4640410a186b\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u0022a2d1d7d2d2cdd0d6e2c9c7d0c0c3ced1d2c3c1c7d2d0cdc5d0c3cf8cc1cdcf\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E , is it the address you sent them to?
