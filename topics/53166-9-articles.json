I say nay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s an art to this, and it\u0027s based on two small principles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Don\u0027t kill all your velocity just so you can rebuild it in order to move. Burn in a direction between your retrograde (relative to target, remember) vector and straight towards it (the purple thingy). Continue until your prograde and \u0022towards\u0022 markers line up. The closer you aim to the retrograde marker, the slower you\u0027ll be going compared to when you started, and the closer you aim to \u0022straight\u0022, the faster. You can fiddle with this until you get a speed you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If you\u0027re more than about a kilometer away, especially if you\u0027re approaching slowly like I do, don\u0027t actually line up perfectly straight. Get close, and then note which way the prograde marker drifts over time (5x warp is good for this). Adjust your velocity accordingly so that you can expect your prograde and \u0022towards\u0022 vectors to meet up when you\u0027re going to hit the target. If you did it right, you\u0027ll be able to look at the map and see a 0.0km intercept shortly ahead in your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplying these two principles I\u0027ve regularly managed to rendezvous with extremely little RCS usage, which is good when I have a Munar lander that\u0027s out of fuel and almost out of Monopropellant and I\u0027m trying to get it back to the station to save the poor incompetent Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cyst","CreatedById":74149,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T19:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot really a trick and maybe some (if not all) of you already know it.

So sandwiching a plate between stacked tanks helps them not spontaneously decouple and ruin the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what was cursorily mentioned earlier about small probes I have verified to be true - LV-Ns are awesome, but if your probe is the size of a Kerbal, the LV-N is so heavy it actually can sap a bit of the delta-V. For tiny probes I\u0027ve found the Rockomax 48-7s (small orange stack-mounted one) is the best, barring ion engines of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso also: As many already know, orbits change when you come out of timewarp. I\u0027ve studied what happens, and it\u0027s mainly that the eccentricity changes. Generally it increases (makes your orbit more elliptical) when you\u0027re moving down (from Ap to Pe) and decreases towards circular when moving up. The effect is most obvious and exploitable when your orbit is nearly circular, and can be useful for keeping very low-orbiting ships from dipping into the atmosphere (or the ground).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso also also (can\u0027t believe I forgot this before): If your ship is huge and can barely avoid crushing its own engines on the launch pad, water may actually be better for landing than land. As long as you enter it slowly enough (depending on what\u0027s on the bottom of the ship - testing helps), the water will prevent the first module that hits the ground from having to hold up the whole ship for that first few frames, and the ship won\u0027t tip over and smash itself (unless it\u0027s really really tall). It also appears that in 0.23 the water is slightly forgiving of entry velocities and you can, for example, land an engine at slightly over 7 m/s without splattering it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-09T04:53:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2014 04:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T04:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t really need maneuver nodes for inclination changes.
