The debugging was nothing special - just trial and error taking mods out one by one until the game didnt break anymore. The issue with KCT is known whenever the game is saved/resumed with a probe craft on a ballistic kerbin orbit. I had focused on US as the cause because the game broke after I launched and activated my first water purifier. I had totally neglected to realize that the stage that that put the purifier into orbit was the one that was causing issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am experiencing another current bug tho - wedges (but not core hubs) that were re-sized with tweakscale reset back to default size after the craft is launched and loaded.
