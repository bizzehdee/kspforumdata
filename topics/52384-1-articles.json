The payload for each moon was adjusted to the moons themselves; parachutes for landing on Laythe, making minor tweaks to my Mun landers for Vall, and obviously heavier equipment for Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter getting the hang of transferring to Laythe, the mission went pretty smoothly. Tylo was my last stop. Deployed my satellite with no problems. That left a small probe and rover. Landing the probe went fine. Deployed solar panels, named the lander, engines shut down. So I moved onto landing my small rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the problem. I switched to the landed probe so that I could warp my rover lander around to it\u0027s deorbiting position and the lander was doing a slow bounce on the surface. Engines weren\u0027t just de-throttled, they were shutdown, the weight of the probe is balanced in all planes and it was sitting just as still as could be wished when I left it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI *just* managed to keep the probe from flipping over and managed to get it to stop pirouetting long enough that I could switch to another craft. But when I returned to the probe, it was back at the bouncing and spinning. It never goes more than a metre or two from the surface, but I\u0027m at a loss to explain why it\u0027s behaving that way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s on a level landing spot and it\u0027s the same basic probe design I\u0027ve had success with landing on Kerbin, the Mun, Minmus, Laythe, and Vall. Bulked up to deal with Tylo\u0027s gravity, but if anything, the added fuel and such have lowered the center of gravity, which should make it *more* stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, any insights? This sort of thing common on Tylo? Maybe I\u0027ve landed on some sort of anomaly? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
