I haven\u0027t enjoyed a space game this much since back in the early / mid 90s, an old game called \u0022Frontier: Elite II\u0022 and the followup \u0022Frontier: First Encounters\u0022 by David Braben were (at least to me) two of the best open ended space games ever made. While they don\u0027t share anything directly in common, I believe KSP has captured a similar immense scope and freedom of exploration / imagination that I enjoyed in those games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway that\u0027s enough nostalgia, so after spending numerous hours messing around in the KSP Demo and causing a sizable dent in the Kerbal Astronaut population I decided that once I\u0027d made it to Mun and back I\u0027d get the full game. Thanks to the awesome videos and tutorials from Scott Manley (and others, but mostly Scott\u0027s) I made it to Mun, crash landed, sent a rescue ship that landed safely but didn\u0027t have enough fuel to return, I finally made a successful voyage there and back so I picked up the full version! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I didn\u0027t want to repeat the same Kerbal culling in the full game I figured I\u0027d start out with some unmanned (unkerballed?) missions. Like many I graduated from the \u0022Wile E. Coyote school of Rocket Science\u0022, so after many hours of comedy misfires, boosters launched without payloads and rockets falling over on the launchpad I finally got the staging in the right order and put some things in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s one of my Stayputnik class Orbital Probes, this one is furiously probing Mun from orbit..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk57/Feldynn/KSP/2013-05-06_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E..and my KerbNET Comms Satellite that is currently broadcasting across Kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk57/Feldynn/KSP/2013-05-06_00004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-06_00004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T18:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice satellite designs!

I plan on 2 for each planet and one around each moon, just to say \u0022I was here\u0022, and to find out for myself about how much fuel it takes to get to each one before a landing attempt. I could read about or watch videos on getting to each one, but that spoils the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T21:37:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
