I\u0027ve been looking for this movie for I\u0027d say 6 to 7 years. I saw it when I was a kid in hbo and I was in love with its atmosphere. So below I\u0027m going to list everything I can remember from the movie to help narrow it down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas probably made in the mid to late 80s \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe special effects were on par with the first Terminator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was Destiny ( the video game ) the movie. Large, rusted ruins in a post apocalyptic frozen tundra. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the characters went into these ruins they ran into these amorphous, nano like machines that took the shape of spiders, saw blades and knives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe memory of these very large almost... circular rusted walls in the snow is burned into my mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember the ending.. just barely. I remember they needed a ship to escape at the very end.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy memory of the movie is very cloudy and that\u0027s about the best I can do to describe it. So.. does any of this ring any bells with anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.Joseph Kerbertson","CreatedById":57354,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T21:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScreamers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WmAoN4CXPu0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T23:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHoly crap thats it...
