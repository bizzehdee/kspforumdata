This does have its uses, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, one of the best uses for docking ports in the VAB is multidocking: You can only connect one port (the \u0027primary\u0027) in the VAB, but if you leave the secondaries lined up and facing each other, they\u0027ll automatically multidock when you load in on the pad.

I see no reason to raise a big hooplah over the idea of adding an arrow to a docking port to tell you which side is in/out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I agree with you that people should check their work rather than just throwing it together and seeing if it flys but even people who routinely check their work can get it wrong if it is a large build with multiple ports or they have a bad camera angle due to the limitations of the VAB camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHell on my newest station I made this very mistake (though only on one of the two sr ports I put in) I had checked, double checked, and could of sworn they were on right, but one of them somehow wound up upside down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint is it will happen to anyone simply because the difference between the two sides is so small it is not really obvious, adding a little arrow pointing in would greatly reduce that from happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty much my point. Given that it\u0027s an easy fix (Copypasta the arrow from the size 1 decoupler, maybe put one on either side of the \u0027handles\u0027), there\u0027s not really any reason NOT to do it. You\u0027d still have to check the orientation to not screw it up, it\u0027d just be easier to check.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liquid","CreatedById":36242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T08:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENever had any trouble with the big docking port, it\u0027s got a texture that you can see during placement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cashen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cashen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, the point is, most people don\u0027t examine parts after they place them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stopped reading right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad cannot be held accountable for people\u0027s lack of patience and unwillingness to check their work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, looking at that quote it does look like case of \u0022change your game to pander to reckless clowns!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T08:54:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Liquid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Liquid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENever had any trouble with the big docking port, it\u0027s got a texture that you can see during placement.\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, looking at that quote it does look like case of \u0022change your game to pander to reckless clowns!\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t aware that copypasta from one texture to another (which I could do in GIMP in about 30 seconds if I knew where the textures were hidden!) consisted of \u0027changing the game\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if they add an arrow, you\u0027ll still need to check the orientation.
