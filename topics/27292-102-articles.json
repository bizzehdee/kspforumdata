I only sent Jeb up (three one-man cans instead of a Mk1-2 Command Pod, see), so I think I\u0027m going to have to land the ship (test the chute system that way) and go back up with a full contingent on an actual Moho trip now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinished construction of my three ships for the Doing it Gemini Style Challenge - the Gorgon 7, Orthus 7 and Echidna 7 (my original Gemini mockup was the Chimera 7, hence the related names). Got both the Orthus and Echidna to Munar orbit and the Gorgon to Kerbin orbit with Jeb and Bill aboard. Next step is to land the Echidna, fly the Gorgon to the Mun, rendezvous and dock with the Orthus and conduct a landing. The Orthus is the lander module and it\u0027s my first open cockpit design, so I\u0027m interested to see how things ultimately go. The plan is to land near the Tranquility site - why not?
