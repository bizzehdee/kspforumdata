The booster then runs at that thrust throughout the entire burn, so TWR increases dramatically. This can cause problems with excessive TWR near the end of the burn.\n\nThis mod adds a second tweakable slider for SRBs, giving you the option to set both the beginning thrust and end thrust. The booster will smoothly change the thrust level between those two points. I believe the most common use will be to give a booster a high initial thrust, then taper off to a lower final thrust, in order to extend the overall burn time and avoid excessive TWR. That\u0027s how I always use them, anyway. With a little bit of planning and practice, you can make an all-SRB first stage that will smoothly accelerate at two to three Gs throughout the entire burn."},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T14:10:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not sure I know what you are referring to.
