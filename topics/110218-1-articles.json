So i started methodically adding lifting surfaces one by one, ensuring that mirrored symmetry was activated. And each time I added another wing, the CoL shifted slightly towards the left wing. I tried with various types of wing (stock and mods) in various configurations. But whatever I did, it seemed that more lifting surfaces just pushed the CoL more off-centre.\n\nAlso, is the smaller CoL indicator - in comparison to the CoM marker - a new thing in 1.02?\n\nI\u0027m using FAR, and pretty much every other mod available.\n\nAnyone got any ideas?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
