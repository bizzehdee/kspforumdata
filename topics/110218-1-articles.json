So i started methodically adding lifting surfaces one by one, ensuring that mirrored symmetry was activated. And each time I added another wing, the CoL shifted slightly towards the left wing. I tried with various types of wing (stock and mods) in various configurations. But whatever I did, it seemed that more lifting surfaces just pushed the CoL more off-centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is the smaller CoL indicator - in comparison to the CoM marker - a new thing in 1.02?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using FAR, and pretty much every other mod available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone got any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/YrBHp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
