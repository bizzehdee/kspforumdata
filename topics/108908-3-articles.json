I knew everything about the Kerbin system up to Mun orbit. My lander had extensive testing, ten flights to make sure it decoupled properly, 5 for the launcher, and 2 for the ladder (back then I thought you needed ladders for everything). This was my 5th attempt of a landing. Attempt 1 and 2 ran out of fuel, and 3 and 4 crashed into the Mun. The launch was perfect. I had tight margins in orbit, but the transfer stage got me into orbit around the Mun. I decoupled it, and went for the landing. I killed most of my velocity, and was really close to the surface. I forgot to kill my horizontal velocity, and I was moving around 30 m/s. I hit the Mun hard. Left fuel tank gone, righty survived though. I survived with about 60% of the ship alive.
