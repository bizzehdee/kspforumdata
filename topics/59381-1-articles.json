I was thinking perhaps being able to sort them by \u0027projects.\u0027 For instance, if you\u0027re planning a series of mun missions, you could start a new project [subfolder], and name it Apollo. Then, when you save a rocket, you can choose to put it in the Apollo folder for easy reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, I\u0027d like a way to select a project as soon as I went into the VAB; the load screen would show only that project (with an up button to get out, of course), the save would automatically go into that folder, and the default name would be [projectname] [X\u002B1], where X is the number of craft files already in the project folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T04:26:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is an interesting idea.

In my very first save file, I saved every iteration of my ships under a new name, and even if I never had to use them, I still enjoyed looking at all the old versions just to see how the design was refined as it was built. In later save files I stopped doing this because it ended up filling up my ship list very quickly, and it was tough for me to remember to change the version number before saving every single time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like a separate categorization system in addition to per-craft version archives, preferably with custom categories. It\u0027d be nice to be able to have all my supply craft in one category, my space tugs in another, my one-shot science missions in a third... etc. If the same systems also applied to subassemblies, even better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T01:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to use a numbering system with my rockets, with the numbers indicating major version changes and decimal places indicating minor changes, basically like games do.

The numbering helps easily identify craft but I would certainly love a better way of managing designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two thoughts on this. First I\u0027d like to have a way of defining a craft type (Station, lander etc) during design, instead of after launch (I\u0027ve never found a way to do this anyway). This could be coupled with the saving \u0026amp; loading screen so you can filter by specific craft types reducing list sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition I\u0027d like to be able to manage stock ships better, with a way to \u0027promote\u0027 a game specific design to stock, or to delete stock ships (with suitable warning), instead of having to copy files around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T01:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a suggestion.

You can create projects and select a project for each of your craft files. Then those tags are another option to sort crafts by.
