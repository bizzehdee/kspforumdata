Problem is, I can model with either Blender or Unity (only two programs I have for that), but I don\u0027t know how to export the model to KSP. So, just to throw an idea out there, maybe you could re-texture the panel, while keeping the orientation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalEscape","CreatedById":147764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T21:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what else to try so I think it must have to be modeled in the correct orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to export your parts to KSP download \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65356?p=1878643\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1878643\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis addon\u003C/a\u003E for unity.

I did have a game object suncatcher with the z facing the correct way. But what fixed it for me was that the z of the panel model itself had to be facing the sun so I made the scale of Z= -1 and that worked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lt Vax","CreatedById":149558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T20:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad I checked this out, something tells me I\u0027ll have to fix my Solar Girder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
