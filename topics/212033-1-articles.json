Many of these could exist along the length of the tether. In a programmed sequence each could move to add some momentum to the last one movement making a chain reaction that amplifies the energy until it gets enough energy to release a spacecraft along to the next destination. Like a certain movie, \u0022The Core.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that is feasible, could it also use certain locations in earths orbit to naturally propel the vehicle more. Say where the earth is slightly bulgier at the time being to gain a little extra oomph.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow long would an object need to be to do this, assuming it even can, and how many way stations along the tether would be needed to add sufficient energy to whip a vehicle out of earth orbit to the moon or mars? Or even up to geostationary orbit or similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be used to get vehicles to a destination with less onboard fuels or larger payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming if you have/use gyroscopes to keep it on a stable path you have energy to release(and potentially the means to control it.). And if you use solar sails for propulsion you can potentially accelerate at certain points or any point to varying degrees to add energy depending on needs. I\u0027m also assuming the deploying and undeploying of the sails would also add energy as would changes in available energy in the sails. And all could be used potentially to control the applied energy to the vessel. Let alone on board fuel and propulsion on the vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso excess energy could be stored in batteries for various uses... Maybe even to power up stuff on a ship/station. Could it also fling space stations to other planets? And is there any good electris based propulsion system if it has extra energy to transfer. Or could the energy be applied to stuff on the whip to add extra energy to the given craft? Assuming extra batteries aren\u0027t bad because of the mass. Although I would assume that might help with the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming it\u0027s better to use fueless designs to avoid having to carry up fuel. Unless it\u0027s collected in space or brought in a removable stage and applied to the whip or vehicle being slung. then you only need to bring extra mass for things for maintenance which can happen seperately from a vehicle launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022150\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j_QLzthSkfM?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Devo - Whip It (Official Music Video) | Warner Vault\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-15T03:24:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2023 03:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-15T12:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn theory, yeah, you could come up with a whip-launcher. But if you can build a megastructure like that, there are easier ways to launch something. If you have an \u0022anchor point\u0022 and a tether long enough and strong enough attached to it, just use a magnetic linear drive to accelerate the cargo along the tether. It will be more energy efficient, you can get away with both a shorter and a thinner tether, and you won\u0027t be putting the tether under that much stress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-15T13:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis feels like one of those XKCD what-ifs where the inevitable hypersonic impact obliterates everything within 100km of the equator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-15T14:00:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYo-yo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-15T14:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forgot what novel they use nanobots to do this \u2014 Seveneves?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-16T02:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if you brought it up in spools of smaller material and build a rope out of high tensile material.

If it\u0027s weight efficient enough maybe it could be brought up cheap and hold the material afterwords. Even self regenerating. could any such material be built in space as a tube. Assuming it\u0027s needed and can\u0027t be done otherwise. What if the ISS brought up spiders and had them build webs and have the continers slowly turn those webs into a string.

Specifically the solar sail tether pulling and redirecting extreme orbital paths? If strong enough they could even slow down reentry vehicle by using that to redirect to diffenet orbits and slow down. Or use the energy to make more complex path changes to direct back out from a planets influence or similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it help get vehicles to stations without wasting fuel efficiency so you could dock at station on entry to a planet? They could be like universal tug boats. I\u0027m assuming they could also do things like S shape turns that the shuttle did to burn off momentum. But it could be done in orbit. Or even done in orbit after using the planets gravity/atmosphere to slow down a bit. Assuming it helps beyond just having solar sails on a ship.
