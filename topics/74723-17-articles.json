I\u0027d say:\u003Cp\u003E1) The real world time limit on turns is fine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I\u0027m for the recycling thing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) One turn build delay makes sense. However, I think we should get a certain number of ships and buildings set up before we start counting turns because story-wise our corps have been running for sometime and would naturally have stuff already set up. Also, video-wise and gameplay-wise. it\u0027ll be more fun for us (and others watching) if we have a foundation to grow from instead of starting from the ground up and having to wait 3-4 days to do something\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I vote no ship limit\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1-2) Alright good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) We will have our starting ships and buildings along with additional BP.
