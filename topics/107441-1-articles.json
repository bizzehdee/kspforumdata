I had other crashes yesterday as well but this time I decided to report it.\n\n**No mods installed!**\n\n![8R9udjd.png](http://i.imgur.com/8R9udjd.png)\n\n**Reproduction Steps:**\n\nI\u0027ve bought the game yesterday, so I\u0027m quite new here (I hope that it won\u0027t affect my case because I love the game). Yesterday I already had various crashes: Game just crashed to the desktop without any error messages, then with standard windows error message like KSP just crashed and so on. Today I\u0027ve decided to report any crashes that happens to me because I am unable to play like this, it happens always in the worst situation. For example sometimes I can run the game just fine for an hour then I get a crash and keep getting crashes until I reboot my system. If I don\u0027t reboot I often get a crash upon loading a resumed game right after launching the game after a crash.\n\nHere is the content of the folder according to the error message:\n\n[**2015-05-04\\_165548**](http://zalandroid.hu/ksplog/2015-05-04_165548.rar)\n\nI also have an another folder created by the first crash (crash to windows without error message that I\u0027ve mentioned):\n\n[**2015-05-04\\_142548**](http://zalandroid.hu/ksplog/2015-05-04_142548_error.log)\n\nI also attach my DxDiag, maybe it can provide some useful information for you:\n\n[**DxDiag**](http://zalandroid.hu/ksplog/DxDiag.txt)"}]}
