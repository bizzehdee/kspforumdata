MechJeb is pretty good at balancing even without them, especially if you have one of the larger pods, so you should be okay. Otherwise, getting into orbit manually and using MechJeb for the rest is an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also, I, too, have been having problems with the Landing autopilot. Sometimes it gets stuck on a step, sometimes it forgets how to operate engines (Throttle goes up, engines are active, plenty of fuel getting to the engine..... engine still off), but most of the time it completes a successful landing... 30-200km away from my target. Tried using click-only, typing-only, and click-then-type, with both versions, from orbits of 30km Munar orbit to 100km Kerbin orbit to 1000km kerbin orbit. Same results with all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-25T10:36:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2013 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by loppnessmonsta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
