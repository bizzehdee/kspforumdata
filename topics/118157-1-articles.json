I went with the real life J variant which is a Japanese single pilot version of the craft. There is no benefit to having two pilots in Kerbal combat, so I decided on this one for the sake of performance.\n\nThe video is pretty great. Filming quality is good, and fun combat.\n\n![DistantKeyAtlanticsharpnosepuffer.gif](http://giant.gfycat.com/DistantKeyAtlanticsharpnosepuffer.gif)\n\n![20469202265_b5f5625009_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/441/20469202265_b5f5625009_b.jpg)\n\n![20442965096_90f9554cb0_b.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/484/20442965096_90f9554cb0_b.jpg)\n\n![urnYBtM.png](http://i.imgur.com/urnYBtM.png)\n\n![ME2Efne.png](http://i.imgur.com/ME2Efne.png)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/L4Q00XfsLC8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[\\[cb_co\\] F-15j Eagle Model](https://sketchfab.com/models/804421cf873a437d89cc0adb00c582c9) by [clown_baby](https://sketchfab.com/clown_baby) on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com)\n\n**Armed Eagle**\n\nParts: 134\n\nWeight: 14.3t\n\nLength: 13.2m\n\nWingspan: 10.2m\n\nTop Speed at 100m: 338.2\n\nTop Speed at 10,000m: 794.2m/s\n\nAcceleration: 32.92 m/s^2\n\n**Stock Eagle**\n\nParts: 110\n\nWeight: 12.6t\n\nLength: 13.2m\n\nWingspan: 10.2m\n\nTop Speed at 100m: 349.3\n\nTop Speed at 10,000m: \n\nAcceleration: 45.22 m/s^2\n\nThe craft is quick an performs well, capable of supercruise with adjustments, and has a large weapons payload.

The top is flat so it was pretty easy, but on the bottom I really wanted to replicate how the intakes move inwards as they go towards the engines.
