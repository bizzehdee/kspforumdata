My main complaints are that whenever you drag an item all the other ones move around to fill up that gap, forcing you to wait a second before you can put it where you want it. Instead I think it would be better that the gap remains until you have let go of the item before everything moves as it would make organizing stages a lot quicker and less tedious. I would also like a way to group together items into one, just like how it is with symmetry, as sometimes the staging gets really long (especially with sepatrons on side boosters).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could even make staging a whole new tab (like action groups and crew) and maybe use some color to indicate different parts of a craft (this would be especially helpful when looking at other peoples crafts to easier understand what different stages do).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoninFrog","CreatedById":203049,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-10T18:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would also be great if all the stages were displayed in the staging menu.\u00A0 I hate having to scroll through dozens of stages on Eve landers and Jool 5\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-21T08:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to see it improved as well.
