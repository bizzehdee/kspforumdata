After several steps I am happy with my design, I saved my design then rescued my first capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis evening I thought I would attempt rescue number two but I cannot load my rocket. I enter the VAB and I can select the load button and my rocket is listed in amongst a number of others (I presume these are stock design as they are not mine). The problem is that when I select my design nothing appears in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have Engineer Redux and Chatterer installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone help please?
