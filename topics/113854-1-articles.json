Why badges? So much nicer than an \u0027Engineer\u0027 or \u0027Pilot\u0027 subtitle, and the badges could be used elsewhere, such as in the Astronaut Complex not to replace the text label but to supplement it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESecondary suggestion\u003C/strong\u003E - I have a space station with a capsule docked. How can I tell which Kerbal is in which module? With KAS instaleld it\u0027s not a problem because the right-click menu lists them along with access to their inventory, but in stock KSP this is an annoying problem. The context menu for a module really should indicate which Kerbals are inside it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimon Hibbs\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SebLavK","CreatedById":77634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not entirely sure about whether you can tell the specialisation when a kerbal is in EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, by clicking on the hatch of a habitable module, you get a list of the kerbals in that module (and you can also transfer them between modules).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simonh","CreatedById":57952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T21:12:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SebLavK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SebLavK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not entirely sure about whether you can tell the specialisation when a kerbal is in EVA.\u003Cp\u003EHowever, by clicking on the hatch of a habitable module, you get a list of the kerbals in that module (and you can also transfer them between modules).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks handy, thanks for the tip.
