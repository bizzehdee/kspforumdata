I need to EVA my Engineer to do the work, but wait, which one is the Engineer?\n\nShould I exit to the space centre, go to the astronaut complex, identify the engineers, go back to the tracking station, take control of the flight again and EVA my Engineer?\n\nNo, I just check which one has the \u0027Engineer\u0027 badge displayed on their IVA thumbnail. Why badges? So much nicer than an \u0027Engineer\u0027 or \u0027Pilot\u0027 subtitle, and the badges could be used elsewhere, such as in the Astronaut Complex not to replace the text label but to supplement it.\n\n**Secondary suggestion** - I have a space station with a capsule docked. How can I tell which Kerbal is in which module? With KAS instaleld it\u0027s not a problem because the right-click menu lists them along with access to their inventory, but in stock KSP this is an annoying problem. The context menu for a module really should indicate which Kerbals are inside it.\n\nSimon Hibbs"},{"CreatedByName":"SebLavK","CreatedById":77634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:24:41Z","Content":"I\u0027m not entirely sure about whether you can tell the specialisation when a kerbal is in EVA.\n\nHowever, by clicking on the hatch of a habitable module, you get a list of the kerbals in that module (and you can also transfer them between modules)."},{"CreatedByName":"simonh","CreatedById":57952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T21:12:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not entirely sure about whether you can tell the specialisation when a kerbal is in EVA.\n\u003E However, by clicking on the hatch of a habitable module, you get a list of the kerbals in that module (and you can also transfer them between modules).\n\nThanks handy, thanks for the tip.
