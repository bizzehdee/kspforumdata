If it was EM then that\u0027s solvable by using a powerful enough generator to charge while in flight, which is a bad idea normally, or to just drop out and recharge if it was zenon then pack more on. I think that a limit on how far you go is a good idea to keep a bit of challenge in it, in this case building a warp ship and the infrastructure so that it can go anywhere.

Kind of thinking about leaving out the xenon in the warp drive itself rather than packing enough inside for two whole tanks worth of warp. I\u0027m thinking about making it take twice as long to recharge rather than where I have it at being 25% slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere I have the numbers now, Jool\u0027s orbit requires about 2000 EM, Plock about 6500 EM and takes about a minute and a half, that doesn\u0027t include fiddling around trying to get into position or get circularized. Which I think works great for stock, but might be too aggressive for a 3.2x or 6.4x system, surely the 10x system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind of hard to balance this so it generally works well without feeling too easy for stock but crippled for those more vast systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to USI 2.5m drive : 20 bubble size, 12500 ISP, 3000 Xe, 15000 EM, 10000 Ec/s for 1 EM/s converter, 237 ec/s \u002B 81.5 EM/s \u002B 8.14 Xe/s to run the bubble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get another 40s of run time with this drive compared to the new one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, don\u0027t know what RoverDude is doing with Regolith and how it may affect the workings of the CFGs for the WarpDrive for 1.0. I think these cfgs I\u0027m okay with and I can pack them up for people to fiddle with if nothing is changing as far as the converter for the WarpDrive module is concerned.

The main thing I was wanting out of it was something that could fit on moderately sixed SSTO and spaceplanes (since I love those) looping right over the wings while still allowing clearance for landing gear. The main benefit in this setup is because most SSTOs can only get to Minimus at most without refueling, and this would provide greater range if you are willing to deal with the whacky orbital mechanics that translation causes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was mostly hoping to build tiny, challenging-to-engineer ships that could fly to LKO and warp to Lathe without staging or refueling (though probably with several aerobrakes, etc since there would be so little fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
