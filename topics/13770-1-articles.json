Rather then having all 6 of those tanks on a single stage, make two sets of three for the same orientation. Then, take fuel lines and connect those two stages in series, and then to the inner rocket. When the one stage is depleted, eject it and you will still have the full second set of three. This lets you burn that half of the fuel with a significant amount less mass on the craft, giving you a higher delta V. My hyperion class V craft attached demonstrates the concept.
