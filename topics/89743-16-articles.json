Some parts might require a precursor part or parts. Testing of that part might be a proactive way you can speed development, but the testing needs to be meaningful. There might be precursor \u003Cem\u003Escience\u003C/em\u003E required, as well. Atmospheric science for parachutes or wing parts, a lander/crasher on the Mun to design lander legs, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, you can\u0027t get around the fact that buying tech is the reward the player gets for \u0022doing science.\u0022 There really is no alternative in the sandbox world of KSP to this as a reward. If there were a \u0022space race\u0022 or something, then \u0022winning\u0022 would be the reward (beating the kosmonauts to Duna, etc). Sadly, all this is very interconnected---I\u0027m also a fan of having the solar system randomized, forcing the player to actually discover things (a kind of reward, like the first time you saw Jool \u0022in person\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin the paradigm we have---which is not going to change---Ideally we\u0027d have at least upgrades to parts, instead of just \u0022parts\u0022 to work with. Instead of a specific LV-30 vs LV-45, we\u0027d have ungimbaled and gimbaled engines. Then, with use/research, etc, we might get upgrades to those. Better Isp, or lighter weight (composite instead of steel, for example). Gimbal range could improve. For fuel tanks the wet/dry ratio could improve. Early parts could have very low heat tolerance, which might improve. THAT would be more intuitive to me. The trick would be to not spam new parts, but reuse the parts, but up the stats. Perhaps each part is given a single new stat, called \u0022tech level modifier\u0022 (TLM)and the performance is modified by it. For engines it might be a multiplier on gimbal or mass (stock_gimbal*TLM, or mass*TLM (in this case higher tech would have smaller fractions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously a major change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T05:32:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMajor change indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t say I agree with your solution. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, to work on what we have now, does the following axis of improvement seem right to you ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Less interdependency to allow easier prioritization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- still a minimum technology level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- compatibility with a possible fund/time/science synergy between Administration/contract/R\u0026amp;D, assuming SQUAD finally balance what they started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom this I can imagine possible combination of administration-strategy/contract which could result in the same \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Efunctionally speaking\u003C/span\u003E to what you want, while keeping the science-currency dynamic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor all the bad thing we/I say on Squad\u0027s unfinished feature, I am actually quite impressed by the sheer potential in customized game-experience.
