I was going to make this big writeup (well, halfway typed it out already actually) to try and garner some motivation by other programmers to take on the task... well it seems like someone else other than myself, or Markus at the LOG project, has done just that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55835-Kmp-0-22-wip-alpha/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55835-Kmp-0-22-wip-alpha/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(seriously, if you haven\u0027t checked this out yet, go do it now!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I have decided to not do my big writeup and just release the code for everyone to look at and laugh at (It\u0027s not very good). That said, I will go over my ideas a little bit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, my goal was to synchronize the rotation and position of multiple vessels being controlled on different clients over a network. Rotation was easy. Position, as I later discovered was also pretty easy. I realized that all I needed was orbital data. KSP does all the calculations for me, position wise. Because of this, the kraken shouldn\u0027t be an issue... My theory is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I understand how KSP renders a vessel is that it will take it\u0027s orbital data and plop it where it needs to be around a body. Doesn\u0027t matter where in world space it is. If the vessel is within loading distance from the active vessel (your vessel) then KSP will automatically calculate the relative position for you based on the orbit it\u0027s in. Since KSP is constantly shifting the reference frame automatically, the position of the other vessels within viewing distance should also shift accordingly without notice. So, using that idea, only updating the orbital data to get the position, the Kraken shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory of course. I was not able to test it fully but I was able to fly around another client without issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bjj42SVj4RA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, enough talk... Bellow you will find the source code. A few things to note: this is all test code. It was never meant to be production quality. The plugin requires a very specific environment in order to run. You cannot compile this and expect it to work out of the box. This code is meant purely for reference and discussion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also not a programmer by trade. I do this stuff in my free time as a hobby. That said, my source is not clean and I\u0027m probably doing a lot of bad things some of you seasoned programmers might cringe at. At best, I hope someone might find what I\u0027ve done useful. If not, then oh well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Go check out the actual working plugin and have a blast!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pwolfamv.com/programs/KSPMulti.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload Source\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELicense: GPLv3 - Please read ReadMe.txt for more information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last bit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to extend a big thanks to those who visited my thread, sent me messages, and watched the videos I released over the past few months. You guys are passionate about this idea and I was glad I was able to spark your interest and hopes. I am sorry I wasn\u0027t able to give you all something that was fully playable but I am really stoked to see TheGimp\u0027s project and looking forward to what he and Markus\u0027 LOG project can come up with.
