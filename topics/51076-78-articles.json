Mostly it seems to affect Kerbals going on a quick EVA for the biome reports, when timewarping quickly after reentering the capsule. It seems that if you wait a bit after going back \u0022in\u0022 it\u0027s much less of a problem. My guess its to do with the time to propagate the \u0022merging\u0022 of two vessels back to the server before entering timewarp but I\u0027m sure godarklight can isolate that one better .). At one point I observed a duplication of my empty ascend stage after staging but that was just once. Usually it seems to work. I don\u0027t see any difference between that particular staging event and others that went fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My friend got disconnected from the server (happens quite a bit but thats not an issue, really) and after he reconnected all his science research was gone. The research facility was still open and accessible but all nodes he had researched were locked again. He still did have the 6 science points leftover that he has had before the d/c. We tried reconnecting, restarting both client and server but nothing helped. Even tried hacking the persistent.sfs file on his machine to get him the points back but the KMP Server seems to store this somewhere else as the points were not applied after restarting both client / server again. I even had a very brief look into the SQLite database but while I found the scenarios I couldn\u0027t find the science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I had my own disconnect oddity after which the research facility was closed and all science instrument yielded the usual \u0022you\u0027re getting the suspicion you\u0027re not learning anything\u0022 messages and the like that you get when you try to do science in a Sandbox game. A client restart on my end fixed this however, my tech tree was still unlocked to where it should be and the instruments are yielding science again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ok I just had another thing that really annoys me. I have a probe in 200km / 1200km orbit around Jool which has 5 detachable probe landers. Once I detach one of these (small decoupler) thay end up in a random suborbital trajectory that always leads to their death. That\u0027s extremely annoying, especially considering how long it takes to get to Jool in the first place.
