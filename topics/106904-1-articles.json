They should be given slightly before you have the tech to do it easily to challenge a player to come up with a design.\n\nAs an example for the sat contracts: \n\nContract to be put in a rather LKO and allow more deviation from the contract requirements\n\nContract for a esentric orbit and having to be more precise with the orbit\n\nContract for geosync orbit\n\nContracts for putting up a sat linked to your scince parts tech level. Unlock the thermometer you get a contract to put a sat up with one attached, same with the scanning parts.\n\nAfter you complete each you will no longer get sat contracts for Kerbin. \n\nDo the above should help with not turning the game into grinding the same contracts to fund upgrades and missions that you really want to do."},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:40:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E After you complete each you will no longer get sat contracts for Kerbin.\n\nI like your idea except of this. i love satellite contracts and want to fill kerbins soi with them ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I would prefer an option to deactivate certain contract types for certain bodies or an option \n\nto allow or disallow completion of a contract type(while allowing would lead to the results you suggested)"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T12:55:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I like your idea except of this. i love satellite contracts and want to fill kerbins soi with them ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I would prefer an option to deactivate certain contract types for certain bodies or an option \n\u003E to allow or disallow completion of a contract type(while allowing would lead to the results you suggested)\n\nIn GameData\\Squad\\Contracts\\Contracts.cfg there are many options that let you do these sorts of things.
