Just a per launch limitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a limit per mission, its likely you\u0027d never be able to build good sized space stations or bases at any point. Or if you could, ridiculous 1,000 part launchers would very much be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not opposed to ridiculous launchers, I just think that their place is more in sandbox mode than it is in career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso juggling a mission based cost limit might be darned hard to do. You\u0027d never be able to do anything permanent and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I suspose, I could see a \u0022method\u0022 whereby you are limited by the total cost of your space program. Launching and losing missions costs nothing. However, for every in existance ship (outright debris doesn\u0027t count) it counts against your total space program budget. So if you have 50,000cr worth of ships, stations and probes out there and your budgetary limit is 50,000cr, if you want to launch another ship, you\u0027ll have to recover/end something to get the budgetary money back to launch something else. That or earn more budget through accomplishing a goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, that\u0027ll neve really limit \u0022ridiculous\u0022 designs, but it could also be a method that could work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meyst","CreatedById":59881,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T17:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting idea, I don\u0027t know if the game is set up to track how many total launches you have made and what would be involved in doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think another interesting option is to add a node in the science building to the left or above the starting parts that a player could hit to convert science to more money for parts.
