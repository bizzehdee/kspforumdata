Once I understand how mods work with an existing app, create a backup of (at least) those sections of the vanilla app that will be overwritten. This way, you can revert to vanilla without having to reinstall the entire program. In the case of Remote Tech, I do not believe any stock files are ever overwritten. However, for say, MechJeb 2.09, the stock command pods are overwritten so that they all have mechjeb functionality. So in that case I copied the contents of the whole Squad Game Data directory and created this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\Backup of Squad Game Data\\Squad \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t actually need to back up that whole thing, only the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\Backup of Squad Game Data\\Squad\\Parts\\Command\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut it isn\u0027t really that much disk space and it was just easier to copy and paste the whole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Before I ever start to download any mods, I create a sub-directory in a place that I\u0027ll be able to find, such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\Downloads\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I create additional subdirectories for each mod I download, so I have for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\Downloads\\B9 Aerospace Pack R3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\Downloads\\Chatterer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\Downloads\\HOME 1.03\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eetc.,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe archive files that you download from the SpacePort go into their appropriate download sub-directory, and get extracted there, and then you can examine how the modder has packaged it and what you need to move where.

This may or may not be the actual case but regardless it is how things appear. Us users stating our issues IS constructive criticism as we are simply informing the makers of what we do and don\u0027t like.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo issues here - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You are not reading JDP and Cliph\u0027s statements to make the above comment. There has been nothing implied or phrased to say they are scrapping the current system. What they have said is that they are having to rebuild the system to function with the new way the core program handles certain things and to clean up the badly written (by their own admission) code in RT (v1). The statement has been made several times, quite clearly, that the end product for RT2 will contain the \u003Cstrong\u003ESAME FUNCTIONALITY\u003C/strong\u003E as RT1 with additional features added. It may go about handling that functionality differently, but it will still be the same functionality. The only ones talking about changing functionality are \u003Cstrong\u003EUSERS\u003C/strong\u003E, most of whom haven\u0027t read what JDP and Cliph have stated nor have they actually looked at RT2, they\u0027re just making assumptions based on a few users complaining about how parts of a very early alpha of a new version isn\u0027t working (and which they were told wouldn\u0027t work) and then running with it and then 3 pages later, suddenly it\u0027s now \u0022fact\u0022 that something has been removed, added, or changed, all without a single post from either of the developers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Issues are not what you were stating. You stated that the flight computer has been changed when it hasn\u0027t. The \u003Cstrong\u003ECORE PROGRAM\u003C/strong\u003E has changed and that caused the problem between RT and MJ, not the developers. They even put as a \u0022bug\u0022 on the GitHub tracker before they even released the playtest version that it was a known issue. That says they are going to \u003Cstrong\u003E*FIX*\u003C/strong\u003E the issue and that it is not a design or implementation change that is planned or permanent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThree, Honestly it is rather insulting that you, for whatever reason, feel that if somebody doesn\u0027t understand something that they shouldn\u0027t be here AT ALL.

It gives players an option they didn\u0027t have before; to write programs for their probe that can be executed with remote instructions. Say you wanted to make your probe land in the previous version, and your signal delay is 10 minutes-- good luck landing anything when the controls take 10 minutes to respond to your input. In the new version, you can write a landing program that starts a deorbit burn, orients the craft away from the surface and starts a burn if the altitude is below a certain number, then extends the landing legs below a certain altitude, then switches off the engines.\u003Cp\u003EOr, you might write a program that checks the battery power level, and if power level goes below a certain value, it executes an emergency procedure that turns off unnecessary equipment and extends solar panels.
