Now they want to take their experiments to space to see if by creating the fastest head-on collision by two nuclear engines one could induce a wormhole to the mythical Sol star system rumored to be on the other end of the galaxy. Can you record the fastest orbital collision between two manmade objects - preferably the above-mentioned nuclear devices?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T02:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou do realize you can get to orbit in only 3 parts, right? A command pod, an X200-32 fuel tank, and an LV-T30 will get to orbit in a single stage, and if you\u0027re a good pilot it will even have enough fuel left for powered landing back on Kerbin. You could go \u0022cheaper\u0022 by using the X200-16 tank and an aerospike, but that\u0027s more difficult to control. For new players a parachute makes sense, obviously. And keep in mind the part costs right now make no sense and aren\u0027t even remotely balanced, they\u0027re merely placeholders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs described in your tutorial, the manned version of your basic orbiter doesn\u0027t have enough delta-V to reach orbit, and the unmanned one will run out of electricity if you have the throttle off for a few minutes. You want a lighter engine for the second stage like the LV-909, the T30 is overkill and too heavy for a small upper stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried either of the other 2 things you propose? An in-space collision with high relative velocity is actually very difficult to pull off and more down to luck than skill, the stock game doesn\u0027t give you enough information or precision to do this in any reliable way without cheating the persistence files (see one of Scott Manley\u0027s videos, I forget which).
