I mean I hate the good mods that keep making me want to install them. Oh and also not forum mods... Damned English isn\u0027t that clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the topic on hand and I have just counted the number of subfolders in my GameData folder and my jaw dropped when I realised it came to FORTY EIGHT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYup... I\u0027m a freakin mod addict.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strange thing is, my build isn\u0027t that unstable either. As soon as I shifted it to Open-GL a good 95% of the crashes stopped and a bit of fiddling with the mod versions fixed the rest. It does get low framerate at launch but I can deal with that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy complaint is that I keep coming across awesome mods that I have missed and find I just HAVE to have them... Like Smart Parts (that helps automate launches). I love being able to design craft that stage at specific altitudes or can dump fuel before landing. Then there is Throttle Controlled Avionics that help fly VTOL jets by balancing the thrust from the engines. You have to set the craft up right but ships that usually flip over now can fly nearly perfectly and can even land on the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup... Those are just two of the mods I have come across that I just couldn\u0027t imagine being without... and that is one top of my base requirements like Engineer, Mechjeb, Scansat etc... I like to build craft like NASA does and include all the automation so that you can plan on launching a craft and get it to land on a specific planet location with the minimum of input. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGod...
