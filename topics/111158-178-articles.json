I revived \u201CKSP vending machine\u201D and I wasn\u2019t scolded...\n\u003E \n\nThere\u0027s no rule forbidding necroposting.  Please be clear, **\u0022bumping\u0022 is not the same thing as necroposting.  Bumping is never okay.  Necroposting often is.**\n\nWhat we mean by \u0022bumping\u0022 is if you post in a thread, *\u003Cu\u003Eand then \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u003C/strong\u003E post in that same thread \u003Cstrong\u003Eagain\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E* specifically for purposes of \u0022trying to keep your thread on top\u0022.  Here\u0027s a classic example of what bumping looks like:\n\n1. There\u0027s some mod thread somewhere, perhaps a low-traffic one that doesn\u0027t get posts very often.\n2. User has problem.  Posts a question.  \u0022Help me, I\u0027ve got , can someone help?\u0022\n3. A day goes by and nobody else posts anything.\n4. That same user gets impatient and then posts *\u003Cu\u003Eagain\u003C/u\u003E* something like \u0022bump\u0022 or \u0022Anyone?\u0022 or the like.\n\nThat\u0027s not allowed, because it serves no useful purpose and *\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E* highly annoying to other forum members-- it\u0027s like someone who rings a doorbell, and when they don\u0027t get an answer, just keeps ringing and ringing the doorbell trying to get someone to answer the door.  Dude, you ring a doorbell *\u003Cu\u003Eonce\u003C/u\u003E*.  More than that is just annoying harassment.  In the above example, #2 *\u003Cu\u003Emay\u003C/u\u003E* have been a \u0022necro\u0022 if the thread were long dormant... but it may be a reasonable one, and it\u0027s not \u0022bumping\u0022.  #4, however, *\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E* bumping, and is not okay.\n\nThat\u0027s in stark contrast to mere necroposting, which *\u003Cu\u003Esometimes\u003C/u\u003E* may be silly and pointless (e.g. reviving a thread which really needs to stay dead, such as a Gameplay Questions thread from a KSP version five years ago that\u0027s no longer relevant because KSP has changed since then).  But there\u0027s also such a thing as a \u0022righteous necro\u0022, where the old thread may still be perfectly relevant, so there\u0027s nothing wrong with reviving it.\n\nFor example, maybe there\u0027s a mod thread that hasn\u0027t had a post in a long time-- maybe it\u0027s just that not a lot\u0027s happening so nobody has had any reason to post recently.  It\u0027s not *\u003Cu\u003Edead\u003C/u\u003E*, it\u0027s *\u003Cu\u003Eresting\u003C/u\u003E*.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)  So asking a question there could be perfectly legitimate.\n\nOr, take the example of the [KSP\u0027s Vending Machine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/101246-ksps-vending-machine/) thread that you mention, in Forum Games:  It sat around gathering dust for a couple of years, and then [you posted in it](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/101246-ksps-vending-machine/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=3577094).\n\n**That\u0027s not a bump.**  So you didn\u0027t do anything even slightly \u0022wrong\u0022, and you\u0027re fine.\n\nSure, I guess you could call that a *\u003Cu\u003Enecro\u003C/u\u003E*... but in this case, I think it\u0027s a perfectly fair one.  That thread was gathering dust for a while, sure, but it\u0027s still just as \u0022valid\u0022 as it ever was, and nothing even slightly wrong with reviving it.  As evidenced by the fact that people are having fun with it and continuing to post after you.  So, ya done good.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nExamples like this are *\u003Cu\u003Ewhy\u003C/u\u003E* there\u0027s no actual rule against necroposting.  It *\u003Cu\u003Eoften\u003C/u\u003E* is somewhat inappropriate, but not always-- it depends on context.  In this case, you\u0027re perfectly fine.\n\n(What *\u003Cu\u003Ewould\u003C/u\u003E* have been \u0022bumping\u0022 would have been, suppose you posted in that game thread and then nobody posted after you for a while so you got impatient and posted *\u003Cu\u003Eagain\u003C/u\u003E* to try to \u0022ring the doorbell\u0022.  But you didn\u0027t do that, so you\u0027re good.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Lapis","CreatedById":193784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-11T18:59:14Z","Content":"[@Gargamel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/) how was the transition from normal forum user to mod?"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-11T19:35:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 36 minutes ago, lapis said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Gargamel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/) how was the transition from normal forum user to mod?\n\u003E \n\nHe\u0027s recovering nicely and the implant scar is healing well."},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-11T23:34:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, lapis said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Gargamel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/) how was the transition from normal forum user to mod?\n\u003E \n\nQuite abrupt and jarring to be honest.
