I spent the last 6 hours trying to get this stupid hatch to work and it is ALWAYS obstructed. I followed every tutorial in every thread on this forum and the wiki with no results. Every post has conflicting ideas which makes them useless for help. I CAN NOT get the stupid hatch to work unless I place the box colliders at y=0 and z\u0026lt;0. This is worthless because this is not where i want the hatch as it is in the center of my model not the top where to door is. Check the following picture, the top circular panel is where I want to airlock to be and the colliders are in the only spot it works. I can change x to any value and it works fine but y has to be 0 and z has to be less than 0 or it is obstructed. It DOESN\u0027T matter what size the colliders are. I can make them tiny or huge, intersect them all the way into the mesh or place them out in the middle of nowhere as long as y=0 and z\u0026lt;0 it works otherwise it doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m at the point of no return on my sanity here trying to get this to work and I need help. I would like to note that moving the entire station model down to the colliders does nothing as once I load the game the collider is at the same spot regardless of where the station is moved in unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1117.photobucket.com/albums/k581/Toxic_Tripod0/random/collider.png\u0022 alt=\u0022collider.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T01:56:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emake sure the Airlock only intersects 1 collider mesh in your model, also try capsule collider as it has smaller footprint compared to box collider.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T07:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat didn\u0027t work either.

Ignore everything else posted about this in other threads as they are all conflicting ideas. It does not matter if its a mesh or box collider, convex or not. It doesn\u0027t matter how or if they intersect the model mesh. What matters is that it is below 0,0,0. You can achieve this by moving the origin of your model ABOVE where you want the airlock to be in your modeling program then reimporting into unity. Then when you place your airlock and ladder it will be below 0,0,0 and will work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T18:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dunno...
