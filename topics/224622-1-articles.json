This just makes me wonder though, can we re-implement the Soviet space program parts again in KSP2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe need for soviet parts suddenly came up to me as I was building transport vehicles for my space station. Back when I had Making History in KSP1, I\u0027m obsessed with using a replica Soyuz as the designated vehicle, and more to that, Soyuz rocket EXCLUSIVELY for the transportation to the space station . I did try messing around and make Soyuz-like rockets in KSP2, but I can never get a function-heavy booster for the lauch stage, and now I really crave those Soviet enspired parts to be part of KSP2 again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, talking about replicating Heavy Launch Vehicles, I\u0027m also entrigued about the idea of creating Proton series, Energia and N1 in KSP2 as heavy lauch vehicles, since these *brutalist solution* to heavy payloads seems quite fitting for the KSP setting, RAMPING UP THE SIZE way of solution\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoomsdayDuck555","CreatedById":229813,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-28T16:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think they may have said that implementing a whole new part diameter would take too much time away from milestones, so they would consider this after 1.0.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
