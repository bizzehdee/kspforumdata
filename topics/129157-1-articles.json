You could try to create some sort of interlocking stucture using the modular girder (which IIRC is available in the demo) but you are going to have two big problems. Problem 1 - things will break, especially in the transition between warp / ordinary time. Problem 2 - when physics are no longer applied (i.e. when switching away to another craft) your interlocked ships will be treated as two separate entities and will drift apart since their orbits cannot be identical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T15:59:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose technically the parts of the station don\u0027t need to connect?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they are in stable orbits a few meters from each other then the crew can just EVA from section to section as they need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s unusual and perhaps not efficient but I can\u0027t see why it wouldn\u0027t work.
