I play career mode so I am limited in my parts. I have noticed strange things with the basic jet engine, and I don\u0027t know if they are normal as far as the game is concerned, normal in real life and I know much less than I thought, or what. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, I have noticed my craft with basic jet engines equipped gain speed in climbs, even steep climbs, regardless of the mass of my craft vs. thrust (well, so far). Now I understand the higher I get the less dense the atmosphere gets, but these are jet engines that require air intake, as well and because of that they never get high enough for less dense air atmosphere to make much a difference. So then why am I always gaining speed in a climb...? I don\u0027t abuse the number of intakes I use, as I like to keep things looking believable. I realize in real world examples it\u0027s when the pounds of thrust exceeds the weight of the aircraft (such as why F-16s can gain speed in a near vertical climb) but ingame it happens no matter what.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother weird thing I noticed is that, even at full engine power in a 90 degree dive, my craft always LOSE SPEED. Now it goes without saying that there\u0027d be no justification for that, as the only thing that could cause that to happen was if I started from so high up in much thinner atmosphere that I would be slowing down to terminal velocity, and it goes without saying that is not the case. So why am I LOSING speed in full powered dives?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am new to KSP so I\u0027m sure there\u0027s easy explanations lurking somewhere for this that I am just not getting.

The avionics let the pilot take it right to the ragged edge of the envelope, hopefully keeping it just on the controllable side of the line (and Martin-Baker takes care of the other side of the line\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, is that SAS should be viewed as a standard and non-cheaty feature of planes in KSP. All of the standard cockpits have the full SAS system included. The only difference (after the SAS system was reworked a few versions ago) between the cockpits, the IRW, and the IAS is the amount of torque and cosmetic appearance. If the cockpit alone provides sufficient torque, you don\u0027t gain anything by having additional SAS units on the plane, but they can be added as and when required. The 3 standard cockpits provide 10 torque each, which I personally reckon is plenty for most 10-20t planes. The IRW provides 8, and the IAS 15.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need more than 1.0 torque per ton to make a plane controllable, there\u0027s a good chance that the design has fundamental issues which should be fixed other than by adding more torque, and more than 0.5 per ton should have you thinking about whether you\u0027ve got sufficient control surfaces and the CoM vs CoL vs CoT reasonable. Too much torque can also be a bad thing, as it can allow you to push the plane beyond the envelope and cause a spin. No amount of torque will properly fix a plane which has a fundamentally bad CoM vs CoL vs CoT and goes into a spin at the slightest control input. When the SAS is active, you can watch the pitch/yaw/roll indicators on the bottom left of the screen to see how hard it\u0027s having to work \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC.if any of them are constantly at or close to max during straight and level flight or gentle climb/descent, there\u0027s a design problem with the plane. Of course, as with the real world, it\u0027s a valid choice to design a plane to be on the edge of instability, for maximum responsiveness, and there is no 100% correct way to design them (but plenty of ways to create smoking holes in the ground\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for RCS, it\u0027s a useful feature, a requirement for orbital docking (more or less), but there\u0027s something wrong with the plane if it\u0027s uncontrollable in simple atmospheric flight without it turned on. Keep it switched off, other than when required, or you\u0027ll rapidly run out of RCS fuel and not have any when you do need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T13:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERe Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, it\u0027s effectively very dense (because of the screwy drag model) but it does drop off quickly with altitude.
