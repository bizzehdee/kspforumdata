I have the Mission Control and Tracking Station upgrades necessary to allow maneuver nodes. I set a node to help me get LKO insertion. Then when I returned to the orbital map to do an orbital alignment, it would not set a node. I clicked repeatedly on the blue orbit, but it would not open a node. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat went wrong here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not seeing the spacecraft position as it moves around the orbit in the map display.

It is a relatively uncommon but annoying bug that has existed ever since manoeuvre nodes were implemented IIRC. It is sometimes possible to work around it by creating a node on a different part of your trajectory and moving it, particularly if there is an SOI change involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the spacecraft, open map view and bring up the NavBall. Hover over the top edge of the screen in the centre and you can filter by ship type (like in the tracking station). It is likely you accidentally turned off the icon for the type of ship you are flying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DennyC","CreatedById":92723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T21:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot it, Thanks. Eventually I\u0027ll get caught up with the changes in 1.0. I\u0027ve watched a number of the tutorial videos; a very good resource, but sometimes not for searching for a specific answer.
