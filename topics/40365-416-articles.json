I also think that the time and expense and skill involved in setting up a microwave power network should result in some pretty decent rewards. IMO, the rocket nozzle should probably cost approximately the same as a regular engine (pretend the nontrivial cost is in generating the magnetic confinement and in materials/electronics that can tolerate the magnetic flux and stray energetic particle). You\u0027ll still benefit from cost savings on boosters and fuel.

Same goes with the thermal rockets. The thermal jets are another story, since they involve a little more complexity than the stock parts, except there is now another comparable choice: the RAPIER engine. Both can switch fuel, except the thermal jets and thermal rockets are even more versatile in their usable reaction mass. So the thermal jets and rockets should be more expensive than the RAPIER, but not by orders of magnitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thermal receivers shouldn\u0027t be prohibitively expensive either, as I make my point further down... Generators need not be exceptionally expensive either, as it is basically the same as radiators... it\u0027s not out-of-this-world technology...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reactors on the other end are what should be most costly, and with a very steep cost increase as the technology gets more evolved. A fission reactor can be built literally in Jeb\u0027s scrapyard (see \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.dangerouslaboratories.org/radscout.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERadioactive Boyscout\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) A fusion reactor, we still haven\u0027t managed, and it\u0027s been 10 years down the road for the past 50 years... Antimatter reactors are even farther down the road, if ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo by making the fusion reactors, say 2 or 3 orders of magnitude more costly than the fission ones, and the antimatter reactors 2 or 3 orders of magnitude more expensive than the fusion ones, we\u0027d have our desired technological speed bump as far as infrastructure goes. Relatively cheap fission reactors, bulky and not quite game breaking. More expensive fusion reactors, which would limit their widespread use in the beginning, but would eventually become the mainstream as funds get available. Antimatter reactors, you might purchase 2 or 3 of the larger ones in the whole Kerbal system if the parts are priced with an exponential scheme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3) Theoretical science should be much more demanding\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe antimatter collector, antimatter reactors and antimatter containment units and the Alcubiere drives should be a LOT more demanding as far as science points goes. IMHO the antimatter tech should be 5 times the science points they now require, and the Alcubiere drive should be in the 50000-100000 range... With contracts it is now much easier to generate science, so I think that having such a high limit would give those of us valuing gameplay and those of us wanting a degree of plausible realism a nice balance, requiring to put in place a science and resource collection infrastructure in the whole system before having the means to leave for the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDISCLAIMER: \u003Cem\u003EThose are my opinions and do not reflect negatively in any way, shape or form on the comments of previous contributors nor of the mod\u0027s authors and experimental contributors.\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T22:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIncreasing the warp drive\u0027s science cost is irrelevant once the lab is available.

Here\u0027s how I would take a stab at balancing: Add up all of the science available from running stock or Interstellar experiments at all possible locations. Add a percentage margin for renewable science sources like labs, asteroids, and contracts, and subtract a percentage that gets spent on retrofitting upgrades to hardware. I would guess that if the whole KSPI tech tree cost about 110% of what you can get by running experiments, it would feel about right. The tricky part is that so many other mods are science sources, Custom Biomes being a big one. Might need a couple of versions of the tree so you can pick the one that feels right with the rest of your setup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T22:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Der Kosmos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Der Kosmos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow that costs are a thing, it might be an idea to have new parts for the upgraded things, rather than have them be automatically replaced.

Collecting science at the moment is a pretty tedious thing to do, and in no way fun if you go to such extremes.
