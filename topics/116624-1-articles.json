After thinking it was just how powerful the booster was, I took off the spoiler and it only reached the same speed in about twice the time.\n\nThis gets me thinking, how many of you have used spoilers on your craft to get them to go faster?"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T02:15:44Z","Content":"Spoilers don\u0027t make things go faster, as the name says they spoil the airflow and push the vehicle down, they creates drag. A car with a spoiler is slower in a straight line. They do allow higher cornering speeds though."},{"CreatedByName":"FirePhoenix","CreatedById":148645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T02:30:50Z","Content":"Oh, well then I have no idea what I created then.

They prevent the car from lifting off, thereby allowing more power to be transmitted from engine to ground.
