After thinking it was just how powerful the booster was, I took off the spoiler and it only reached the same speed in about twice the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gets me thinking, how many of you have used spoilers on your craft to get them to go faster?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T02:15:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpoilers don\u0027t make things go faster, as the name says they spoil the airflow and push the vehicle down, they creates drag.
