You want to take seismometer readings from several nearby locations and compare them. You want a thermometer to tell you the temperature gradient as you descend. You want to know how the gravity is changing as you orbit, to detect the pattern of non-uniform planet material density. The solution to this was to make you transmit many times, when what it should have been was to make the science data require travel to be worth full points. i.e. if you turn on the gravioli detector, time warp through several polar orbits, and then send your data, you get full value, but if you just send a single datapoint you don\u0027t.

What we have in Kerbal feels more like the 60\u0027s than anything else (and rightfully so, since that was when the space age really took off.) But in modern times? We learn a lot more from probes now than we can from manned missions, IMO. There are (sadly) only two reasons to send humans to other worlds now. One is for the sake of compensating for errors, and the other is to draw the crowds. By remote control, a probe can remain in space gathering data practically forever, and we\u0027re learning a TON more information than we would by sending humans, simply because we\u0027d have to bring them back in a relatively short time if we wanted them to still be alive. A probe can sit there and stare at one rock for a month if it wants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the science garnered from a thermometer too much? Sure it is. But a thermometer (or even a fully-loaded probe) doesn\u0027t come close to how much we learn from the real thing. There are countless instruments that the game doesn\u0027t even delve into, and I imagine that is why we get so much from the simplistic things we CAN put on a probe. They\u0027re generalized representations of what real probes can give us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said all of that, it still makes sense that the manned missions result in more \u0027science\u0027 than the probes. Anything NASA/JPL has done has gathered some attention, but still none of it comes close to Apollo. Were we to send humans to Mars, or even back to the moon, that would be more attention than space has gotten in decades. Imaginations would be sparked, career interests would change, and there would be a renewed public interest in humanity\u0027s future in space. This ultimately leads to more people studying to become rocket scientists, astrophysicists, etc, resulting in: BAM! More science and better tech. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, when I first heard about the career system, I pictured something a bit more RPG or Sim-City like. How you manage your space agency doesn\u0027t just impact what you can learn. You would also have to do things to keep the public (not just the science geeks, but EVERYONE) interested. Public interest makes it a political interest, which results in more funding. You can send all the probes you want and learn tons, but make few headlines. There would always come a point where you have to score a hail mary touchdown to get the crowds going wild. This would be a lot more interesting if life-support was an actual factor though.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-26T17:06:10Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2014 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T17:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting thoughts, vger.
