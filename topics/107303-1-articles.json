The target orbit does not appear in map view after I\u0027ve accepted the contract, but it does appear if I look at it through the tracking station. The weird thing is I\u0027ve already complete 2 satellite contracts and everything was working fine, and now suddenly it isn\u0027t. \n\nI\u0027m on 1.0.2 and no mods. \n\nAnybody else notice this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T05:39:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Supernovy**"},{"CreatedByName":"holedoor","CreatedById":142960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T23:21:47Z","Content":"This just happened to me. I have 1.0.2, 64 bit on windows 7, steam, no mods. I accepted a solar orbit satellite contract. I saw the orbit guide in the tracking center. I built the satellite/rocket and put it on the launch pad, and when i zoomed out to map, the guide was gone. Tried to restart game, move in and out of tracking station, restart the launch. My persistent and quicksave are after it happened, and previous game save was before last mission and i don\u0027t want to do that one over again, so i have to contract the solar satellite mission and take a loss in funds."},{"CreatedByName":"pearldrumbum","CreatedById":133163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T02:38:02Z","Content":"I figured it out. In my case it was user error. If the contract has an orbit around a body other than Kerbin you have to double click that body to focus on it and it will show. The orbits it\u0027s showing in at the tracking station include contracts you haven\u0027t accepted yet.\n\nTry double clicking on the sun to shift focus there and see if it shows the target orbit"},{"CreatedByName":"holedoor","CreatedById":142960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T03:30:22Z","Content":"that seemed to be the trick"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T05:40:15Z","Content":"Tag changed to Not a Bug, then."}]}
