It was half the size of Earth, and orbited a red dwarf. it had only one moon, big enough to stabilize it\u0027s axial tilt, and had an oxygenated atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was named Kurth, or \u0022New Earth\u0022. The moon was called Mon, and there they built the Hummin civilization for millions of years. The Hummins over time developed giant heads, lost skin tone, and developed compound eyes. They were also rather skinny. These became known as the Draki. They soon colonized the nearest star system, known as Kerbol. It had a habitable planet in it called Kerbin, where they colonized first, even though it had twice the gravity that the Draki were used to. It had a large moon called Mun and a small moon called Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Draki on Kurth eventually went extinct, as they had gone into a war that destroyed all civilization on it. The Kerbin Draki, meanwhile, were still prospering, but they had become lazy. They had servants, but they were paid too much for the average person. There was no way they were going to enslave their own kind, so they bred a new breed of Draki that were mostly stupid. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were called Kervants, and they were not as stupid as the Draki thought. Three Kervants revolted, and were banished to the dead planet Kurth. Jebidiah, Bill and Bob found some damaged Draki technology, and fixed it up so they would be cloned so they couldn\u0027t die. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey spent hundreds of years developing a rocket that could return to Kerbin. When they fianlly returned, they found the Kervasnts had taken over, and that they were now called Kerbals. They had nothing to do, so Jeb started KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-18T19:49:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2014 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlamingPotatoes","CreatedById":35731,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T21:50:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting idea!
