On very low gravity bodies you can even push em upright by walking into them. If using RCS remember to kill the sas before hand or the pod will use its torque to fight the rcs and try to return it to the horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mun is a bit massy for these tricks unless packing some serious RCS, what you have may not cut it, however you did appear to land on an upwards facing slope which is nice. Use pod torque to roll it around so it\u0027s facing as close to up-hill as you can get and it can be possible to take off horizontally like that, a la spaceplane. Again its a tactic designed for lower gravity, but you may be able to get it back off the deck without much more than a snapped leg or two on the underside as you lift clear.

Turn SAS off, then fold up your gear. Follow celem\u0027s advice and use RCS to get it upright.
