That is indicated by the crossing marker pointing at exactly the same place as the inclination marker so I find it easy to set up. That place becomes the place where I will meet the ship, actually in just two more burns. First burn is when the \u0022target position at intersect\u0022 marker gets sufficiently close and I can move it to match the intersect marker by a small burn at the meeting point, either prograde or retrograde. And second burn is to brake at the target. That last burn can be prepared by putting a maneuver at the point and matching the two orbits with that maneuver. That tells you not only which direction you need to burn, but also when you need to start if you don\u0027t want to overshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T06:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryxal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kryxal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EScott Manley\u0027s always popular ... this one\u0027s about 6 months old.\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/srsiLZLPiv0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much for the link!
