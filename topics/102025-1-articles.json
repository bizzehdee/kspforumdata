Instead it is a proof of concept or a first draft of the challenge. I am putting this out there to get my ideas for a challenge out into the Kerbal Space Program community,with the hope that with community feedback I could then improve and eventually finalize the challenge for full publication on these forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis challenge isn\u0027t something that I myself can do right now, but it is going to be a goal for me to aim for, something that I want to accomplish in my time with Kerbal Space Program. My hope is that by watching others more experienced complete this challenge I will learn from them in my endeavors to complete this challenge myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... here is my ideas for the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackstory; Life on Kerbin is going to be over in the next 100 years. (either through global warming, global catastrophe, or whatever you can think of.) So the governments on Kerbin have banded together to create the Kerbal Interstellar Colonization Space Program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir plan: They want to be able to evacuate at least \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BE of all kerbals on the planet. Some of them will be placed in a colony on Duna, but everyone else will be heading off to seed kerbal life on distant star systems. The idea is that when Kerbin becomes habitable once more, the colony of Duna will send out a message to the other stars that Kerbin can now be returned to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have been put in charge of the first phase of this interstellar program. You\u0027re charge is not to see this plan come to fruition, but to lay down the ground work for it; doing the needed research to improve the technology kerbals have available, and to conduct the needed tests that will makes this plan a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjective: You will need to build a prototype interstellar colony ship which is self-sustaining. With only the colony ship in the immediate area, kerbals must be able to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild and Launch new rocket ships, probes, and satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollect resources for fuel and rocket parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand finally be able to build self-sustaining colonies on distant planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship cannot be built in orbit of Kerbin or any of it\u0027s moons because the governments fear that kerbals with telescopes will see the construction and panic. Best place to build it is in orbit of Duna which will need it\u0027s own colony as well. Building a self-sustaining colony on Duna (of 30 or more Kerbals) may actually help with the construction of the interstellar colony ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce constructed, the ship will need to go on it\u0027s maiden voyage. This voyage must be captained by none other than Jebudiah Kermin, and hold 100 kerbals for colonization. The ship will go on an interstellar journey to any one star system outside the Kerbal system, will then plant a colony on one of the available planets, and then it must return to the Kerbal system so that Jebudiah can land back on Kerbin to report his success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that point onward, the ship that you have built will become the schematics that all the goverments on Kerbin use to build all the other colony ships to evacuate Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the needed timeline that this needs to occur by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 years from the start of the program, the interstellar colony ship must already be under construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30 years form the start, the colony ship must be ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd after 50 years from the start, Jebudiah Kermin must be back on Kerbin to report his success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this tight schedule is because the goverments on Kerbin must begin the construction process for all the other ships by the second half of the century so that they have enough time for the evacuation to commence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final note: The challenge can not be completed in Sandbox mode. Science mode is acceptable, but you can try career mode if you want an even greater challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge entries are done either by recording a video of the interstellar colony ships maiden voyage, or by streaming it on twitch (although a complete series of the challenge on YouTube or twitch would be nice for those wanting to learn how to do it themselves,) or creating a KSP After Action Report thread on these forums. (pictures are a must.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that is the basic idea of the challenge in a nutshell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some required mods for the challenge (although this list is not completely comprehensive.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScanSat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither Kethane, Karbonite, or other alternative resource for fuel mod.

One idea that i have been playing with is time-based scoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. you must start construction of the ship by year 20 as per the rules. Eveyone who does so gets 100 points. However, you can get 200 points for starting it by year 15, 300 points for starting it by year 10, and 400 points for starting it by year 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The ship must be complete and tested by year 30 as per the rules. Eveyone who does so gets 100 points. However, you can get 200 points for doing it by year 25, 300 points by year 20, 400 points by year 15, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Jebudiah must be back by year 50 as per the rules. Everyone who does so gets 200 points. You get more points the early he comes back, as before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that is it. Again this is only a proof of concept, or rough draft. Please let me know what you think of it, and if there is anything that I can do to improve it.

Yes, this big boy actually took off the launchpad by itself, with a little push from some boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Deciding what parts could I cut out to reduce the horrible lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Trying to combine all of the MKS/OKS stuff in a single launch so I don\u0027t waste the money.

It will include gathering as much science as possible from the planet and moons, building a communications network around the kerbin planetary system, building a refuel and repair space station in geostationary orbit directly over KSC, and a mining colony of the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 2 would be a misson to eve to get as much science from it\u0027s planetary system as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 3 would be a mission to Duna to set up the permanent colony there, a mining colony on ike, and the space station that will become the intersellar colony shipyard. Also during phase 3 would the precendent to set up a more permanent program architecture and transport system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 4 would see the start of the construction of the Interstellar Colony ship in orbit around Duna while a small interplanetary colony ship is being built around Kerbin with a planned mission to Jool to colonize Jool\u0027s moons, get as much science from them as possible, and to build mining colonies on them returning to Kerbin with all the science and resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 5 Would see science missions sent out to the other planets to finish the research on the intersellar technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 6 Would see the launch of the Interstelllar Colony Ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach phase would have it\u0027s own timeline of when it needs to start and when it needs to finish in order fit everything into the timeline of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn further thing that the person who posted above brought to my attention, people playing on career mode must start with the least of amount of money possible as well as cutting down rewards from contracts to %50.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, science mode is still going to be the preferable mode for this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand so that is my idea.
