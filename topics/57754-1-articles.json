Ignoring the fact that squad has any and all rights to do what ever they want with this game as per the TOS as displayed on their website. it also amazes me at how little people understand about the development cycle with regards to content delivered over time. I saw a good graph about ita little while back, basically it described an exponential curve that said that over time the amount of \u0022content\u0022 delivered decreases per the amount of time spent on it. Example when the game such as ksp is first released the first updates seems like a huge amount of core gameplay content delivered. If you look at the version history you can see this. however what they don\u0027t realize is that this is what happens with all video games during development. It is simply impossible to continue adding large amounts of core gameplay elements without Ignoring the features already in the game and making them unpolished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in response to the comment with regards to deadlines and being finished when it\u0027s done. GTAVs multiplayer is a perfect example of where sticking to a deadline is detrimental to the game. Also have you ever driven on a half finished bridge? I would hope everyone remains civil in this discussion and not contribute to the negative stereotype of online communities and forums. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDodger\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T07:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stargate525\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stargate525\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Wow.
