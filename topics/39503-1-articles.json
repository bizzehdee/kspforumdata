Too many security issues. Minecraft modders used Megaupload/RG and other services to make a few bucks. There is nothing illegal about using them that way. Whether this forum wants to allow it is another matter. Squad may also take issue as it would pull traffic away from the spaceports. But there is nothing stopping people from using such services on other forums. It\u0027s all up to the mod creators to decide how they want to distribute their material.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
