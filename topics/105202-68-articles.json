Who said USI-LS was easier?  I never considered it easier, just different.  With the latest changes it is definitely not easier than TAC-LS.\n\u003E \n\nIve got the life support turned on as well. And agroponics. Ive followed the tutorial on mks-l and ive got it all set up right in theory it should be mass producing supplies. Also roverdude said that. Its designed to be in between tac and snacks. Not anymore I guess.\n\nThings are really messed up right now. I just cant produce anything. I put people in the hab and my supplies go up. Switch them back to the scout pod my supplies just drained from 200 to 0 in 5 seconds. And when ive got my kerbals in the hab I dont produce any mulch.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T22:21:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 10:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Yuri kagarin56**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T22:13:17Z","Content":"hmm... you should most definitely not be making fertilizer... let me see what\u0027s up, probably a bug on my end ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yuri kagarin56","CreatedById":137490,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T22:33:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 minutes ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E hmm... you should most definitely not be making fertilizer... let me see what\u0027s up, probably a bug on my end ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nAny idea about supplies draining in seconds and supply readouts coming out wrong?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T23:04:45Z","Content":"Will have to take a peek.

The bad news is, EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT. Or close enough. I can\u0027t find RoverDudes posts ATM (thanks, gigantic forum thread without subdivisions like in a subforum), but here\u0027s the bottom line:\n\n- Consumption is up 4-fold. Yep.\n\n- Recyclers are available that reduce the consumption by 4 times, (so to the old level). Those are now in the stock Mobile processing lab and in some MKS parts.\n\n- kerbals don\u0027t like being cooped up too long, they get homesick. Bring more space than needed, and bring multipliers. Those would be the cupola and the hitchiker.\n\n- everything is configurable. If you have MKS, you have to configure it twice, once in the USI-LS settings, once in UKS/USI-LS.cfg\n\n-not all the bugs are out just yet\n\nHappy life supporting.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-09T08:55:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2016 08:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kobymaru**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kobymaru","CreatedById":107372,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-09T13:24:18Z","Content":"This is GitHub issues [#72](https://github.com/BobPalmer/USI-LS/issues/72), just posting here to generate some attention:\n\nPlease consider the following two pictures:\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/FDVEK/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nHere you see, that in the 10 seconds that have passed between the screenshots, the remaining habitation time has gone down by 31 seconds.\n\nIt seems that when the Recyclers are enabled, they produce \u0022Wear\u0022 (consume ReplacementParts), that reduces the vessels maximum habitation time which in turn reduces the kerbals current habitation time, faster than the game time.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if the Wear produced by the Recyclers is a feature (why would recycling cause wear on the parts?).\n\nEither way, the habitation time readout should show the actual time that the Kerbal has currently left, not \u0022a time if no recyclers were running\u0022.
