How I escape from the moons is to head \u0027eastwards\u0027 until I reach escape velocity for that particular body. Then it\u0027s just a matter of adjusting your orbit to get your periapsis low enough for a good old aerobraking.You might find this more fuel efficient than your method, too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkoRagnos","CreatedById":28181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T08:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope, easiest way is to burn so your apoapsis is heading in the opposite direction of travel to the object you\u0027re orbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you escape the object\u0027s gravitational pull so you ended up in kerbin orbit again, keep burning until you have as little PE as you need\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12161104/images/ksp/example.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022example.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T15:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ET10 and MarkoRagnos basically said the same thing. (Handy diagram, by the way.) The idea is to angle your ascent so that, when you coast clear of Mun\u0027s/Minmus\u0027 SOI, you\u0027re simply falling back to Kerbin. The ascent was your de-orbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jay_Em","CreatedById":47145,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T17:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just got back from Minmus with a rescue mission using the same method as the one that MarkoRagnos posted, so I can verify that it\u0027s correct. It works perfectly, and I only required one other small burn to land on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
