A lot of good ideas have been thrown out and thankfully it sounds like intercept is taking a good hard look at this and KSP2 will be pretty different from KSP1. There are some pitfalls though that aren\u0027t entirely obvious. For instance if you have science accumulate over time you need a check to prevent time-warping through the whole tech tree\u00A0that also doesn\u0027t punish people for\u00A0time-warping to Jool when they need to. It\u0027s not insurmountable, but it is a challenge. One way to do this is to have \u0027raw data\u0027 that needs time to be processed, so you can time-warp a certain amount of science at which point progress would halt until you collected more data. Another check could be an exhaustible life-support system of some kind, but ideally any life support system would\u00A0be to some degree set-it-and-forget-it once properly supplied so you could time-warp years at a time to other star systems without having to go back and babysit each colony along the way. I\u0027ve also suggested in the past having goal-dates for different discoveries that give players extra rewards for getting out and doing things quickly. It\u0027s also unclear so far whether \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E resources themselves will be depletable over time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other pitfall would be making a system thats overly prescriptive or distracts from key missions. A lot of folks have complained that generic science points \u0027don\u0027t make sense\u0027 but they do one crucial thing: allow players to do the missions they want to do and get science along the way. If you link specific parts to specific tasks you\u0027ve actually created a linear set of missions that players must do more or less in order whether they like those types of missions or not\u00A0because its only way to unlock what they need. A non-specific point-buy system allows players to go out and collect science while doing the missions they want to do and then buy the parts they want to buy. I\u0027ve been of the opinion that its not the points themselves that make KSP1 grindy, but all of the repetitive clicking and scrounging\u00A0it takes to get them.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA big one I agree with folks on is the idea that experiments should also give the player useful information.
