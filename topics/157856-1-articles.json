If I can do a high speed rover at warp x1, it don\u0027t survive long at x3 or x4. It starts being shaky and losing control.

The new Unity uses a new version of PhysX that has a bug in the springs and in the joints between parts. The devs are under the impression that the spring bug and the joint bug will be fixed at some point by Unity. The devs gave us spring settings and damping settings to try to make up for the bug. But there is a bug, and it can\u0027t be fixed by Squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as spring and damping settings, there is no specific rule. If there were, the devs would have implemented the rule and not bothered with putting the settings in the tweakables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou basically want the springs set according to the weight of the vehicle. So on the Mun, you need to set them extra soft. On Minmus, you need them even softer. On Tylo, you want them harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter you have the springs set properly, you can adjust the damping to minimize bouncing. Usually it doesn\u0027t need to be changed much. I find that moving it a little bit in the direction that the springs were adjusted seems to help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some other people who are a bit religious about never touching those settings.
