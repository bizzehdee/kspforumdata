when bring near the reaction masses, accelerate until 20m/s\u00A0(variable per total\u00A0mass of ship);\u00A0is very fast to change these actions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Gravity constant\u00A0reactor (Pitch and Bias): a part that works like engine, not requires store negative energy, but consumes a lots of electricity when change the acceleration, accelerate until 50m/s^2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Warp drive reactor: a part that works like engine, consume and destroy negative energy when is active, but consumes more electricty than the produced for the generation of negative energy; her work\u00A0althrought change directly the\u00A0velocity instead the acceleration, and when not work brake to original velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe acceleration by previous methods cancel the G forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Differential sail engine: a engine that only consume negative energy, accelerating like another normal engine, with G forces and low power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIdea based in:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ntrs.nasa.gov/?N=0\u0026amp;Ntk=All\u0026amp;Ntt=breakthrough%20propulsion%20physics\u0026amp;Ntx=mode%20matchallpartial\u0026amp;Nm=123%7CCollection%7CNASA%20STI%7C%7C17%7CCollection%7CNACA%7C%7C125%7CCollection%7CNIX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/?N=0\u0026amp;Ntk=All\u0026amp;Ntt=breakthrough%20propulsion%20physics\u0026amp;Ntx=mode%20matchallpartial\u0026amp;Nm=123|Collection|NASA%20STI||17|Collection|NACA||125|Collection|NIX\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-11T16:04:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2015 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angeltxilon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAclaration\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T22:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this is about a mod and not for the core game it\u0027s now in addon discussion \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angeltxilon","CreatedById":149432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-11T15:57:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
