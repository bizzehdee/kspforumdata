Kipard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow can I add FAR and Heatshields to other pods like the FASA pods etc?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For a nonablative heatshield can just do what Nathan posted. Ablative is it bit more complicated but will look something like what is posted below and you just need to tweak the values to what you want.
