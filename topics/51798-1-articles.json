Not like returning a Mun rock the first, okay fourth try is all that hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what about other planets? It takes a considerable amount of engineering and tech to return safely with science so we can call it in for a discount, grinding the science down to nothing before a live sample is studied in person. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewould a science lab meant for stations and bases be a good idea to mitigate that reduced science output? It has to be manned of course. The more the better? Perhaps an IVA crew station to do science on? Just looking ahead on the improved IVA concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are mods that deal with tech/science/experiments that deal with this. However I assume squad is not done doing what ever they have in store for stock science. So go forth and discuss. Unless this has already been talked about. what ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
