My criticisms (i know its your first but its always to have things to work on, like i need to get wayy better at drawing people..) woulde be that the legs need shifting over a bit, the part where his legs join his body doesnt seem to.. Work well... As well as his waist. He seems to get slightly chubby but other than that its fine! I love the art style.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
