I have tried the same a few times but when I decouple the stages and open their parachutes these stages still seem to not be recoverable once I finish the mission. Does someone have any design advice?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow I tried doing it was pretty much by building a well-strutted lower stage and by putting many chutes on them. Then I\u0027d set up the staging so the chutes would open at the same times as the stack decouplers and the engines of the upper stages would be in a separate stage so they don\u0027t burn the chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this doesn\u0027t seem to work. I suspect the chutes can\u0027t take the speeds but I can\u0027t really check because of control restrictions (only one vessel at a time).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T16:29:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 04:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T10:46:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile in the atmosphere KSP (now, since 1.0) keeps calculating vessels up to ca. 22km away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you manage to time the opening of the parachutes or better the landing of your booster stage with the ascent of the rest of your rocket you might get lucky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most of these users most likely use the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-1-0-2-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-6-%285-15-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStageRecovery\u003C/a\u003E mod which refunds your lower stages as soon as KSP unloads them (below ca. 22km in the atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do not want to mod your game, you can try to build rockets that take there booster stage high up into the atmosphere and while your next stage is on its way to a high APoapsis or maybe even after it has reached a stable orbit, you can switch to your booster stage and watch it land - might require you to add a probe core to the booster, but activating parachutes at the same time as seperating the stage should work too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T14:30:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T11:27:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShort of using the mod mentionned above, you can\u0027t reuse everything. As the range is now 22.5km, you can recover very early stages such as boosters, but they don\u0027t cost a lot. You can also recover very late stages. but you can\u0027t recover mid flight stages (which is usually the most expensive part. Further more, if you want a good rate of recovery, you have to control the landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor cost efficiency reasons, I went also into reusable launchers and ended with SSTO rockets. The easy way to do it is to design SSTO rocket stage able to orbit payload then deorbit itself and reenter as near as KSC as possible. If you time it right, you get a very cheap price to LKO. When you have your basic design, you can easily tweak it for each of you needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I did : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123195-Cygnus-family-Recoverable-SSTO-Rockets-from-12-to-236-tons\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECygnus family reusable rockets (SSTO)\u003C/a\u003E.
