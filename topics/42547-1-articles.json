Of course, this may be for role playing purposes, but it got me thinking -- what are the benefits of a horizontal takeoff jet-powered space plane versus a vertical takeoff SSTO (which also has jets to reduce fuel consumption, similarly to Scott Manley\u0027s reusable space program launch system)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had to much experience, and I\u0027ve only just started using the B9 aerospace pack (which may invalidate what I\u0027m about to say), but it would appear that horizontal takeoff SSTOs don\u0027t have as much payload capacity, so if one was to want a SSTO design for lifting large quantities of fuel/cargo, a vertical takeoff SSTO would be best. Is this still the case with B9 aerospace (since the B9 mod adds some pretty high capacity fuel tanks and some pretty large aircraft)?

Anything a spaceplace can do in this regard, a normal rocket can do better, and with a lot less aggravation in making it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, some folks like to say they have a \u0022green\u0022 space program, where everything is reused. Hence they go for spaceplanes rather than dump boosters all over the place. But this has no bearing on the game, it\u0027s just personal preference. And as I understand things from my NASA buddies, the \u0022reusable\u0022 Space Shuttle program was a mistake anyway. It cost more to create the global infrastructure to support shuttle operations, and to refurbish the orbiter between flights, than it would have to use disposable rockets. Which is why the replacement for the Shuttle isn\u0027t a spaceplane but a 1-shot rocket, and why nobody else is planning on building a Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, spaceplanes are quite useful for exploring planets with atmospheres. You can cover ground much faster, in greater comfort and safety, than you can with a rover, and can fly over terrain obstacles that stop rovers. But in this case, you\u0027re using it as an airplane, not a spaceplane, and thus can get it to its destination from a vertical launch. In fact, the thing doesn\u0027t need any space capability of its own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T10:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are some advantages that planes have as a launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably the most important one is that Jet Engines have a very high fuel efficiency compared to any of the rocket engines and they also have a good TWR. This means that they can lift more mass for less fuel making the whole launch vehicle smaller and more efficient. This lets you get up to around 18k pretty easily (and higher still if you abuse air intakes properly) which you will notice is well above the majority of the atmosphere. It also isn\u0027t out of the question that you can get your orbital speed around 1000m/s without too much difficulty and a half way decent space plane. This means that when you switch to rockets you need both less oomph to get into orbit and that the rocket engines will be more efficient as the lower atmosphere means higher ISP (again meaning your craft is more efficient). If we had a better aerodynamic model it would also mean that the lifting of a payload would be aided by the wings, further improving the efficiency of lifting payloads at lower altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the landing side the Space Plane is much more flexible when it comes to land. Yes with practice you can get pretty close to a landing target, but a space plane can get closer still. In fact if you arbitrarily decided to shift landing points for some reason (such as noticing something interesting on the way down) a Space Plane is clearly superior as any rocket is going to have serious issues in doing the same. Obviously this only holds for planets with atmosphere though, without atmosphere a space plane is no better (and probably worse) than a traditional lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the down sides, in my experience Space Planes get difficult to fly after a particular size threshold, which means that for very large payloads a more traditional rocket is still probably a better bet. Also because the aerodynamic model is a bit rubbish currently you really don\u0027t get the full benefit from a space plane, you pretty much may as well just strap a bunch of jet engine boosters to a traditional rocket to get you up to ~18k before dumping them. This is actually what I have taken to doing recently, and have a very efficient launch vehicle I\u0027ve designed for satellite sized payloads. It is basically 2 jet engines that lift things up to 18k, then a couple of SRB\u0027s (one after the other) kick the satellite into an elliptical orbit where its own weaker engines can get it to where I want it. Depending on how \u0027reusable\u0027 I\u0027m playing I may even attach parachutes to the parts I\u0027m dropping so they can be \u0027recovered\u0027 and \u0027reused\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T10:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion SSTO Spaceplanes are not very practical for lifting payloads to orbit.

Other than my medium and heavy lift rockets which max out at 25 ton lift capacity, the only way for me to get anything that weighs more than 25 tons into orbit is by way of my SSTO space planes. FAR keeps me from building those so common and horrible and not at all realistic asparagus launch monsters of a million and one stages and over 9000! mainsail boosters, that have the same chances as getting into space in the real world as a fat kid sitting on a 2x4 plank throwing a bowling ball on the other end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I am on my soapbox....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have less problems with people who use mechjeb than those horrible asparagus monstrosities of pealing rocket stage launches that have no aerodynamic properties at all.
