These things would be like the debug menu in easy mode and a few mods that you guys could put in\u00A0as add-ons. the game is still amazing but it was kind of frustratingwhen I would crash into the moon or go past it because I ran out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firemetal","CreatedById":164725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-19T16:59:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd-ons are probably not a thing that will be implemented. If you want those, play the PC version. The debug menu would be a good thing to add but I\u0027m not sure if it will happen as it hasn\u0027t happened yet.
