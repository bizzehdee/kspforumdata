The f22-looking one\u003Cp\u003EOK, Im not sure if its f22, but the vtol fan-thingy would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is from an F35B (The VTOL version).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way it works, there is a \u0022crankshaft\u0022 between the main engine and the VTOL fan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the crankshaft is engaged, the F35Bs engine powers both the main turbofan AND the VTOL fan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis of course means that the main turbofan at the back loses some of it\u0027s maximum power when in VTOL mode. But it has the advantage of not needing a heavy second engine just to power the VTOL fan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conventional mode, the VTOL fan is disengaged and all power from the engine goes into the main turbofan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis explanation is in case someone does decide to make a KSP version. Which I would be interested in as well. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
