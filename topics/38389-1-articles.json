I\u0027ve actually made a few mods of my own, based on parts other people have made(modding my own install). But now ive made something that id like to share, and im not entirely sure what the whole rules are on sharing parts that were made by someone else, im assuming i have to ask the original author for permission, but i dont know how to get ahold of him. I modified the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/greenhouse/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGreenhouse\u003C/a\u003E by \u0022r h\u0022. I made 3 others with the same basic configurations, only they generate different things, like liquidfuel and intakeair(dont ask). I have some more ideas for \u0027biofuels\u0027. Perhaps even a biofuel engine! But i need permission, can a more seasoned space explorer point me in the right direction? That being said, this game is soooooo amazing! :3 I really want to get into my own mods. which will be mostly science/utility stuff.KFS stands for Kerbin Future Sciences, which is exactly what i hope to bring to the game. More scifi-like utility stuff. I cant model or mesh worth crap, but i can read the code. What exactly are the configuration files coded in? Ive always thought the game was majorly composed of C# (hence the .cs extensions eveywhere). Im a python person myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry about all the um, rambling! i just really love this game ^______^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres a description of my greenhouses, the models are essentially the same as the one on the spaceport, only colored a bit different:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The IKRBF is a subdivision of KFS, providing the top botanical scientists in all of Kerbol!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etitle = Evine GreenHouse\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emanufacturer = International Kerbin Botanical Research Federation (IKBRF)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edescription = Advances in Kerbin botany allow plants to be converted to over the counter rocket fuel.
