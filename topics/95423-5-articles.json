That was the absolutely lightest way to fly 3 Kerbals inside a pod, not much more than using a single Kerbal Mk-1 pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy .18 the mass was increased to 3.5 tons. But the Mk1-2 Command pod weighed 4 tons, so it was still 1/2 ton lighter to carry 3 Kerbals. And even the new Mk3 pod weighs less than the Mk1-2 pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I am a big space shuttle fan, so I liked the look. And for piloting, the black \u0022belly\u0022 side and white upper side makes it easier to see the roll orientation than for anything else. And\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6. it even looks more realistic (to me, which is all that counts) when used as a lander because the windows make more sense for a crew member to look out of to see the surface for landing than any of the other pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn exception is the recent Mk2 Cockpit upgrade\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6. that also looks worthy. The \u0022lander can\u0022 is nice\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but the field of view out of that one little window is almost a joke. And the Mk2 cockpit weighs 6/10 ton less than the Mk2 Lander Can pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the Mk3 cockpit, the rest of the Synchronicity lander design I built around it, the clustered Asparagus tanks, extra items carried along the sides (rovers, or mini-landers, or probes, or all the above), plus the \u0022Forward Service Module\u0022 , I just really like the design. In version .23, I made up reproductions of the Synchronicity Landers. In the pic below, the original was like the one at the lower right. I later made a monster that had clustered 2 meter tanks, but then refined it to the design seen at the upper left. That was used in various modified forms for many missions. Then having made the reproductions, I made up a \u0022new\u0022 one as seen in the middle which was lighter and could make use of rendezvous and docking with a transfer stage in orbit around the planet, which was not possible when I made the first one, and that I did not get into doing for planetary missions until later. So that means the version reproduced at the far left deorbited to, landed on, took off from, and returned to Kerbin from as far away as Eeloo and Moho without docking, all by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LPcMkB7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LPcMkB7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However, the new Mk3 cockpit has the front attachment node offset from the rear, so the CG is affected if I put any significant mass on the nose node. So, unlike the old pod, so I can\u0027t do the Forward Service Module without needing to kludge together something on the opposing side to keep it in balance when thrusting. So that is one reason why in my recent jump from 23.0 to using .90, I made a totally new lander rather than deal with that problem. And the mass increase yet again to 3.9 tons was not fun. So by downsizing from 3 Kerbals in the Mk3 cockpit to 2 in the Mk2 cockpit, the pod mass is nearly half. Although I don\u0027t get to use the Forward Service Module feature with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk2 cockpit lander for this Dres mission does look a lot nicer on reentry than anything else that still has tanks and engines attached to it, this new lander does not have anything hanging outside into the airflow when it re-enters nose first (well, a little bit of the landing leg footpads but that\u0027s as much as I can fold them in without sacrificing deployment span for landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027ll use \u0022real pods\u0022 too. Awhile back, in .23, I wanted to make up a totally new lander with a Nuclear engine in the center. So, that meant using two or more pods on the outside. I ended up making it into a Quad lander, with four Mk1 lander cans, which was a very efficient way to land 4 Kerbals anywhere that didn\u0027t have too much gravity (did a Mun \u0026amp; Minmus mission, then flew two of the Quad lander ships docked together to Duna .Both landed near each other, one staying behind as a base as it gave most of its fuel to the other lander before undocking to land, so the other Quad lander could land on Duna and have enough fuel to fly back to Kerbin). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GBRGGXi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GBRGGXi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course in the end, all that matters is that it works in KSP. It is the nature of KSP to make \u0022unusual\u0022 rockets or ships. And sometimes even a pod is not the answer. My favorite design to beat a technical challenge was what i came up with to fly from Eve\u0027s surface back into stable orbit (to rendezvous with a Synchronicity ship). It did not have any pods at all. The original for the mission was able to make orbit from 2.4 km, IIRC. Later I made one that could fly from Sea level, and then much smaller ones as part of a challenge, taking off from 6.5 km mountain tops. A couple of pics of that first one below, for more pics see my Eve album listed in the message link posted above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll close by saying that I get most of my enjoyment in KSP from designing and assembling the rockets. Which also sometimes includes coming up with some creative new thing to do for a specific mission, which on this one was the Grasshopper (and yet another new reuseable launch vehicle. Though I\u0027ve used that basic concept before, as have others, just not with 3 meter parts since I did not have any 3 meter parts to play with till now). Now, once everything has been tested out, and I fly the \u0022real\u0022 mission, I do enjoy that. But the real mission takes far less time than the preparation does. I spent about a month on the preparing for the Moho mission and 4- 6 weeks on working up all the goodies for the grand Eve/Gilly mission (of which the in-game flight to orbit from Eve was the smallest part, albeit the most important).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- GeorgeG\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3KJyrUF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223KJyrUF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Djg6UzN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Djg6UzN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-09T08:09:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2015 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GeorgeG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ftunk70","CreatedById":109881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T08:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love Moho, its beautiful landscape/coloring, and its 12 biomes.
