Propellant cross-feeding leaves the center core still carrying the majority of its propellant after the side boosters separate. This gives Falcon Heavy performance comparable to that of a three-stage rocket, even though only the single Merlin engine on the upper stage requires ignition after lift-off, further improving both reliability and payload performance. Should cross-feed not be required for lower mass missions, it can be easily turned off.\u003Cp\u003EEngines from all three cores light up at launch. But until fuel runs out in the booster cores, the main core uses little or none of its own propellant. There are two separation events: booster separation and main core separation. This is akin to a three stage rocket and thus enables greater performance. Compared to what is thought of as a two and a half stage rocket, like the Delta IV Heavy, the central core can operate at full thrust and still be left with a full fuel load after booster separation, as opposed to a partial load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first though that came to my mind was \u0027Hey!

In his scheme, three parallel stages were fired from lift-off, but all three engines were fueled from the outer two stages, until they are empty and could be ejected. This is more efficient than sequential staging, because the second stage engine is never just dead weight. In 1951, Dmitry Okhotsimsky carried out a pioneering engineering study of general sequential and parallel staging, with and without the pumping of fuel between stages.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if we\\\u0027ll see \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10468.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10468.0\u003C/a\u003E for real in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T17:00:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is my favorite configuration!
