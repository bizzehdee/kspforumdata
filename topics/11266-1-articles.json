Propellant cross-feeding leaves the center core still carrying the majority of its propellant after the side boosters separate. This gives Falcon Heavy performance comparable to that of a three-stage rocket, even though only the single Merlin engine on the upper stage requires ignition after lift-off, further improving both reliability and payload performance. Should cross-feed not be required for lower mass missions, it can be easily turned off.\n\u003E Engines from all three cores light up at launch. But until fuel runs out in the booster cores, the main core uses little or none of its own propellant. There are two separation events: booster separation and main core separation. This is akin to a three stage rocket and thus enables greater performance. Compared to what is thought of as a two and a half stage rocket, like the Delta IV Heavy, the central core can operate at full thrust and still be left with a full fuel load after booster separation, as opposed to a partial load.\n\nThe first though that came to my mind was \u0027Hey! They stole my idea!\u0027\n\n![29njk78.jpg](http://i46.tinypic.com/29njk78.jpg)\n\nOkay seriously, how come it\\\u0027s taken the aerospace industry so long to use this idea in real life? I started realizing fuel crossfeed was the best thing since sliced bread only a week after playing KSP. Surely this is mature technology by now? Space shuttle\\\u0027s been using fuel crossfeed from the External Tank to the Orbiter for 20 years now."},{"CreatedByName":"Resender","CreatedById":18274,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T13:29:08Z","Content":"Cause the idea in real life is not as easy as you might think"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascensiam","CreatedById":12621,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T13:47:19Z","Content":"You can bet it\\\u0027s been on the drawing board for ages, the case is just that unlike KSP, you\\\u0027re faced with a \\\u0027\\\u0027do it right or lose billions\\\u0027\\\u0027 problem, so they had to be sure of all alternatives, and make sure this was the best one in the end."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T14:08:42Z","Content":"Also in KSP we don\\\u0027t have to worry about the *amount* of flow this system would need, or any leakage should something go wrong.\n\nI\\\u0027m glad to see space x try this though, it seems to be the most efficient system possible in our beloved game and if it can work in real life it will seriously cut down on the size of rockets and the amount of fuel they need."},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T14:42:04Z","Content":"After doing some more research turns out this is quite an old idea:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In 1947, Mikhail Tikhonravov developed a theory of parallel stages, which he called \u0027packet rockets\u0027. In his scheme, three parallel stages were fired from lift-off, but all three engines were fueled from the outer two stages, until they are empty and could be ejected. This is more efficient than sequential staging, because the second stage engine is never just dead weight. In 1951, Dmitry Okhotsimsky carried out a pioneering engineering study of general sequential and parallel staging, with and without the pumping of fuel between stages.\n\nI wonder if we\\\u0027ll see [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10468.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10468.0) for real in the future."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T17:00:41Z","Content":"It is my favorite configuration! Having all engines working, instead of hauling dead weight, really gives a nice improvement of efficiency. \n\nFurthermore, you can *cascade* these cross-fed \u0027packet\u0027 rockets to use every stage of your craft.

In each set of 3 outers, the first stage fed the second stage, the second fed the third, and the third fed the tricoupler.
