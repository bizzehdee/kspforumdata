With a touch of #3, too. Except what I do is pick some mods I haven\u0027t tried before and run a new game with them. For instance, I had never used Remote Tech before, so I started a new game with that mod. It has been kind of fun to build up a constellation of comsats. But now that I\u0027ve done that, probably next time I won\u0027t play with remote tech, because been-there-done-that.
