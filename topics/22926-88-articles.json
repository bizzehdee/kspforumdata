Besides honestly busy work is one of the best ways to learn, I already have a few pieces of my own and a part pack me and another guy brought back in from the cold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I wanted to learn so I could help out and give back to the community that I have taken so much from. I have made great friends all over the world, doctors, engineers, researchers, and whatnot. This community never ceases to amaze me with the width and breadth of amazing and talented folks who dedicate a huge amount of time, hard work and raw talent to a game that just wouldn\u0027t be the same without them. I That I can safely say to all of these people Lack being very much one of them, Thank you for everything you do, have done, and continue to do on a daily basis for our community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thank you guys also who, in your hearts and minds have included me into this group. I will say to those that do, Thank you, but in all reality I\u0027m a just the ant in among the giants, and the more I learn the more I realize that what I don\u0027t know can still fill volumes of texts. The more I know, the more I learn just how amazing those giants really are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, Thank you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I should be able post a file with the updated adaptors, the new cfg\u0027s for CLS, TS, and an updated firespitter.dll file, our at least a link pointing to it. I FIXED the problem with the dual 2x1\u0027s texture switch issue. Now, with the new firespitter it will swap all of them. I have updated a few parts .mu files so you will have to overwrite a few but it won\u0027t break anything... but I will post a reminder when I post the new stuff I have done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AccidentalDisassembly","CreatedById":110936,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T17:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrWizerd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MrWizerd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I should be able post a file with the updated adaptors, the new cfg\u0027s for CLS, TS, and an updated firespitter.dll file, our at least a link pointing to it.

It will overwrite some of the .mu files, but does not significantly change them, so they should not break your save. That being said, PLEASE BACKUP YOUR SAVES! I don\u0027t wish for you to loose anything. I still have some things to figure out, the detail on the 3x1 and 4x1 fuel tanks are significantly whiter than they should be. Also I need to update there skins to the tank skin as well. All of the adaptors are working, but they might need there weights tweaked. Also what they hold have not been changed from the original part files, so you will note that all of them will either hold 1 crew, or some batteries, or nothing. SO I would like to open a discussion on what people would like to see in these adaptors. I don\u0027t want to put fuel into them however. So from that aspect, some of the larger ones, like the 3to4\u0027s could hold batteries, life support stuff for tack, and a crew berth, or a few births... I would like to see what people think about these transitional parts and what they should hold before I make a final decision. Please remember this is Lack\u0027s mod, and that all of my decisions are subject to his approval as well. Also, I am having a problem with the 4x1to3x1adaptor0 This is the quarter height on center 4x1to3x1 adaptor part, In my test build it was not showing correctly but I think it is a problem elsewhere can someone confirm its showing in the vab for me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOH!
