Imagine, watching as a kerbal comes out of flight school, and with your guidance, learns to fly a rocket into space, then learns to orbit, and eventually learns to land on other bodies and return. Many, many possibilities here. It may also be kinda funny to watch as kerbals learn through trial and error how to accomplish goals themselves. I\u0027m sure these things would be possible to program, challenging, but possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would also suggest that using mechjeb or stock autopilot to point the rocket at a certain velocity vector to get to orbit or land is no less of an accomplishment than wasd\u0027ing it to space.

to the thrill of landing your first mission to another planet.\u00A0 Different, but no less valid.\u00A0 Perhaps in a certain way, it could even be integrated into the existing game in the future.\u00A0 Maybe if a kerbal is experienced enough you could have the option to \u0022hand over the controls\u0022 to them with a set of parameters to
