Just a couple km off the ground the entire launch vehicle tips over cause the space plane has lift-generating parts, right? Pretty easy concept. Well, I tried to correct that by adding enough wing parts to the back to move the center of lift just behind the center of mass so it doesn\u0027t tip over (which looks ridiculous), but it still tips over and does flips. I assume that this is because the center of mass is shifting forward as the fuel is being consumed, so this means that even if this somehow kept the space plane from causing too much lift up front then the huge wing structures in the back would eventually cause it to flip the other direction. Any suggestions on how I get this thing into space without flying it (because the space plane was built to look cool, not function as a plane in an atmosphere)?

I\u0027d instead recommend a spaceplane with jet engines and powerful air intakes - use the liquid fuel and oxidizer tanks instead of the liquid-fuel-only tanks. Those extremely fuel-efficient jet engines can get you up higher than 20 kilometers, burning no less than 50 units of fuel. Take off from the runway, use jet engines until you\u0027re out of air. From then on, use a liquid fuel and oxidizer engine. I wouldn\u0027t recommend the atomic engine because of how heavy and weak in thrust it is. You\u0027ll need to make orbit with that engine. Once you\u0027re in orbit, you probably won\u0027t have a lot of fuel left.

The solution is pretty simple, just stick a few torque wheels to the rocket and then launch with SAS enabled and it should stay pointed in the right direction.
