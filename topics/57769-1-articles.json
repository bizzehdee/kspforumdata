This is a combined lander and attached rover, with the plan to collect a ton of science in multiple biomes on the Mun, and perhaps find some Easter eggs with the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a little re-working of my rover and launch vehicle, I was finally able to deliver my 7.1t lander/rover to the Mun. I ended up using the smaller wheels on the rover so it could escape out from under the lander (lower speed, boo). I also switched out the Skipper engines for 4x LV-T45s on the main stage, and 16x LV-T30s on the boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot34.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot34.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff successful!

Orbital stage was ignited when the vehicle reached apoapsis, burning to \u0022circularize\u0022. Due to a bit of mis-timing, the orbit ended up quite eccentric: 70x400 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot37.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot37.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital stage separation. Note the extended solar panels. In my KOES mission, I found my reaction wheels completely drained the batteries if I forgot to extend the solar panels.

I wanted something other than what I did before. The other mission landed in the \u0022Munar Midlands\u0022, so I aimed the inclination towards one of the craters. When that burn was complete, I still had quite a bit of fuel left in my munar injection/orbit stage, so I bled off the remainder prior to my planned LZ to ensure my lander stage had enough fuel for a good landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot44.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot44.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I separated the lander to complete landing maneuvers. Because my lander (and its engines) is pointed \u0022backwards\u0022 I had to turn \u0022prograde\u0022 to complete the maneuver. The lander\u0027s center of mas was off by just a smidge, enough that it took a lot of feathering of the throttle and reaction wheels to get it down. After a couple attempts, I was at last successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i405.photobucket.com/albums/pp133/zeppelinmage/screenshot45.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot45.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETouchdown!
