I cannot figure out what the best ore deposit percentage is on Minmus. The best I can find is 8.98%. Is that good? I might try scanning Duna and the Mun to see if I can find a higher concentration. I have narrowed down the concentrations with the analyzer, but want to make sure I\u0027m not missing a 15% or 20% node. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus question: Are certain planets more likely to have high ore concentrations? Which ones should I plan an ore refinery on and what % should I be looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T23:12:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 11:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mackadelik\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T22:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe theoretical maximum is 15%, but 10% is quite good.
