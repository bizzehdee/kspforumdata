It depends on my mood. Mini-shuttles (and all space planes) can be fun, offer more precise landings, and have a lot of interesting design options. Capsules are usually simpler, take less of my time to land (speeding up physics is safe for ballistic reentry), and are easier to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour initial plane design looks nice but may be tough to fly given how KSP works:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe lift is too far behind the center of mass. It may be too difficult to hold the nose up for aerobraking and landing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAre those angled wingtip stabilizers your only control surface for pitch, yaw, and roll? KSP usually behaves better with dedicated control surfaces, especially for pitch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe easiest improvement might be canards near the nose. Lift will shift forwards plus you\u0027ll have more pitch control. You don\u0027t have to use the large \u0022canard\u0022 part; elevons radially attached to the cockpit may be enough.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThat plane is small and doesn\u0027t need double-wheel landing gear in back. Save weight and cost with single-wheel gear. If the plane sits too nose-up on the runway after that change, offset the front gear into the body, and the rear gear down a tiny bit from the wing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-05T15:02:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I build a spaceplane the most important design criteria is that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E does not move as fuel is consumed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter making sure that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E does not move (or only moves a tiny bit) I make sure that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u00A0 Usually the blue sphere is at least touching the yellow one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are the two most important considerations to me when designing a spaceplane.\u00A0 I find \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid to be invaluable during the design phase (it can show wet and dry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E markers simultaneously).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-05T21:00:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224071281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206196\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221640984114\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002238144\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cloakedwand72\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/31/2021 at 3:55 PM, Cloakedwand72 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know how to improve my dream chaser lifting body mini shuttle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d suggest adding a couple of small canards on the front end.\u00A0 Oversteering\u0027s a risk, so make them as small as possible (the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Advanced_Canard\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eadvanced canards\u003C/a\u003E are good for this, the AV-R8 are kinda big), and set their control authority to about half the default, and set them to be \u003Cstrong\u003Epitch only\u003C/strong\u003E (they shouldn\u0027t be engaged for roll).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat ought to give you a bit better pitch control, especially when the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E moves forward as you burn fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight also help to give it a bit more reaction torque for control.\u00A0 If you add a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/MK2_Drone_Core\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMk2 drone core\u003C/a\u003E, that has a fair amount of torque built into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224071531\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206196\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641038504\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/1/2022 at 7:01 AM, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is quite far forward\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I would have said it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eisn\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E-- on the contrary, looks like it\u0027s about in the middle of the plane, maybe a bit too far in the rear for comfort.\u00A0 Farther forward might be safer-- there\u0027s some risk of aerodynamic instability with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E as far back as this is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, it looks like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E will move forward as fuel is burned, so that should help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
