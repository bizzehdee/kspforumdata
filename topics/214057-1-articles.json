It\u0027s a very important change and relatively easy to implement:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn the Save / Load windows, replace the term \u0022Vehicle\u0022 with \u0022Project\u0022 (because some people build entire families / fleets of boosters as assemblies and these are not vehicles)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlso, replace the term \u0022Workspace file\u0022 with \u0022Project workspace snapshot\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn the Load window, replace \u0022Load vehicle\u0022 with \u0022Load project\u0022 AND put all \u0022Project workspace snapshots\u0022 in a drop-down list specific for each Project save.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way we can have Projects be vehicles and then we can merge / import that vehicle Project Workspace Snapshot into another Project which is a fleet of vehicles (but we should be able to \u003Cu\u003Ename these vehicles individually\u003C/u\u003E).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, as stated above, it would be incredibly useful to be able to \u003Cu\u003Elabel (sub)assemblies and have them be a single group of parts\u003C/u\u003E which can be stacked and destacked. More details below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA Project should be a collection of vessels and assemblies (like a folder which holds crafts and (sub)assemblies).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWe should be able to label vessels and (sub)assemblies (groups of parts) inside the Project.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLabeled craft / (sub)assemblies (groups of parts) should also save their own action groups and staging sequences.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe assemblies should stay grouped together even if stacked on top of each other, so it\u0027s easy to destack them (stage, lander, return pod etc.). Working on parts of an assembly would require selecting that group.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022explaining-projects-and-workspace-snapsh\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002288.17\u0022 height=\u0022966\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/mTsLNgQ/explaining-projects-and-workspace-snapshots.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-01T16:13:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2023 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Vl3d\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
