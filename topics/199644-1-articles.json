KSP wouldn\u0027t be KSP without guys like you. So after updated KSP to version 1.11 there was this incompatibility warning regarding tweakscale and I updated it to version 2.4.4.4 after it was available in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. But since then, I can\u0027t add some parts in the craft-editor to a new or existing craft. For example, I can attatch engines like \u0022Skipper\u0022 or \u0022Vector\u0022, but not the stock parts \u0022Mammoth\u0022 or \u0022BACC Thumper Solid Fuel Booster\u0022 or modding parts like the \u0022VW-200 VASIMR\u0022.\u00A0 The complete editor (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) stops working and I have to load a saved craft to be able to exit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I revert to a 2.4.3.X version of tweakscale in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E I can use all parts but get this warning message that all craft files may be corrupted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the Player.log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://workupload.com/file/MsJ9zmecgP4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://workupload.com/file/MsJ9zmecgP4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know there are much modds in my current game, but maybe someone have a idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance,\u003Cbr\u003E\nSnips\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
