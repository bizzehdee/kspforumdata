It is heavily modified and and my play style tends to lean towards realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little background on the the space program so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe launched our first test rocket 2 years ago. It was a successful mission on which we were able to test our first engine designs as well as some automated flight controls. We had a few failures with early guidance systems, we are proud to report none of these failures resulted in any loss of life or property damage; we had many more successful launches after that testing more of our technology and allowing us to develop newer and more advanced propulsion and guidance systems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust 300 days after our first launch we were ready for our first manned mission. The plan was to launch our first Kerbanaut into low orbit, where they would complete two orbits of Kerbin before de-orbit and splash down off the eastern coast of the KSC. Jebediah Kerman was selected for this prestigious mission. Launch went smoothly and Jeb attained a circular 80Km orbit. The orbits were completed, de-orbit and reentry went off without a hitch, however due to a malfunction in the triggering system for the chutes they deployed early and were torn apart. Jebs capsule impacted the ocean at over 800m/s, instantly killing jeb and obliterating the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this was a terrible loss, we know that Jeb would have wanted us to continue pushing for the stars. We shall be naming our planned Kerbin space station the Jebediah Memorial Station in his honor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving on from this tragedy we successfully completed 3 manned flights to LKO along with many unmanned missions and we are now ready to expand our reach to Kerbins two moons, the Mun and Minmus. To this end we have begun creation of a communications network to facilitate communication with probes we plan to send to both bodies in order to identify suitable landing zones for manned missions. This brings us up to the beginning of this log 2 years and 56 days after the founding of the Kerbal Space Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first images I have for you is of the establishment of my comms network, a 3 satellite relay network positioned at a keosynchronous orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/idfPT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
