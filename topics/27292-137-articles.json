As the payload seemed rather small, I built another probe right under it before building the launcher, this one to be shot out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch went ... upwards ... mostly ... something tells me I should have added at least one reaction wheel, two probe cores were not enough, even with gimbaling engines on all stages. The rocket tipped over, MC opted for \u0022go flight\u0022 and fired the engines whenever they pointed up. In the upper atmosphere the rocket could be stabilized, of course the whole gravity turn was messed up, so the final orbit was around 75x265. So, the next step of the mission was delayed until Mun was in the right location to burn at PE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel calculations were made and nodes plotted. It was unclear if there was enough fuel left - or had ever been from the design phase to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mun probe was to enter a polar orbit and after finishing mapping switch to a GSO around Mun\u0027s equator. Somehow the figures for the transfer stage and both probes seemed to have been mixed up. Only after separation it became clear that the mission could proceed mostly as planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso not according to plan four fairings were left to fly by Mun and enter a wild orbit around Kerbin, but far away from any current of planned satellite orbits.

Hopefully long enough for some Goo readings around Kerbol and an inclination change to line up with Eve - if only to practice these things for future missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe day closed with reconfiguring satellite dishes to keep everything in contact with KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurvey of Kerbin showed unusual readings of an as of now unknown chemical compound.
