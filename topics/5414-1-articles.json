I added 4 hip tanks and legs, and 3 more solids to your ship, and just about landed on the Mun, but something is going on with your lower stage using up all its fuel before getting close to orbit. A side-by-side comparison may be in order. Thank you for sharing your ship with everyone all the same - that\\\u0027s how we learn - and I\\\u0027m sure that mine isn\\\u0027t the most efficient either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\\\u0027ve been tinkering with the Moonraker for a few hours now, and finally realized that adding more stuff to it was not the solution \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. In the end I used a much lighter lander, on top of first a huge rocket, then an orbital insertion and munar insertion stage, and finally a braking stage for the mun landing. When I tried it just now I arrived in munar orbit with a bit of fuel left in the lunar insertion stage (the three engine one), then used the braking stage to basically stop, then fall to the surface, hover and then stage so the lander didn\\\u0027t have to use much RCS fuel to land. Didn\\\u0027t get back, though, but that\\\u0027s probably my fault for being sloppy while taking off. The basic idea with a massive lower stage and lighter upper stages seem to work, though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it might be possible to put legs on the second to last stage here, so I can take off from the Mun with the remaining fuel in the current \u0027braking\u0027 stage. I\\\u0027ll have to experiment with that. Meanwhile, here\\\u0027s the latest iteration. Damn, it\\\u0027s fun trying to work with the stock parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"closette","CreatedById":11773,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-16T00:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDownloaded your new craft and made it to the Mun (survivable crash due to my poor flying skills).

Anyway all I modified to your machine was to add a bit off oomph to get it off the ground with a few extra SFBs, mainly because I\\\u0027m still struggling a bit to find a good orbit to set up a mun approach \u0026amp; some extra RCSs for a bit of overkill \u0026amp; some struts to hold it all together. I\\\u0027ve tried to attach it so hopefully it works. I also read on another post that at about 10000m start to lean at about 80 degrees then all the way over between 30-40000m.

I currently try to get to 200m/s, then maintain that until I reach around 25.000m where the air is thinner, then full throttle while I pitch over to get the most speed and altitude possible.

I\\\u0027m finding a much more circular \u0026amp; stable orbit this way. The craft closette designed is heaps stable and easy to fly, I used her design and added a bit, give it a crack it certainly gets you up there. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-16T15:09:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\\\u0027ve got the orbit thing down, but I can\\\u0027t help feel that there\\\u0027s an optimal way of doing it, that would probably save lots of fuel...
