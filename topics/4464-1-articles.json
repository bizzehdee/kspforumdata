If the texture is transparent, it will look transparent in the game as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind though, that texture transparency in KSP is single-bit. A part of the texture can be either fully transparent or fully opaque, but you can\\\u0027t have semi-transparent parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few parts in the game use transparency to optimize the meshes. The parachute cords, for instance, are modelled as a solid cone, and the cords are done using transparency on the texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epsilon","CreatedById":392,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-11T21:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkaaaay then.
