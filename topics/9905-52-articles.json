It seems certain parts don\u0027t like to be grabbed by the arm, and they do some odd things when you try to set them down. Specifically, when you demagnetize the arm after grabbing something, quite often the piece you grabbed will pop right off the larger module, and will remain stuck on the end of the arm. Further, it\u0027s impossible to get the part off the arm.
