I\u0027ve been wanting a command pod that\u0027s not quite the same Apollo capsule shape everyone seems to be doing, but still looks kerbal. I also wanted it to have a good set of windows to use for the \u0022Bridge\u0022 of an interplanetary ship and also work for looking \u0022down\u0022 for landings. This is what I came up with. It\u0027s a very rough model, just a sketch really, and I just threw some colors on it to get an idea of what it would look like. I have never textured before and I suck at it. Anyway, 2 cut in windows and the \u0022cockpit\u0022 window. I imagined an eva hatch on the opposite side of the capsule but didn\u0027t try to model it. Top edge is 1.25 and bottom is 2.5 to match existing stock parts. I figure it holds 3 Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood idea, but it looks like you\u0027re already halfway done.
