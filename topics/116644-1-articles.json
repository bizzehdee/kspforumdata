I recommend bumping it up to 360 m/sec for flexibility in how you land.\n\n A design using RCS for a 1.4t payload would need 1 R1 tank and a single linear RCS port. It would weigh 1.74 tonnes fully-loaded. This would not be the lightest or cheapest solution, though. An LV-1 Ant and round-8 would get the job done for 1.64 tonnes and approx $260.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T11:26:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 11:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pinchy","CreatedById":143038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T11:33:24Z","Content":"Thanks Slashy - I was thinking of RCS rather than Ant so that when I land on minmus I can move around using the RCS thrusters - if I use ANT is that not just one way direction i.e I wouldn\u0027t be able to land the rover on its wheels and then move it. I haven\u0027t used ANT engines before - so can\u0027t confirm my understanding, but I built a rover on minmus using 2 twitch engines that I mounted to the back of the rover with 2 Round8\u0027s mounted on top of each other, but I accidentally blew it up and messed up the quick save accidentally hitting F5 rather than F9 - so now I have my ship on minmus as planned but no rover - so my plan was simply to put another orbital type station for another contract in minmus and send down the rover to replace my busted one!!

I did a couple Minmus landings on Vernors alone.\n\nThe big problem though is that they \\*are\\* quite powerful for light vessels and SAS likes to go wild trying to stabilize the craft, firing them rapidly wobbling it so and fro, if the craft is light - a way around that is to have only one thruster per side (at CoM) so SAS won\u0027t try to use them for rotation. And yes, for 1.4 tons a single Vernor is a plenty to take off from Minmus."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T12:20:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks Slashy - I was thinking of RCS rather than Ant so that when I land on minmus I can move around using the RCS thrusters - if I use ANT is that not just one way direction i.e I wouldn\u0027t be able to land the rover on its wheels and then move it.... I wouldn\u0027t be able to use Twitch engines to bring me down as again my rover would be pointing backwards all the way to the surface?\n\nActually, I find that the simplest \u0026 most flexible rover design is to do exactly that: Build the rover vertically, like a rocket: probe core on top, cylindrical body, engine on the bottom. Then just attach wheels to the sides. You can fly it like a rocket; you can land it like a rocket, gently, tail-first. (Don\u0027t need landing legs, as long as you set it down under 7 m/s.)\n\nThen, once you\u0027re down on the surface, just let the rover rotate forward and settle on its wheels. At this point, it\u0027s like a rocket lying down on the surface. You can drive it around like a rover, the probe core even lines up nicely on the nav ball to give an intuitive view for navigating. The engine is pointing backwards, so if you need a little boost to go up a hill, it\u0027s perfectly situated. If you ever want to take off again (e.g. to make a suborbital hop to another biome), just rotate up to the vertical and take off.\n\n(This design does require putting some reasonably strong reaction wheels on the rover, but you\u0027d probably want that anyway to avoid flips.)\n\nA picture\u0027s worth a thousand words, the below gives the general idea. (Ginned up for illustration purposes, didn\u0027t bother to launch, put science instruments on it, etc., but you get the idea.)\n\n![oaVTFtH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oaVTFtH.jpg)\n\n![WfgtE0f.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WfgtE0f.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T12:22:03Z","Content":"Keep in mind that RCS is an on/off system.
