Then just attach wheels to the sides. You can fly it like a rocket; you can land it like a rocket, gently, tail-first. (Don\u0027t need landing legs, as long as you set it down under 7 m/s.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, once you\u0027re down on the surface, just let the rover rotate forward and settle on its wheels. At this point, it\u0027s like a rocket lying down on the surface. You can drive it around like a rover, the probe core even lines up nicely on the nav ball to give an intuitive view for navigating. The engine is pointing backwards, so if you need a little boost to go up a hill, it\u0027s perfectly situated. If you ever want to take off again (e.g. to make a suborbital hop to another biome), just rotate up to the vertical and take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(This design does require putting some reasonably strong reaction wheels on the rover, but you\u0027d probably want that anyway to avoid flips.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA picture\u0027s worth a thousand words, the below gives the general idea. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Ginned up for illustration purposes, didn\u0027t bother to launch, put science instruments on it, etc., but you get the idea.)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oaVTFtH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oaVTFtH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WfgtE0f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WfgtE0f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T12:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that RCS is an on/off system.
