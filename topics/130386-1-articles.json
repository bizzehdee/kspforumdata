For example, \u0022fly a manned ship through a Mun arch above X velocity\u0022. These contracts would only appear after the player had reached a certain reputation level, and would be high penalty/high reward contracts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese contracts might be things like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~ \u0022Threading the needle\u0022 on a Mun Arch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~ Reaching a specific velocity and maintaining it while below a specific altitude\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~ Making the Kessel Run in less than 12 Parsecs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n~ Rendezvousing with a falling piece of space debris\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, mods could have access to this company\u0027s contracts, and so a LS mod might as a player to send a ship of a given mass/crew to a certain destination. This would force the player to send a fast ship with the bare minimum fuel and LS to complete the round trip, or risk a Kerbal dying. This of course, would be a huge blow to the player\u0027s reputation, and would cause the contracts to dry up for a little while, or until the player\u0027s rep crossed a threshold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to hear everybody\u0027s thoughts on this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
