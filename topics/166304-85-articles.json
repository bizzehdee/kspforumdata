The plan was divided into three steps: the first step was to launch a sounding rocket, of two types: high-altitude physical and biological; the second step was to launch a small satellite, \u0022but not a potato or an egg, like the US, but at least one or two hundred kilograms in weight\u0022; and the third step was to launch a large satellite, weighing several tons or more. So it was at this time that the Chinese Academy of Sciences mainly carried out research on space biology such as animal centrifuges, vibration, low pressure, and biological training.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCentrifuge experiments on rats:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ceaf906e8ff728ed416e6b40f1a4d5c.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022106.50\u0022 height=\u0022898\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/z2GgwRp/ceaf906e8ff728ed416e6b40f1a4d5c.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the first question before the researchers at this point was: what is high-altitude oxygenation?\u00A0Relations between China and the Soviet were still good at this time, but there was considerable secrecy on the Soviet side about the advanced and cutting-edge scientific research topics and weaponry of the time.\u00A0\u0022The new ships of the Baltic Fleet were close at hand, but instead of arranging a visit for us naval colleagues, they made us board a tourist boat on the Neva River. When we reached the shipyard, the curtains on the windows were lowered, as if they were afraid of what we might see. During the professional tour of the ship model experiment pool, even the model ships doing the tests were covered up, obviously to keep it a secret from us. \u0022said by Luo Shunchu, deputy head of the\u00A0Chinese delegation to the Soviet Union.\u00A0But perhaps it was the Soviets who felt that the institute of aeromedical sciences was not so sensitive to the usefulness of the Chinese: of course, we the Chinese were always trying to learn something about atomic bombs, missiles and nuclear subs at those times, which quite sensitive even now\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:lol:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_laugh.png\u0022 title=\u0022:lol:\u0022\u003E\u00A0The technology of how to supply oxygen to pilots at high altitude and low pressure is \u0022really nothing\u0022. So, the Soviet agreed to Chinese order for two complete sets of oxygen supply equipment for MiG-21 pilots (The actual introduction of entire MiG-21s in China instead came a year later, in February 1959).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPressurised oxygen supply equipment is available now,\u00A0the second problem is the low-pressure containment chamber.\u00A0At this time China had only just emerged from years of war not more than ten years earlier. There wasn\u0027t that much metal material available. So, Professor Liang Zhiming from the Mechanics Department of the Nanjing Engineering Institute made calculations and concluded that the concrete culverts of the railway could withstand the enormous pressure and that the low-pressure compartment hull could be constructed entirely of reinforced concrete.\u00A0The researchers were inspired by the raw lacquer on the very well-preserved wooden figurines when they visited the Nanjing Museum. After consulting a number of chemical experts and receiving the answer that \u0022it is possible to use it in the construction of low-pressure cabins\u0022, \u0022they made a kind of putty out of raw lacquer and applied it to the exterior of the cabin, paying special attention to filling in and scraping the gaps between the metal and the concrete, and then painted it with two coats of raw lacquer, resulting in a good sealing layer. The laboratory men also covered the painted pods with another layer of triclinium and a coat of grey paint. For those who don\u0027t know they think it\u0027s also a metal pod.\u0022\u00A0The result is also quite good: it keeps the cabin air pressure at the equivalent of 10,000 metres above sea level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for the Chinese the source of technology for high altitude pressure resistant suits and oxygen supply equipment was not only the Soviet Union but also the United States. Time came in 1959 when the Chinese shot down several RB-57D and the U-2.\u00A0By studying several captured American pilot\u0027s G-suites, and oxygen regulators,\u00A0several institutes of the Academy of Aeronautics and Sciences developed the \u00226002 pilot\u0027s pressure resistant suits\u0022.\u00A0In addition, the researchers identified a serious flaw in the oxygen supply equipment used by the Americans at the time: when the user inhaled at a high flow rate, the sub-membranous chamber of the respiratory valve would change from positive to negative pressure through priming, and under the positive pressure in the helmet, the gas would quickly escape through the expiratory valve, at which point the oxygen supply equipment would lose its ability to supply oxygen to the pilot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022d9036fc5fbd2408cacd24dabfaf8a27.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/Y2TyZSN/d9036fc5fbd2408cacd24dabfaf8a27.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1970, the 507 Institue was assembling the ground test parts of the environmental control and life support system of Shuguang-1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve9728","CreatedById":206195,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-31T18:51:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter 2:\u00A0 Scouting before we going to the sky\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSep. 13, 1960, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-7%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97%E6%8E%A2%E7%A9%BA%E7%81%AB%E7%AE%AD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ET-7M sounding \u003C/a\u003Erocket was\u00A0successfully launched at \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%BF%E5%BE%B7%E7%81%AB%E7%AE%AD%E5%8F%91%E5%B0%84%E5%9C%BA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBase 603\u003C/a\u003E\u0022 (I post the Chinese wiki link because there\u0027s more photos and details).\u00A0The engine test stand was converted from an abandoned bunker left behind by the Japanese invaders during the WWII. \u0022Due to the conditions, some of the auxiliary equipment had to be used as substitutes.

A young lady, with a little monkey, on a bus was very intriguing to people. And what was even more hilarious was that, as the bus was moving, the little monkey, don\u0027t know what magic powers it used, got out of the dense cage, and jumped around in the bus, scurrying back and forth, causing chaos all over the bus for a while. Monkey may be small, but they are much more agile than people. Some people were so scared of the monkeys that they didn\u0027t know where to hide, while others stood up to help catch them.

The view is that, under the present circumstances, there is no need for any satellites carrying living creatures at all, but that we should go straight to manned spacecraft.\u00A0\u00A0This school of argument is led by Cai Qiao of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%86%9B%E5%86%9B%E4%BA%8B%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E9%99%A2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAcademy of Military Sciences\u003C/a\u003E, and the reasons they cite sound convincing: as early as the end of 1959, the Academy of Military Sciences had already included research into the safeguarding of space medicine in its scientific research programme. This means that they had been working on this related field for seven years, and the Institute of Biophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences already had some experience of launching sounding rockets carrying living creatures. At the same time, it could also draw on the experience of foreign manned spacecraft flying at the time.\u0022 As things stand now, get a spacecraft and we\u0027re sure to carry a man on board the first time! \u0022, Cai Chiao insisted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo sooner had Cai Qiao\u0027s words fallen than someone next to him could hear no more. He slapped the table and stood up, saying: \u0022Then why not you be the first one takes the spaceship?!\u0022 This said by Han Zhaogui, Director of the Planning Division of the IBP.\u00A0He felt that although Cai Chiao was a respected old scientist, this statement was really unacceptable and a rather brutal display. Fortunately, the strategic decision makers at this time had also learnt from the blind brutality of the Cultural Revolution and did not adopt the \u0022direct to manned spacecraft\u0022 option.\u00A0The final outcome of the debate was to arrive at the launch of the first manned spacecraft in 1973-1975, enabling the first manned space flight.\u00A0In order to achieve this goal, the plan proposes some major implementation measures, such as replenishing scientific and technical personnel and raising research centres for space medicine and space biology, as well as large-scale simulation equipment, and making full use of aircraft, rockets and satellites to carry out relevant pre-research work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the programme and objectives have been set, the next question is how the various departments should be organised and managed.\u00A0Previously, the relevant research, technology introduction and cooperation were basically managed by several research departments under their own responsibility. The most realistic issue arising from such a problem is that of funding. At the same time, various needs and plans had to be submitted and approved by different decision-makers in different units, \u0022which often gave rise to conflicts and wasted money and time.\u0022\u00A0 So the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%86%9B%E6%80%BB%E5%90%8E%E5%8B%A4%E9%83%A8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGLD\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0contact with STC (Science and Technology Commission).

The Dongfeng Base (aka JSLC now), which was then used to launch missiles, was first surveyed, designed and built entirely with the participation of Soviet experts. The Soviets knew all about it, and because of its proximity to Mongolia and its proximity to Soviet forces, it was not conducive to secrecy and was vulnerable to sabotage.\u00A0And at a time when local conflicts were occurring on the Sino-Soviet border, the consequences of a major war would have been unthinkable.\u00A0So, Dongfeng Base started to select sites in the third front in southwest China in December 1969. The important principle was that the discipline should be considered for long-term development, but also to facilitate secrecy and construction.\u00A0Two months later, a survey team of around 40 people will pre-select three locations: Yuexi in Sichuan Province, Xichang in northern Yunnan Province, and Huangling in Shaanxi Province.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe initial choice was not Xichang, as it later became, but Yuexi. It was reported and approved by the State Council and the Central Military Commission.\u00A0However, a subsequent review revealed that although Viet Sai was well located: surrounded by mountains, its secluded terrain made for a stable strategic position; and in the event of a large, inclined satellite or spacecraft launch to the northeast, the first and second stage rocket wreckage landed in a safe location. However, the Yuexi proposal was overly concerned with the requirements of \u0022leaning against the mountains, dispersal, concealment and access to the cave\u0022, making it a long and difficult project, with high investment and not conducive to long-term development.\u00A0After a subsequent third review and a more in-depth additional survey of Xichang, the decision to establish a satellite launch site in Xichang was made through a comprehensive comparison of the two locations, topography, climate, earthquakes, strategic position and technical requirements.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n29 July 1970, Dongfeng Base submitted a report to the COSTIND and the CMC requesting a change in the location of the test site for ground-to-ground missiles, satellites and spacecraft. On 14 October, the State Council and the Central Military Commission approved the reorganisation of Xichang from the previous Yuexi, codenamed \u0022Project 7201\u0022, meaning that the main works would be completed by 1972 in preparation for the launch mission.\u00A0The idea was to establish a launch site for manned spacecraft in Xichang and to carefully select and train the first astronauts in Beijing. Both tasks were then carried out in high secrecy: the astronauts did not know where the launch site was, and Xichang did not know that the state was secretly training astronauts. However, due to unfavourable factors such as the country\u0027s overall power, technical conditions and transportation, and the subsequent cancellation of the \u0022Shuguang\u0022 project, the launch site for the manned rocket was never built.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1968, the 507 began to demonstrate experimental equipment such as centrifuges, and from 1971 to 1978, the 507 built centrifuges, chambers 1, 2 and 3, impact tower, electric swings and flight simulators. The manned centrifuge named as type-68.\u00A0It has a total weight of 137 tonnes and can produce an overweight of 25G. The processing and production of the equipment took the combined efforts of more than twenty factories in six provinces and cities to complete. The hydraulic system of the main machine, the central turntable and the three-axis frame were all produced and manufactured in different factories in Shanghai. Due to the extra weight, width, and height of the machine, it was completely impossible to transport it by road from Shanghai to Beijing. So, the equipment had to be installed by land and sea, taking six days, a 3,000-tonne cargo ship and more than 30 large trailers and other vehicles.\u00A0More annoyingly, it was a half-baked product that was not working well from the start, requiring endless daily tests and was very unstable due to the adoption of an underdeveloped hydraulic solution rather than the more technically stable motor-driven solution proposed by 507. The first manned operation wasn\u0027t completed until 1985.

The results of the experiment proved that the subjects had a good appetite, normal health status, no change in average body weight, 95% food digestibility and satisfactory overall test results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002217e99264ab9d16b60b5fee5fcb71837.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022177.78\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221080\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/mtb4zD4/17e99264ab9d16b60b5fee5fcb71837.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientists from 507 and workers from Yiming Food Factory were developing the space food together.\u00A0At that time, 507 was still one of the PLA units, so I guess the two in military hats on the top right are the scientists from 507.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022e37780e079bf89580286834d9db2012.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022177.78\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221080\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/Krnkjtz/e37780e079bf89580286834d9db2012.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSubjects perform a space drink drinking experiment in a low-pressure simulation chamber.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, research on IVA suits were also underway.\u00A0At first, the development of the IVA suits was assigned to the research laboratory of life support systems engineering for research. But after a period of events, it became clear that the matter was in fact extremely closely related to space medicine. So in order to allow a better integration of medicine and engineering, the development of the IVA suits was transferred from the engineering research labs to the medical research labs to undertake. The helmet, gloves and the body of the space suit were developed separately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe general technical specifications at the time included the astronauts wearing space suits throughout the mission. This would have considered the factors of eating and drinking and head and oral hygiene (sounds bit strange now).\u00A0They then designed and researched 3 models of helmets based on the characteristics of the Chinese head shape. The outer shell is made of fibreglass, which is light, strong, non-deforming, protects against collisions and vibrations, and has better sound and heat insulation.The production research team has improved the machining process in order to make the neck loop part of the helmet that connects to the space suit absolutely airtight. This technology also provided a very important foundation for the Shenzhou programme decades later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe body and glove parts they found\u00A0Ge Shenran, a tailor by trade who had worked on the G-suits used by pilots. \u0022He never went to school, and he didn\u0027t have any degree, but this man was particularly good at research. He would take one look at you and make you a suit that fit perfectly without any measuring. At that time, whenever the leaders of the military and science committees needed to go abroad, they asked him to make some suits.\u0022 said by Chen Jingshan, who from Institute of Aerospace Medical Engineering, \u0022he can\u0027t speak any foreign languages, so spent his days puzzling over photographs of space suits published in the US. The photograph is flat, and he always imagines this flat surface as being three-dimensional. He made a dummy out of crushed straw paste, and when it was done, he put the boxing paper on the exterior, and when it was done, he removed the paper shell and made it flat. This practice was done by Ge himself running to a toy doll factory to borrow their production methods.\u0022\u00A0One of the key technologies for space suits is the airtight zip. Ge Shenran went to the Shanghai Zipper Factory and the Shanghai Abrasives Factory and brought in some of the most skilled teachers to work on it. Two years later, the airtight zip for the IVA suit was produced, filling a technical gap in this technology in China at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe IVA suits were made two sets in total.

This pressure would allow for simple regulation of cabin air pressure and a smaller pressure differential between the inside and outside of the cabin, allowing for smaller gas leaks in the cabin. Also, the astronauts don\u0027t need to inhale oxygen and expel nitrogen before wearing the low-pressure spacesuit.\u00A0The other school of thought is that the Soviet experience of one atmosphere of pressure should be adopted. This way there is still the IVA suit for secondary protection in the event of a loss of pressure in the event of an emergency leading to a leak in the hull. Moreover, this has been proven to be more effective by repeated Soviet practice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there is another school of thought which argues that neither the Soviet nor the American experience is desirable because China has its own special circumstances. Firstly, to prevent decompression sickness, the working pressure of the space suits couldn\u0027t fall below one half of an atmosphere. The limited scientific capacity at the time made it impossible to develop a space suit that could work at high pressure. If the option of one-half atmosphere in the cabin had been adopted, the working pressure of the space suits would have been 30.65 kPa. Secondly, the one-half-atmosphere solution met the needs of Chinese rockets. At that time China did not have the capacity to send a 4m\u00B3 capsule into space. If the air pressure were reduced, it would mean that the gas storage structure could be reduced, freeing up more valuable space for the spacecraft.\u00A0Thirdly, astronauts are perfectly adapted to living and working in an environment of one-half atmosphere pressure. The Americans have proved that astronauts don\u0027t react badly at one-third of an atmosphere, so it is even less likely that they will at one-half of an atmosphere.\u00A0Finally, if the Soviet one-atmosphere solution is adopted, then it will inevitably be necessary when the cabin structure is more robust. One-third of an atmosphere would have required a filling with pure oxygen, and not to mention the negative effects that pure oxygen would have had on the human body, the lessons of Apollo 1 alone prevent us from adopting this solution.\u00A0In the end, the one-half-atmosphere solution was adopted: it combined the best of both American and Soviet pressure solutions and met the needs and technical constraints of China at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ejection seat was also studied and tested for the emergency invacuate from the spaceship.\u00A0The most advanced ejection seat technology available in China at the time was the ejection seat with cockpit cover from the MiG-21. However, as the size was not suitable for the sitting height of Chinese pilots, there were a number of accidents in which the cockpit cover was snapped into the seat during emergency ejection, resulting in the death of the pilot by crushing the vertebrae in his head. The J-6 aircraft (which was the MiG19 imported and licensed from the Soviet) also had a poor success rate in saving lives with its ejection seat. Therefore, an objective and urgent need to rapidly improve the Soviet ejection seats.\u00A0After extensive ejection tests on animals, dummies and cadavers, which proved that the life-saving requirements could be met, it was agreed, after much debate, to carry out the first ejection test on an aircraft on 28 February 1973. The experiment was a success.\u00A0And in addition to doing wind tunnel experiments on rats, dogs, pigs, monkeys and dummies, the experimenters also took on the task of being subjects themselves, subjecting themselves to powerful air waves and obtaining a large amount of realistic human data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224eaf3c89e954445ce9af1f6742bc799.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/tCJLz3d/4eaf3c89e954445ce9af1f6742bc799.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027exerciser\u0027 has been fixed ready for ejection tests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221a6ea65206174cd2bcded6cfab06bac.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/0YqdwL9/1a6ea65206174cd2bcded6cfab06bac.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027exerciser\u0027 was doing the ejection impact experiment in the impact tower\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022edbaa077e5553d0945334942f99430c.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022900\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/rvcBpbx/edbaa077e5553d0945334942f99430c.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA vibration test to understand brain function and electroencephalographic changes in human beings in a state of violent vibration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn June 1970, the General Staff Department of the PLA approved the formation of the 507\u0027s astronaut training program, and on 14 July 1970, President Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and the Central Military Commission approved the \u0022Shuguang-1 project\u0022.

Weightlessness can last for more than 35 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220ca0b57a1eb805936ee0c60d0f765fd.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/6Zqx1mD/0ca0b57a1eb805936ee0c60d0f765fd.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe astronauts who passed the selection were training\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fd3362b97c1652a2bbc25e89a602e93.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/X82PSDW/fd3362b97c1652a2bbc25e89a602e93.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe weightless training aircraft.\u00A0The fourth and sixth from the left are pilots participating in the astronaut selection process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022888bca55ac84b222087bbf0f73355f1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/wKRb71G/888bca55ac84b222087bbf0f73355f1.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverweight moments on a weightless aircraft.

The Long 7A can currently produce 4-6 rounds per year and is expected to reach 8-10 rounds per year by 2025.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8 satellites in one day.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4300442476\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/CNSpaceflight/status/1612322006317531138?s=20\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNantong High School Sat is a nanosat developed by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://vsat.cloud/en.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShanghai VSAT Company\u003C/a\u003E,\u00A0with the participation of students and teachers from Nantong High School, and the main application user is Jiangsu Province Survey and Mapping Institute. \u0022The satellite is designed for global broadcasting, deep space observation and Earth observation, and operates at an altitude of 700 km in sun-synchronous orbit. It is loaded with an eight-channel full-spectrum camera and X-band communication system, which can observe the aurora phenomenon emitted due to the influence of solar activity on the Earth, and transmit the detection data obtained back to the ground; at the same time, it has the capability of ultra-wide image capture, with the basic parameters of 100km width and 15m resolution, and the parameters can be adjusted in orbit, and the performance has reached the international mainstream level, which can adapt to the subsequent large-scale network observation needs. In addition, the star has the function of playing school songs in Nantong High School, and has on-board experimental facilities, so that students of Nantong High School can carry out experiments in high school physics and other subjects through the measurement and control platform.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile it\u0027s also the first satellite of VSAT\u0027s \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.vsattech.com/en/constellation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E2050 Constellation Program\u003C/a\u003E\u0022:\u00A0Launching of 108 satellites designed with the participation of 108 secondary schools and forming a constellation of satellites in orbit.

The funny thing is, the info I can found is in 2019, the local media said that the Nantong High School Sat would been launched at 2020. The secondary schools in China are a three-year school system, which means three years for middle and three years for high school. This secondary school is a high school only, which means the kid entering in 2019 have now graduated from that school and are starting their second year at university.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd: the nearest camera at CZ-7 launch site:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1K3411U732/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click\u0026amp;vd_source=6fef304b8d0c4737896e6b702ddfbfb3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1K3411U732/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click\u0026amp;vd_source=6fef304b8d0c4737896e6b702ddfbfb3\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-09T16:17:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2023 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by steve9728\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EOfficial media reporting gone wrong\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve9728","CreatedById":206195,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-09T09:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7282913279\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=https://twitter.com/i/status/1609821305330884608\u0022 style=\u0022height:562px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfully 2:40 video:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1RG4y157dN/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0\u0026amp;vd_source=6fef304b8d0c4737896e6b702ddfbfb3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1RG4y157dN/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0\u0026amp;vd_source=6fef304b8d0c4737896e6b702ddfbfb3\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n00:44: researchers on ground prepared New Year\u0027s Day \u0022Blind Boxes\u0022 for astronauts in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-09T09:14:30Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2023 09:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by steve9728\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
