I don\u0027t want to launch a new plane with new parts, I want to launch this plane. I\u0027ve already paid for it, I just need fuel. There\u0027s a lot of changes that need to be made if spaceplanes are going to make sense - either this change, or a full refund on recovery, or ability to refuel on runway without launching an entirely new vehicle just to transport the fuel... if it stays the same, it just plain won\u0027t make sense and considering the plane parts are being revamped, it\u0027d be a shame to not want to use them because of a broken system.\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-30T13:58:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2014 01:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hempa2","CreatedById":80807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T14:32:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Slouch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Slouch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst off, it\u0027s called taxiing (taxi) not taxing (tax).\u003Cp\u003ESecond why would you do this?
