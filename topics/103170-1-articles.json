After a set time If Good Thoughts are not replenished by returning to Kerbin Orbit or by use of the included Recreation Module, the said Kerbal will die.\n\nI hold no responsibility for mod conflicts / save breaking issues that may arise from installing this modification. Expect errors!\n\nFuture Plans:\n\n- Make Kerbals uncontrollable / cause random actions to take place on the craft after succumbing to madness.\n- Balancing of the Recreation Module converter.\n- Remove \u0026 rewrite some features of the code reliant on TAC Utilities modules.\n- Further Module Manager Integration and individual Kerbal mental states based on \u0027courage\u0027 \u0026 \u0027stupidity\u0027.\n\nRelease V0.1 (GitHub): [**Here**](https://github.com/Whitecat106/Release-V0.1.git)\n\nSource V0.1 (GitHub): [**Here**](https://github.com/Whitecat106/Source-V0.1)\n\n![Bvb0oPx.png](http://i.imgur.com/Bvb0oPx.png)\n\nThis project is released under the same license as Taranis Elsu\u0027s original code\n\n- Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) creative commons license\n\nOriginal Code \u00A9 Copyright Taranis Elsu\n\nModified Code \u00A9 Copyright Whitecat106"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T23:24:01Z","Content":"I started laughing!\n\nWhy not have the insane kerbals, instead of dying, randomly flip the directional controls for steering?
