I have a craft i made which has 9 ion thrusters and can land on mun or less size celestials and has a lko\u00A0of about 12000 m/s dv. The craft itself is going to have fixed landing gear, and so i was testing it on the launch pad, i set the qualification at 20 m/s, and withba considerable work on making new parts i have gotten it there, a craft that can repeated land with a 20 m/s downward velocity, at least, to the test limit. The problem is the lander blows up the launch pad, i hit f3 but the danage report gives no damage to the lander.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
