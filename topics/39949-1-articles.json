No, really, I mean I was terrible at it. The joy of the game was measured only by how spectacularly (or quickly) I failed a mission. I was able to achieve stable orbit (elliptical) and maybe intercept (crash a kerbal into) the mun. Then I found MechJeb, and *click* it worked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, inevitably the cookie jar was open, and i couldn\u0027t help myself. (read that analogy here, I think.) I apparently paid attention, even tho I remember it more as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.*click* Jool\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.minimize to read messages while making a sandwich.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. *click* land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. End mission and grab another rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. *Click* Moho. (you see where this is going.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Fast forward to .21 update. Playing stock, with a new save, from scratch. I know I suck, but now I\u0027m gonna blow up on pretty new surfaces. I used some premade stock stuff, and couldnt keep it pointed upwards for anything, even with the new SAS system (and yeah, i was ready to blame it on that). I removed all of the references of MJ from my favorite craft file in my old save, and it loaded up just fine. So, this is where it gets interesting. I launch, and it stays perfectly straight. I move and the SAS stabilizes it, exactly where i would expect it to. I pull off an absolutely perfect ascent, watch my apoapsis, and prograde burn to curcularize my orbit, at the exact altitude I wanted. I make a maneuver node to intercept the Mun, and nail it. Circularize my orbit at 30k, split my landers (2 of em, manned) in an identical orbit, and proceed to land the first. Perfect landing, a bit off from where i was aiming, but gorgeous touchdown. Switched to the second lander, and created a node above the first one, retrograded and tweaked it a little to hit smack on my other module, and landed 640m away from it. I was stunned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Of course I was up way too late pulling this off, and went to bed with Orbital mechanics pervading all of my thoughts/dreams. The nex day I decided to aim higher and launched another mission to Duna, freehand. It was a bit more difficult obtaining and tweaking the intercept, but I was able to land both landers, 297m away this time. One of the landers even remained upright! (The other lost a leg while I learned about horizontal velocity in a low G environment *cough*). Anyway, to make a long story long, MJ taught me how the orbital mechanics are to be used in the game. It taught me how to fly, so I guess I wont be needing it anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the rant, proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benie","CreatedById":70327,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T21:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook.

But then comes the day when you have to haul circa 10 modules of a space station into LKO. They are very similiar weight-wise, so standard lifter can push them into space. Orbit is stable, and circular. Lifter is well tested, all the kinks are worked out. All you need to do is launch and fly everything to that 80 km orbit. Then you go back to Space Center and launch another payload. And another. And another. After four launches it\u0027s not fun anymore.
