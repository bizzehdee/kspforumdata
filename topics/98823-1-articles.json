The big feature of the mod is the dry center of mass calculation - it\u0027ll tell you based on your current craft design just exactly how much your center of mass will shift as you burn fuel and it will show you where the CoM will be at that point. With that information you can set a center of lift that will keep your plane\u0027s flight stable in all configurations, or use it to make adjustments to reduce (or better yet eliminate entirely) the amount of the shift. The other thing it\u0027ll show you is how much torque your thrusters and engines will produce. That\u0027s the crucial bit for VTOLs, of course; if your vertical engines produce too much torque, your flight won\u0027t remain stable.
