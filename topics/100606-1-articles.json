Perform an experiment. Take a small rocket, (One that is capable of reaching orbit) and burn straight up, then sideways. Take the same rocket and perform a Gravity turn. You will find that the rocket that does the gravity turn reaches orbit with more dV remaining. This is because it has built up enough horizontal velocity during ascent that once it finally reaches space it takes only a small amount of dV to circularize. With the other rocket, it has some initial horizontal velocity from the rotation of the planet, but it still needs to build up enough so that when it stops fighting gravity it misses the ground. \n\nAnd orbit is basically (at it\u0027s most basic level) falling and missing the ground."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T14:23:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Engines have a better performance in vacuum, yet we still perform a gravity turn at \u0022low\u0022 altitude, where the engines performe worse.\n\nRight-click an engine on the pad, just so you can see it\u0027s data, and watch how quickly the ISP improves.

Gravity is pulling down on your rocket at ~10m/s^2, which means that in order to go up burning vertically you have to thrust such that your acceleration is \u003E10m/s^2. However, if you\u0027re burning sideways, you get all of that thrust, instead of subtracting gravity. Anything in between falls off like the cosine of the angle.\n\nIt\u0027s actually even bigger a deal than that, since once you hit sufficient sideways velocity gravity actually *helps* you, which it never does when you\u0027re burning directly counter to it."},{"CreatedByName":"Rokmonkey","CreatedById":9319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T14:41:09Z","Content":"Dedjal, this is because the aerodynamic forces are less than those due to gravity.\n\nEDIT- Ninja\u0027d\n\nIf you go to a the Mun, you can burn up a little, then burn sideways, you just need to get high enough to clear the mountains.\n\nAs for the ISP, it is scaled based on pressure, not altitude.

You will notice that most gravity turns start at roughly the 10-15km mark. At this point the atmosphere is starting to get pretty thin, so the actual drag on your rocket become quite low. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why is it feastable to stay as long as possible in a drag enviroment (pun not intended)?\n\nYour rocket efficiency grows exponentially toward it\u0027s vacuum Isp, because the atmospheric density falls off logarithmically. Even at 20km your Isp is pretty good.\n\nThe main point is, the faster you can get to a point where your rocket is pointing Orbital Prograde, the more efficient your burn will generally be. But you are correct, this needs to be done at sufficient altitude that the gains from this are not lost to atmospheric drag. For instance, pitching over at 5km and going full orbital prograde is a recipe for disaster. Conversely, going strait up to 70km, and pitching over there isn\u0027t very efficient either because you spend so much propellant counteracting gravity.\n\nOnce you are on the orbital prograde marker, you are no longer spending fuel just to overcome gravity, and that\u0027s a big deal - as G translates to 9.8m/s of Delta-V lost for every second used to fight gravity."},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T17:25:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You will notice that most gravity turns start at roughly the 10-15km mark. At this point the atmosphere is starting to get pretty thin, so the actual drag on your rocket become quite low.\n\nJust to be clear, this isn\u0027t quite exactly true to real life. The stock (0.90 and earlier) simulation of atmosphere creates a lot more drag a lower altitudes than is realistic, so the turn to orbit tends to be much higher and more severe (also because the stock atmosphere is very unlikely to tear your rocket apart). When using a more realistic aerodynamic simulation on Kerbin, a pitchover for a gravity turn tends to be around 5 degrees when the rocket\u0027s moving at about 100m/s - which is usually below 2km altitude.

I don\u0027t think I have to explain why this is so. The very same effect is at work during the gravity turn at launch. Launch also is a long prograde burn, after all.\n\nIt\u0027s not as if gravity would turn the rocket, and then the rocket would change it\u0027s trajectory, but the other way round. Remember: once things really get going, the rocket cannot deviate from prograde or it would be ripped to shreds. If you want the rocket to describe an arc, you have to make it so that prograde moves to the side. That\u0027s what the gravity turn does.\n\nNow, what happens once you tip the rocket slightly? The sideways velocity accumulates, while gravity nibbles at the vertical speed. Over time, you get a trajectory that is ever more sideways and ever less up. The rocket has to follow that trajectory, like an arrow. But unlike an arrow, it\u0027s also thrusting all the way, and as it starts to turn it\u0027s thrust will also be ever more sideways and ever less up, accelerating the turn.\n\nGravity is shaping the trajectory; aerodynamics mandate that the rocket has to follow this path with only the most minute deviation.\n\nOne might say that this is a distinction without difference; I don\u0027t think so, but also don\u0027t believe it\u0027s worth making a lot of fuzz about it.
