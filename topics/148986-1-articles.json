MechJeb and Kerbal Engineer Redux. Both mods are highly respected by their respective camps, and feelings and opinions run hot. I do not recall such a thread as the one I am proposing here. I know people have stooped to arguing about if MechJeb is cheating or how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E is a wonderful flight data device. What I would like to do here, is have an actual forum, not a thread or a message board, but an actual honest forum, where we can freely exchange, debate and challenge the positions of one another. Now, I am NOT advocating total anarchy where X rated language is used. No, I am opening this thread, for an honest debate, similar to the ones we see during election times, where you have 2 candidates step up to podiums and debate. So, with that said, here are the rules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Be respectful of one another.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Civil and Polite language only.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Support your argument. Using phrases like: \u0022Because thats the way I feel\u0022 \u0022Reasons\u0022 or anything of that are strictly forbidden. Use real, fact based reasons, and if necessary use photo evidence as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Arguments must be logical, civil and fair.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Standard Forum Rules apply as well, with the exception: Challenging a persons point of view, position or reasoning is allowed and expected. Such challenges are critical to an open and free flowing civil debate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this said, I formally welcome you to the MechJeb versus Kerbal Engineer Redux Debate! Let\u0027s begin!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for this edit, but, I wanted to start the thread and then get the images for my first point in this debate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has been said you need Kerbal Engineer Redux for delta v stats. I counter this by saying, MechJeb can provide this as well. I will provide you with 2 images, 1 of which shows all 3 stages as a single rocket, and the other shows the stages side by side, ranging from 1.25m to 3.75m.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H8hGOeO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022H8hGOeO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand side by side:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/exxvXiI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022exxvXiI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is but a small sample, showing that, MechJeb mirrors features found in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, with the added benefit of being an autopilot as well.

I respect those who do choose to do it all by hand, but I get irritated when people turn it into a contest over who\u0027s better at KSP. I get particularly irritated when it\u0027s full time streamers who have 12 hours or more a day available for them to play the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv title=\u0022Protected by Grammarly\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m in same boat with you. The only thing I wish was possible, was to move the mechjeb closed tab indicator around the windows, sticking to the right side of game window is bad because when you are in launchpad, well, the stock buttons now sit there and sometimes in is hard to click on buttons under mechjeb tab indicator, this complaining aside, I think each one of them has their own benefits and usage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to flight assistant I used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E to estimate problems with plain designs but recently I found this : CorrectCoL , so, I don\u0027t know. But still, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E shows some stuff during the design that can be really useful. Also, when it comes to mechjeb and it\u0027s automation, I still use it\u0027s node planner especially for circularization and tweaking periapse for geostationary orbits \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T20:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use both. I use MechJeb for ascents, since at this point the have become too routine and boring, and sometimes for docking since it\u0027s otherwise very tedious.
