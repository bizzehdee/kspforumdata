I\u0026#39;m running 5 nervas on methane but they\u0026#39;re only producing 0.02 % of thrust, thereby not moving my ship an inch. No fuel is being used up, but heat is being generated and the engines are producing flames. What am I missing? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you need more info, please ask. I\u0026#39;m running kspi by the way, as well as lots of other unrelated mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nthanks in advance\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T23:08:28Z","Content":"\nI think this should be in modded support.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo ideas on your issue, sorry.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T23:09:02Z","Content":"\nSince this is a mod-related issue, it probably belongs in one of the mod sections. However, let\u0026#39;s get the simple troubleshooting out of the way - are you trying to fire those engines on the launch pad? They produce practically no thrust at surface level.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Odyessus","CreatedById":152855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T23:15:39Z","Content":"\nNope, in space. Decoupler, interstage faring, 5 nervas, thrust plate multi adapter and a interstellar x24 tank filled with methane. Engines and tanks are matched for propellant. Relaunching on the deck produces thrust as expected, but not in space on the current save. :( \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nim tempted to destroy the ship in space, redesign and relaunch. Thankfully this is not career mode!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nill be honest, I\u0026#39;ve never got the interstage faring to work... It doesn\u0026#39;t pop off like the normal aero faring does.

I tested, on the pad, the same ship, with and without an interstage faring at the base of the nervas, and it worked without. The faring was not releasing properly, so i guess the physics got confused. If anyone can point out how to correctly use the KSPI interstage faring, that would be awesome. When i get around to reinstalling FAR, it will be a life saver for the bigger ships.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T10:02:25Z","Content":"\nAre you talking about the fairing that KSP adds automatically on a stacked engine? Maybe a Quicksave/quick load can help.\n"}]}
