The current ModuleEngines/FX derived solution relies heavily on run time checks and basic hacks in order to enforce that the engine must be deployed before it can be activated; a very \u0027dirty\u0027 solution that has a few issues that I have been unable to fix or find workarounds for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the performance front I was doing a cleanup of the propellant-use code and had a much more optimized method for updating FX that did not run on every tick/game update (unless needed). It is more that I want custom engine modules for the bits that you can\u0027t cleanly implement on top of the stock modules; deployable engines and electric-only engines (I believe someone has figured out how to make these run using stock modules, but its been awhile since I looked into it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, for the time being, I -am- deriving from ModuleEngines/FX for the sole purpose of mod compatibility (mostly for MJ, though good for RO/RSS/RF as well). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the effects shouldn\u0027t be too hard to link to the engine module. But I also need to manually create all of the effects groups at runtime from the config definitions as they will not exist in the part config like they normally would. IIRC I should have most of the code needed already in my retired custom-engine module (as it also dealt with run-time effects configuration).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink I may have found a decent compromise for the scaling issues (also reduces models needed by a ton). Will result in slightly less detailed / less optimal mounts and shroud configurations, but should be much easier to develop assets for and do maintenance on. It might require ditching a few of the \u0027features\u0027 I had planned (such as custom engine-specific shrouds, e.g. for the rs-68); still working through the logistics on that end. I\u0027m hoping to be able to keep them, but they might be a non-rescalable asset and only available on the stock setup (unless someone else wants to make the custom sized models for RSS).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T01:34:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all the work you guys are putting in for RO, I\u0027ll probably be giving it a try for my next new game that I start (if I can get it all working properly in career mode).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would consider that an honor \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral Progress Update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning into some rather large issues with regards to rescaling; more specifically, allowing the custom engine clusters to cleanly be rescaled for use in RO/RSS/whatever and how it relates to the manually built models that I currently intend to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines are all modeled at 64% of real scale. Would be easy enough to rescale the engine models themselves back to realistic sizes. The problem comes from the hand-crafted mounts for stock stack-sizes; these do not cleanly rescale to RSS sizes using the standard 1.5625 \u0027100% correction\u0027 rescale (e.g. 64% * 1.5625 = 100%). This results in strange/odd tank sizes (6.25m rescales to ~9.74m rather than the 10m it should, 5m = 7.8125 rather than 8.4m). If you rescale the mount to match the exact size needed all of the engines will need to be rescaled with it as well; resulting in different stack-sizes having different scaled engine models. Not good for a realism-based mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) The first alternative that I\u0027ve thought up is to use consistent scaling for the engine mounts (e.g. 1.5625 scale), but allow specification of the interstage fairings to be whatever size is needed for that stack size. So, while the mount itself might be slightly smaller than the tanks, the engines would all be at proper scale. This seems like it -might- be the most workable solution; the aesthetics would be slightly off as the mounts/fuel lines would not match the tanks, but it should work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) A second alternative that I\u0027m heavily considering at this point is fully-procedural mounts rather than hand-built models. The problem that is ran into here is how to do this while still making them look good? Not sure that I could pull it off (without years of coding on it). A big problem with this is how to handle the special-case oversized mounts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) A third alternative that I\u0027m considering is somehow splitting up the mount model into multiple independently scalable parts. So you could maintain the motors at a standard rescale factor (1.5625x) but scale the stack-mounting plates by a different amount to make them cleanly line up with the stack size they are mounted on. This would also -greatly- cut down on the number of specific models that I need to create.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just to throw a wrench in the gears there is the case of the special \u0027oversized\u0027 engine mounts and how to cleanly rescale those to be usable with random rescaling (can\u0027t see how it would be possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps I am getting a bit too ambitious with my plans and might need to scale this project back a bit. Even as it is (if I ignore the RSS rescale problems) the full set of parts will be 20 engine models, 51\u002B mounts, and 51\u002B mount shrouds. Of course this was with attempting to do very-detailed skeletal type mounts where all the fuel-lines match up and are routed properly. Might just rethink the mounting layout along the lines of #3 where there is a single tank-cap model that can be freely rescaled, and a single skeletal adapter per cluster layout that is rescaled appropriately for the motor mount size. Still has problems related to external shrouds (specifically the oversized/special ones).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrangely the plugin-end of things I think will be the easier bit to figure out this time. Setup thrust transforms per engine type: check, simple enough to do. Alter engine module stats for selected engine (thrust/isp/mass/heat): very doable. Position engine models where needed based on cluster layout: no problem. Re-setup engine gimbal properly for engine type: simple. Re-setup engine FX properly for engine type: Not yet figured out, but preliminary investigation points out that it is doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescaling of models for use in RSS: No clue where to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm... still quite a bit of figuring out to do on this stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill look at doing some mock-ups of engine mount stuff a bit later to see if I can figure out an easily freely-rescalable solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edon\u0027t worry at making your scaling compatible with RO, keep it at how you have done, stock doesn\u0027t scale to most rockets out there, and those who stick at 64% doesn\u0027t always get stock scaling, if you check bobcat\u0027s stuff for example, they are 64% scale and few things there match stock, another example is the Space Shuttle, the ET isn\u0027t 5m, it is ~5.4m in diameter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebtw, I like option 3 myself as it would allow easy stock and RO scaling \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh, here\u0027s an extra I saw over at Chaka\u0027s thread:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5MVXAkMeQDc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the booster painting, they look more like an airline or executive jet rather than a government agency \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T05:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave been doing a ton of thinking on logistics of the engine plugin module, and the more I think on it the more I see that it might not be a \u003Cem\u003Egood idea\u003C/em\u003E in the long run. While I\u0027m pretty sure I could get it all implemented to work fine with stock, trying to make it play nicely with nearly anything else will likely prove highly problematic. Scaling is just the start of the problems. Most of the patch-based engine stuff would simply fail, as I would be constantly overwriting the engine stats and/or completely rebuilding the module. Adding anything like engine ignitors would simply be not possible (that I think of, without explicit built-in support). The sheer number of different mount/adapter models that I would need to create to do it properly is simply staggering, and possibly more than I could reasonably accomplish without burnout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as I have several engine models, lots of ideas, and several hundred mb of research data, I do intend on continuing development on the engines - both finishing those I have started, and adding a few more variants. I also still intend on making pre-built engine clusters from those, as that is the entire reason I was looking to make engines in the first place (part-count reduction through pre-built engine clusters). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still investigating one more configurable plugin-based option geared more towards one part per engine type, but it is looking like it would still run into some of the same issues as expressed above. Mostly - scaling would still be a large problem, and playing nicely with other mods would still be difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy last resort, which I will do if I can\u0027t get other options to work (which is seeming very likely), is to simply follow the standard setup. Create one part per engine per cluster setup, but with a much reduced selection of cluster setups for most engines. These would mostly be the iconic / historic setups, and would be different on a per engine basis. All should be available in a single-engine mount as well for general purpose use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMounts will not be stack-size specific, but instead be engine size specific, which will allow for much greater range of scaling. They would all come with procedural engine fairing module with configurable top and bottom radius, and possibly a second procedural fairing module to set up the stack-size adapter plate. Hopefully using that simple layout and module combination should still allow for patching, rescaling, and generally playing nice with others. Moving to a single-part-per cluster setup also re-presents the opportunity for optional custom shroud setups using a simple mesh-switch plugin. It also allows much greater room for customization of the mounts and their layout/spacing on a per-engine setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m already designing all engine models to use a common (rescaled) mounting system, so this greatly simplifies the creation of the \u003Cem\u003Einitial\u003C/em\u003E set of parts; I merely need to design and compile a single mount model and a single engine model, and the rest is taken care of through MODEL nodes in the config. In the beginning many of these will be little more than pre-welded engine clusters (though, ones that actually function as intended) -- initial releases will likely have no shroud options and all engines would share the same rescaled mounting bracket model. Many of these can/will be upgraded over time to include customized mounts and shroud options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the more interesting/mundane/overkill details that I haven\u0027t mentioned yet regarding the engines is that I am designing them all with realistic gimbal mechanics, as far as possible. The gimbal position on each motor is where it would be on the real article, is/will be modeled after real gimbal and mechanics, and each will have (seemingly) functional mechanics driving the gimbal movement (really just some transform constraints...). Each motor will have different parts that move and flex as the engine is vectored, at least as close to the real-world mechanics as I could replicate (some of the fuel lines IRL have many articulation points; these will likely only have 1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, still tons to think on, and many engine models to finish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T09:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see that things going in the right direction so I\u0027ll just stuff more pics of prospective engines, it seems that there\u0027s now a mini tech race between SLS-BF4/SpaceX/Russians to build new launchers using methalox engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERD-0164 vs RD-180MC (methane-cryogenic) chart:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=32161.0;attach=1059438;image\u0022 alt=\u0022index.php?action=dlattach;topic=32161.0;attach=1059438;image\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erows: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- thrust (in tf so x10 for kN) SL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- thrust vac\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- isp SL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- isp VAC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- throttling ability (%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- length\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- diameter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERD0164 = Fuel Rich Staged Combustion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERD-180 = Oxidizer Rich Staged Combustion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* = Maximum dimensions in the plane of the cut nozzles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=32161.40\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=32161.40\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a brainstorm for possible future stuff to account for if you\u0027re developing your custom engine code, if not you might as well disregard it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=====\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve read some stuff about spacex engines and \u0027overthrottling\u0027 ability\u0027.

Love the idea though, and will likely add something similar onto the features /todo list (if I don\u0027t find another mod that has done it first). Using this method seems to make the most sense for a career based game, allowing you to squeeze a little bit extra out of the lower-tech engines and possibly allowing them to see later-game use (similar to how we are -still- using engine designs from the 60\u0027s...RL-10 anyone?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImplementing some sort of \u0027engine out\u0027 or failure mechanics again seems like it belongs in another separate mod/module rather than being tied to my engines.

I believe there already are a few mods out there that simulate random part failures and reliability stats (never used it, but DangIt! comes to mind).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, implementing some sort of engine cluster control where you can shut down specific engines might be on the board.

As previously mentioned by other posters, CH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E has slightly higher impulse \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 about 370 s in vacuum vs the 360 s \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 at the same chamber pressure of 7 MPa. But, this is counterbalanced by its lower bulk density of about 830 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E vs about 1030 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. Bulk Density is the density of the combined Fuel and Oxidizer load in their appropriate ratios. Even though Methane is \u0022only\u0022 430 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E it is burned with 3.5 parts oxygen compared to 2.1 parts for RP-1, hence a CH4 rocket will be carrying more oxygen and less fuel by weight. Oxygen is pretty dense at a little over 1140 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E which is denser in fact than RP-1 (about 810 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E). If we assume that chamber pressures and engine cycle efficiency will be equal, RP-1 outperforms CH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E simply because a 20% larger tank will impose weigh penalties that slightly outweigh the 3% increase in specific impulse. However, the RP-1 advantage is contingent upon operating at an equal chamber pressure which may not be the case. And, Methane (CH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E) has additional advantages that are applicable in specific scenarios.\u003Cp\u003E The reasons CH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E is a front runner for SpaceX\u0027s Raptor can probably be attributed to four factors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMethane does not coke (polymerize) at the operating temperatures of a rocket engine \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it\u0027s coking point is roughly twice as high. This makes it easier to make an engine reusable and re-usability is a key SpaceX objective. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBecause Methane does not coke, it is also easier to implement a full-flow stage combustion (FFSC) cycle where all the fuel and oxidizer flow goes through the pre-burner. Compared to contemporary Russian partial flow stage combustion engines higher chamber pressures are attainable resulting in a total impulse advantage of about 30 seconds, or 9%. This eliminates the performance deficiency of CH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E compared to RP-1. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf SpaceX intends to use the same fuel in all the stages, CH\u003Csub\u003E4\u003C/sub\u003E can be considered a better upper stage fuel and a worse lift-off fuel, even without enabling higher working pressures. This is because upper stages are typically 1/8th to 1/10th the size of the 1st stage, and here impulse is more important than density. Using Methane with the aforementioned FFSC cycle means that SpaceX can potentially get equivalent 1st stage performance and better upper stage performance. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEven though it is, IMHO, somewhat dubious that early Mars mission will use in-situ fuel production. If that ever becomes an applicable practice, Methane can be produced from water and CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E while RP-1 cannot. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Other than that, there is the non-factor that somewhat favor Methane, such as regular grade Natural Gas being good enough and not having to highly refine the fuel from regular kerosene to RP-1 to achieve low coking characteristics and consistent densities. I say it is a non-factor, because fuel cost is such a negligible part of launch costs that it really doesn\u0027t matter if fuel cost a few times more or less.

Now I just need to write the plugin to rescale the thing and move the mounts/thrust transforms around. -Might- be this weeks \u0027new feature\u0027 (if I get the plugin written), though it may or may not have a finished model/texture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
