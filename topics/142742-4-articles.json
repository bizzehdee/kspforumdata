There might be a best engines for a particular job/scenario.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are talking about favorite engine, that is a different matter altogether. I myself like the Aerospike and the Vector a lot, both a nice mix for atmo and vacuum. I\u0027m also a big fan of the Puff engine on smaller craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see why the Aerospike has a model like the shock cone intakes. It\u0027s kind of confusing and one of these days I might mistake it for an air intake and put it on the front of a plane.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloojay","CreatedById":162865,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-28T21:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166055-daelite101/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022166055\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166055-daelite101/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DaElite101\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0its not modeled like a shock cone, its modeled like\u00A0an aerospike.
