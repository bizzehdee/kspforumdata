I wanted to test it out but it seems that there are many things it throws build errors with that Visual studio does not care about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance doing this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPublic void somemethod(float input = 1.0f)\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebuilds fine in Visual studio but in monodevelop it throws a build error on account of the default variable (input).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was another case too. But dont remember what it was\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA strange thing is that if i close the project, open the project in visual studio, save it \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand then open it in mono again. It compiles fine... any idea why this is happening? Is there some assembly settings that are changed? The target language is always set to 3.5 / mono\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that is suggested as a fix is to to disable compiling in mono (inside the main options/debugger tab) but this disables the ide requiring you to compile with unity. Which does not appear to be a valid option for ksp plugins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm a noob at programming so im sorry if this is a stupid question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm using Monodevelop 4.01(the one that ships with unity)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
