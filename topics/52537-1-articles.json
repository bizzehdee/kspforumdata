Launch straight up and observe what happens. Don\u0027t forget to deploy the parachute when your rocket gets down to about 5,000 meters to the surface. launch the next one and do an orbital turn using the Navball, say about a 20 degree change with just the D key. Do the next launch but instead of using the D key to Turn, use the S key. Play with combos of the WSAD and QE keys to see how they affect your ship during and after powered flight. Play with designs that use one fuel can, two, three, five, six, and note the performance difference. Play with throttle settings on the simpler designs. Try using a SRB on one design. Note how it behaves compared to a liquid fueled engine. Keep a written logbook of the results. You can hit the F3 key for a mission report. Do take advantage of Jeb to do science reports and take samples where he lands back on Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, go spend some of the science and unlock some more parts. Play with decouplers and building stages. Example, take the rocket above, put a decoupler between the capsule and first fuel can. Then place a decoupler under the LV-30 engine and attach a SRB under it. Note how that combination affect performance compared to a single stage. Note, how placing a decoupler under the capsule can make landing easier. You can also use symmintery and attach boosters to the side for increased lifting power and see how they perform at this time. Note why this might not work as well as it should with the design below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tzeqOsM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tzeqOsM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, go and experiment with various combos of engines and stages.

Experienced players decided to have some fun with this and blow the bottom stages up with exhaust from the upper stages, but this is a carefully managed process which i don\u0027t advise to beginners. Rather, if you want to play carreer mode, just put a command pod on the launchpad. Take a crew report, then hover over your Kerbals portrait in the bottom-right and go \u0027EVA\u0027, or step out of your craft. Step on the floor and take a surface sample and an EVA report. Step back into your pod (use the F key to board), then recover it using the big green button that will appear above your altimeter when you hover there. You should now have enough science to unlock decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, for your easiest start, i very highly advise you use sandbox mode instead. Try restricting yourself to the \u0027small diameter\u0027 parts.
