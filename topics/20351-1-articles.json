Mod devs will probably balance things out within their own mod, but there\u0027s no guarantee that that will hold when players add another mod that adds a few different parts with similar function. For example, take the battery from MMI.S, and the battery from the DSM mod. Both have the same capacity, but the DSM one is much larger, and much more massive. Strictly from a logical point of view, it\u0027d make no sense to use the DSM version if you also have the MMI.S battery available. My goal is to just tweak a few numbers so that things make sense and we can all get the most out of the modders\u0027 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have much knowledge of C, and know nothing about the classes mods can use, so plugin development by me isn\u0027t much of a realistic option right now. However, I do a lot of Python programming for kicks, so cfg edits are trivial for me to do. I guess it\u0027s rather fitting; in the same way Python is used as a \u0022glue\u0022 to hold together various parts of a larger program that are written in different languages, a well-thought-out pack of cfg edits that tweak values and settings across multiple mod packs can glue them all together into one harmonious whole. (The best analog I can think of off the top of my head is Obscuro\u0027s Oblivion Overhaul for TES IV. It wasn\u0027t so much as a new mod, as a massive collection of the community\u0027s mods all in one package, and rebalanced so they made sense and the game was still fun. Balancing a game in an of itself can be time-consuming, and as more parts pop up, it\u0027ll be a bigger and bigger project. Still, it\u0027s something I want to do if it\u0027ll benefit everyone involved.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESal: There are two ways I can interpret that minimalist set of rules posted, as it relates to projects like these that are simple cfg edits that tie different mods together, without including any of the other mod assets. (In other words, there\u0027s not really any stealing, so much as it is providing an alternate settings file to a part created by someone else. I don\u0027t see how this would be any sort of problem if credit to the original authors is given.) The intent seems to be to protect more complex works, such as plugins, models, textures, and so on, which I understand, and are worth protecting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) (This is what I think the intention is and is definitely preferred.) This would allow for a pack of cfg edits for the purpose of balancing multiple similar mods together. If a license is absolutely required (and really...what the heck am I licensing? A few characters of tweaks? O.o If I had to put anything on it I\u0027d say \u0022public domain\u0022 period and leave it at that, if I had a choice), and \u003Cstrong\u003Eif\u003C/strong\u003E a public domain license isn\u0027t acceptable, then the most restrictive license of the mods that the original cfg files come from would need to be applied to the entire pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) (The more restrictive interpretation.) Such a pack would be banned entirely, because it would be impossible to redistribute those files as a single pack and license them under the same license. They would need to be separated into distinct packs that inherited the licensing from their respective mods, meaning the entire project would be separated into mini-packs, licensed differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second would be a nightmare that I\u0027m simply not willing to put-up with. I have a life, and school. *blinks* I\u0027m amazed that my brain has to do these legal cartwheels to know whether or not I can share a few tweaks to settings files. O.o\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, in any case, it would seem that a step-by-step guide on how to edit every cfg file to be rebalanced is actually not against the rules. No chance of me even considering such a thing because I wouldn\u0027t write it, and no one would use it if anyone did. Again, it\u0027d be an organizational nightmare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo help us out here. Is such a project okay to share here, or do I need to go elsewhere?
