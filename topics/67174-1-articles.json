Looking at that two year old article makes me realize just how good the SLS program is doing ( though.. correct me if im wrong here ). The Orion is set to fly on a Delta-V Heavy in September for a high energy reentry akin to Apollo 4. Then the SLS is too fly in 2017 as stated. I have faith in NASA. If commercial companies can take over LEO NASA can focus its efforts more and more on BEO. Obama said himself awhile back that we should be launching Americans from American soil so the interest is there. And its better then its been in decades Id say. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is.. what to focus on? Other then the Orion capsule itself the SLS has no payload.. Do we go to the Moon? Mars? .. Asteroids? .. All of the above? A tough question. I for one am for a Moon base and an ARM. Mars.. I couldn\u0027t really care less for it at the moment.
