Even after you turn your engines off, that heat is going to stick around for awhile and spread to the other parts of your ship until it equalizes."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T21:20:43Z","Content":"I hate atomic engines for this reason.

Heat has built up in your engines, and it spreading by conduction to nearby parts. It will continue spreading until the temperature equalizes. Meanwhile, the heat is slowly being radiated away by most parts, but it will take some time to dissipate. You can enable temperature details in the right click menus to see it happen in detail (Alt-F12 -\u003E Physics -\u003E Thermal -\u003E Display in Action Menus). Opening solar panels can help as they are good radiators. Also in the future a few C type wings are lightweight and effective radiators."},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T01:36:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Its working as intended, at least until they change it all again in 1.0.3.

The default (and minimum) setting is 1; it can go as high as 100, which will ensure that your LV-N\u0027s never overheat just by running."},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T01:40:07Z","Content":"Space is such a terrible conductor ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T06:54:18Z","Content":"Heat of some elements rise as they accept heat from other, hotter elements.

I\u0027ve reached nearly 5000m/s yesterday on nukes, Throttle at around 4th notch on the scale, a notch below the first big mark, engine with \u0022throttle limit\u0022 at 90%. Even with physwarp at 4x it took hours of real time but the engine never overheats.\n\n(just don\u0027t change ships (\u0022switch to\u0022 or through KSC) while you have the nuke running at the low-throttle. It IS doable, the craft stops gaining speed but still burns fuel, especially in normal time warp."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T07:00:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Heat of some elements rise as they accept heat from other, hotter elements.

As soon as you hit x1000 or higher, all temperature on all parts resets to ~289 K and remains that way. But below that warp factor, everything is processed normally.\n\nSo one (albeit a bit cheaty) way to cool down your nukes is to go to timewarp x1000 once with the ship focused, so they reset."}]}
