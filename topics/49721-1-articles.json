You could re-implement that interface... but since ModuleDataTransmitter\u0027s CanTransmit implementation isn\u0027t virtual, so all ModuleDataTransmitter internal calls to this function would still use these original implementation. Sure you can try it, but you better expect some weird issues. IScienceDataTransmitter.TransmitData might be worth a try as well.
