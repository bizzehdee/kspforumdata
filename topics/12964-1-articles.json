Combining multiple colliders into one object to create a more complex collider would therefor not work since it would no longer be convex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new unity parttools on the other hand allows you to create multiple colliders either by giving more meshes mesh collider components (this is what the old system did with your node_colliders) or by creating default unity colliders within the scene itself, bear in mind that they still have to be convex.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
