I didn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDLC\u0027s should always be optional, and they should be developed and implemented with this thought in mind. A DLC shouldn\u0027t in any way twist the players arms into buying it in order to be able to keep playing. I can see this happening here with mods that will be developed in a way \u0022you NEED to have this DLC in order to install my mod\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be all fine and dandy if the DLC offered stuff that we don\u0027t already have with mods. Something BIG, something hard-coded, something not achievable with mods. Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but in the features of this DLC I\u0027ve only read stuff that we already have with mods. To take something already developed by the community with hard work, incorporate back into your product and sell back to the community is just cheap. These guys developed a great game, I\u0027m sure they could\u0027ve done better. I\u0027m sure they could\u0027ve done something to the code that we don\u0027t have access to, adding content impossible to be added through modding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMyself, for instance, I only play with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002B\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I find Kerbol system too easy, not challenging. It\u0027s a personal choice. The content of the DLC has absolutely nothing that interests me. And that\u0027s FINE, not all DLCs need to please ALL players. Many games have tons of DLCs, some aimed at players X, others at players Y in order to please everyone, and the most important part is, if you choose to NOT buy DLC X, you can still enjoy the game and features you have paid for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is, I\u0027m afraid somewhere down the line, mods like the ones I\u0027m enjoying at the moment will get updated to run on top of the new DLC and from that point onwards only people who purchased the DLC will be able to use it. Not to mention this DLC will split the modding community and make things already harder than they are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why I\u0027m frustrated. If they had worked a bit harder on this DLC and offered something big that COULDN\u0027T BE ACHIEVED THROUGH MODDING, then I\u0027m sure the vast majority of us would be more than interested in paying for it, and all of the modding community could move the same direction, developing new stuff on top of new content, and everybody would be on the same page.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI foresee a big storm coming.

As a modder I know I\u0027ll keep making/maintaining my mods for stock game, and add expansion pieces where it makes sense, but not exclusively. That said its my choice as a modder to do that, and each modder gets to make that choice, and the people who play their mods will prompt, ask, cajole, demand, beg, etc for the features.they want in the availability scope they want - as has been going on for years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have faith in the community, the modders\u00A0and the discussions we have here that people will work together to keep modding on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m fully aware that modding on DLC will depend on modders and modders alone. And I very much appreciate people like you, who will keep their modding update to benefit both sides of the party.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I tried to state is I\u0027m afraid down the line people that decided to not get the DLC will be left out and forced into it. The DLC will not affect people who don\u0027t use mods in any way, shape or form. But the majority of us uses mods, and this is the part of the community that needs to be taken more seriously. Why? You gotta remember that is thanks to modding that this community has flourished and is one of the most active communities I\u0027ve ever seen. Look at the numbers of posts, topics, visitors, the addon section is on the top. It\u0027s thanks to modding that an endless number of videos are constantly posted on YouTube, attracting even more players to come and buy your product.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know how marketing works, I work in the videogame industry. I know how powerful YouTube can be and how much it can impact on your player-base and sales, and I know for sure your numbers wouldn\u0027t be the same if this game wasn\u0027t as open to modding as it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did a lot of work on modding for a game called Silent Hunter 3, back in 2009. One of my mods had over 45k downloads, a sound pack. That game was released back in 2005 and it is to this day one of the most active communities I know, with new mods being released on a daily basis, and some big mega-mod projects even coming out in videogame magazines. 12 years have passed and that game is still being sold, thanks to the modding community that keeps it alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess my point is, modding brings more players and possibly more profit to the company than a DLC would in the long run, not from modding alone but from all it involves. I have friends who purchased KSP only after they saw what modding could do to the game, and stated they wouldn\u0027t have done otherwise. So when releasing a paid DLC with weak content (again, only based on the information that was given us), you will cause the community to split, modders to split, and the consequences of it can be catastrophic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m hoping like crazy that I\u0027m wrong about this, cos KSP is by far the best game I\u0027ve ever played. I\u0027ve tons of creativity and KSP is the only game to date that I\u0027ve played that allows me to put all that creativity into action and see it all unfolding in front of my eyes, and not only in my imagination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest of luck to us all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223001011\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157802\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490742343\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57838-triggerau/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257838\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57838-triggerau/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@TriggerAu\u003C/a\u003E, Yeah, that\u0027s why I specifically limited my agreement (and why I\u0027m none the less in the \u0022it\u0027s a small price to pay\u0022 camp, though that;s entirely because I feel like I ripped Squad off because I\u0027ve not gotten so much use out of so little expense in... forever, possibly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ve been getting ripped off by videogame companies for so long that when one company does what it\u0027s supposed to do and release a decent, fully functional product, we think they are god.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack when Blizzard was still called Silicon \u0026amp; Synapse, games weren\u0027t made only with the intent of profit, but rather made by people who love what they were doing.
