The buoyancy is simply equal to displaced weight. Vacuum is, in fact, the perfect filler for a balloon. It gives you 100% buoyancy. The reason vacuum chambers don\u0027t float is because they are heavy. Really, really heavy. They have to be in order to withstand the pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s the reason we don\u0027t build balloons filled with vacuum. If you fill a balloon with, say, helium, the pressure inside is equal to one atmosphere, same as on the outside. Yet, helium can still be lighter than air at the same pressure. So the balloon itself can be very thin and light. Vacuum, on the other hand, has to be contained within a thick, strong shell, or it won\u0027t be able to withstand the outside pressure. There is no material in existence that would be strong enough yet light enough to make a vacuum balloon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, it\u0027s not a complete impossibility. It is possible to build a honeycomb structure with something like Mylar skin that can, in principle be buoyant due to contained vacuum. I don\u0027t know if anyone has ever actually built one, but I\u0027ve seen some papers showing that it is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, however, the advantage of vacuum being lighter than any gas is completely nullified by the weight of the container required to maintain said vacuum. It is always more efficient to use a light gas, such as hydrogen or helium.

You want to build one 2x larger. (Or 2x smaller.) This increases (decreases) buoyancy by a factor of 8, because volume scales as cube of diameter. This also, however, increases (decreases) the pressure it has to withstand by a factor of 4, all the while the cross-section has increased (decreased) by a factor of 2 only. Former is cross-section area of the entire sphere, which scales with square of the diameter, and later is cross-section of the shell only, which scales linearly with diameter. So now the shell has to be 2 times thicker (thinner). And because you already increased (decreased) total surface area by a factor of 4 already, the total weight of the shell has also increased (decreased) by a factor of 8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it doesn\u0027t matter how big or small you make that shell. The requirements of strength/weight of material from which you want to build it are the same. And it\u0027s impossible to build either way. Similar problem occurs if you consider how this changes with atmospheric pressure. If you reduce pressure, you can make the shell lighter, but you get less buoyancy by the same fraction. So again, the problem does not scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd like I said, materials with sufficient strength/weight to build a uniform shell that can maintain a vacuum and still be light enough to float do not exist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T23:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven current materials, yes, absolutely, a vacuum airship is impossible.
