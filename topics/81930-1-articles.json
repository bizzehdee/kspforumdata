With the signature, go to your settings, and look on the left hand side, There is a toolbar there, with a bunch of options, such as \u0022edit avatar\u0022 and \u0022edit info\u0022 and just look for \u0022edit Signature\u0022. You can type one in there. Hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T03:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, you need 5 posts until you can post without the getting approved by moderator thing, and I don\u0027t think you can edit your sig until 5 posts too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWalrus123","CreatedById":119099,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T03:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
