For some reason, this rubber duckie seems to be telling me to take over the galaxy.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E - Jebodiah Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlot premise:\u003C/strong\u003E A Machinima involving Kerbal Space Program in which Jeb Kerman had went totally insane after spending too much time out in charge of a Main Space Carrier orbiting around Jool. Because of this (and the inability of Kerbin\u0027s \u0022Scientists\u0022 to figure out that he is going crazy) Jeb not only went mad, but also managed to coerce other not so intelligent Kerbins to build an armada that is threatening not just the KSP, but even Kerbal itself (with the treat free playboys and Kerbitches for all)! This leads the only people to try to stop him, the idiotic Bob Kerman, and the even more moronic Bill Kerman. With their group of equally \u0022clever\u0022 scientists, will they finally be able to defeat the new scourge of space? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGenre:\u003C/strong\u003E This will be a comedic parody of a science fiction TV show/movie. Much in the same vein as SpaceBalls, it will involve various forms of stupidity, potty humor, and other forms of idiocy. The idea will be to have Machinima mixed in with comic strip drawings to help tell this story in a episodic type of narrative. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMisc:\u003C/strong\u003E Due to the fact that most of the space sci-fi carriers/stations are too heavy to fly, there will be no gravity for the carriers/stations for take-off, and will only have gravity effects on once the space stations/carriers are placed around the orbits of their particular planet/moon bodies. Also, do to this, all cheats will be on (fuel, RCS, EVA) for the Machinima portions. The B9 mod will be in effect, and possibly MechJeb (if it would work correctly with .21). And there will be no Kerbin mini pictures at the bottom right corner of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow...I will do the comic strip portion. But, I was thinking of doing something like the Hiimdasiy MGS comic shows, with the game play video recordings in between them. I\u0027m thinking of doing a QUICK, 5-7 min YT short for this. If anyone\u0027s interested, they could PM me (or write in this forum), but I would like to have help with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Voice acting. I am going for everyone sounding like either Kermit the Frog, or Ernie. And it would be better to get the point across if I had some people (or one good VA) read off the comic strip. Also, I would like to have someone who could do the voice of a scientist (like Bulma\u0027s dad from DBZ). And possibly someone who could pull off a good President Bush, or Bill Clinton (for a part in a future episode).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Station/Carrier builder. This is important! Without the ships around the said orbits of the various places it would sort of shoot the whole idea down. But if someone would be generous enough to create the ships (or wants to do the game play recording) I would appreciate it (and give you credits/links in the info). If someone wouldn\u0027t mind doing the recordings, it would be helpful as well (as for some odd reason, my computer is lagging while playing this game with the B9 and MechJeb mods).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll more than likely will also knock out the post-editing (unless someone wouldn\u0027t mind taking care of that for me (as I\u0027m using Windows Movie Maker atm)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what do you guys think? Like I said, if there is any interest in taking part, feel free to write on this board message, or PM me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T03:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice idea, can you add some space mecha in the style of mobile suits?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, they will do nothing but get shot down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T03:52:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll good stories start with a storyboard.
