I would say that it\u0027s probably done by using actual thrusters that have been placed on the front and sides of the ship to slowly settle it in place, but seriously, thats going to take a lot of work and make some ships ugly....Especially my big ships...Like my Halberd....The SAS can\u0027t that huge thing still, it just makes it wobble even worse...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I still have yet to try docking on a controlled platform, like on Kerbin.

The actually, and quite effectively, matches the other craft\u0027s orbit path to a \u0027T\u0027. I tried my best without having to look it up, and effectively shot passed one particular vessel three times before I gave up, closed KSP, and went on the web. Five minutes later, I facepalmed then went to bed. Today, I got up at 12, and took an hour to dock my two Phoenix Mk III 2.0 ships.
