Or how to get to there the wrong way.","CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T15:32:05Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T15:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t your usual mission report but hear me out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve been following the NASA model, spending all my time in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made 2 trips to Mun, 3 to Minimus and 2 to Duna. That\u0027s good right, spending all my time on different space station designs, and trying to design the ultimate interplanetary crusier to have future landers dock to, that well I just haven\u0027t left LKO in a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut so last night I needed to test how a mod would work on Laythe, so I made me a cheaty ship 1 man lander pod, smallest fuel tank, mainsail, and infinite fuel cheat. After 3 failed attempts I uninstalled Deadly Reentry, a constant 17 g\u0027s of acceleration just wasn\u0027t working. Now I have other launch windows scheduled, and a space station with oxygen supplies, so we can\u0027t just launch for a encounter and time warp. This has to be a quick trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I burned for Jool, and I burned for jool, and I burned for Jool, So I left it burning while I went and took a bath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI come back and we\u0027re down to under 1 day till encounter. That\u0027s an acceptable amount of time warp without messing up other missions, and I realize, I\u0027ll have to burn the same amount of time retrograde to slow down. Time warp forward.... ooo slow down for Kerbol fly by.... WOW!!!! We\u0027re all dead from radiation! Shouldn\u0027t I be getting some sort of Gravity slingshot being this close to the star? This is a very straight trajectory... Wonder if I has anything to do with the fact I\u0027m doing about a quarter of a percent the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime Warp forward till 2 hours from Jool encounter, rotate the ship and begin deceleration burn... Hmmm I already shaved my legs, what this time. Oh yeah, I forgot about Physics Warp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I watch Tv while my ship slows down.. Make my encounter and continue to decelerate till I make an orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, what? I\u0027m in Orbit, where\u0027s Jool? Where\u0027s all the moons? Over there... Way over there? ! this SOI is huge!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eok, reduce my orbit, reduce my orbit, correct inclination, reduce my orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOMG!! I\u0027ve seen Jool before, there are tons of pictures posted, and youtube videos.... But there\u0027s something different about BEING there. Wow, this place is amazing, so pretty. A moment of considering signing up for Mars One, photos from Curiosity aren\u0027t as good as being there, before I remember I\u0027m way too femme for the frontier lifestyle. And I bet the pizza will run out pretty quick up there. Oh well stuck on Earth for me. But Thombal Kerman, he gets to stare at the pretty. Wow. Ok... ok, We didn\u0027t pack that much O2, time for our mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eencounter with Laythe, Orbit, and begin landing manuver. Ok, I misjudged the drag, need more altitude or we\u0027re going in the drink.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright aim right there... and burn. NO NO not that way don\u0027t spin stop the spin, Woah Woah Splash...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote to self: When coming back here for real, use the f5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I\u0027m designing my real mission to Jool. I\u0027ll post pictures of that one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T20:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, Jool and his entourage provide a lot of pretty sights. It\u0027s also very lonely if you send one, single kerbal in a small ship. So, after returning Bob home i decided to send only multi-crewed missions that far.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
