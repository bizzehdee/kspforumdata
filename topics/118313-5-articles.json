I thought he would take the logical next step and you know, *post* his license, or reupload his mod, but he hasn\u0027t and I\u0027m worried this thread will get locked (hence why I handled it via PM). Since you\u0027ve let the cat out of the bag, I guess you could try PMing him like I did.

Specifically, I am referring to the \u0022accidents\u0022 and their simulations. It would seem (or else I\u0027m even worse at this game than I thought) accidents in the simulation are still counted toward opinion modifiers. It should be as simple (I would think) as looking at when events get reverted (timestamps?). You could ask [@magico13](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73338-magico13/), who heads KCT, but simulations will be eventually getting outsourced to the KRASH mod.\n\nI think the temporary workaround might be to just change public opinion modifiers in the government config, but then you kind of get a one dimensional government![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022).

Instead it uses the standard KSP way of saving into the persistence file (via ScenarioModule).**  \n\u003Cu\u003E     Positive aspects:\u003C/u\u003E  \n\n     - reverting flights no longer messes with the state (no \u0027false\u0027 counts of destroyed vessels and dead kerbals)  \n\n     - loading a save sets the state to the correct one for that point in time  \n\n     - @Deimos Rast: I havent used KCT/KRASH myself, but I imagine their \u0022simulation\u0022 of flights is also implemented via KSP\u0027s standard persistence. This version here might already solve your request for integration - maybe have a try and let me know...\n\n\u003Cu\u003E     Negative aspects:\u003C/u\u003E  \n\n     - The previous .conf save-file is no longer read from and written to! Your old data in an existing save will no automatically migrate to the new persistence!  \n\n        One way to manually migrate the data might be:  \n\n        1. let it create the default (empty) scenario module in your persistence file.  \n\n        2. Then manually copy the data from the old conf save file into the scenario in the persistence file. The data itself should be fully compatible. Backup both files before attempting something like this...\n\n**2) some performance improvements (no more \u0027oneveryscene\u0027 addon)**\n\n**3) added KSP-AVC version file, and a license file**\n\n\u003Cu\u003EKnown problems:\u003C/u\u003E\n\n- after saving/loading, past reviews cannot be shown. The data is actually all there in the persistence, but something is wrong with reading/presenting it. Might have been already broken before my changes, but I definitely introduced some problem here. I\u0027ll need a few hours debugging to see what is going on there...\n\n**And finally:**\n\n[@iamchairs](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143189-iamchairs/) : of course I\u0027ll happily toss you a pull request on github if you want to use this version for your further development!"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T03:13:59Z","Content":"Oh I hope this works 100% soon I absolutely love this mod.
