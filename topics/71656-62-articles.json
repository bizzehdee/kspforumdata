As soon as more than one player tries to control anything, the whole physics go to hell. You can\u0027t survive a reentry while another player flies something, because in that case your rocket will hit kerbin with 500\u002B m/s no matter what you do. Only if everybody stops doing anything while you fly, you can do a normal reentry and get to fire your parachutes at approx. 2000 meters height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame problems if you try to dock anything or try to land on the Mun for example. If another player clicks on anything or starts another vehicle while you try to control your stuff, you have no chance to survive. The lander / rocket begins to spin like crazy, as if SAS had lost it\u0027s effect. I believe this is caused by lag created by too many server messages. Seems like the server can\u0027t handle more than the updates of a single player at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally sad, I hoped this would be a solution, as Squad seems to have given up their multiplayer plans, but I guess it\u0027s time to put KSP to the shelf \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nactuly squad has not abandoned the multiplayer concept of the game at all its just been on the back-burner for now.. we might see it when 1.1 comes around\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stlfatboy","CreatedById":153940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T20:30:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey\u00A0@godarklight,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am very thank you for your work.
