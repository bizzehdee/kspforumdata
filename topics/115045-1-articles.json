No way to turn it, just lots of dV to be used for spoiling the encounter even more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh well, a far flyby is it. I left the probe for half a year of game time, building my empire and conquering Mun and Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd today the day came when the encounter would occur. A really short, really distant flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I switched to the probe, to my surprise I noticed one thing: after half a year it still kept the original orientation. Except now, on the other side of the Sun, the nose formerly pointing prograde, was now pointing retrograde!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot entirely, not accurately, but I had some 500m/s dV more than my current speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I fired my engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lengthy burn later I spotted I\u0027m no longer going retrograde and burning almost entirely radial. Why? And why is the probe turning? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuicksave,because I didn\u0027t make one before, and with barely 200m/s more dV than my current speed I set off to solve the puzzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay. I found it: Ant introduces tiny inaccuracies in its burn. It starts turning in a random direction after a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany quickloads later I got the probe to turn back towards retrograde, then fixed the *rough* direction by activating time warp, and quicksaved again. 80m/s of reserve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately with the tank emptied in a significant degree, Ant ceased to produce the \u0022erroneous\u0022 pulses. I couldn\u0027t turn anymore, and I\u0027d fall short by some 50,000km of Eve, making an orbit but too long to get anything but \u0022In space high\u0022. I tried to get an assist for Gilly, but the inclination was all wrong. And all I could do was changing the moment, duration and strength of burn - not its direction. Plus the 80m/s wasn\u0027t nearly sufficient to overcome the inaccurate aim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI discovered that if I delay the burn, the slightly curved flyby path brings the retrograde marker directly into my reticle, maybe a few degrees off. Except that STILL wasn\u0027t enough. 10,000km short. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I got to thinking... how my prograde turned into retrograde. How the reticle moved as I waited along the path... could I make any use of it? Would burning prograde be of any use at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEureka! Yes, it would!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuickload, waiting for the optimal time to burn, and... I allowed the orbit to close, and brought it somewhere within Gilly\u0027s orbit but not much farther. Then I warped to periapsis, and - still in the same orientation, unable to turn - burned (mostly) prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kept burning until the apoapsis left the SOI. Basically, I set an escape trajectory. Except that wasn\u0027t all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/24sUuSv.png\u0022 alt=\u002224sUuSv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust before reaching Eve escape, I burned again (\u0022mostly retrograde\u0022). But now my orbital speed was far, far lower than on the initial encounter path, even after closing the orbit. The dV left in the tank sufficed with fuel to spare!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick lookup at the Wiki: Eve\u0027s atmospheric height is 90km. So I set up a periapsis of 85km... and - it worked!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vrGY1Ed.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vrGY1Ed.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The probe survived atmospheric braking and came out with apoapsis a bit beyond Gilly\u0027s orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI began totally milking what I had for science.
