No way to turn it, just lots of dV to be used for spoiling the encounter even more.\n\nOh well, a far flyby is it. I left the probe for half a year of game time, building my empire and conquering Mun and Minmus.\n\nAnd today the day came when the encounter would occur. A really short, really distant flyby.\n\nAs I switched to the probe, to my surprise I noticed one thing: after half a year it still kept the original orientation. Except now, on the other side of the Sun, the nose formerly pointing prograde, was now pointing retrograde!\n\nNot entirely, not accurately, but I had some 500m/s dV more than my current speed.\n\nSo, I fired my engines.\n\nA lengthy burn later I spotted I\u0027m no longer going retrograde and burning almost entirely radial. Why? And why is the probe turning? \n\nQuicksave,because I didn\u0027t make one before, and with barely 200m/s more dV than my current speed I set off to solve the puzzle.\n\nOkay. I found it: Ant introduces tiny inaccuracies in its burn. It starts turning in a random direction after a while.\n\nMany quickloads later I got the probe to turn back towards retrograde, then fixed the \\*rough\\* direction by activating time warp, and quicksaved again. 80m/s of reserve.\n\nUnfortunately with the tank emptied in a significant degree, Ant ceased to produce the \u0022erroneous\u0022 pulses. I couldn\u0027t turn anymore, and I\u0027d fall short by some 50,000km of Eve, making an orbit but too long to get anything but \u0022In space high\u0022. I tried to get an assist for Gilly, but the inclination was all wrong. And all I could do was changing the moment, duration and strength of burn - not its direction. Plus the 80m/s wasn\u0027t nearly sufficient to overcome the inaccurate aim.\n\nI discovered that if I delay the burn, the slightly curved flyby path brings the retrograde marker directly into my reticle, maybe a few degrees off. Except that STILL wasn\u0027t enough. 10,000km short. \n\nThen I got to thinking... how my prograde turned into retrograde. How the reticle moved as I waited along the path... could I make any use of it? Would burning prograde be of any use at all?\n\nEureka! Yes, it would!\n\nQuickload, waiting for the optimal time to burn, and... I allowed the orbit to close, and brought it somewhere within Gilly\u0027s orbit but not much farther. Then I warped to periapsis, and - still in the same orientation, unable to turn - burned (mostly) prograde.\n\nI kept burning until the apoapsis left the SOI. Basically, I set an escape trajectory. Except that wasn\u0027t all.\n\n![24sUuSv.png](http://i.imgur.com/24sUuSv.png)\n\nJust before reaching Eve escape, I burned again (\u0022mostly retrograde\u0022). But now my orbital speed was far, far lower than on the initial encounter path, even after closing the orbit. The dV left in the tank sufficed with fuel to spare!\n\nA quick lookup at the Wiki: Eve\u0027s atmospheric height is 90km. So I set up a periapsis of 85km... and - it worked!\n\n![vrGY1Ed.png](http://i.imgur.com/vrGY1Ed.png)\n\n The probe survived atmospheric braking and came out with apoapsis a bit beyond Gilly\u0027s orbit!\n\nI began totally milking what I had for science. Orbit high, Orbit low and Atmosphere high. \n\n![WvRRRm4.png](http://i.imgur.com/WvRRRm4.png)\n\nAfter good dozen orbits, each lower, finally the probe brought the apoapsis into the atmosphere, and began its descent...\n\n![OkD2pig.png](http://i.imgur.com/OkD2pig.png)\n\nSurprisingly, it didn\u0027t even overheat...\n\n![acCkUqY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/acCkUqY.jpg)\n\nUnfortunately, on the night side, Stayputnik\u0027s batteries ran out so I couldn\u0027t transfer science of atmosphere low, and...\n\nthe pressure reduced the 44m/s of dV I had left to zero, and the thick atmosphere was insufficient - 36m/s, but the probe didn\u0027t survive.\n\n![husERfh.png](http://i.imgur.com/husERfh.png)\n\nStill, the orbital maneuvers performed without any reasonable ability to turn around - I find it a good reason to brag.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T17:34:52Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T17:50:39Z","Content":"Nice!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T00:01:38Z","Content":"Deserved bragging noted.
