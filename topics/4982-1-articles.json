However, this difficulty is not without its balance, which is the \u003Cem\u003EGannet\u003C/em\u003E\\\u0027s hefty payload. Though it can be released in air, it is intended that it be used as a ranged missile against enemy shipping or marine weapons platforms. The warhead packs a punch, and the four SRBs that carry it will also detonate on impact. It is fitted with ASAS guidance, for added destructive efficiency*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighest safe speed with payload: 7.4 m/s [sAS off]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighest safe speed with payload: 23.5 m/s [sAS on, rear flaps up]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighest safe speed without payload: 17.4 m/s [sAS off]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighest safe speed without payload: 42.3 m/s [sAS on, rear flaps down]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zBPI0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zBPI0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*requires one live pigeon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ping111","CreatedById":8679,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-30T23:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy do you tease?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJOIN MY NAVY!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-30T23:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ping111\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ping111\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do you tease?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJOIN MY NAVY!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill working on the missile.
