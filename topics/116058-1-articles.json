I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a workaround, but my solution completely avoids the problem.\n\nEDIT: with this I don\u0027t mean that all those mods that create a galaxy are bad. or that your question was bad.

Making the system easy to navigate is simple if you have just two stars, if you have more than two it may be a little more complicated but I\u0027m confident I can get good results.\n\nAs for the planets, I don\u0027t plan to slap planets inside binary stars, a solution could be to put them far enough that they orbit the two stars as it was one object, but I haven\u0027t put any thought into this for now\n\n* * *\n\n**A couple of news on the project**\n\n**KillAshley** joined me in the development of this mod, we are now working on the star systems that will be added in the galactic arm, near the Stock KSP system (which is the starting system).\n\nI\u0027m working on the orbital parameters while KillAshley is working on the star models.\n\nOnce we have a decent number of star systems I think we may release the first playable alpha.\n\nAfter the base structure is done we\u0027ll start developing the configs that will move the planet packs to other star systems.\n\nTo be clear, if you want to play with a planet pack and this mod you need to make sure this mod is compatible with that planet pack.\n\nEach of the compatible planet packs will be loaded on a brand new star (not on the star systems we are adding right now)\n\nthis new star will most likely be a single star (not binary) since there are no planet packs that have a binary star system at their center.

As far as what you can do easily in KSP at present goes, this method\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.alemor.org/~mario/uploads/unevenbarycenter.jpg](http://www.alemor.org/~mario/uploads/unevenbarycenter.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Works OK provided the larger body is at least four times the mass of the smaller one. However it causes serious errors if the masses are equal.\n\nThis would work, but the orbital periods of the two bodies would not be the same if both Planet and Moon are orbiting the barycenter, that\u0027s why I put the moon in orbit around the planet and set the barycenter\u0027s mass to give the planet the same orbital period as the moon.\n\n\u003E The difficulty though is still how you would apply this in a situation where \u0022Moon\u0022 is the Sun and \u0022Planet\u0022 is a more massive star you\u0027ve added. As you discussed the Barycentre SOI will want to be applied over the Sun SOI instead of the other way round.\n\nhere I\u0027ve lost you.\n\nif the barycenter is the parent of the sun, then the sun\u0027s SoI will take precedence on the barycenter\u0027s one.\n\nmuch like the Mun takes precedence over Kerbin"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T23:57:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E here I\u0027ve lost you.\n\u003E if the barycenter is the parent of the sun, then the sun\u0027s SoI will take precedence on the barycenter\u0027s one.\n\u003E \n\u003E much like the Mun takes precedence over Kerbin\n\nSorry, maybe I was a bit behind, I was still thinking of how you said you didn\u0027t want to reparent the Sun."},{"CreatedByName":"Tellion","CreatedById":116794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T00:11:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E the fact that the SoIs of the stars should cover at least the point where the barycenter is. otherwise flying in there could be messy ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E but it should be possible to do, yes.\n\u003E \n\u003E I didn\u0027t do that for SigmaBinary because that mod is supposed to make the process simpler for the user.\n\u003E \n\u003E also, your solution will only work if the two stars have the same mass,\n\u003E \n\u003E the one I used in SigmaBinary can work if the masses are the same, but the result is better when there\u0027s some difference\n\nWhy messy though? The center of the whole system is the barycenter, the stars orbit it. It\u0027s like placing a copy of Kerbin at the opposite end of the orbit and multiple small moons around both Kerbins. If at all, I see this conflicting more with reality than with KSP\u0027s nested SoIs. No criticism of your mod anyhow, it is an excellent and very creative solution especially for planetary binaries.\n\nEdit 2: I just thought of close flybys and gravity assists which could be used to exploit such a barycenter. Bleh, KSP is really quite limited... Still not sure what solution I like better in this case... How do overlapping SoIs of the same order behave, does one of you know? \n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is an extensive discussion on the topic of binaries, [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39620](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39620)\n\u003E It\u0027s mostly about possible extensions to the game, as well as discussing methods that don\u0027t work well. As far as what you can do easily in KSP at present goes, this method works OK provided the larger body is at least four times the mass of the smaller one. However it causes serious errors if the masses are equal.\n\u003E \n\u003E The difficulty though is still how you would apply this in a situation where \u0022Moon\u0022 is the Sun and \u0022Planet\u0022 is a more massive star you\u0027ve added.

Regarding the graphic, I am not sure I understand though: Both bodies orbit the barycenter? Because if they follow a simple Kepler orbit they have different angular velocities, which is something rather bad in this case. Sigmas mod solves exactly this, even if it trades that for some other inaccuracies.\n\nEdit: Aaand I was ninja\u0027d. Twice .\\_.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T00:25:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 12:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tellion**"}]}
