No criticism of your mod anyhow, it is an excellent and very creative solution especially for planetary binaries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: I just thought of close flybys and gravity assists which could be used to exploit such a barycenter. Bleh, KSP is really quite limited... Still not sure what solution I like better in this case... How do overlapping SoIs of the same order behave, does one of you know? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is an extensive discussion on the topic of binaries, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39620\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39620\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s mostly about possible extensions to the game, as well as discussing methods that don\u0027t work well. As far as what you can do easily in KSP at present goes, this method works OK provided the larger body is at least four times the mass of the smaller one. However it causes serious errors if the masses are equal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty though is still how you would apply this in a situation where \u0022Moon\u0022 is the Sun and \u0022Planet\u0022 is a more massive star you\u0027ve added. As you discussed the Barycentre SOI will want to be applied over the Sun SOI instead of the other way round.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAww that thread is super interesting, thanks! Regarding the graphic, I am not sure I understand though: Both bodies orbit the barycenter? Because if they follow a simple Kepler orbit they have different angular velocities, which is something rather bad in this case. Sigmas mod solves exactly this, even if it trades that for some other inaccuracies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Aaand I was ninja\u0027d.
