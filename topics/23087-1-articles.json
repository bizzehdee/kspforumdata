It is a satellite in circular orbit, with a booster right on top of it. I can always choose to set the booster (debris) as target, but not the satellite which is now detached. If I manage to highlight the satellite, it ALWAYS says set target on debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI time warped until there was separation of booster/satellite, so no issue highlighting each.
