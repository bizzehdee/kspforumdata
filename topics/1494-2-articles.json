Obviously, you\u0027d need to be careful in construction so that you\u0027d keep the reaction wheel module pretty much at the center of mass, or be able to reposition it during construction, but it\u0027d simplify rotational control of the station. Translational control could probably be safely limited to some sort of thruster that fires in a fixed direction, or with thrust vectoring at most, to provide periodic boosts to the orbit to deal with decay due to orbital drag, and to conduct small delta-vee/plane shift maneuvers for debris avoidance. Remember, space stations don\u0027t need to maneuver nearly as much as the craft that serve them. Indeed, I could easily see Jeb just saying, \u0027Khell with it, I\u0027m just gonna set it spinning and let that keep it stable; if it needs a boost, I can dock a rocket to it.
