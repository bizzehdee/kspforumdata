Let\u0027s say I\u0027m in the vehicle assembly building and I want to go to the tracking center or the R\u0026amp;D building. When I click \u0022quit\u0022 it takes me back to the space center as it should, except the view is extremely zoomed in in-between the vab and the R\u0026amp;D building. That wouldn\u0027t be a bad thing, except that I can\u0027t zoom out or even move the camera. Because of the camera zoom, I don\u0027t have access to the tracking center or launch pad. Quitting and reloading doesn\u0027t fix this. The only way to reset the camera to it\u0027s correct position is to quit the game and launch it again. In my book; any glitch that requires the player to quit the game just to fix it is game-breaking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help or suggestions would be great. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eps This is my 1st post so don\u0027t hate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T22:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECause the problem.

If exiting from Flight or the Tracking Station it never occurs. Pretty sure this isn\u0027t a mod-related issue, though, as (I think) I\u0027ve seen it 100% stock as well. Though I\u0027m just as useless as the rest of you as I haven\u0027t bothered to keep a copy of the log when it happens. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
