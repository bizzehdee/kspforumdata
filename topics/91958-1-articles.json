I\u0027d be glad to hear from other users though! A quick forum search has pulled up a few threads regarding people having difficulty running 0.25 at minimum specs, and I was one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a refresher, published minimums are:-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.0GHz Dual Core or higher\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4Gb RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E512Mb Graphics card with shader model 3.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe remaining specs regarding Windows, free space etc are fairly simple but it\u0027s the above three that are highly variable on people\u0027s systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy computer\u0027s quick, about the quickest dual core you\u0027d find without spending big money...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.0GHz Dual Core\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4Gb RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1Gb Graphics card with shader model 5.0 (GeForce GTX 550)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.24 ran perfectly, 0.25 crashed before loading. Graphics were set to roughly medium, the only exception was the resolution set to 1280x1024.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I tried some tweaking and varied a few components to see what I could achieve... the results were interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt low graphics, it ran fine. If I increased textures over halfway the game crashed at ship building. I stole a 2Gb ram stick from my wife\u0027s computer and upped it to 6Gb. No change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I installed 0.25 on my wife\u0027s computer and it ran exactly the same despite having only a 1.86 dual core and a 512Mb graphics card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe processor doesn\u0027t therefore seem to affect very much, but still no cigar. If my wife\u0027s underscored machine reacted the same as my overspend, it suggested a fairly major upgrade was needed. Lastly, I borrowed a 2Gb graphics card from a friend, analogue rather than DVI, and it ran perfectly on the highest graphics settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be a system flaw, but to me the 512Mb card requirement really needs looking at!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be good to know if I\u0027m totally off the mark or if others have experienced similar!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
