Add the following code to the RC radial, preferably by using a ModuleManager config. I\u0027m guessing at an appropriate value for adjustCollider. I know for a fact that -0.25 works, but it\u0027s too aggressive. It will cause the radial to show up as shielded even if nothing is there to shield it. Haven\u0027t tested the value below but it should probably work. If not, increase it a little. (I picked -0.015 as 0.0025 *2 to compensate for the part being sunk in and an additional 0.01 to compensate for the transform, where I\u0027m not exactly sure how far off it is. (what this does btw is to move the origin of the raycast further back along the directional vector.
