For example: If you have more prestige than your rival(s) more contractors will contact you instead of your rival(s) driving them bankrupt from lack of funding.\n\nPrestige should be earned by been to first in orbit or researching a tech instead of bringing a Kerbal back safely (That\u0027s an achievement). Just say you get to orbit first and you get 100 prestige all the rivals following will still receive prestige\n\nbut not as much as been first to orbit.\n\nNotifications of events such as a mun landing should be notified to players when they enter the space center screen telling them all the stats necessary such as how much prestige earned and if they did it first.\n\nNow you might be worried that the game would take a performance hit from having rival(s). You simply don\u0027t load space centers and huge rockets. For example: They land on the Mun. A ship never went there but the game calculated if they could go to the Mun of where you where in the tech tree and the difficulty setting of the AI. How ever you could see and go to a space station the AI launched.\n\nThis is all I can say right now, and don\u0027t just judge, build upon this idea! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T15:57:53Z","Content":"There is a [proper subforum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion) for this ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd rival space agencies actually have been discussed there quite a bit, so your idea falls in line with the ideas of several other forum users. I\u0027d encourage you to look at their arguments as well, and the counterarguments as well that think that the idea isn\u0027t worth it. \n\nPersonally, I say that it would be a fun addition, but it should be something that can toggle on and off.
