term.\u00A0 When you hear the term \u0022by design\u0022, probably what pops into your head is \u0022by design\u0022 in the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estrong\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E sense of the term, as in:\u00A0 someone cares about it a lot, made a conscious decision to do it this way, spent engineering time to make sure it was this way, and the decision is unlikely to change because they want it to act that way.\u00A0 And yes, there are plenty of cases like that.\u00A0 If you bump up against something in the game that you strongly dislike, which is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estrongly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u0022by design\u0022, I doubt you\u0027ll see that get changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there are other, \u0022weaker\u0022 cases of \u0022by design\u0022, where change is a lot more possible, generally speaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s \u0022by \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etechically obsolete\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E design.\u0022\u00A0 It may be that a feature was originally implemented a long time ago, and the design decision made good sense at the time, but the reason may have become obsolete with changes in the game.\u00A0 Maybe it was designed that way out of technical necessity, but other options opened up as the game developed, and it\u0027s no longer an actual technical limitation, and the only reason it\u0027s still there is because nobody complained about it before, or because everyone\u0027s been busy with higher-priority stuff and nobody got around to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s \u0022by \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egameplay obsolete\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E design.\u0022\u00A0 Same deal, but perhaps the original reason was based on long-ago gameplay behavior, and if the game behaves differently now, perhaps the original reason for the design decision has become moot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s \u0022by \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eaccidental\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E design.\u0022\u00A0 Maybe somebody built a general-purpose gameplay mechanic to cover a broad range of behavior, and this one specific use case happens to be one where the default behavior doesn\u0027t make much sense, but nobody ever thought to address it before.\u00A0 In other words, it could be that the specific behavior isn\u0027t a conscious design decision on anyone\u0027s part, but rather, it just ended up that way due to default behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t work for Squad and therefore don\u0027t have any more insight into this particular case than you do, but I\u0027d guess that it\u0027s at the weaker end of the \u0022by design\u0022 spectrum.\u00A0 Certainly I think it makes perfect sense for a kerbal in a command seat to be able to collect science if it\u0027s within arm\u0027s reach.\u00A0 Heck, in 1.2, with the right probe core, you can transfer science around \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eeven without any kerbals present\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, so if that\u0027s allowed, why not allow a kerbal in a command chair?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMy suggestion to you:\u00A0 Go ahead and log a bug in the bug tracker.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 However, under \u0022issue type\u0022, classify it as \u0022feedback\u0022 rather than as \u0022bug\u0022.\u00A0 Keep it simple, \u0022I think a kerbal in an external command seat should be able to collect science from instruments that are within range.\u0022\u00A0 Include a link to this thread so that the discussion\u0027s visible to the Squad staff when they\u0027re looking at it.\u00A0 Then, after you\u0027ve created it, post a link to the bugtracker issue here, so that your fellow forumgoers who like the idea can go there and vote it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t guarantee that Squad will make the change... but hey, it\u0027s worth a shot.\u00A0 We\u0027re in a pre-release right now, so it\u0027s the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eperfect\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E time to be making that sort of suggestion, and the sooner the better.\u00A0 If it turns out to be something that\u0027s easy for Squad to implement, and if they like the idea, who knows-- they might do it.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022
