The original was pretty much an exact functioning replica of the LAU-142/A - down to the bolts and wiring - but at 20000\u002B polygons (roughly equivalent to a 60 part ship), it went a little bit higher than my polygon budget of 500.

Then all that would need to happen after that is to rig it so the doors open just before the launcher/missile combo is activated. I have denialed^\\*^ myself into believing that I might be able to bundle it with RvB, and all it would take is the IR guys to let me steal a snippet of their hard work, and a little bit of coding by an inspired clever coder type. I should set up a candybar and mountain dew (Irn Bru?) trap and see if I can catch one! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nOf course, with all the recent 1.1 hype, I think maybe the LAU-142 needs to wait until after Unity 5.0 version of KSP is released, as that will probably break a lot of plugins. ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I can\u0027t wait for these weapon bays!\n\nMe neither!
