But butchering them for meat, however, is going to be a lot of mess. Just plucking the feathers alone is already a problem. Then the blood when you cut the meat, then the guts. Then the sanitizing process... Just thinking about it makes me think it is way more problems than it is worth.\n\nAlso, what do we do with the waste? Feather, bones, anything that isn\u0027t edible. Seems like a whole lot of energy wasted for things we can\u0027t use.\n\nMaybe one day we will have a genetically engineered creature that does nothing but take in waste discarded by the crew and turn it into meat...like a certain sci-fi horror manga.
