For example, it can\u0027t store any date before January 1, 1970.  For another, if the system is using a signed four-byte integer to store the value (as many systems do)... then it\u0027ll overflow on January 19, 2038, causing a [problem like Y2K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) only probably more severe.\n\nBecause of those issues, in recent years software has tended to move away from that representation, in favor of other timestamp schemes that are more flexible.  However, for an awful lot of software, it\u0027s a thing.\n\nSo... if there\u0027s a software migration somewhere that was moving records around... and if one of the fields being migrated was a timestamp for the post... and if something went awry and the timestamp got zeroed out... then a timestamp of zero means \u0022Midnight GMT, January 1, 1970.\u0022  Which would be the afternoon of December 31, 1969 for the western hemisphere, which I suspect is where most KSP forum posts come from.  Which would explain why all the posts that show a timestamp of December 31, 1969."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-09T23:59:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 47 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Technobabble\uFEFF about the 1969 date is in spoiler, for th\uFEFFe curious.\uFEFF\n\u003E \n\nAnd here I thought the Powers that Be just wanted to commemorate the year of the first moon landing. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetpackmaniac","CreatedById":182323,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-11T13:50:21Z","Content":"Why do I sometimes see odd symbols on old posts? \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\uFEFF\u00C2\u00A6\uFEFF\uFEFF \uFEFF\uFEFF"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-11T14:38:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, a\\_space\\_oddity said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Why do I sometimes see odd symbols on old posts? \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\uFEFF\u00C2\u00A6\uFEFF\uFEFF \uFEFF\uFEFF\n\u003E \n\n*Those are the characters of an BBCode Forum.
