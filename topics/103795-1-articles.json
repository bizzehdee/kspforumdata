We get a look at the boat, sporting three jet engines, a white structurite hull, six deckchairs and a parasol over a table. I\u0027m using Ferram\u0027s BetterBuoyancy, but it can swim in stock hydrodynamics as well, if not as fast.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

He couldn\u0027t, and upon loading, the parasol, and Jeb, decided to proceed downward energetically. Jeb, as the selected Kerbal, floated up, while the other two sunk like rocks, which, as I understand, is a known BetterBuoyancy issue."},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T22:18:21Z","Content":"Uh oh.
