I\u0027m now the swiftest learner around but I can put that ship together in about 60 seconds now, I\u0027ve done it so many times trying to get things right. This program is the least intuitive I\u0027ve ever used, going back to when I began using computers (1980s). People like me are fortunate to have a caring community such as the knowledgeable ones on this forum. I like the game a lot, but it\u0027s frustrating as hell. And I\u0027m grateful for the help I get here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI look forward to whatever answers you can provide to the questions above. I have 3 Kerbals sitting on Mun, waiting patiently to find out if they\u0027re going to get to ride around on their rover.
