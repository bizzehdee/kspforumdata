The Gryphon is an orbital bus and tanker, able to transfer almost 3/4 of an orange tank to a craft in low kerbin orbit, as well as over 300 units of monoprop, and up to 10 crew and passangers. It has been tested for Deadly Reentry and designed around the latest version of FAR. The posted design uses Mechjeb, but an autopilot-free version is available by request.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nxJQGd7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nxJQGd7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the Gryphon, like the Manticore before it, is designed to accept a transfer vehical attached to the belly docking port- as long as all the -LOCKED- tanks are still full, it can perfectly balance on top of another rocket, the spaceplane\u0027s ample tanks usable to supplement the transfer vehical\u0027s. With this capability in mind, the Gryphon has a belly mounted RCS bank, capable of safely belly landing on Ike or smaller worlds, and assist with a safe landing on kerbin or laythe. This bank can be toggled off with the press of a button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H7W9UDs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H7W9UDs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gryphon is easy to fly into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen physics loads, press your [FAR] tab to bring up your Flight Status, and click on \u0022Lvl\u0022, \u0022Yaw\u0022 and \u0022Flt Data.\u0022 This last window has a bunch of information, but the important part of it is the \u0022L/D\u0022 and the \u0022Air Requirements Met.\u0022 Finally right click one of your flaps (on the delta, not the tailbooms) so you get a window that says \u0022Flap Setting: 2\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/InUM6XS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022InUM6XS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(image is of the Manticore, but the FAR data is the same)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour action groups are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Switch Raipier mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Toggle Raipiers on/off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Toggle Turbojets on/off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Flap Setting \u002B1 (nose up)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Flap Setting -1 (nose down)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8: Release whatever is attached to your docking port\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9: Belly RCS activation/shutdown (when active and RCS is on, press K to fire)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0: open/close docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress Space to turn your engines on, and throttle up. Double tap 9 to shut down the belly RCS, and 0 to close the belly docking port. Then let it take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn flap setting 2, the default, the Gryphon should gracefully lift off around 140 M/s and start arcing back into the sky. Wait for it to point over 45 degrees upward, then activate SAS to lock in the heading. Ideally you should be very slowly bleeding m/s, and your Mach number shoud be holding steady in the .4 to .5 range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you pass 8000m, nose down (with W) to just below 40 degrees- you should start building velocity. Watch your mach number, and try not to move your nose around much (unless you start getting a \u0022Large scale stall\u0022 warning, then nose down some more) until you pass Mach 1. Then (assuming your level) you can turn off SAS to smoothly let your flaps lift your nose back up to 45 and lock it in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you pass 17500m, you\u0027re going to need to start leveling out. Press 5, wait a sec, and press it again (the flap you right clicked on should say \u0022Flap setting 0\u0022 If not, press 5 again until it does) and release SAS. Instead of pulling up, your nose should drop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFind your \u0022Air Requirements Met\u0022 in the Flight Data window- you want to be flying almst perfectly level (the guage next to your altitude at the top of the screen should be very near the \u002B10) when you get below 150%. Press 4 to get to Flap Setting 1. You\u0027re trying to find an angle that keeps your Air Requirements steady, somewhere between 90% and 140%. (110%-120% is best, but anything near there is fine) Lock it in with SAS, and check your email. It\u0027ll take a while to get up to speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Kerbin is not a flat world, your locked-in angle will slowly rise, pulling you up into thinner air, so you\u0027ll have to re-set your SAS every once and a while. You want a horizontal speed of AT LEAST 1550m/s before going rocket-mode on your raipiers- the faster you go on jets, the more fuel youll have left in space. Dont turn on the rockets if you\u0027re falling (again, check the guage next to your altitude), instead, nose up 45 degrees (and turn OFF the raipier rockets with 1 if they switch automaticaly) until your flying level, THEN turn on the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the rockets are on, you want the most lift for the least drag. Really, you want that most of the time, but it\u0027s most important for rocket mode because the rockets use so much fuel. Find the \u0022L/D\u0022 number in the Flight Data window. The number will jump around as you nose up and down, but try and find a high number and lock it in. Then bounce out to the map screen to find your apoapse. (or if you use mechjeb or Kerbal Engineer, you can open an Orbit Info window in the flight screen) it\u0027ll take a minute or so, but once your apoapse reaches 70, press 2 to shut the rockets down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe apoapse should still be climbing slightly, because the turbojets are still going- choking and shuddering, perhaps, but still giving a little bit more power. When they finally give it up, press 3 to shut down, point your nose directly prograde, and coast up to orbit. While you wait, plan your circularization burn in Map mode. Remember to cut your throttle (with the X button or with Ctrl) before pressing 2 to bring your rockets back online if you dont want to go flying right then and there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, it\u0027s simple rocket science. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-02T09:39:29Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2014 09:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rakaydos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T17:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should try to make screenshots with F1 so we don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t see your desktop \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T18:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can never find the folder it puts them in. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone want to tell me what I screwed up on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T08:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s not there create a new folder called \u0027Screenshots\u0027 but without the apostrophes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T10:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere I was hoping someone was commenting on my jet, not my computer. :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LvL","CreatedById":109145,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T10:52:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a wonderful SSTO, but I was wondering, why are there swept wings at the back?
