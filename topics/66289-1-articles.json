This teacher uses a system that is basically a large cloth suspended with clamps to represent space-time, and various weights, marbles, and other spheres to represent other masses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the objects weigh down the thread, they have a simulated gravitational effect on each other. This guy even demonstrates free return trajectories, why everything goes clockwise, and he even creates a planetoid-satellite system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease enjoy, it\u0027s pretty dang awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTY1Kje0yLg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T21:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always wanted to perform that experiment\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T15:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the guy said the setup costs $100.
