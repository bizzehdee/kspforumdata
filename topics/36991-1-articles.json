All the fancy gravity assists in the world are useless if they exceed this number. To get a net savings out of the maneuver your free deltaV must make up for the deltaV missed out by not burning in LKO. The baffling thing about the calculations is how the gravity assist factors into the entire mission plan. For example the max gravity assist comes from a pitiful entry into the Mun\u0027s SOI so while you get all of it, you don\u0027t come out with much more than that. Do you GA to eject in a nice Hohmann trajectory or do you get more dV out of the GA and let the trajectory hit the target at a sharp angle.

Some 800m/s if i am not mistaken.

If you can set up a Kethane refinery on Mun and just refill your interplanetary ship with it whilst transportig Kerbals fron Kerbin using some sort of shuttle craft I can see this actually being a cool strategy.
