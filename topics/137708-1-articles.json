With 2 parachutes and minimum weight, I only can slow down to 8 m/s when I need 7 m/s. I can save the engine by turn it on but then the test dont count. What im asking is those components thats expect to touch land/water in a landing have atleast 9m/s crash tolerance for exemple. I just stoped playing kerbal when 1.1 patch was announced and comeback in the release but I remmeber I didnt have this kind of problems before.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr style=\u0022color:rgb(219,219,219);font-family:Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:20px;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(33,47,67);\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(219,219,219);font-family:Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:20px;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(33,47,67);\u0022\u003EAnd this is just my case, I see ppl that have this kind of problem even with landing gears, thats insane.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Servo","CreatedById":149419,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T12:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry landing the engine upside down (with a probe core or something down). Just make sure your parachutes are above the center of mass. That way, the larger crash tolerance will hit the water first.

With something like this not only higher crash tolerance would make sense, but also there could be some area for implementing KIS/KAS-like EVA repeairing mechanics. Tank patching, for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd stock procedural tanks. The only reason I\u0027m against stock procedural parts is because of the low crash tolerance of them. If a very long tank (that is one part)\u00A0hits the ground too hard it just dissapears with a relatively small explosion in the middle. Instead it could bend, hit the ground and start releasing the fuel from the holes, simply explode (and leave a scorched piece of mantled metal), or catch fire and slowly burn until it runs out of fuel (though I\u0027m not sure what are the chances of such occurence since it would rather go kaboom instead of slowly burning IRL)..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T20:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222530466\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137708\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461326315\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162490\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Avicena\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2016-04-22 at 7:58 AM, Avicena said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I can save the engine by turn it on but then the test dont count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can run the part test by re-staging the engine.\u00A0 Add a new stage above the current one, move the engine to it, and press your stage button (default is spacebar).\u00A0 That will complete the test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso you could add more chutes for slower landing speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FungusForge","CreatedById":148313,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T21:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t ever really do these contracts until I have some form of wheels.
