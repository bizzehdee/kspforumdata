One of the most important things in engineering is knowing when something isn\u0027t worth sinking more effort into. The ISS would cost more for worse results compared to building Mars transfer equipment from scratch.\n\nTo answer your acceleration question: Acceleration is absolutely relevant; it controls what kinds of maneuvers you can pull off. The ISS can\u0027t take much acceleration; if you can\u0027t do much acceleration, you can\u0027t pull off the trajectory used on most Mars trips. This is particularly a problem on ejection and capture burns. The ISS can\u0027t aerocapture and can\u0027t pull off a Hohmann capture burn, so it has to follow a different trajectory than other Mars missions (the way Dawn did capture was to approach at low relative velocity, which required a different trajectory than you\u0027re used to seeing). In contrast, something that could pull off aerocapture would have a huge dV savings.\n\nThis is, of course, leaving aside that the ISS isn\u0027t designed to operate without resupply; it\u0027s getting fairly old, which you don\u0027t really want on your interplanetary spacecraft; it\u0027s not designed or allowed to operate without the ability to rapidly evacuate all crew to safety (and while they haven\u0027t had to do that yet, they have had emergencies that required preparing for an evacuation if needed); it\u0027s a highly specialized orbital lab with the ability to receive new experiments from resupply ships, and is designed with the assumption that it\u0027ll be doing that (swapping experiments in and out, rather than having just long-term experiments), which is not what you want or need in a one-shot Mars trip; and it\u0027s currently performing lots of good science in Earth orbit, which we\u0027d lose if we sent it off to Mars.\n\nI really can\u0027t think of any reason why it *would* be a good idea to take a highly specialized (and aging) LEO laboratory and send it off as a transfer vessel for a Mars mission, which has different requirements. The ISS was designed for a job. It does that job fairly well. Said job is more valuable than anything it could do in Mars orbit (because there\u0027s not all that much difference between LEO and LMO, and scanning-type experiments can be done at least as well with a probe, but in LEO it\u0027s way more accessible). There\u0027s no such thing as a \u0022little rearranging and adding some fuel\u0022 in real life; real rockets aren\u0027t Legos. A Mars transfer ship should be built as a Mars transfer ship, not retrofitted at great expense from something doing a useful job."},{"CreatedByName":"deathbane","CreatedById":64268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T02:09:13Z","Content":"so in the year 2020 when the iss is decommissioned then what through it away... im just saying some of the Components can be reused, evary thing reused is one less thing needing to brought into orbit\n\n and as for the engines we have nuclear(politics aside) and ion or some sort of electrical based propultion, i mean the solar panels on the iss right now produce around 6 to 8 kilowatts"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T02:16:37Z","Content":"? mechanique stress and wear and other assessment of default risk even the slightest ... yes there is the road to do, whatever ... \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BF\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-30T02:16:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2015 02:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0027\u0027**\n  \nyes it\u0027s a lazy and crappy google translation ..."},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T02:26:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E so in the year 2020 when the iss is decommissioned then what through it away... im just saying some of the Components can be reused, evary thing reused is one less thing needing to brought into orbit\n\u003E  and as for the engines we have nuclear(politics aside) and ion or some sort of electrical based propultion, i mean the solar panels on the iss right now produce around 6 to 8 kilowatts\n\nYep.

Here\u0027s what the ISS would need to be capable of going to Mars.\n\n1. A propulsion system capable of moving it out to Mars. This on its own is \u003E50% of the mass that would need to be put into orbit for a new ship.\n\n2. A habitation module with radiation shielding capable of working all the way out to Mars.\n\n3. A life support system that isn\u0027t ancient.\n\n4. Control computers with the radiation tolerance to operate for months outside Earth\u0027s magnetosphere.\n\n5. A power supply: solar panels wear out, and the ISS panels are already pretty old. Plus, out at Mars there\u0027s only half as much sunlight. Besides, the interplanetary propulsion system will likely have a nuclear reactor onboard, either as part of an NTR or to power a VASIMIR engine.\n\n6. A structure designed to survive an interplanetary transfer burn.\n\n7. A laboratory module. The ISS has lab modules, but they aren\u0027t necessarily set up for the kind of stuff a Mars mission would need, like analysis of Martian rock samples, or biological experiments in Martian gravity. In any case, a lab module you can\u0027t land on the surface is dead weight for almost all of the mission.\n\n8. Any hardware that lands on Mars, including a habitation module, any laboratory facility, a mars rover, an ascent stage, any hardware needed for ISRU, and all the heat shielding, parachutes, and landing systems needed to get all that to the Martian surface. This is also a lot of the mass and cost.\n\n9. New docking hardware to work with the Orion capsule and lander, which will both use the new NASA Docking System. The old docking ports are pretty much useless.\n\nHere\u0027s what the ISS has that could be reused:\n\n1. Maybe one or two of the node modules to carry supplies in. All the Russian stuff is either old or being used in OPSEK, the laboratory modules are dead weight as are the cupola, robotic arms, Quest Joint Airlock, and the truss structure.\n\nAlso, spacecraft are generally built in factories with lots of very expensive, very heavy equipment. To do major modifications to ISS modules, you would have to either design and launch miniaturized versions of that equipment (astronomically expensive), or deorbit and re-launch the modules (pointless, since the only thing you were saving was fuel to launch replacements into orbit)."},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T04:57:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E safety is in the design the better the design/retrofit the safer it is, and whats cheaper then already having the parts in orbit all that need to be done is send a metaphorical tool box\n\u003E \u002Bhaving the Canadian robot arm would help a lot too\n\nYou\u0027re underestimating the cost and difficulty of converting an ISS module for a Mars mission. Like, by *several* orders of magnitude, based on the \u0022tool box\u0022 comment. I\u0027m not sure where you get $50b from or why it has any relevance to this discussion: most of the ISS simply could not be used, the parts that could would need modification to support it (because the mission they\u0027re designed for is not the mission of a Mars transfer stage), and unless you can extensively inspect the modules (which is rather difficult in space) you will still have serious trouble meeting safety requirements.\n\nWhat\u0027s cheaper than using the things already in orbit? Having the parts down on Earth where assembling stuff is relatively easy, and where the parts are actually designed for the job.\n\nYou don\u0027t seem to understand this: *The ISS is not capable of independent operation.* It *needs* resupply. It *needs* evacuation procedures. Much of it has spent over 10 years in orbit; parts of it are approaching 20 years. Its component pieces are not designed for, and are not capable of, the reliability needed on a Mars mission. They never needed to be, because there was always an abort option. They routinely require spare parts to be sent up, because the entire station was designed for a mission in LEO where resupply is possible. Its component parts might be considered reliable enough to continue operating in LEO past the design date. Operation in LEO is easy -- there is an easy abort option. A Mars mission cannot rely on that, nor can it rely on the ability to send up replacement parts.\n\nSpace hardware is expensive. Part of the reason is that it has to be designed within very tight parameters, and is highly specialized. The ISS is specialized to be a LEO laboratory. Its modules are designed to support a crew and science in LEO. Trying to turn them into something suitable for a Mars transfer, while they\u0027re in space? That\u0027s the sort of thing that, while it might initially sound frugal, ends up being a massive budget-sink."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T06:41:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yep.

This takes a lot of planning and prep work, so you want a good deal of advance warning (hence the extension to 2024 coming 5 years before it was planned to end in 2020). It might get extended more as budget permits and NASA and Roscosmos feel like continuing it, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s likely to get extended much beyond -- maintenance and operations are a big chunk of the cost, and a new station allows starting over with lessons learned from ISS (like ISS started over from Mir)."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T07:41:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E so your saying engineering,retofiting and building a ship to be built in mind of useing iss parts would cost more then 50 billion (half the cost of the iss because i dont see using every single piece use in the construction) over building a brand new ship from scratch\n\nIt would be like converting a camper van into an airliner.
