So I set up a Mun lander that uses drop tanks (with the landing gear legs on the tanks). These tanks feed into a larger central tank, using the yellow fuel pipes. The central tank is the only one with an engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I have it set up correctly? Will it actually use all the fuel in the drop tanks first? If so, how do I know when the drop tanks are empty and ready to be discarded? It\u0027s easy when they have an engine on them, eg, onion/asparagus staging. When the engine shuts down, the tank is empty. But when the tanks don\u0027t have engines on them, the game doesn\u0027t give a fuel meter for them. Is there a way to do this without plugins, or a way to tell from the fuel meter for the single engine?
