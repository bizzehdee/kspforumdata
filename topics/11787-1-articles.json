However, I think we should remain vigilant for vandals. As they were the cause of the official wiki being shut down.\n\nIn fact, maybe we could limit the people that are allowed to edit by making sure that their intentions are good. I really believe that all of the information that we could put on a wiki is very important for player use.\n\nTell me what you guys think."},{"CreatedByName":"The_Duck","CreatedById":1156,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T02:12:24Z","Content":"In fact there is already an unofficial wiki, run by N3X15: [http://kspwiki.nexisonline.net/wiki/](http://kspwiki.nexisonline.net/wiki/)"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T02:25:47Z","Content":"Sweet!
