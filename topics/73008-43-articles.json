Around a 45 degree climb is probably most fuel efficient, but jet engines use so little fuel that it doesn\u0027t matter much. If the plane has enough power, I usually climb at 75 degrees or so just to get it done quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When you get to 20,000m, level off and build some speed. You want to pile on as much horizontal velocity as possible while you make a slow ascent to 30,000m. Keep your angle of attack (the angle between where your nose is pointing and the direction in which the plane is actually moving, shown by the prograde marker when in surface mode) and climb rate low; by the time you hit 30,000m, they should both be around 10 or so. A low angle of attack reduces drag and helps your intakes work better. The low angle makes you climb slower, but that\u0027s okay; you need that time to get up to speed. As you go faster, the angle of attack required to maintain a given climb rate reduces, but as you go higher, the thinner air means that the angle of attack required to maintain a given climb rate increases. If you do it right, these two factors will roughly balance each other out and you should gain the necessary speed and altitude in a single smooth climb. However, a plane with some aerodynamic or piloting flaws may need to bounce up and down between 20,000 and 30,000m a couple of times while building speed before the final push.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Somewhere between 20,000m and 35,000m (exactly when depends on both plane and piloting), you\u0027ll start to run short of air. Don\u0027t switch to rockets immediately. If you\u0027ve got multiple engines going, shut some down to concentrate the available oxygen into the ones you keep running. If you\u0027ve already shut down as many as you can, throttle back a bit. You can dramatically increase your jet-only altitude by doing this, and once you get up to serious height the thin atmosphere means that you only need a tiny amount of thrust to accelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Keep this going for as long as your plane and your patience can tolerate. A well-built and -flown plane should be able to get over Mach 4.5 and 30,000m in a single attempt on jets alone. Once you\u0027ve wrung as much speed and altitude out of the jets as possible (you want at least Mach 4 and 30,000m), force the nose up to 45 degrees and light the rockets. If you have both jets and rockets, don\u0027t shut down the jets immediately; the thrust of the rockets will drive a ram-air effect that kicks the jets back into life for a while. Keep the rockets burning until your apoapsis exceeds 70,000m, then shut off and coast until it\u0027s time to circularise. Point prograde and close your intakes while coasting to minimise drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good plane and pilot should be able to get the apoapsis to 70,000m with less than a minute of rocket power. Done properly, it requires very little fuel. But if you try to brute-force it from lower speeds and altitudes, the atmospheric drag is going to drain your oxidiser tanks before you get anywhere near orbit. You don\u0027t need part-clipping and you don\u0027t need air-hogging; these are just ways of compensating for poor piloting and design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re having trouble with design rather than piloting, give \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90747-Kerbodyne-SSTO-Division-Omnibus-Thread?p=1357777\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1357777\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90747-Kerbodyne-SSTO-Division-Omnibus-Thread?p=1357777\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1357777\u003C/a\u003E a try.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DracovaXIV","CreatedById":97121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T06:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tg626\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tg626\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you guys get these things into orbit!?!?!

Now I\u0027m playing with Real Solar System since the stock game is a joke - you can put a brick into space with a fuel tank and engine strapped to it, as one esteemed person put it eloquently on these forums. :3 If you aren\u0027t playing with essential mods like FAR, DRE, and so on - it\u0027s just ridiculous. You can safely land on Kerbin without parachutes on a command seat strapped to a tank, engine, and some optional legs. But I digress!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three main reasons why spaceplanes don\u0027t work for people, in the following (descending order):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Wrong engine,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Too heavy,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Poor airframe design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re playing with FAR/NEAR, \u0022poor airframe design\u0022 is probably the number one reason. I think those mods should be made official and put into the game by default, personally... Also, no, no clipping fuel tanks at all! Less is more! I had a really beautiful spaceplane once built with B9 and Taverio\u0027s parts, it had three fuel-containing parts: two long Mk2/Mk1 adapters, and one short Mk2 LFO tank. The thing had four surfaces (looked almost exactly like a Predator drone) and one engine - a small SABRE. I could get the thing into orbit in probably less than two minutes with about four-point-something km of deltaV left over.

That lander has something like 5.6km of dV. Once, a bug caused my orbital module to blow up, so I had a kerbal stuck on that lander with some fuel remaining in Munar orbit. I flew the thing back to Kerbin, used aerobraking over the course of several orbits, then let the thing fall through the atmosphere, and used the remnants of my fuel to do a soft splashdown landing. The craft survived, and so did the kerbal. Try it for yourself if you like. It \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E pretty fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, before KSP, I used to play Orbiter. I really got into KSP because it was possible to build modular spacecraft, something that Orbiter dearly lacked. I know it\u0027s possible to have a lot of fun with the stock game, and I did have a lot of fun with it - at first. But beyond a certain point, playing in a proverbial sandbox - building ridiculous contraptions (like so many KSP channels on Youtube exhibit), launching kerbals off of decoupler cannons into Duna, and flying to Jool on one Jumbo-64 tank of fuel becomes tiresome, not fun. If there was a hard-realism alternative to KSP with the same modular spacecraft construction features, I would most likely play that. But so far that hasn\u0027t been the case. That said, I do apologize for sounding so snide.
