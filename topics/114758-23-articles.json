Even the smallest TAC oxygen container (the smallest hex-can) provides 24 days of oxygen. Have you tweaked them to be smaller?\n\nSecond: This is really long list of installed mods.

Certain build configurations with stock struts (okto, girders, etc) are prone to overheating.\n\nThe issue is indeed linked to conduction and and the actual cause is probably math float errors. What happens is that that as heat is conducted between parts, the errors build up with temperature rising in the low mass parts as the heat oscillates back and forth.\n\nMasses of 1kg or less are at risk.\n\nInstallations with Deadly Reentry should be mostly immune because the conduction factor is lowered to 3.3 (from a stock value of 20), so anyone having problems with overheating should lower conduction."},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T15:58:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cool ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E @sashan: \n\u003E \n\u003E First of all, i have tried different docking combinations and could not cause the parts to overheat unfortunately.\n\u003E \n\u003E But i had some other findings, that might cause the problem for you:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.
