I have checked my translation key setup and it is correctly setup to IJKL HN keys, but none of them seem to work. My ASDW Shift/Cntl keys work the RCS side work OK, but I can never slow down when I get close. I have the 4-thruster RCS on my ship, but I was wondering if I need to install something else for my IJKL HN keys to work the translation side of my docking maneuver? (note: I am staying in Staging mode to try and perform my dock) I just keep on flying by my \u0022space station\u0022. There is probably already a thread discussion this, but I cannot find it.

By chance do you have your caps lock turned on? If so it will use mono prop but the effect you are looking for will not be present and everything will be slower, fine control makes RCS go even slower than normal. It is just a thought just by the looks of what is here, maybe the picture will reveal more though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BatmanNC","CreatedById":134548,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T04:16:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to everyone.
