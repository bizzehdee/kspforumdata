Imagine stretching it in length, and it\u0027ll point into the wind like a weather vane, with the stability you\u0027re looking for. Moving your front wheels back a bit toward the center of mass will help with the ground handling, but as narrowly-spaced as they are, and with the way KSP deals with wheel colliders not at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angles to the ground, it\u0027ll always be a bit tricky to handle.

Not sure if ailerons above CoM will make that worse, or counter it, but you usually add some rudder in the direction you want to roll anyway.\n\nIf you want to avoid that, you either need to set the rudder to negative roll deflection (or mount below CoM and positive roll direction), or put the ailerons on some dihedral part of the wing.\n\nEDIT2:\n\nUploaded another replica.

Didin\u0027t think of that!\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: Also about the engine angle: I do that too, but might think about increasing it a few more degrees.\n\nBrake rudders work just like a normal rudder in practice. I messed around with a little craft for a bit, you \\*need\\* a little dihedral - my test craft went from terminal sideslipping to fully usable with just a couple of degrees.\n\n[![21633906472_865491df75_c.jpg](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5782/21633906472_865491df75_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/yXHqFs)\n\nPressure-forward on that and still directionally fairly stable, haven\u0027t tried it supersonic yet though.\n\nEdit: seems ok at lower levels supersonic - I\u0027m not sure yaw spoilers are a good idea for a large spaceplane though, you really don\u0027t want to be using spoilers for anything on the way up.\n\nEdit2: here\u0027s a bigger one. Need fairly large yaw spoilers and also some sort of PID yaw controller.\n\n[![21458584218_d38fdbf467_c.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/738/21458584218_d38fdbf467_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/yGdRtY)\n\nDisabled the cockpit reaction wheel and the engine gimballing, it\u0027s pretty stable at low levels - higher levels I need to do some pid tuning to manage.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-23T08:07:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2015 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T02:19:50Z","Content":"Anyone interested in a couple of FAR \u002B Advanced Jet Engines \u002B Real Fuels designs?"},{"CreatedByName":"m4ti140","CreatedById":67296,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T00:57:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E EDIT2:\n\u003E \n\u003E Uploaded another replica.
