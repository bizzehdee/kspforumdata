The best use would be to strap a few rocket pods under it, and deploy it from a ship, as it needs no lift to take-off. Or fly. Or land. \n\nIt basically is a jet-powered brick, try to fly it yourself, dl link is in opening post."},{"CreatedByName":"Boogaman","CreatedById":6306,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-22T21:52:16Z","Content":"Very cool!
