In the past, KSP recognized the separate stick and throttle as the same device, forcing users to have to go through remapping software, with various levels of success.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe X-55 has a lot of HAT switches and other obscure controls not found on typical joysticks, so support can be tricky. For instance, it would be interesting to program two hat switches or a hat switch and a rocker to use for Translational RCS control (6 discrete inputs).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJon\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YargJay9991","CreatedById":143494,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T23:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found this but it probs won\u0027t help much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/124970-105-saitek-rhino-x-55-hotas-stick-and-throttle-mixed-up/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsal_vager says something about unity5 possibly having better controller code so here\u0027s hoping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy Flying\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYargJay9991\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
