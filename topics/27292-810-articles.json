After getting much help from the forum, I have learned to make orbit with a spaceplane. So today I slapped together a new 20 part plane (includes RCS and solar part). Left the runway climbed to 7k and set to about a 10 degree climb. Switched to rockets at 26k (well over 1000 m/s). Plane got a little loose and pitched and rolled. Fought for control. My son walked in at this point and said the guy on the left (Bill) looked a little green. I assured him they are all green. He said, no that one looks like he is going to be sick. Kind of had to agree. Circularized.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsed mechjeb to mark KSP (because clouds and darkness - why did I think a nighttime landing was a good idea?). Aborted MJ now that I had a location. Set a node to reenter with landing marker at west coast of continent - another forum tip I learned. Began reentry. Switched engines back to airbreather mode. Set airbrakes. Nose up high and gentle rolling S curves until heat and speed were under control. As I went to fire up engines, I noticed I had miscalculated my fuel requirements. Engines belched their last just west of the mountains about 170km from the runway. Hit R and used RCS to hold the nose up as best as I could. Then shortly after I lost electrical power (batteries would have been nice). At 10k over the mountains the last of the mono was gone. I thought about hitting revert but I had to see how this ended. The plane would still swoop left and right but I was barely keeping the nose above prograde. Speed dropped to about 45m/s when the front wheel touched the grass 37km west of the runway. Set the brakes and held the steering straight while the plane bounced a few times before stopping. All involved breathed a sigh of relief. I love this game.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTomorrow I put some fuel in the empty wings and add the batteries I forgot. Jeb volunteered to fly.

With the reaction wheels going it was extremely stable all the way down the mission area at around 20m/s, save for the one time I fat-fingered my keyboard and caused a flip (which is why it only has one set of solar panels; it originally had another set mounted in back).
