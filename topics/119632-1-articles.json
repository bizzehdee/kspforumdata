I\u0027ve been playing KSP since .90 (Beta) but I\u0027ve only learnt how to actually play well when 1.0 was released. So here some questions I would like answered:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I\u0027m starting to get better at making and flying Space planes into LEO (I\u0027ve watched many YouTube videos and looked on the wiki), but I can\u0027t get the hang of making an SSTO. Are there threads that can teach me the basics of it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u0027ve pretty much know how to build and fly stable rockets, but how do I get my spacecraft to dock? I know I need docking ports and I\u0027ve tried the scenario, but I just can\u0027t seem to understand the fundamentals of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Is it worth using the ion-drive? It\u0027s very slow and conventional rockets would easily have better thrust than it. although it does have very good ISP (Specific Impulse) and I was thinking about using then to transport probes across the Kerbin System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Is it possible to build an Orbital kinetic strike vessel like one of these is vanilla KSP? I was thinking it would be really fun but I don\u0027t know how long this would take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/endwar/images/4/41/Rods_from_God.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100924143021\u0022 alt=\u0022latest?cb=20100924143021\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i318.photobucket.com/albums/mm410/Marshuno/WMD-2Satellite.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WMD-2Satellite.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

Usually this will be the smaller, more manoeuvrable one, especially when docking a node onto a space station. The other craft will be the \u003Cstrong\u003ETarget\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Make sure the target craft has a docking node in an appropriate alignment. If your target craft is an equatorial orbit, you can do this easily by pointing it (or the docking node at least) directly \u003Cstrong\u003Enorth,\u003C/strong\u003E using the nav-ball as a reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Manoeuvre the craft you are controlling near the target vessel (within, say, ten metres depending on vessel sizes) using RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Now align the controlled vessel to have a docking node pointing directly \u003Cstrong\u003Esouth\u003C/strong\u003E on the nav-ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Manoeuvre the craft to be directly over the target docking node using the Translate keys. You can use Docking Mode if you like, but \u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027ve started using the I, K, J, L, H and N keys (Translate keys)\u003C/strong\u003E as it still allows me to roll, pitch and yaw the craft if I need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. If you are having trouble lining the craft up by eye, make sure you have the target docking node (Yes, \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou can set a specific docking port on a vessel as a target \u003C/strong\u003Einstead of the whole ship!) as your \u0022Target\u0022 (double-click on it), and use the nav-ball as a reference. Then use the translate keys to move your spacecraft until the Target marker and Prograde marker are directly overlapping each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Once the prograde and target markers are on top of each other, simply use the H key to translate forwards a little! \u003Cstrong\u003EIf you\u0027ve lined it up right, your spacecraft should hit the target port straight-on\u003C/strong\u003E, and the magnets will take over. Even if you aren\u0027t lined up when your burn forwards, you can still use I, J, K and L to correct your position before you contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a really rough description of what I run through, and you shouldn\u0027t take anything I\u0027ve said here as unchangeable fact, but \u003Cstrong\u003EI hope it works as a good guideline\u003C/strong\u003E. As with a lot of things in KSP, \u003Cstrong\u003Eeveryone has a slightly different way of doing things\u003C/strong\u003E, and you should absolutely choose whatever way works best for you. If you find a mental checklist like this one works best, then by all means use it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Once again, \u003Cstrong\u003Eit also takes practise\u003C/strong\u003E, so don\u0027t worry if you don\u0027t get it right first, second, or even third time! At least with docking, \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou can always pull back and try again\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, yeah.
