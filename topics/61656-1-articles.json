I\u0027ve been browsing on and off for quite some time (since 0.19?) and have played KSP on and off since 0.18.

I\u0027m a real amateur when it comes to exploring space, though. I don\u0027t play for a long enough period of a time to complete an actual mission, but now that finals are out of the way and high school has long since ended, I decided to dust off my KSP Shortcut on the desktop and finally actually play it for once!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought I\u0027d finally make an account and start posting every so often. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a recent mission I made in career mode to collect some science in Mun orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/KHlxy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
