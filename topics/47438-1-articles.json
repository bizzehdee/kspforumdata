I like to make serial staged rockets and they are a nightmare to secure. These launch clamps stick out of the rocket with a fixed length so securing the upper stages is all, but impossible. What I have to do it use a decoupler and the long trusses to extend them out. And sepatrons to clear the debris away from the rocket. But its still a loose, wobbly connection and when launched these claps tend to kick my rockets rather violently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew launch clamps.. with modifiable extensions to get them the hell away from our rockets lol. But its not just that. I want to see more from these things. New models, new animations. These clamps should be large and bulky like the real ones and be fixed to the rocket so we don\u0027t have to use 30 of them. And on top of that have particle effects and a new sound. The condensation clouds from the LOX with hissing noises. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the sound is the next thing that needs tweaking.. god forbid you have more then five and you happened to have your volume bumped up...

More serious issues I have with the current system are the clamps triggering again when you get into loading range with e.g. a rover test. Also, when I quicksave on the launchpad and later quickload, the clamps are not attached anymore, resulting in the rocket crashing. Although that could be an issue with KW Rocketry tanks, as I only used those when I had this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Force21","CreatedById":14852,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T15:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can just put structural parts extending off the top of your rocket attached to launch clamps, and put a sepratron or two on the structural part, then when its time to launch, itll detach everything away and still keep your rocket stable on the pad. Theres no reason to only have the clamps hold your rocket. I often put struts connected from the top of the clamp to other parts of the rocket, and that works amazingly well. I also for the tall rockets, put long I beams on the top of the clamps that are attached to the bottom of the rocket, then extend them up to the top and connect them using more struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T17:20:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do the same thing as well Force, but I find its still a loose connection.

What happens when I build a rocket with sizeable side-boosters, or I build a Saturn-V sized rocket? Obviously a tower built for a Soyuz will not fit around a Saturn-V. The way it is now, with the pads, is really not a bad solution. I propose they you may instead be implementing the pads improperly, or that your rocket is not structurally sound. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, am I saying that this is a bad idea?
