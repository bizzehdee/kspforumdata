If so, it would seem like the trickiest part is the landing, the rest being a matter of thrust limiting in design. Without RCS....well, I still think its doable, albeit with more difficult aiming. I would also imagine you need liberal use of Separatrons to not splatter while landing, but the liftoff would be simple: an RT-10 strapped to your capsule gives you 3k or so dV, which is vastly more than needed to get off the Mun and plunge back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kujuman","CreatedById":28299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T03:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty doable.
