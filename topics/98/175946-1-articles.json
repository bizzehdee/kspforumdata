Launch\u003C/strong\u003E:\u00A0 First see comments in my previous post.\u00A0 One final technique not discussed above is to use the available fuel to ballast the statue a little differently (i.e. move more fuel toward the top of the statue).\u00A0 This may improve aerodynamic stability enough to make you happier,\u00A0although you\u0027ll have to manually move it back later if you want to burn it on the way to orbit.\u00A0 (FWIW I did not have to re-ballast any fuel to successfully make orbit.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2 - Duna booster attachments\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0- There is a large docking port under Jeb\u0027s, um, seat area that is reasonably well aligned with the statue\u0027s center of gravity.\u00A0 I suggest connecting your main interplanetary booster there.\u00A0 You will still need a lot of maneuver control (many \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E units and/or thrusters) to wrangle the statue around in flight and counteract the small misalignments between your center of thrust and center of mass.\u00A0 You can also ballast the statue by moving some extra fuel around the various extremity tanks (fingers etc) to try to get the center of mass better lined up with your thrust.\u00A0 This is especially true if you use the high-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E nuclear engines since they don\u0027t have much (any??) gimbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3 -
