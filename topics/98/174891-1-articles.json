Starts you with a launch pad on the surface to build for launch, then puts you on the ground to mine fuel in the second stage. Third setting puts you in orbit with added parts to descend safely and land. The final build will be to launch from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and fly your ship to Eve. In the final mission, you will receive free full serve fuel refueling at Minmus and Gilly with a self serve station in a lower orbit of Eve for a final top off before you land. That way you control how much fuel you bring on board for this maneuver. You will have requirements to plant a flag, do science, and bring tourists along. I built this as a tool for trying out different ideas quickly and easily and am happy to share it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
