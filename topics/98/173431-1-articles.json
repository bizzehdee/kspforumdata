Her mission has been classified Top Secret. Kerbodyne has designed a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E that will speed ore conversion by 300%; without an engineer. She is to travel to the low-g world of Gilly to test the new converter. The mission is straight-forward and confidence is high. Safety risks are minimal. Mission is considered to be routine.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stage is set.

Some of the functionality in the Mission Builder is not quite right yet, so I couldn\u0027t do everything I wanted; and had to find some workarounds for others. Overall, it turned out pretty well, I think. I used creator-built vessels to help expedite things. The mission is somewhat difficult in a couple of places, so I thought it would help speed things along if you didn\u0027t need to spend time in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E working on your design. Also, I thought it might be fun to fly somebody else\u0027s ship (something I\u0027ve yet to do; gonna start delving into other people\u0027s missions now that mine is complete). Anyway, I hope you guys dig it. Any questions or comments are welcome. And any feedback (either good or bad) would be appreciated. As I said, it\u0027s my first mission, so I\u0027m eager to improve however I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Cpt Kerbalcrunch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrUnderhill","CreatedById":154346,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-04T13:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just played your missions, and really enjoyed it.

I had hoped this would be a challenge that would be fun (but also challenging) for experienced and new players alike. The idea was to have a story, and to also get players to maybe do some things they hadn\u0027t tried before. I had a pretty good scoring system set up, but the current limits of the Mission Builder made it tough to do. I\u0027m hoping the next update will resolve some of these issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks again for participating, and congrats on your success.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
