We believe it\u0027s about time it had life too. You\u0027ve been tasked with the momentous mission to put 100 Kerbals on Laythe. \u0022The 100\u0022, as we have so named them, will all be specially trained colonists. They are not to become a part of any ship crew and to ensure this, we have designated them all tourists. There is a colony structure already in place. Just dock with it and load them in. You\u0027ll have 8 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the first episode in what will probably become several (not sure how many though). There is a main mission, and several side jobs that will be thrown at you for extra points, but not to interfere with the main mission. This mission features a few artistic structures, some of which you won\u2019t see until their respective events are triggered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to a bug where by you cannot set icons in mission vessels to anything but Rockets and Aircraft, it is advised once you get started you rename the Colony structures and any other ground bases when they appear to change the icon only, not the name. This will make it easier to review only your own vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve tried to work around all the known bugs with mission builder as best I can, but some required inserting little notes within the mission to remind you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iwg7XpY638dL1C1b_Bi3blRu13yXSSsY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1iwg7XpY638dL1C1b_Bi3blRu13yXSSsY\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is also my first Mission Pack assembly so to install it as a mission pack, just drop the zip file in your Missions folder. Don\u0027t unzip it.
