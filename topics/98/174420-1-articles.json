The Space Shuttle by NASA was good but only the shuttle was reusable and yet two of them unfortunately were destroyed out of the time they serviced. Elon Musk and his team aspire to land the main booster to prove everyone wrong and that private companies can be the leading role in space exploration, which as we know is the way forward at this time. Until NASA get their new SLS and Orion in working order (check out other mission for that) the main hope is SpaceX.
