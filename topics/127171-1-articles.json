Either way, thing is this: I have a vehicle with 4100 m/s of dV and enough TWR but cannot reach orbit. The reason for this appears to be drag related. However, I really dont\u0027 know why. I was under the impression, parts behind other parts would be occluded and therefore protected from the airstream (i.e. during reentry) and should also not produce drag. However, as you can see from my screenshots, there is apparently A LOT of drag being caused by tiny parts in the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anybody explain to me, why this drag is occuring? Is there any way to avoid generating drag by putting them behind other parts?

Actually most of the drag we mean when whe say \u0022drag\u0022 is actually caused by the low air pressure *behind* the vehicle.\u00A0Air moving over a surface causes skin drag.
