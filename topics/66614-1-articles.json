It\u0027s only a matter of time before to get anything truly useful done in space (such as setting up robotic ISRU infrastructure on the Moon and Mars), we\u0027re going to have to rely at least in part on orbital fuel depots to move our heavier payloads...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should be focusing more on technologies and design solutions for orbital fuel storage, ISRU, and propulsion technologies in the present- rather than sending robotic probes for Planetary Sciences.
