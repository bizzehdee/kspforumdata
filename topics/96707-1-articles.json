However, the x86 (32 bit) build (the one that isn\u0027t marked as x64 this build is unstable or something like that) works fine on an x64 computer. All it means is that KSP is still limited to using 4gb of RAM. So I\u0027d download x86 if I were you. You are probably on version \u003Cstrong\u003E0\u003C/strong\u003E.22. The versioning didn\u0027t get reset, but it jumped from .25 to .90 to signify KSP entering beta. Add on installation is still the same.
