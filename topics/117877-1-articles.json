Then save, and copy the PART { } for the clamp-o-tron over from that craft to the one in orbit. (replacing the kerbitrail one). \n\nYou could also try the universal docking ports mod:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73005-1-0-x-Kip-Engineering-All-Ports-and-Hubs-fixed-and-updated-for-1-0-x!-(2nd-May-2015)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73005-1-0-x-Kip-Engineering-All-Ports-and-Hubs-fixed-and-updated-for-1-0-x!-%282nd-May-2015%29)\n\nWith this plugin:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79128](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79128)\n\nwhich should make all docking ports universal."},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T17:39:44Z","Content":"Just leaving a quick note so that y\u0027all know I\u0027ve moved this into the main Gameplay Questions forum.
