My Kerbin system refueling setup is a station in a 500 km \u0022gateteway\u0022 orbit around Kerbin and a big miner that goes to Minmus for refueling. The miner has the full mining suite (2 drills, one large convert-o-tron, and support equipment) , space for 18.000 units (180 tons) of ore, and enough thrust and fuel capacity to get into Mun orbit with a full load (not that I do it, but it could). So to get from Minmus to docking at the station it has to refine ore on the way, the end result is that it can deliver 10.000 units of ore to the station in one round trip. In other words: more than half of the fuel\u00A0 that was mined on Minmus gets \u0022wasted\u0022 on the trip to Kerbin orbit. That doesn\u0027t sound very efficient, but on the other hand for each round trip I get 100 tons of useful fuel on my station. Which means that I can fuel up several \u0022reasonably sized\u0022 interplanetary craft with one round trip of the miner. And when I fuel up something like a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/AHHans/Nauvoo-Asteroid-Station\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENauvoo class\u003C/a\u003E station then that is moved to Minmus orbit to be refueled there, allowing the full 18.000 units to be transferred each round trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there are several ways to tackle this issue.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-10T16:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nall those are just stilistic differences, i only realize one issue:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhy am i mining mun when i could be mining minmus? i\u0027d spend a fraction of the fuel to land and lift off...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnever thought much about it. i started building a ground station on mun to get science, and when i planned \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E coupling it with the science station seemed natural...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell, whatever. i can and will have multiple similar facilities around the system\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-10T17:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223800544\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194592\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591806894\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n43 minutes ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nall those are just stilistic differences,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYupp. That\u0027s one thing I like about KSP: there are many different ways to play it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-10T17:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223800544\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194592\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591806894\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhy am i mining mun when i could be mining minmus? ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnever thought much about it....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell, whatever.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike anyone else.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end is just stilistic differences as you said.
