I didn\u0027t see anything wrong with that. Until recently after I flew a mission to Duna. My fuel was low and my first launch window for Kerbin required a lot of deltaV so I waited years for a smaller burn only to discover that I had plenty of remaining fuel to make that first burn. In the end what would have been a 2.5 year mission ended up taking nearly 5 years all because of my faulty guessing. Feeling like a failure, I looked up how to calculate the deltav and then wrote a simple program in c\u002B\u002B that calculates how much deltaV a rockets current stage has.\n\nHere\u0027s the C\u002B\u002B code:\n\n#include \n\n#include \n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() \n\n{\n\n double totalMass, fuelMass, engineVelocity, deltaV, Isp;\n\n cout \u003C\u003C \u0022What is the total mass?\u0022 \u003C\u003C endl;\n\n cin \u003E\u003E totalMass;\n\n cout \u003C\u003C \u0022What is the fuel mass alone?\u0022 \u003C\u003C endl;\n\n cin \u003E\u003E fuelMass;\n\n cout \u003C\u003C \u0022What is the engines Isp?\u0022 \u003C\u003C endl;\n\n cin \u003E\u003E Isp;\n\n engineVelocity = 9.8 \\* Isp;\n\n deltaV = engineVelocity \\* log(totalMass / (totalMass - fuelMass));\n\n cout \u003C\u003C \u0022The DeltaV is \u0022 \u003C\u003C deltaV \u003C\u003C \u0022.\u0022 \u003C\u003C endl;\n\n cin.get();\n\n cin.get();\n\n}\n\nAfter building this and using this little calculator for a few missions, I now feel idiotic for not doing this before. Until now I never realized just how big of a handicap I had been playing with.\n\nSo in conclusion I now strongly believe that the deltav for rockets is the single most crucial peace of information missing from the stock game. In the least a level 5 pilot or engineer should be able to calculate the remaining deltav for the current rocket stage. Which could keep players like me all stock. And I have to ask if anyone else thinks Squad should add such a feature to the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T20:47:15Z","Content":"I do always calculate it myself, but I\u0027m starting to come round to the idea of having a delta-v calculator in stock, albeit at a high tech level or with an engineer at a high level. \n\nI actually found that learning about delta-v and how to calculate it was much more rewarding than just being given it, but now that I understand it, it seems more of a nuisance to work it out myself.\n\nIf it is available to a level 5 engineer then it requires a number of interplanetary missions to be carried out before it becomes available, so that would probably be the best option."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T20:52:16Z","Content":"Squad are adding this for 1.0 already ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T20:52:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And I have to ask if anyone else thinks Squad should add such a feature to the game.\n\nNot only should they, they ARE.

I can tell before even launching if my ship has a chance or not of reaching orbit.

I also like the early game lack of patched conics and think it is a similar issue with delta-v.
