They are unnecessary for your rescue mission and only add weight. The lander can comes with some monopro so it\u0027s there for small maneuvers if you need/want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Get rid of the MK1 pit and and replace it with the lightest probe core you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t forget to move the parachutes. If you have a flat probe core (other than the sputnik one), then you can also get away with the smaller stack mounted chute. It should be capable of supporting a return of a lander can and probe core at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Get rid of the Advanced SAS unit. You probably don\u0027t need one at all on this lander since the lander can and probe core will be enough torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Swap out the two Z400 batteries for 4x Z100s. It will be only half the power, but a whole lot lighter. 400 electricity should be enough for your rescue operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can consider cutting the number of lights from 4 to 2. 2 should still probide enough light and will drain the batteries slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Move the connection point of the landing legs up some. That\u0027ll help with the tipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll those things should really lighten the load. Plus if there is a mistake, you won\u0027t strand another Kerbal. Just make sure you kick out the crew member when you launch the rocket so there is rescue space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also agree with adding some drop tanks to the side. Don\u0027t forget to put some engines on them or run some fuel lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an advanced topic, it sounds like you are stopping all horizontal velocity before the vertical. This is certainly an easier technique to start with, but it can burn a lot of fuel on the Mun. You\u0027ll either need to pack on more dV for the lander, or try a more fuel efficient descent. If you can do most of the burn pointing at the retrograde marker, that tends to be a bit better. It takes some practice chasing around the retrograde marker. You also don\u0027t want to slow down too much while still high above the surface or you\u0027ll burn extra fuel. The goal is to get the retrograde marker to the top of the navball right as you\u0027re approaching the surface. There\u0027s more to it than that, but hopefully that\u0027s enough to get you started practicing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus is an easier first target once you rescue the guys.

Self explanatory: you are in orbit and you burn retrograde, changing the orientation of your ship as the speed vector moves to compensate. It is not the more efficient way but it is the easiest one to learn, so I recommend you to try it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Suicidal burn. THis ones suposes you already killed most of your horizontal speed ( or had little to begin with , due to a colision course ), and it means that you mesh the button to start burning at the last possible moment in retrograde fashion. More efficient than 1), but really not recommended if you don\u0027t know well your ship abities/ don\u0027t have nerves of steel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Lowering the periapsis of your orbit \u002B horizontal burn. Assuming you\u0027re in a mostly circular orbit, you burn at the exact oposite side of the planet you want to land and lower the periapsis of your orbit ( that will get into directly above the place you want to land due to the burn ) as low as you can/dare ( depends of the altitude of the place you want to land and the altitude of the planet in the orbit you are in ... be careful with tall mountains ). Then wait until you get to periapsis and burn horizontally as fast as possible until you killed all the horizontal speed. You might need some extra burning at retrograde to make corrections, but in theory ( periapsis at 0 m and a perfectly flat planet ) you can simply do the above and turn the ship upside up ( since you do not have vertical speed at periapsis ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the method that is the most efficient ( burns at high speed are more efficient ( Oberth effect ) ) and, while also nerve wracking, it is far saner than 2) .

Self explanatory: you are in orbit and you burn retrograde, changing the orientation of your ship as the speed vector moves to compensate. It is not the more efficient way but it is the easiest one to learn, so I recommend you to try it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Suicidal burn. THis ones suposes you already killed most of your horizontal speed ( or had little to begin with , due to a colision course ), and it means that you mesh the button to start burning at the last possible moment in retrograde fashion. More efficient than 1), but really not recommended if you don\u0027t know well your ship abities/ don\u0027t have nerves of steel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Lowering the periapsis of your orbit \u002B horizontal burn. Assuming you\u0027re in a mostly circular orbit, you burn at the exact oposite side of the planet you want to land and lower the periapsis of your orbit ( that will get into directly above the place you want to land due to the burn ) as low as you can/dare ( depends of the altitude of the place you want to land and the altitude of the planet in the orbit you are in ... be careful with tall mountains ). Then wait until you get to periapsis and burn horizontally as fast as possible until you killed all the horizontal speed. You might need some extra burning at retrograde to make corrections, but in theory ( periapsis at 0 m and a perfectly flat planet ) you can simply do the above and turn the ship upside up ( since you do not have vertical speed at periapsis ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the method that is the most efficient ( burns at high speed are more efficient ( Oberth effect ) ) and, while also nerve wracking, it is far saner than 2) . But it requires some finesse pretty much no one has in the first attempts, so it is far better to start with 1 )\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will have to sort all those out. My kerblas are all stranded in craters with steep sides with inclines and slopes. The other thing I\u0027m dealing with is trying everything you\u0027ve mentioned plus trying to land in a relative close proximity under 1 to 3 KM away. My most recent rescue rocket landed safely, however it was 75.6KM away. There is no way that a Kerbal should be forced to walk that distance, LOL. That would take a years walking time with their little legs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T03:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry a suborbital hop ... it won\u0027t hurt anything since you\u0027re using probe-ships.

Start your braking burn half the time to the node of the length of the burn, then just bring it straight down (honestly, I\u0027d probably burn a bit earlier and a bit less, but more practice here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, your Kerbals have plenty of monoprop to get themselves out of craters, so don\u0027t worry too much about being spot-on, just fairly close.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T03:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LoganMalone\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LoganMalone\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBy the way, what is the learning curve time in this game anyway?

That probably explains your 75 km in diference . The issue is that it is hard to judge how much earlier you need to burn without having some experience in descents ... and that is why people with some experience ( like Manley ) tend to prefer suicide burns or the lower periapsis \u002B horizontal burn technique, since those allow for far finer control of the landing place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to train the place where to land, you can do what I did back in the day: I chose myself a place where to land ( say, the twin craters ) and try to land there with the same ship until you made a bunch of sucessful landings.
