Since space flight is mostly waiting, something that is usually skipped with time acceleration, the only thing I can imagine would be real-time missions.

The watch may not be a good fit for \u0022normal\u0022 KSP playing, where we focus on the screen all the time (though it would still be awesome and that might be enough. Besides, it *is* possible to glance at the watch while playing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it could work very well for \u0022real-time\u0022 KSP, or for long burns, or perhaps some other ways of playing we may come up with.

This would spread out the game over a day (perhaps this might be a good way to force us to get off the computer and do some chores instead). How about it? I imagine we may then use Kerbal Alarm Clock to have the game pause before maneuver nodes (so it\u0027s OK if we can\u0027t come to the computer immediately), and we can use the watch to be able to know how long until we can return to the game.
