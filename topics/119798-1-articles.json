In my picture the craft near the VAB has the tracking radar, but no weapons of its own. The other three craft have the missiles and a data link part. That part lets them connect to the tracking radar and remotely target enemy craft. By doing this the opposing aircraft must destroy each launcher or run the gauntlet to destroy the radar station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T17:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh that is so cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
