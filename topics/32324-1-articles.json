I recently started giving them a label like Craft/Fun/Station/etc. for example \u0022Craft Explorer\u0022,\u0022Fun SRB Rodeo\u0022,\u0022Station Fuel Tank\u0022 but its not really a solution :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought that I cant be the only one having such a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how do you manage your craft files, do you use any mod (which i havent found after some googling and searching on the forums) or do you just dig through all of them to find the right ones??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scrogdog","CreatedById":66879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T18:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use Sub-Assembly Loader mod. With that, what I usually do is develop and save payloads and lifting packages separately. For example, I develop a one man capsule/CM package and save it normally. Then I create the lifting package and save that part only by dropping on to the mod icon. Now, to create a one man capsule mission, I load up the Capsule/CM as normal, and then grab the lifting package from sub-assembly loader.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, that lifting package can also be used for light satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOccasionally I might save lifter and payload together, depends on the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T18:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to main ship save area. hold \u0022Crtl \u002B a\u0022 then press Delete. But, in all seriousness. I try my best to name them for exactly what they do or are used for. Sadly we need a description area for our crafts. I like writing paragraphs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E One thing I can suggest is write / type their description on paper / notepad (or what ever word program you like to use) and then Give the craft a TLA with at least one full word on what it does. Example: Lander KMmM, could stand for Lander for Kerbin Mimmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it would require a bit more work. But, what else are you going to do to past the time while ones ships get in their burn zones. Also if you do try such. Get your TLA naming system down first and stick with it and dont change it. Hence the reason why I suggested on paper or print it out as it can be faster to look up then switching. As sometimes one can do sometimes do something foolish like over burn or forget to burn. On the plus side. One can then write / type out how successful or flawed the design was and what areas could need improvement or removal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JaySmoka","CreatedById":60988,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T18:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use pattern in their name to get them ordered and use sub-assembly for \u0022parts\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: L87-100 L stands for Lifter, 87 is the max payload then 100 is for orbit capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen i build rockets for specific version, the craft file will be the Vessel class, number of the revision and the destination. A-1 Mun will be the name of the first iteration of the A class and designed to get to Mun. If my mission is a success, I rename my vessels in order to be able to find them in tracking center. So quickly i can find which craft is designed for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if a model didnt change much but I changed some feature I add feature description abbrev. For example I have a Tug ship used to bring Fuel tank to my space station. Form my space satation I have to type of docking possible for fuel tank: normal docking port adn Sr docking port. So I have a fiel Tug-1 Fuel SRD (senior docking port) and Tug-1 Fuel D (normal docking port). If my station get A jr docking port for fuel I will name it Tug-1 Fuel JRD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust need to remember abrev \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bunzmaster","CreatedById":68129,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T03:44:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI give them names to help me remember. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Jet Plane is called the Arrow (being Cdn it\u0027s what comes to mind when I think of an awesome jet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun vehicles are \u0022Apollo\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinnimus vehicles are \u0022Minnie\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Vehicles to pickup stranded kerbals are Apollo Rescue, or Minnie Rescue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I also give them numbers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current Apollo lander is \u0022Apollo 2.5\u0022 The first number being how many Complete redesigns, and the second number is how many failures that resulted in a small change in the design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T04:46:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve taken to naming them \u002201 Skyscratcher\u0022 and \u002202 Munzor\u0022 and so on so my space program is in numerical order, each craft building off the last.
