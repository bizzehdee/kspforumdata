Don\u0027t look at me, I tried but it\u0027s way too confusing for my taste.\n\nAnd even though you should really go to the Scatterer thread for issues with Scatterer, yes, using a version that is *specifically designed* for 1.0.5 but using it on 1.0.4 *will* cause issues. In fact, I\u0027m surprised the mod is still partially functional when you use the 1.0.5 version in 1.0.4, it could have broken your KSP.\n\nSo, for the oceans, I\u0027m pretty sure you need to update your KSP to 1.0.5.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-20T14:19:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2015 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The White Guardian**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T15:53:33Z","Content":"I\u0027m loving the mod so far.
