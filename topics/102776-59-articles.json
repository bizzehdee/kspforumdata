In fact, I\u0027m surprised the mod is still partially functional when you use the 1.0.5 version in 1.0.4, it could have broken your KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for the oceans, I\u0027m pretty sure you need to update your KSP to 1.0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-20T14:19:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2015 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The White Guardian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T15:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m loving the mod so far. \u00A0One mod I haven\u0027t installed yet is Karbonite. \u00A0The OP says it\u0027s supported, but I see that Oronzo recently had some trouble finding Karbonite, and KillAshley is looking into it. \u00A0Should I go ahead and install Karbonite now or wait?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oronzo","CreatedById":153814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-21T19:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222308980\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022102776\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449298800\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022128696\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KillAshley\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/12/2015 at 8:00 AM, KillAshley said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks ill look into it as soon as i get some time off work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstall the mod Karbonite quietly.
