However, KSP2 requires RTX GPU which I don\u0027t currently have but I have been subscribing to Geforce Now. Geforce Now is a cloud gaming PC with RTX. It would be nice if I am able to play KSP2 on Geforce Now with my old GPU and also able to play it in my Mac too. Please opt-in KSP2 to Geforce Now so that low spec gamers and mac users also able to play the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"s_gamer101","CreatedById":205435,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-26T13:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224276840\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221682433433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022228831\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ChainofChaos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, ChainofChaos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso able to play it in my Mac too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMac support is planned as far as I know, but not in the near future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224276840\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221682433433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022228831\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ChainofChaos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, ChainofChaos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, KSP2 requires RTX GPU which I don\u0027t currently have\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe performance will almost certainly improve a lot. The performance of the current early acces version is really awful, and I say that as someone who runs the game on an expensive gaming PC and has built ships in KSP 1 that litteraly have \u003Cem\u003Ethousands\u003C/em\u003E of parts. Building ships like some of the bigger ones I\u0027ve built in KSP 1 is currently pretty much impossible in KSP 2 due to the bad performance, no matter what hardware is used. And the hardware requirements are indeed very high for many people. But I\u0027m pretty sure the devs are aware of that and will make it better, they want to sell the game to as much people as possible after all and not just to some people who borrowed a spare supercomputer from NASA.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo at some point, you will probably be able to run KSP 2 on your machine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
