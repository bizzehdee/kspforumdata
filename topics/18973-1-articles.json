I\u0027m certainly not trying to brag, but upon launching the game, I skipped the tutorials and created a basic single engine practice rocket. The Parrot MkI didn\u0027t launch, so I strapped on two SRB\u0027s, and got my first successful launch! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I took off the SRB\u0027s and put my Parrot MkI on top of a cluster of 5 liquid rockets, and thew in an ASAS, and on the next launch I got a 2million meter ballistic launch! Obviously I needed a little more horizontal velocity, so after 3 more test launches, guessing my manual trim on how much the space shuttle seemed to transition to horizontal during launch, I achieved a stable 200-400km orbit! And I still have enough gas for a deorbit burn, although my 3 kerbonauts are currently still orbiting for endurance testing, I think we\u0027ll leave them up until they tell us they\u0027re getting hungry :-) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted this was all with the demo, wanted to check that out, but now that I\u0027ve had my fun I\u0027m going to buy the full version when I get home.

Kerbin\u0027s gravity well is quite mild compared to Earth, and rocket Isp in 13.3 was quite forgiving, so making a simple two-stage orbiter is quite straightforward. You must keep present that the developers, presenting the demo of a severely incomplete game, wouldn\u0027t want it to be frustrating (it has to work as advertisement \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E The balance has already changed in .16 (.17 incoming \u003Cem\u003EReal Soon Now\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2\u003C/em\u003E) and will be trimmed again as we approach completion: docking will be a game changer, as will be \u0022space race mode\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll also notice that the balance of old KSP discourages many of the clever staging tricks you could be thinking about: it\u0027s two stages to orbit, three to the Moon and back. Personally, I managed a lunar landing on the first moon on my first try, back when it was made (0.12 if I\u0027m not mistaken) and I\u0027m not the best pilot around here... truth to be told, I had practised powered landing on Kerbin before, but I always failed, so I don\u0027t know how much good that actually did me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou won\u0027t get bored easily though, don\u0027t worry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I believe that each coming versions will become more challenging than the previous, through new objectives, new dynamics, et cetera, for quite a long time still.
