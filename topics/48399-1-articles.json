And I dislike using quicksaves, it\u0027s either a revert to launch, or - like now - there\u0027s a reason to send another craft to rescue a kerbal, Bill in this case\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T20:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, okay, understood.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually don\u0027t hesitate to use quicksaves for things I have no chance to eyeball or guess in advance. Landing on ground on Laythe is one of them; I\u0027d need to send 20 missions otherwise and that\u0027d stop being fun. Aerobraking is another, it\u0027d be 7/10 ships destroyed and 2/10 lost in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T20:09:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell my entire mission was a failure from the word go.. Took 9 launches to get the oversized lander into HKO, another 2 to get a refueling vessel up... But she didn\u0027t have enough delta-v to get into an orbit around Laythe, not without using the lander. Even with HyperEdit, I was unable to get into a good intercept until I\u0027d cheated in another 10k/s of Delta-V\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
