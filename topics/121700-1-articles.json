The only problem? They don\u0027t fit together: you can\u0027t stage your mission from an orbit that only makes sense if you have fuel depots, without having fuel depots. You can\u0027t use SEP with the premise that it will save mas due to efficiency, when it\u0027ll cost extra mass on account of the chemical kick stages, the requirement to leave from a high-energy lunar orbit, and using it for a truly minute portion of the mission. ISRU is there, but again, it\u0027s used in such a marginal fashion that it won\u0027t actually save anything, just increase the complexity of the mission. Orion, nobody knows clearly what it\u0027s there for, I guess only a clone of Apollo can move people to lunar orbit. What is clear is the completely artificial requirement to use a staging orbit only the SLS can reach with meaningful payload.

The flight rate SLS needs be a certain abount to even be remotely viable and potentially there are bulky heavy payloads like deep space habitats and ISS rivaling solar power trusses that need a rocket with SLS\u0027s proportions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince its not a flexible clusterable multicore like falcon, delta, or angara that can keep production up by flying lighter configurations for more common jobs it simply has to fly a lot, with the limited budget to actually make the payloads there no room for it to have competition, and it must work at capacity to justify itself(geez it\u0027s beginning to sound like STS 2.0 but without the .... scifi space plane am I right?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would anyone hatch a harebrained scheme like this to support the notion that they need a big rocket? While feeding the military industrial complex, and recreating apollo for votes are pretty natural answers let\u0027s try being marginally optimistic for a moment and entertain the thought that maybe there are bulky payloads that only a heavy lifter can support and that in order to have the rocket they need for those few payloads they need to hatch a scheme where it is needed for all the payloads. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially if there is even one needed architectural component that no other rocket can support then they would need to hatch a scheme like this to support the one rocket to do the job for that one component. Whether it\u0027s the best solution is certainly up to debate. A debate about how to best travel through space that has probably raged since just before apollo. I think in the end the SLS system like the saturn V and STS stand to accomplish great things no one else is going to bother to do. It may be a bloated mess but it\u0027s one of only a few rockets being made to actually push boundaries and thanks to its zombie like political momentum it may accomplish some of its ends before going down in history as yet another case of \u0022how not to build a sustainable rocket\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I\u0027m saying is I\u0027m not going to be too upset about it being a train wreck as long as it gets at least to phobos. politics is a harsher environment than space to the point that engineering to navigate the senate floor is more important than considerations for outer space if one is ultimately to get anywhere in the first place, and you gotta admit if there is one thing SLS is good at its politics. That being said I don\u0027t think there is much of a need to rush.

One is that the reason that high orbit was chosen is because departing from LEO using SEP means the crew spends too much time in the Van Allen belts. Two: This entire plan assumes the worst case scenario. NASA doesn\u0027t receive more funding, commercial parties are unable to contribute launches to lessen the pressure on SLS, ISRU doesn\u0027t become more capable/reliable, etc. Many things about this will change for the better between now and when the program begins to pick up speed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, as somebody has already said, there are payloads, including the humans, that make the trip on chemical stages under the present plans. Hypergolic stages, even. It is very telling in and of itself, that the low-efficiency propulsion option is actually just as efficient in launches, tell you how well leveraged SEP is in this plan. Also, consider that the payload of a SLS to distant retrograde orbit is very comparable to an EELV\u0027s payload to LEO, so this pieces are \u003Cem\u003Eactually sized for an EELV\u003C/em\u003E, mass-wise. I know, volume is another constraint... but hey, I can at least affirm without fear of being wrong that you could use less, more massive elements, if you staged in LEO. Or lift the present ones on the existing EELV fleet. And you know, spend the dV that the upper stage uses to launch the pieces to the moon (chemically, I must add) to have extra mass to give yourself dV to depart straight form LEO: good old Oberth will actually save some dV from the budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you will tell me how this fits in the present budget, when they are talking about two SLS launches a year or more, while building the surface elements at the same time.
