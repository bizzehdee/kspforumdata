And there\u0027s no guarantee that the devices which pop up around its release will be what I\u0027m looking for including price... I have to say I can\u0027t wait for that one, and if it\u0027s \u0022that\u0022 good then I\u0027ll trade up. Err, sell the one I end up getting and buy that one, maybe not in that order. As much as I like the idea of waiting for a better piece of hardware to come out, I\u0027ve been breaking myself of that habit because there\u0027s ALWAYS a better piece of hardware about to come out. Matter of fact, apparently me buying something is pretty much the best way to guarantee that the upgraded version comes out sooner. That and it takes a couple months to see what percentage of the units are defective in some stupid way (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pretty much just decided against the Asus tablet in the past several minutes. Apparently, about 35% of them or more have digitizer problems within a month or two that are related to a number of different problems (drivers, leaking displays, bad solder points, bad cables, etc) so it kind of makes the integrated pen pointless and I\u0027m a bad gambler. That\u0027s the only reason I gave it a second look, the Dell one just isn\u0027t integrated into the tablet body. Oh well, you win some and you lose some. Maybe one of those Broadwell tablets will have an integrated pen with a functional digitizer and I can grab one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-16T08:30:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2014 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T19:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Duke23\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Duke23\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIntegration?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the way tablet and main PC work together.
