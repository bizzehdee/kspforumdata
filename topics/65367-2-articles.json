The isp displayed is the overall stage isp at the start of the stage and not the effective isp over the whole life of the stage. So, if you have a stage consisting of a long running liquid engine with a good isp and some non-detachable solid boosters with a poor isp then the displayed isp will be that including the solid boosters and will be less than the effective isp as the solid boosters will not be running during most of the stage. This shouldn\u0027t really affect anyone as the deltaV calculations will be correct because the isp is recalculated for each phase of the simulation (a phase is as long as it takes to completely drain the quickest draining fuel source). The stage isp simply needs to be recalculated from the overall stage deltaV and the starting and ending masses but it\u0027s late and I need to get some sleep so I\u0027ll do it tomorrow...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-14T00:36:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2014 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crazor","CreatedById":75428,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T12:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to let you know that there are some old .dlls in the output folder in both of your branches over on github.

It then calculates the resource consumption rates using the isp and relevant values from above (in flight it uses requestedThrust and in all other cases it uses maxThrust and thrustPercentage and when landed it also uses the main throttle position).
