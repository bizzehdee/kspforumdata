After spending a bit of time getting a prototype working, I fitted one to my latest warship, the MCS-14 Materis, and fired on\u00A0one of my stations. There were a few problems.

I suspected this was because the way of the slug had been stacked together and offset into one length, looking fine on the outside but stretching and applying uneven force when fired. I\u2019m not sure if that was the problem, but using a 0.65m heatshield as a base for the gear pushers solved it. With this\u00A0fix in place, I fired it at my station again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnexpectedly, the heat shield plate increased the projectile speed by an order of magnitude, from about 720m/s to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E8.8km/s\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot459.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/320295022786510851/413692156461449227/screenshot459.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMutual destruction.

ship with less then 6 of those, some with as many as 20).\u00A0 Railguns are also a tad unaccurate (granted this isnt an issue as 90% of the time you fire at point blank), and have either low

fairly consistent with what they do vs other weapons.\u00A0 Second most effective weapon (in my opinion) is the ibeam, since its super small and lightweight, packs a punch, and can be comfortably brought on smaller vessels like starfighters and gives them just enough firepower to neuter or even kill a 100t cruiser if you fire accurately at the right locations.\u00A0 Maybee leg-guns will be a
