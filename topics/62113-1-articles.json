I am really frustrated right now because I was building a ship that should have took 5 minutes but it took more like 30 minutes because I kept accidentally moving my other fuel tanks and stuff, messing up all the struts. Eventually, I finished the ship but later realized that the other fuel tanks weren\u0027t aligned with my radial decoupler. Then I ended up watching my kerbals fall to the ground without a parachute while the rest of the ship was exploding and bombing the KSC. Anyway. please add this feature, it would help a lot :I\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T04:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ectrl-z (10 chars)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T04:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd Control\u002BY is redo, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T04:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, already exists.
