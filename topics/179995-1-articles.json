At your midcourse correction point, you can just look with your eyeballs at the trajectory past Duna (or wherever) and do the burns by hand. The required burns are tiny -- so throttle your engines all the way down to give yourself the required precision. Normal/antinormal first, to get your trajectory to pass over the equator (e.g. if your trajectory is too far north, then burn antinormal). Then prograde/retrograde to change the timing of your encounter, which is the easiest way to adjust the flyby \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E.
