I\u0027m always looking for ways to organize my weird collections of mod parts.\n\nI see you\u0027ve included kOS parts in the .cfg, even though there\u0027s no mention (that I can find) of support for the mod. They\u0027re kind of all over the tree since they use the stock tree nodes. I think the \u00224 Bit Computers\u0022 to \u0022SuperComputer AI\u0022 branch would be perfect for them. \n\nMy humble suggestion:\n\n4 Bit Computers:  \n\nkOSMachine1m        (CX-4181 Scriptable Control System, stock tree science cost 45)\n\n8 Bit Computers:  \n\nKR-2042                 (KR-2042 b Scriptable Control System, stock tree science cost 160)  \n\nkOSMachine0m        this is a legacy part, and cannot be added via the editor\n\n16 Bit Computers:  \n\nkOSMachineRad         (CompoMax Radial Tubeless, stock tree science cost 300)\n\nSuperComputer AI:      \n\nKAL9000             (KAL9000 Scriptable Control System, stock tree science cost 550)\n\nAnd \u0022Cherry Light\u0022 is just a silly rotating light which can, in my opinion, stay in the node it currently inhabits (Advanced Electrics).\n\nBy the way, why is \u0022LY-10 Small Landing Gear\u0022 in the unplaced-node, and not in e.g. \u0022Landing\u0022, which is an empty node with stock parts only?\n\nEDIT: Oops. Just noticed there is a pull request for kOS parts.
