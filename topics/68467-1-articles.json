Needless to say; that huge nostalgia wave came crashing and taking everything with it.\u003Cp\u003ESeriously; during 2004-2006, this game was my childhood. My parents bought the PC copy when we were downtown(I was 4 at that time), I proceeded to play the living **** out of that game, whether it was tearing through Calypso Coast in a blue Vauxhall VX220 or cruising around Alpine Trail in a Ferrari 550 Barchetta. It was just too much fun, and no way in Kerbin I\u0027d leave that game behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENowadays I don\u0027t have the PC disk as it got scratched to oblivion(R.I.P. disk, you\u0027ll not be forgotten), but after a LOT of trouble, I managed to find a copy for the PS2 version. It doesn\u0027t give the same nostalgia feeling as it\u0027s almost as a \u0027remake\u0027(though not like Hot Pursuit 2010), but since it offers the same soundtrack and a couple of more features like weather, time of day, and a whole new scenario - Desert, it cut it out for me for the time being. But, whenever I listen to the soundtrack, I can\u0027t help but feel the nostalgia that the PC version offered me, with the Championship and Hot Pursuit challenge trees, buying cars and tracks with NFS points instead of completing challenges of the trees, and the such, and then I can\u0027t help but wish I had the PC version again, while wondering if Multiplayer is still active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else here still has the game, or has nostalgia with it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T23:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what about this song from San Andreas?:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-BfLo00Dg8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy far my favorite song from that game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T00:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t played GTA San Andreas, so I can\u0027t really say I miss it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Need-Speed-Hot-Pursuit-2-PC/dp/B00006CRVH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eit\u0027s still on sale!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
