However, I noticed that the wobbling was at the top, where the only place possible to strut it was the fairing itself, which was impossible to attach struts to.\n\nIt was very burdenous that I have to rely on strutting in vain, and a big hunk of streamlining and aesthetics is wasted. Maybe there can be another setting in the VAB to \u0022open\u0022 and \u0022close\u0022 the fairing, so that you can attach things on it, yet still keep it simple to assemble.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"TronX33","CreatedById":109784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T22:35:38Z","Content":"Yes.

This would really be a tremendous help for launching larger payloads, especially ones that are built around a longer central spar."},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T10:59:34Z","Content":"It is possible to attach struts to a fairing using a little workaround.\n\n1. Attach some temporary part to your rocket, so it reaches up past the fairing base outside the fairing.\n2. Attach a strut from your payload to the temporary part, through the fairing.\n3. Strut will attach to the fairing instead of the temporary part.\n4. Remove temporary part."},{"CreatedByName":"Coyote27","CreatedById":141964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T11:02:09Z","Content":"Clever, thanks!\n\nIt\u0027d of course be better if a workaround is unnecessary, but still."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T13:20:13Z","Content":"Yup this has been asked a few times before.
