Was just starting to have a lot of fun with planes in 0.90.\n\nBut after noticing my flight would take me about 45m real time to complete, i just gave up after 15m. \n\nIs it still possible to use planes for missions like these halfway around the globe?\n\nI\u0027ll still build planes for fun, but functionality seems pretty much gone atm. The flying itself is no problem, love the new aerodynamics.\n\nThanks for reading."},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T11:13:14Z","Content":"Are you using physics warp?\n\nThat sped things up for me in 0.90.\n\nI haven\u0027t got that far yet in 1.0 though, so I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s still reliable."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T11:13:54Z","Content":"Yes, aircraft are most useful for part test contracts and short hops to nearby locations (at least early on).

It\u0027s easier to build a shuttle-type vehicle that can go orbital or suborbital to tackle those contracts further away, especially since the basic jet engine can\u0027t take you much higher than 13 km.\n\nOf course, planes don\u0027t have to be just planes. They can be spaceplanes or, as mentioned, spaceshuttles."},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T11:14:16Z","Content":"Yeah, I don\u0027t bother with those missions.
