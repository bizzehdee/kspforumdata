It\u0027s made of nine identical sections connected by angled docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a lot of lifting and docking, the whole thing came together, but by the time I was four or five sections in, physics was beating up my CPU pretty bad and now I\u0027m getting only a few FPS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that on some of the docking connections the relative roll between the connected ports wasn\u0027t perfect, and the whole thing looks a bit stomped on. With the performance I\u0027m getting I can\u0027t disconnect, fine tune roll and reconnect very easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way I can edit the quicksave file so that the relative roll between each of the paired docking ports is lined up perfectly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1N7Bsub.png\u0022 alt=\u00221N7Bsub.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/spxovCK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022spxovCK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BuriSalt","CreatedById":81964,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T17:02:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny save file master hackers want to take a shot at this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
