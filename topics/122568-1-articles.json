The resulting 3,151 page report was turned over to SatNet Aerospace to research and develop parts that could reduce crashes or make them more survivable. The first parts to come out of the project were Ram Air Turbines and the group was quickly dubbed \u201CThe RAT Pack\u0022.

I was partly inspired by a documentary on the \u0022Gimli Glider\u0022, a 767 that had to glide to a landing with nothing but batteries and a RAT to power critical systems. A couple of spaceplane landings where I had to constantly manage electric charge to maintain control and keep enough for the landing gave me some incentive to actually build it. The RATs are designed to provide emergency power and have peak power at or slightly above that of an RTG. Electric charge output is a function of both airspeed and atmospheric density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRAT-1 \u0022Pinwheel\u0022 Ram Air Turbine - As basic as they come, it provides little power and must be activated manually.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRAT-360 \u0022Cage Master\u0022 Ram Air Turbine - Generates more power and will automatically start up when electric charge is depleted.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRAT-720 \u0022Topper\u0022 Ram Air Turbine - A RAT built into a nosecone.

The power curves where inspired by real RATs, but have been heavily Kerbalized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Why doesn\u0027t my speed on the power curve match my vessel speed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: The RAT uses an effective speed calculation that takes into account orientation, parts blocking airflow, and pressure. It will only match up with vessel speed at sea level, going straight, and without anything in front of the part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Where can I use RATs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Anywhere with an atmosphere. Kerbin, Duna, Eve, Laythe are all good places to use them. Jool and Kerbol might work, but you\u0027ll probably be crushed or melted before you get any power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: What happens if I run out of power landing on the Mun with a RAT?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: You will probably hit the Mun and the RAT will be destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: What happens if I run out of power landing at the KSC with a RAT?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: If you have an auto-activating RAT it will deploy and start generating power. If it is a manual RAT, you can\u0027t activate it after losing power, so prepare for high speed lithobraking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Do RATs work inside fairings or cargo bays?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: No, they need to be in the air-stream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: How does orientation affect RATs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Yes, they produce the most power when pointed in the prograde direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Can I fly backwards using a thrust reverser?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Yes, though it is not recommended. Most planes and rockets are not aerodynamically stable in both directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: How much thrust will a thrust reverser reverse?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Short answer \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 you lose a lot of thrust, but it should be enough to stop quickly. Long Answer \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Each TR has a thrust modifier which defaults to 50% intended to account for thrust lost to exhaust escaping to the sides. Additionally the thrust direction is not directed in reverse, but in a 45 degree angle above and below the engine. The net thrust is in reverse, but there are significant losses from the thrust directed up and down that cancels out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Will a thrust reverser work in space?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: It will, though you are effectively reducing your engine efficiency, so you are better off re-orienting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Why doesn\u0027t my descent rate match my vertical speed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: They are similar but different values. Descent rate is probably better described as ground closure rate. It is how quickly you are approaching the ground. Vertical speed is how quickly you are changing altitude relative to a common reference radius (i.e. sea-level). If you are on level terrain they will be the same. If however the ground is rising relative to sea-level you will have a higher ground closure rate than vertical speed which is a really important distinction when deciding whether you will hit the ground at some point in the near future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: Will I always have time to pull up when TAWS issues a warning?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Not necessarily. The current values are very... \u0022Kerbal\u0022, they give you a chance at survival, but no guarantees. If you aren\u0027t trying to hit terrain it is usually enough warning to avoid the occasional near miss, but if you deliberately try to test the limits you will hit the ground at least some of the time. You can set your own values, but I found anything that would ensure survival was too conservative for the way I fly in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: I\u0027m referencing the stock textures.
