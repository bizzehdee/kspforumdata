On another occasion I sent 3 ships in a row to duna, taking advantage of the launch window, but as I switched between them to make minor course corrections, the last one always got hit by the Kraken, no matter which ship I chose after loading, it happened to different designs. This kind of Kraken only hit me in interplanetary space for some reason, I now always quicksave before going into the tracking station to command a ship en route.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T17:06:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to get this bug in 0.90 all the time, so far in 1.0.4 I haven\u0027t come across it but I have no idea what\u0027s changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that when returning to Kerbin from going to any other body If I didn\u0027t switch back to the KSC and then back to the craft it was almost guaranteed to happen in LKO or the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scene switch back to KSC seemed to fix things though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
