Some minor clipping on the rear landing gears was causing my plane to snap in half ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThat\u0027s the problem on not fully testing spacecraft before critical missions.\n\nOne thing I noticed on KSP is that it starts bugging after playing for a while. On another occasion I sent 3 ships in a row to duna, taking advantage of the launch window, but as I switched between them to make minor course corrections, the last one always got hit by the Kraken, no matter which ship I chose after loading, it happened to different designs. This kind of Kraken only hit me in interplanetary space for some reason, I now always quicksave before going into the tracking station to command a ship en route."},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T17:06:07Z","Content":"I used to get this bug in 0.90 all the time, so far in 1.0.4 I haven\u0027t come across it but I have no idea what\u0027s changed.\n\nI found that when returning to Kerbin from going to any other body If I didn\u0027t switch back to the KSC and then back to the craft it was almost guaranteed to happen in LKO or the atmosphere.\n\nThe scene switch back to KSC seemed to fix things though."}]}
