So? What is it? The Livestream Calendar allows any user to add a livestream to the list, which can then be seen by everyone on the forums. Not only by accessing the streaming calendar specifically, but also on the forum\u0027s front page! Whenever someone loads the forum\u0027s front page they\u0027ll see all livestreams that are due to start within 24 hours just below the active members list. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Nk6IpBV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Nk6IpBV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor people interested in streams\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can not only view the calendar, but also request reminders for upcoming streams. To do so, open up a stream and find the bottom right corner of the box where you\u0027ll find a button called \u0022Request reminder for this stream\u0022. Click it and you\u0027ll be taken to a menu where you can select how long in advance you\u0027d like to be reminded of the livestream. Reminder emails can be slightly early or late. For example, a reminder scheduled for one hour before the stream, will actually be sent between 1:15 and 45 minutes before the stream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor streamers\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo of course the most important thing to you is: how do I add my stream to the list? This is both easy and tricky at the same time, so pay attention. First, open up the calendar by clicking the link above or by selecting the \u0022Livestreams\u0022 tab on the main forum menu and selecting the calendar from there. On the top right there\u0027s a button labelled \u0022Add New Stream\u0022, click it. You should now be faced with the screen below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GLDrujv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GLDrujv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, add your stream\u0027s title. For example, I could add \u0022Kasper\u0027s Space Program\u0022, this is the name that will show up in the calendar and on the forum\u0027s main page and it\u0027s good to add your Twitch username in the title so that people can recognise you. Next we\u0027ll have to make a choice between a standard stream or a recurring stream. A standard stream is just what it says on the box: here you can add a one-time stream, specify when it happens and add your own flavor text. It\u0027s pretty straight forward and I don\u0027t expect any problems there. As you can see the picture above is showing the recurring stream. This needs some more explanation in order to get it to work right. A recurring stream is a stream that is set on a schedule, for example a stream that happens every day, every other Tuesday or every first of the month. So how do we set this up? First, we need to establish if we\u0027re going to stream every day (select Daily), a specific day of the week (select Weekly) a specific day of the month (selected monthly) or a specific day of the year (select yearly). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your streaming schedule has already started you can leave the start day set as is to today, if you\u0027re planning to start soon, set it to the first day you want to stream at. The end date is when you plan on ending your streaming schedule for KSP. Currently that date is set to 2014, but it\u0027s good to set it to next month, or perhaps the next two months, but be sure you\u0027ll keep streaming KSP for the period you select here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile adding a stream you\u0027ll be presented with an area where you can add some flavor text, exactly like a post. For the purpose of allowing you to embed your stream we\u0027ve added the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv width=\u0022100%%\u0022 style=\u0022border: none;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cobject type=\u0022application/x-shockwave-flash\u0022 height=\u0022378\u0022 width=\u0022620\u0022 id=\u0022live_embed_player_flash\u0022 data=\u0022https://www.twitch.tv/widgets/live_embed_player.swf?channel= bbcode.

Of course, it might just be the community here prefers that, but the amount of it seems odd to me.

This is purely meant as a way for community members to share what they do with KSP with other community members.
