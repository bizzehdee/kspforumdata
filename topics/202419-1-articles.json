The trick is not in the keyboard controls but in making a ship that still performs properly as the conditions change. It sounds like you\u0027re having the common problem of either not including enough control parts (like steerable fins) or not attaching them in the right places. Can you share pictures of your rocket? That often helps with diagnosing problems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JebIsBestPilot","CreatedById":207984,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-27T14:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoar boosters might help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all seriousness, your craft might not have the best aerodynamic profile. As someone who does rocketry IRL, you need to have relatively big fins.
