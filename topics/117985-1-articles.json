When I was approaching I let down my gear. Then they ripped off and the all the parts disconnected.![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif) Can someone help me with this? It\u0027s only on Mk 3 parts and the gear were the two biggest ones. It happened with my airliner too. I also have a problem with long planes that wiggle they selfs to death. I can\u0027t land anymore with a lot of MK 3 planes because of the first problem. f3 says structural linkage failure. Can anyone help me prevent it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T21:50:26Z","Content":"Could you post some pictures of your plane?

Ends up the gear was mounted on a cargo bay, and my guess is that it clipped through it when trying to deploy.
