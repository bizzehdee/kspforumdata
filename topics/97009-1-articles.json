The drag coefficient typically decreases as velocity increases for low-mid subsonic flight. Then, it increases and reaches a local maximum around Mach 1. Then, it decreases again and reaches its minimum value a little later and increases once again for very high Mach numbers. KSP makes no attempt to model this behavior. My best guess is that because of the very low mass of intakes, the devs had to do something to increase drag because intakes should produce significant drag, since they are large flat objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T01:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDrag is using a fairly standard equation, except that for the \u0022area\u0022 of the part, KSP uses the mass. Intakes have an explicit area. Munging the drag coefficient appears to be an attempt to use the explicit area, and to properly take into account the angle of attack. But after getting all of that right, it feels like the final piece was rushed through to get the weird setup we have now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
