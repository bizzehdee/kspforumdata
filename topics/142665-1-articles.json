So, applying the principle of uniformitarianism or it\u0027s modern descendants we can speculate about oxygen-rich palaeo-oceans on mars. The paper suggests that, if mars had oceans and the planet\u0027s magnetic field decayed, radiation could have split water into hydrogen and oxygen, the hydrogen dissipated into space, the oxygen was bound in oxides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069109/abstract\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069109/abstract\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMicrobes are not needed for the suggested process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-28T10:36:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2016 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Green Baron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u0026#039;s\u0026#039; mising ...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T15:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to my favourite book on this theme, the free oxygen wasn\u0027t required, too.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the volcanic gases (mostly H2O \u002B CO2) got cold and formed an Archaean ocean, this ocean contained high concentrations of H2CO3 (up to pH = 3..5).
